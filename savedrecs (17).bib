Abstract = {{Poor adherence to medication is a major public health challenge. Here,
   we aimed to determine the adherence to oral and topical medications and
   to analyze underlying associated factors using the translated Japanese
   version of Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 regarding urticaria
   treatment. Web-based questionnaires were performed for 3096 registered
   dermatological patients, along with a subanalysis of 751 registered
   urticaria patients in this study. The adherence to oral medication was
   significantly associated with the frequency of hospital visits.
   Variables that affected the adherence to topical medication included age
   and experience of drug effectiveness. The rate of responses that It felt
   like the symptoms had improved varied significantly among the
   dermatological diseases treated with oral medications. Dermatologists
   should be aware that adherence to the treatment of urticaria is quite
   low. Regular visits and active education for patients with urticaria are
   mandatory in order to achieve a good therapeutic outcome by increasing
   the adherence.}},

Title = {{Correlation between perceived stigma and EEG paroxysmal abnormality in

Abstract = {{Aims: We investigated the relationship between abnormal
   electroencephalogram (EEG) findings such as localized EEG paroxysmal
   abnormality (PA) and the perception of stigma to determine EEG factors
   associated with perceived stigma in childhood epilepsy.
   Methods: Participants comprised 40 patients (21 boys, 19 girls; mean
   age, 14.6 years) with epilepsy at enrollment. The criteria for inclusion
   were as follows: 1) age of 12-18 years, inclusive; 2) >= 6 months after
   epilepsy onset; 3) the ability to read and speak Japanese; and 4) the
   presence of EEG PA. Fifteen healthy seizure-free children were included
   as a control group. Participants were asked to rate how often they felt
   or acted in the ways described in the items of the Child Stigma Scale
   using a 5-point scale. Electroencephalogram paroxysms were classified
   based on the presence of spikes, sharp waves, or spike-wave complexes,
   whether focal or generalized.
   Results: Participants showed significantly higher stigma scores than
   healthy subjects (p < 0.01). A higher score reflects a greater
   perception of stigma. The average total scores of patients presenting
   with EEGPA at generalized, frontal, RD, midtemporal, and occipital
   regions were 2.3, 4.0, 2.4, 3.2, and 2.2, respectively. The scores of
   all questions were higher in the frontal group than those in other
   regions (p < 0.01). Children presenting with frontal EEG PA perceived a
   greater stigma than children presenting with nonfrontal EEG PA (p <
   0.01).
   Conclusion: A relationship was identified between frontal EEG PA and a
   greater perception of stigma. Further studies are needed to confirm
   whether frontal EEG PA may function as a mediator of emotional responses
   such as perceived stigma in childhood epilepsy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{We present a 2-D numerical model simulating cathodoluminescence (CL)
   measurements on CdTe. The model is used to analyze the impact of
   material parameters on the measured CL intensity to establish when
   grain-boundary (GB) recombination velocity S-GB can be determined
   accurately from CL contrast. In addition to GB recombination, grain size
   and its ratio to the carrier diffusion length can impact CL
   measurements. Holding the grain interior and GB recombination rates
   constant, we find that as the grain size increases and exceeds the
   diffusion length, the observed CL contrast increases. For
   small-grain-size material, surface recombination lowers the overall
   intensity of the CL signal but does not significantly impact CL
   contrast. For large grains, high-surface recombination velocity can
   decrease the CL contrast. The model is combined with experimental
   results to quantify the S-GB in polycrystalline CdTe before and after
   the CdCl2 treatment and to predict the impact of GB recombination on
   device performance.}},

Abstract = {{Adiabatic shear banding and cracking phenomena occurring during cold
   forging of plain carbon steel wire rods, whose carbon content was varied
   from 0.2 to 0.8 wt\%, were analyzed by forging simulation test using a
   split Hopkinson's pressure bar. The test results indicated that the 0.2C
   and 0.3C steels were dynamically compressed without surface defects
   after the fifth hit, whereas a deep crack was formed along the 45A
   degrees direction in the 0.8C steel. In all the steels, adiabatic shear
   bands were formed diagonally inside forging-simulated specimens, and
   grains were extremely elongated within shear bands. The higher the
   volume fraction of pearlite was, the easier was the adiabatic shear
   banding. Particularly in the 0.8C steel, the shear band was
   white-colored and narrow, along which a long crack was formed. After the
   spheroidization treatment of the 0.8C steel, adiabatic shear bands or
   cracks were not found during the forging simulation test as the steel
   was relatively homogeneously deformed, which indicated that the
   spheroidization effectively prevented the adiabatic shear banding or
   cracking. The present forging simulation test plausibly evaluated the
   cold-forging performance by controlling the number and amount of hit,
   and provided an important idea on whether the spheroidization was needed
   or not.}},

Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{The recently released Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA55) data are
   evaluated and compared with three other global reanalyses, namely
   Interim version of the next European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
   Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim), Modern Era
   Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and Climate
   Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), in terms of global energy and water
   balances. All four reanalyses show an energy imbalance at TOA and
   surface. Especially, clouds in JRA-55 are optically weaker than those in
   the three other reanalyses, leading to excessive outgoing longwave
   radiation, which in turn causes negative net energy flux at TOA.
   Moreover, JRA-55 has a negative imbalance at surface and at TOA, which
   is attributed to systematic positive biases in latent heat flux over the
   ocean. As for the global water balance, all reanalyses present a similar
   spatial pattern of the difference between evaporation and precipitation
   (E-P). However, JRA-55 has a relatively strong negative (positive) E-P
   in the Intertropical Convergence Zone and South Pacific Convergence Zone
   (extratropical regions) due to overestimated precipitation
   (evaporation), in spite of the global net being close to zero. In time
   series analysis, especially in E-P, significant stepwise changes occur
   in MERRA, CFSR and ERAInterim due to the changes in the satellite
   observing system used in the data assimilation. Both MERRA and CFSR show
   a strong downward E-P shift in 1998, simultaneously with the start of
   the assimilation of AMSU-A sounding radiances. ERA-Interim exhibits an
   upward E-P shift in 1992 due to changes in observations from the SSM/ I
   of new DMSP satellites. On the contrary, JRA-55 exhibits less trends and
   remains stable over time, which may be caused by newly available,
   homogenized observations and advances in data assimilation technique.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare computed tomography (CT) findings in patients with
   pancreatic metastasis from renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) and patients with
   hypervascular pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (pNET) with a focus on
   the relative percentage washout (RPW).
   Methods: We evaluated 16 patients with 37 pRCCs and 28 patients with 31
   hypervascular pNETs using a protocol consisting of arterial and portal
   phase CT. Imaging findings were analyzed for comparison between the two
   groups. The RPW of each tumour using biphasic CT was obtained by two
   observers for evaluation of diagnostic performance. Interobserver
   agreement of each value and optimal cut-off level of RPW for
   discrimination between groups were evaluated.
   Results: Tumour multiplicity showed significant difference in both
   groups. The mean RPW of the pRCC group (observer 1,27.0\%; observer
   2,29.4\%) was significantly higher than that of the pNET group (observer
   1, 0.5\%; observer 2, 3.2\%) (p <0.001 for each observer). Interobserver
   agreement for both attenuation values and RPWs was excellent. A RPW
   value of 19\% was selected as the optimal cut-off for pRCC
   determination, and showed good performance (accuracy 83.8\%, sensitivity
   83.8\%, and specificity 83.9\%).
   Conclusion: With multiplicity, RPW of the tumour on CT could be helpful
   for differentiating pRCCs from hypervascular pNETs. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The volatile profiles of aroma extracts prepared from the flower of
   Gardenia jasminoides by different methods were investigated using gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry. The enfleurage extraction using
   spermaceti wax and palm oil afforded the best aroma extract with a
   preference that was significantly (p < 0.05) better than those from
   solvent extractions, as sensorially evaluated in 43 volunteers. The odor
   quality of the absolute de enfleurage was similar to the floral scent of
   fresh gardenia, as confirmed in 152 volunteers. Although female
   volunteers were insignificantly (p > 0.05) better sensed than male
   volunteers, age was significant (p < 0.05). The nuance gardenia floral
   scent was contributed by farnesene, Z-3-hexenyl tiglate, Z-3-hexenyl
   benzoate, and indole. The relaxing and refreshing sensations of the
   gardenia odor suggest its applications in body care, cleansing products,
   and perfume. This study addresses the increasing interest in floral
   fragrances. The aroma profile and sensory property of this sweet and
   elegant scent flower will strengthen and expand the applications of
   gardenia from traditional medicine to those of perfumery and the field
   of phytochemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Latex, the cytoplasm of laticiferous cells localized in the inner bark
   of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis Mull. Arg.), is collected by tapping
   the bark. Following tapping, latex flows out of the trunk and is
   regenerated, whereas in untapped trees, there is no natural exudation.
   It is still unknown whether the carbohydrates used for latex
   regeneration in tapped trees is coming from recent photosynthates or
   from stored carbohydrates, and in the former case, it is expected that
   latex carbon isotope composition of tapped trees will vary seasonally,
   whereas latex isotope composition of untapped trees will be more stable.
   Temporal variations of carbon isotope composition of trunk latex (delta
   C-13-L), leaf soluble compounds (delta C-13-S) and bulk leaf material
   (delta C-13-B) collected from tapped and untapped 20-year-old trees were
   compared. A marked difference in delta C-13-L was observed between
   tapped and untapped trees whatever the season. Trunk latex from tapped
   trees was more depleted (1.6\% on average) with more variable delta C-13
   values than those of untapped trees. delta C-13-L was higher and more
   stable across seasons than delta C-13-S and delta C-13-B, with a maximum
   seasonal difference of 0.7\% for tapped trees and 0.3\% for untapped
   trees. delta C-13-B was lower in tapped than in untapped trees,
   increasing from August (middle of the rainy season) to April (end of the
   dry season). Differences in delta C-13-L and delta C-13-B between tapped
   and untapped trees indicated that tapping affects the metabolism of both
   laticiferous cells and leaves. The lack of correlation between delta
   C-13-L and delta C-13-S suggests that recent photosynthates are mixed in
   the large pool of stored carbohydrates that are involved in latex
   regeneration after tapping.}},

Abstract = {{We study the interaction between production and R\&D patterns in a
   open-economies model of endogenous growth. Unlike existing studies, we
   treat the two industries entirely symmetrically-both are imperfectly
   competitive, and engage in sector-specific expanding-product-variety or
   quality-ladder innovation activities. To achieve a more satisfactory
   analytical characterization, we eliminate scale effects and impose
   strict concavity rather than linearity on the contribution of skilled
   labour to industry R\&D. With imperfect international knowledge
   spillovers, an increase in one country's skilled-labour endowment above
   the other's affects production and R\&D activities in both countries,
   with the resulting increased production and research specialization
   across countries raising world innovation rates in both industries.
   Surprisingly, increasing one country's skilled-labour endowment towards
   the other's can reduce world innovation rates in both industries, on
   account of the resulting reduced specialization. Broader implications of
   the analysis are also discussed.}},

   background of their parents. The research results were obtained through
   the Critical Reading Self-Efficacy Perception Scale, the Attitude Scale
   towards Reading Habit and the Media Literacy Scale. The results show
   that female students have higher perceptions of self-efficacy for
   critical reading when compared to male. While there is a positive
   correlation between the students' perceptions of self-efficacy for
   critical reading and their attitudes toward reading habits and Media

Abstract = {{A study on the sorption kinetics of Cd from soil solution to soils was
   conducted to assess the persistence of Cd in soil solution as it is
   related to the leaching, bioavailability, and potential toxicity of Cd.
   The kinetics of Cd sorption on two non-contaminated alkaline soils from
   Canning (22 degrees 18' 48.02 `' N and 88 degrees 39' 29.0 `' E) and
   Lakshmikantapur (22 degrees 06' 16.61 `' N and 88 degrees 19' 08.66 `'
   E) of South 24 Parganas, West Bengal, India, were studied using
   conventional batch experiment. The variable soil suspension parameters
   were pH (4.00, 6.00, 8.18, and 9.00), temperatures (308, 318, and 328 K)
   and Cd concentrations (5-100 mg L-1). The average rate coefficient
   (k(avg)) and half-life (t(1/2)) values indicate that the persistence of
   Cd in soil solution is influenced by both temperature and soil
   suspension pH. The concentration of Cd in soil solution decreases with
   increase of temperature; therefore, Cd sorption on the soil-solution
   interface is an endothermic one. Higher pH decreases the t(1/2) of Cd in
   soil solution, indicating that higher pH (alkaline) is not a serious
   concern in Cd toxicity than lower pH (acidic). Based on the energy of
   activation (E-a) values, Cd sorption in acidic pH (14.76 +/- 0.29 to
   64.45 +/- 4.50 kJ mol(-1)) is a surface control phenomenon and in
   alkaline pH (9.33 +/- 0.09 to 44.60 +/- 2.01 kJ mol(-1)) is a diffusion
   control phenomenon The enthalpy of activation (Delta H--/+) values were
   found to be between 7.28 and 61.73 kJ mol(-1). Additionally, higher
   positive energy of activation (Delta G(-/+)) values (46.82 +/- 2.01 to
   94.47 +/- 2.36 kJ mol(-1)) suggested that there is an energy barrier for
   product formation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the concept of ``management learning at the speed
   of life{''} as a metaphor to inspire millenials. Millenials may face
   three major problems in relation to management learning: lack of
   concentration, lack of engagement, and lack of socialization. Management
   learning at the speed of life addresses these potential problems through
   three dimensions: reflective, creative, and collaborative learning. This
   paper illustrates the benefits of reflective, creative, and
   collaborative spaces for millenials using practices from leadership and
   personal development courses that were offered over seven years in
   Canada, Turkey, and the UK. These courses incorporated the latest
   technology that brought the course activities up to the speed of life.

Abstract = {{{[}Purpose] To investigate whether transcutaneous electrical nerve
   stimulation (TENS) mitigates the spasticity of hemiplegic stroke
   patients, as assessed by electrophysiological variables, and the
   effects, if any, on the clinical appearance of spasticity. {[}Subjects
   and Methods] Twenty-seven subjects who had acute hemiplegia and 24
   healthy people as the control group, were enrolled in this study. Some
   of the acute cerebrovascular disease patients could walk. Subjects who
   did not have spasticity, who were taking antispasticity medicine, or had
   a previous episode of cerebrovascular disease were excluded. The walking
   speed of the patients was recorded before and after TENS. EMG
   examinations were performed on the healthy controls and in the affected
   side of the patients. A 30-minute single session of TENS was applied to
   lower extremity. At 10 minutes after TENS, the EMG examinations were
   repeated. {[}Results] A statistically significant decrease in the
   spasticity variables, and increased walking speed were found post-TENS.
   The lower M amplitude and higher H reflex amplitude, H/M maximum
   amplitude ratio, H slope, and H slope/M slope ratio on the spastic side
   were found to be statistically significant. {[}Conclusion] TENS
   application for hemiplegic patients with spastic lower extremities due
   to cerebrovascular disease resulted in marked improvement in clinical
   scales of spasticity and significant changes in the electrophysiological
   variables.}},

Abstract = {{Thermodynamic evaluation of the reducing and carburizing activities of
   N-2-based lean sintering atmospheres containing CO, H-2, and small
   amounts of hydrocarbons with their total content not exceeding 5vol\%
   was performed with regard to sintering of chromium alloyed PM steels.
   Based on the thermodynamic evaluation, three sintering atmosphere
   compositions were chosen for experimental studies. For the chosen
   sintering atmospheres, the effect of graphite addition, sintering
   temperature, holding time and cooling rate on the microstructure, and
   final oxygen and carbon contents was studied. The compacts without
   admixed graphite exhibited a microstructure with pearlitic, and in some
   cases bainitic regions, with their content varying according to the
   temperature profile and increasing with increase in CO concentration in
   the atmosphere. These results are indicative of the carburizing ability
   of the atmospheres which was also supported by the results from chemical
   analysis. Pearlitic-bainitic microstructures were observed in the
   compacts admixed with graphite after sintering which suggests that the
   proposed atmospheres provide conditions sufficient for at least partial
   reduction of the surface iron oxide during sintering. The final oxygen
   content obtained after sintering in the proposed lean atmospheres was
   higher than that obtained in the case of nitrogen/hydrogen mix but still
   was within acceptable limits. The results obtained suggest that the
   proposed lean CO and H-2 containing sintering atmosphere compositions
   are promising candidates for robust sintering of chromium alloyed PM
   steels.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the dynamic behavior of distillation column assisted heat
   pump has received considerable attention, since this integrated process
   is used to improve thermodynamic and energy efficiency. This work
   studied controllability of two processes of distillation column assisted
   bottom flashing heat pump and vapor recompression heat pump. Integration
   caused extra degrees of freedom, in which some manipulated-controlled
   variable pairings were promising. Controllability tools such as setpoint
   tracking and disturbance rejection were applied to compare the
   input-output pairings and select pairings with the best controllability
   and disturbance rejection indices under decentralized control in a
   steady state condition and frequency domain. The results indicated that
   controllability of recompression of the top vapor stream was better than
   flashing of the bottom liquid stream of the column. In addition, results
   showed that reboiler heat duty and reflux rate in a distillation column
   could be replaced with other variables. Besides, when a heat value was
   used in a heat exchanger for keeping the temperature of the outlet
   stream at a specific value, heat inputs could be replaced with the
   corresponding temperatures for the manipulated variables. Therefore,
   using this method demonstrated improved controllability indices. (C)

Abstract = {{Network coding for non-multicast problems has been the subject of many
   recent studies. In this letter, we consider networks in which the total
   capacity of the incoming links to each intermediate node is not less
   than the total capacity of its outgoing links. We call these networks
   funnel networks and prove that any feasible non-multicast problem on
   funnel networks is solvable by routing (hence, by linear network coding,
   too). The desirability of network coding in funnel networks may be
   justified by the other benefits that coding offers. However, we see that
   in funnel networks, the conventional random approach to linear coding
   fails with high probability. Hence, we provide a new random linear
   network coding solution for these non-multicast problems.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we make a comprehensive credit risk analysis on
   government bonds (GBs) of Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Greece over
   the period 2007.4-2012.3, where interest rate (IR) differential, GB
   price differential, default probability (DP) and credit default swap
   (CDS) are considered. First, applying the GB-pricing model in Kariya
   (Quantitative methods for portfolio analysis: MTV approach. Springer,
   Berlin, 1993) to these GB prices, we derive the term structures of
   interest rates (TSIRs) and discuss on the Maastricht convergence
   condition for the IR-differentials among these states relative to the
   German TSIRs and make some observations on some divergent tendencies.
   The results are associated with the business cycles and budgetary
   condition of each state. In the second part, to substantiate this
   viewpoint, we first make credit risk price spread analysis on price
   differentials and derive the term structures of default probabilities
   (TSDPs) of the French, Italian, Spanish and Greek GBs relative to the
   German GBs, where the corporate bond (CB) model proposed in Kariya
   (Advances in modern statistical theory and applications: a Festschrift
   for Professor Morris L. Eaton. Institute of Mathematical Statistics,
   Beachwood, 2013) is used in the derivation. Then it is empirically shown
   that the TSDPs show a significant divergent movement at the end of 2011,
   affected by the Euro Crisis. In addition, the TSDPs of these GBs are
   empirically shown to be almost linear functions of the differences of
   the TSIRs, which enables us to state the Maastricht condition in terms
   of DP. Thirdly the effectiveness of our TSDPs is empirically verified by
   comparing them with the corresponding CDSs against US dollars.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a unique set of antibody Fab fragments was designed in
   silico and produced to examine the relationship between protein surface
   properties and selectivity in multimodal chromatographic systems. We
   hypothesized that multimodal ligands containing both hydrophobic and
   charged moieties would interact strongly with protein surface regions
   where charged groups and hydrophobic patches were in close spatial
   proximity. Protein surface property characterization tools were employed
   to identify the potential multimodal ligand binding regions on the Fab
   fragment of a humanized antibody and to evaluate the impact of mutations
   on surface charge and hydrophobicity. Twenty Fab variants were generated
   by site-directed mutagenesis, recombinant expression, and affinity
   purification. Column gradient experiments were carried out with the Fab
   variants in multimodal, cation-exchange, and hydrophobic interaction
   chromatographic systems. The results clearly indicated that selectivity
   in the multimodal system was different from the other chromatographic
   modes examined. Column retention data for the reduced charge Fab
   variants identified a binding site comprising light chain CDR1 as the
   main electrostatic interaction site for the multimodal and
   cation-exchange ligands. Furthermore, the multimodal ligand binding was
   enhanced by additional hydrophobic contributions as evident from the
   results obtained with hydrophobic Fab variants. The use of in silico
   protein surface property analyses combined with molecular biology
   techniques, protein expression, and chromatographic evaluations
   represents a previously undescribed and powerful approach for
   investigating multimodal selectivity with complex biomolecules.

Title = {{The Teachable Moment After Cancer Diagnosis: Perceptions From Oncology
   Nurses}},
Journal = {{ONCOLOGY NURSING FORUM}},

Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{Purpose/Objectives: To determine oncology nurses' perspectives of the
   receptiveness of survivors to receiving health behavior guidance, with
   secondary purposes to (a) explore other elements of oncology nurses'
   perceptions of the teachable moment and (b) examine differences in
   outcomes between American and Canadian nurses.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Setting: In-and outpatient oncology nursing departments in the United
   States and Canada.
   Sample: 310 members of the Canadian Association of Nurses in Oncology
   (CANO/ACIO) and the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) who currently care
   for patients.
   Methods: Oncology nurses recruited through emails distributed through
   the CANO/ACIO and ONS Listservs completed online investigator-developed
   surveys.
   Main Research Variables: Measures related to oncology nurses'
   perceptions of survivors' receptiveness to health behavior change
   counseling and the teachable moment (i.e., general receptiveness,
   perceived benefits, guidance and referral seeking, long-and short-term
   effectiveness, best time, and best resources).
   Findings: Oncology nurses reported that survivors were receptive to
   receiving guidance on health behaviors, particularly during teachable
   moments after diagnosis and during treatment. They also perceived that a
   fairly low percentage of survivors asked for guidance about health
   behavior change; relatively few made improvements to their health
   behaviors.
   Conclusions: Survivors are reported to be interested in receiving
   guidance concerning health behavior change during key teachable moments.
   Oncology nurses may need to initiate conversations with survivors, offer
   education regarding the benefits of positive health behavior change, and
   provide ongoing support throughout the cancer trajectory.
   Implications for Nursing: Oncology nurses may use findings from the
   current study to guide their health behavior change counseling with
   survivors.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation was carried out on the noncross-linked low-density
   polyethylene (LDPE) nanocomposite foams with polyethylene graft maleic
   anhydride (PE-g-MA) compatibilizer. Nanocomposite foams with similar
   densities were produced by extrusion method, and the effect of
   organophilic montmorillonite (OMMT) nanoclay (closite20A) content on
   cell microstructure, mechanical properties, thermal conductivity, and
   flame retardancy of samples were studied. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was
   used to investigate the nanoclay dispersion in LDPE matrix. In XRD
   patterns of LDPE nanocomposite foams, closite20A characteristic peak was
   not observed as an evidence of nanoclay intercalation-exfoliation in the
   polymer matrix. For increasing the compatibility of PE and nanoclay,
   PE-g-MA compatibilizer was used. Due to the presence of compatibilizer
   in the nanocomposite foams and decreasing the cell nucleation energy
   around the nanoclay, the average cell size was reduced, but the cell
   density and microstructure uniformity increased. Furthermore, the
   compatibilized nanocomposites showed lower thermal conductivity and
   burning rate than that of the nanocomposites without PE-g-MA
   compatibilizer and neat LDPE foams, which can be attributed to the cell
   size reduction as well as distribution of cells of narrow size in
   nanocomposite foams.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To assess psychological symptoms in injured children (aged
   8-17 years) and their parents after emergency department (ED) care to
   examine the relationship between posttraumatic stress and depression
   symptoms, co-occurrence of symptoms within families, and the
   relationship of these symptoms to parent-reported overall recovery.
   Methods Children and parents (n = 263 child-parent dyads) were enrolled
   during ED treatment for unintentional injury. Approximately 5 months
   later, children and parents (n = 178 dyads) completed standardized
   measures of posttraumatic stress and depression symptoms and parents
   reported on child overall recovery.
   Results Follow-up assessments found significant posttraumatic stress
   symptoms in 15\% of children and 5\% of parents, significant depression
   symptoms in 13\% of children and 16\% of parents, and problematic
   overall recovery in 17\% of children. For both children and parents,
   posttraumatic stress and depression symptom severity were strongly
   associated. Child and parent symptoms were only modestly associated with
   each other, and there were few families in which both child and parent
   had significant posttraumatic stress or depression. Parent symptoms, but
   not child symptoms, were inversely associated with children's overall
   recovery.
   Conclusions For about 1 in 6 children and parents, unintentional injury
   treated in the ED can be associated with negative psychological sequelae
   and suboptimal recovery. Within families, child and parent responses may
   differ; their relative association with overall recovery deserves
   additional research. To promote emotional recovery, ED clinicians should
   be aware of the potential psychological impact of unintentional injury,
   provide timely evidence-based anticipatory guidance, and communicate
   these concerns to primary care clinicians.}},

Abstract = {{Boron-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond/hydrogenated amorphous carbon
   composite (UNCD/a-C:H) films were deposited by coaxial arc plasma
   deposition with a boron-blended graphite target at a base pressure of
   <10(-3) Pa and at hydrogen pressures of <= 53.3 Pa. The hydrogenation
   effects on the electrical properties of the films were investigated in
   terms of chemical bonding. Hydrogen-scattering spectrometry showed that
   the maximum hydrogen content was 35 at. \% for the film produced at
   53.3-Pa hydrogen pressure. The Fourier-transform infrared spectra showed
   strong absorptions by sp(3) C-H bonds, which were specific to the
   UNCD/a-C: H, and can be attributed to hydrogen atoms terminating the
   dangling bonds at ultrananocrystalline diamond grain boundaries.
   Temperature-dependence of the electrical conductivity showed that the
   films changed from semimetallic to semiconducting with increasing
   hydrogen pressure, i.e., with enhanced hydrogenation, probably due to
   hydrogenation suppressing the formation of graphitic bonds, which are a
   source of carriers. Carrier transport in semiconducting hydrogenated
   films can be explained by a variable-range hopping model. The rectifying
   action of heterojunctions comprising the hydrogenated films and n-type
   Si substrates implies carrier transport in tunneling. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{Seasonal and interannual variations of the barrier layer (BL) and its
   formation mechanism in the subtropical North and South Pacific were
   investigated by using raw and gridded Argo profiling float data and
   various surface flux data in 2003-12 and hydrographic section data from
   the World Ocean Circulation Experiment Hydrographic Programme. BLs
   detected by raw Argo profiles, which existed within the sea surface
   salinity (SSS) front located on the equator side of SSS maxima, were
   thickest and most frequent in winter and had a temporal scale shorter
   than 10 days, indicating their transient nature. Surface and subsurface
   processes for the BL formation suggested by previous studies were
   evaluated. Poleward Ekman advection of fresher water was dominant as the
   surface freshening process but cannot explain the observed seasonal
   variations of the BL. Subsurface equatorward intrusion of high-salinity
   tropical water was too deep to produce salinity stratification within
   isothermal layers. These results strongly suggest that BLs in the
   subtropical Pacific are formed mainly through tilting of the SSS front
   due to the poleward Ekman flow near the sea surface and the equatorward
   geostrophic flow in the subsurface. This idea is supported by the
   dominant contribution of the meridional SSS gradient to the meridional
   sea surface density gradient within the SSS front and the correspondence
   between the seasonal variations of the BL and isothermal layer depth. On
   an interannual time scale, the winter BL thickness in the North and
   South Pacific was related to the Pacific decadal oscillation and the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation, respectively, through the intensity of trade
   winds controlling isothermal layer depth.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional computer simulations do not incorporate human intuition and
   human-like engagement that acknowledges complex and abstract questions.
   This paper presents WOTS (Wizard of Oz Telemedicine Simulator), a
   generic cognitive training platform that supports transfer of medical
   knowledge through remote training and consultations (telemedicine
   training). Medical training via the WOTS provides remote learners a
   risk-free environment in which they can practice and make mistakes,
   while receiving online feedback about their decisions. WOTS leverages
   the Wizard of Oz (WOZ) concept, where human intuition is applied through
   corrective feedback to complex and abstract misconceptions of learners'
   thinking (flawed mental models). The contribution of WOTS to enhanced
   learning is demonstrated by a number of pilot runs and a case study.}},

Abstract = {{Therapeutic treatment for persons with epilepsy (PWE) should address
   seizure control and the broad spectrum of associated comorbidities.
   Since both epilepsy and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can induce decreased
   libido, sexual health assessment is an important aspect of quality care
   in PWE as well as other patients receiving AEDs. This paper presents
   findings from a pilot quality initiative conducted in the ambulatory
   care epilepsy, pain management, and psychiatric services (N = 15
   clinicians) which addressed two themes: 1) whether libido is routinely
   questioned with/without the electronic medical record (EMR) and 2)
   clinicians' knowledge that both epilepsy and AEDs can induce decreased
   libido. All clinicians used the EMR, 40\% used the GU-ROS section, but
   only 1 clinician (6.67\%) questioned patients regarding libido. Of the
   clinicians, 26.7\% demonstrated knowledge that both AEDs and epilepsy
   can cause decreased libido. Our results suggest that a treatment gap for
   epilepsy-induced and AED-induced decreased libido may be related to
   systems issues (duration of clinical visit, billing codes, EMR template)
   and physician barriers including decreased knowledge. Further research
   in this field and replication of this pilot quality initiative are
   indicated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Relative drainage performance of gravel and tire chips used alone and in
   different combinations were evaluated through the results of drainage
   plate settlement and leachate conductivity testing under incremental
   overburden pressure levels. Experiments were performed to assess the
   appropriate tire chips size (in particular aspect ratio) for their
   large-scale uses as leachate drainage layer material. Potential of
   clogging for the optimized size tire chips and their mixes with gravel
   of transmitting relatively ``high-strength{''} leachate were also
   examined. Results showed that ``small{''} size tire chips of aspect
   ratio 1 (average length 22-25 mm) are suitable for relatively lower
   drainage plate settlement and higher leachate conductivity values.
   Additionally, combinations with ds/dg = 0.25 and 0.50 (by thickness)
   when scrap tire chips and gravel were used as separate layers gave
   ``lesser clogging and free drainage{''} up to higher vertical overburden
   pressure levels. Alternatively, 25\% of tire chips (by weight) mixed
   randomly with gravel also gave lesser clogging and free drainage for
   relatively longer period. These findings are very useful for the proper

Abstract = {{Paraspeckles are subnuclear structures that assemble on nuclear
   paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) long noncoding (lnc)RNA.
   Paraspeckle formation requires appropriate NEAT1 biogenesis and
   subsequent assembly with multiple prion-like domain (PLD) containing
   RNA-binding proteins. We found that SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling
   complexes function as paraspeckle components that interact with
   paraspeckle proteins (PSPs) and NEAT1. SWI/SNF complexes play an
   essential role in paraspeckle formation that does not require their
   ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity. Instead, SWI/SNF complexes
   facilitate organization of the PSP interaction network required for
   intact paraspeckle assembly. SWI/SNF complexes may collectively bind
   multiple PSPs to recruit them onto NEAT1. SWI/SNF complexes are also
   required for Sat III (Satellite III) lncRNA-dependent formation of
   nuclear stress bodies under heat shock conditions. Organization of the
   lncRNA-dependent omega speckle in Drosophila also depends on the
   chromatin remodeling complex. These findings raise the possibility that
   a common mechanism controls the formation of lncRNA-dependent nuclear
   body architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Transcriptional co-activator with PSD-95/Dlg-A/ZO-1 (PDZ)-binding motif
   (TAZ) regulates in cell proliferation and differentiation. In
   mesenchymal stem cells it promotes osteogenesis and myogenesis, and
   suppresses adipogenesis. TAZ activators are expected to prevent
   osteoporosis, obesity and muscle atrophy. TAZ activation induces
   epithelial-mesenchymal transition, confers stemness to cancer cells and
   leads to poor clinical prognosis in cancer patients. In this point of
   view, TAZ inhibitors should contribute to cancer therapy. Thus, TAZ
   attracts attention as a two-faced drug target. We screened for TAZ
   modulators by using human lung cancer A549 cells expressing the
   fluorescent reporter. Through this assay, we obtained TAZ activator
   candidates. We unexpectedly found that ethacridine, a widely used
   antiseptic and abortifacient, enhances the interaction of TAZ and
   protein phosphatases and increases unphosphorylated and nuclear TAZ.
   Ethacridine inhibits adipogenesis in mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells through
   the activation of TAZ. This finding suggests that ethacridine is a bona

Abstract = {{Evaluating the distribution patterns of surface temperature data at Very
   Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)/Global Positioning System (GPS)
   co-located sites w.r.t. normality is one of the most important issues in
   modeling surface temperature data over long periods. Such evaluation can
   generate algorithms for filling in missing data at measurement sites.
   Some algorithms in the literature, such as those in the study of Cho et
   al. J Coast Res 65. doi: 10. 2112/SI65-321. 1, (2013), require trend,
   harmonic, and residual components to fill in the missing data. Trend and
   harmonic components estimate an optimal model that can be used to assist
   such algorithms when filling in missing data. The present study is based
   on the investigation of the normal distribution of the residuals of a
   surface temperature time series at VLBI/GPS co-located sites, after
   removing the trend and seasonal effects through harmonic components
   (inter-daily variations). This study uses surface temperature data
   collected from the VLBI/GPS co-located sites of two different regions in
   Europe: Matera (Italy) and Wettzell (Germany). The data collected from
   these sites form a time series, and time series analyses and
   conventional k-sigma outlier detection are implemented on these data
   sets before subjecting them to goodness of fit tests for normality. The
   residual components of the time series are acquired through a
   decomposing trend and signal effect from the original time series,
   assuming that the residuals of the time series are normally distributed.
   In testing the hypothesis that an observed frequency distribution fits
   the normal distribution, the following tests are used: Pearson chi (2),
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, Shapiro-Wilk or Shapiro-Francia,
   D'Agostino, Jarque-Bera, skewness, and kurtosis tests. Some graphical
   methods are also applied to support the results of the goodness of fit
   tests for normality. Some proposals on the application of the goodness
   of fit tests are put forward, such as the evaluation of the estimation
   model for trend and harmonic components by considering the properties of
   the implemented goodness of fit tests. The results of this study can be
   used to determine the optimal model for estimating trend and harmonic
   components. The output of the present study is expected to have an
   important role in modeling surface temperature distributions at
   co-located VLBI/GPS sites for filling in missing data. Above all,
   meteorological data, such as temperature, pressure, and humidity, are of
   specific interest for modeling tropospheric delay, the main error factor
   in positioning in space geodesy, which in turn makes investigations on
   the distribution of meteorological data more attractive in geoscience.}},

   growth pattern, positive CD34 spindle-shaped cells, bcl-2, and dense
   keloidal collagen with areas of hypercellularity and hypocellularity.
   This case report describes a 55-year-old male veteran who presented with
   a rare manifestation of an extrapleural solitary fibrous tumor of the
   medial right hallux. Microscopic and immunohistochemical findings were
   consistent with the previously documented characteristics of solitary
   fibrous tumors. Complete surgical excision of the tumor is the treatment
   of choice.}},

Title = {{The effect of macroalgal, formulated and combination diets on growth,
   survival and feed utilisation in the red abalone Haliotis rufescens}},
Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{448}},
Pages = {{306-314}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Abalone aquaculture in Chile is dominated by production of the red
   abalone Haliotis rufescens using a diet comprised predominantly of
   fresh, wild-harvested macroalgae. Concerns over the long-term supply of
   macroalgae have led farmers to investigate the suitability of various
   formulated feeds, however there has been limited commercial adoption.
   Combination diets of macroalgal and formulated feed fed together provide
   a mechanism to explore and adapt to formulated feed use without entirely
   abandoning macroalgal feed. The current study evaluated the use of
   formulated, macroalgal and two combination diets (low and high
   macroalgal supplementation) on production indicators and canning yields
   of juvenile abalone H. rufescens in a culture system modified for
   formulated feed. The macroalgal diet and the high macroalgal-formulated
   pellet combination diet (76.1\% macroalgae: 23.9\% pelleted diet as dry
   weight) produced significantly higher growth indicators (SGR and LGR)
   than the low macroalgal-formulated pellet combination diet (31.6\%
   macroalgae: 68.4\% pelleted diet as dry weight) and the formulated
   pellet diet. The protein efficiency ratio of the experimental treatments
   was positively related to the proportional contribution of fresh
   macroalgae in the diet. Furthermore, calculation of the protein
   efficiency ratio of the formulated component in combination diets (PERf)
   revealed a significant positive relationship between macroalgae
   contribution and PERf. This suggests that the increase in total PER is
   driven by the increased utilisation of protein in the formulated
   component of combination diets associated with increasing levels of
   fresh macroalgal supplementation. We suggest possible reasons why the
   presence of seaweed increased the availability of the formulated feed
   protein to the abalone. A simulated canning trial highlighted a
   significant positive linear relationship between meat canning yield and
   the proportional contribution of formulated feed. This study highlights
   the value of combination diets as a tool for abalone producers to
   harness the potential production advantages of macroalgae while still
   accessing the processing benefits associated with nutrient dense
   formulated feed.
   Statement of relevance: We believe that this manuscript describes novel
   insights into the efficiency of protein utilisation in juvenile red
   abalone fed combination diets as well as the effect of diet,
   particularly formulated feed inclusion level, on canned meat yields.
   This provides empirical information to inform commercial abalone farmers
   of H. rufescens when exploring dietary options for optimal culture. (C)

Abstract = {{Purpose To describe the safety and stability of sulcus placement of the
   MA50 intraocular lens (IOL).
   Patients and methods Consecutive patients with MA50 IOLs placed in the
   sulcus at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa,
   USA, from 1997 to 2012 were identified. Inclusion criteria included
   patients with over 4 weeks of follow-up data. AEL was compared with
   incidence of IOL decentration using at two-tailed Student's t-test.
   Results Fifty eyes of 49 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were
   identified. Four weeks post-operatively, the average best-corrected
   visual acuity was 20/30. IOL decentration occurred in 14\% of patients;
   patients with decentered IOLs had a significantly longer average AEL
   (25.37 mm) than patients whose IOL remained centered (23.94 mm, P =
   0.017). Other complications included uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome
   (12\%), iritis (8\%), and glaucoma (6\%). There were no cases of pigment
   dispersion syndrome or need for lens exchange. Twelve eyes (24\%) had
   intraoperative optic capture by the anterior capsule, none of which had
   post-operative decentration.
   Conclusion The MA50 IOL is a reasonable, stable option for placement in
   the sulcus, with a low-risk profile; however, in eyes with longer AEL
   and presumably larger anterior segment, surgeons should consider placing
   an IOL with longer haptic distance than the MA50 to maintain centration.
   Optic capture of the MA50 IOL by the anterior capsule should be
   considered for longer eyes, as it is protective against decentration.}},

Title = {{The VALS: A new tool to measure people's general valued attributes of
   landscapes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{163}},
Pages = {{224-233}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Research on values for natural areas has largely focussed on theoretical
   concerns such as distinguishing different kinds of values held by
   people. However practice, policymalring, planning and management is
   typically focused on more tangible valued attributes of the landscape
   such as biodiversity and recreation infrastructure that can be
   manipulated by management actions. There is a need for valid
   psychometric measures of such values that are suited to informing land
   management policies.
   A Valued Attributes of Landscape Scale (VALS) was developed, derived
   from a document analysis of values expressed in public land policy
   documents. The validity of the VALS was tested in an online survey
   comparing values across one of three randomly presented landscape
   contexts in Victoria, Australia: all publicly managed natural land,
   coastal areas, and large urban parks. A purposive snowball sample was
   used to recruit participants with a range of views and professional
   experience with land management, including members of the urban public.
   Factor analysis of responses (n = 646) separated concepts relating to
   natural attributes, social functions, the experience of being in natural
   areas, cultural attributes and productive uses. Relative importance of
   valued attribute factors was similar across all landscape contexts,
   although there were small but significant differences in the way people
   valued social functions (higher in urban parks) and productive uses
   (lower in urban parks). We conclude that the concept of valued
   attributes is useful for linking theoretical understandings of people's
   environmental values to the way values are considered by land managers,
   and that these attributes can be measured using the VALS instrument to
   produce data that should be useful for the policy and planning of
   natural resources. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   considers the labours required to maintain a networked home, the forms

   amongst household members. As part of this discussion, we consider how
   digital housekeeping implicitly situates technology work within the home
   in the role of the `housekeeper', a term that is complicated by gendered
   sensitivities. Digital housework, like other forms of domestic labour,
   contributes to identity and self-worth. The concept of housework also
   affords visibility of the digital housekeeper's enrolment in the project
   of maintaining the household. This article therefore asks, what is at
   stake in the gendered distribution of digital housekeeping?}},

Abstract = {{Chemical mitochondrial uncouplers are lipophilic weak acids that
   transport protons into the mitochondrial matrix via a pathway that is
   independent of ATP synthase, thereby uncoupling nutrient oxidation from
   ATP production. These uncouplers have potential for the treatment of
   diseases such as obesity, Parkinson's disease, and aging. We have
   previously identified a novel mitochondrial protonophore, named BAM15,
   which stimulates mitochondrial respiration across a broad dosing range
   compared to carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP).
   Herein, we report our investigations on the structure-activity
   relationship profile of BAM15. Our studies demonstrate the importance of
   the furazan, pyrazine, and aniline rings as well as pKa in maintaining
   its effective protonophore activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We empirically examine the joint predictions of the pecking order theory
   and the theory of time-varying asymmetric information regarding the
   timing of security offerings around information disclosures. We analyze
   loan originations and bond offerings around earnings announcements and
   compare them against equity offerings. In support of the theories'
   predictions, we find a positive association between the information
   sensitivity of securities and the likelihood of their issuance after
   earnings announcements. In particular, we find that clustering after
   earnings announcements is weakest in loan originations, stronger in bond
   offerings, and strongest in equity offerings. Also consistent with the
   theories, we find that the size of news in earnings announcements
   matters in the timing decision. We find weak evidence regarding the
   theories' implication that the direction of news in the announcement
   plays a role in the timing decision. We test and find that this latter
   result is partly attributable to potential costs associated with the
   omission of material negative information, such as litigation risk.}},

Journal = {{VASCULAR PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{130-138}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Agonist-induced vasoconstriction triggers a negative feedback response
   whereby movement of charged ions through gap junctions and/or release of
   endothelium-derived (NO) limit further reductions in diameter, a
   mechanism termed myoendothelial feedback. Recent studies indicate that
   electrical myoendothelial feedback can be accounted for by flux of
   inositol trisphosphate (IP3) through myoendothelial gap junctions
   resulting in localized increases in endothelial Ca2+ to activate
   intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium (IKCa) channels,
   the resultant hyperpolarization then conducting back to the smooth
   muscle to attenuate agonist-induced depolarization and tone. In the
   present study we tested the hypothesis that activation of IKCa channels
   underlies NO-mediated myoendothelial feedback. Functional experiments
   showed that block of IP3 receptors, IKCa channels, gap junctions and
   transient receptor potential canonical type-3 (TRPC3) channels caused
   endothelium-dependent potentiation of agonist-induced increase in tone
   which was not additive with that caused by inhibition of NO synthase
   supporting a role for these proteins in NO-mediated myoendothelial
   feedback. Localized densities of IKCa and TRPC3 channels occurred at the
   internal elastic lamina/endothelial-smooth muscle interface in rat
   basilar arteries, potential communication sites between the two cell
   layers. Smooth muscle depolarization to contractile agonists was
   accompanied by IKCa channel-mediated endothelial hyperpolarization
   providing the first demonstration of IKCa channel-mediated
   hyperpolarization of the endothelium in response to contractile
   agonists. Inhibition of IKCa channels, gap junctions, TRPC3 channels or
   NO synthase potentiated smooth muscle depolarization to agonists in a
   non-additive manner. Together these data indicate that rather being
   distinct pathways for the modulation of smooth muscle tone, NO and
   endothelial IKCa channels are involved in an integrated mechanism for
   the regulation of agonist-induced vasoconstriction. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Reconciling Harvest Intensity and Plant Diversity in Boreal Ecosystems:
   Does Intensification Influence Understory Plant Diversity?}},

Abstract = {{Overall demand for forest products in the boreal forest is increasing to
   supply growing bio-energy demands in addition to traditional forest
   products. As a result, there is a need to refine current forest policies
   to reconcile production and ecosystem function within the context of
   ecologically sustainable management. This study assessed understory
   plants' richness, evenness, and diversity in six harvested boreal black
   spruce-dominated stands situated on loam, sand, and peat site types 15
   years after the application of four harvest treatments of increasing
   biomass removals. Treatments included uncut, stem-only harvest,
   full-tree harvest, and full-tree harvest + blading of O horizon.
   Following canopy removal, species richness and diversity (Shannon's and
   Simpson's indices) increased on all soil types. The more than doubling
   of slash loading on the stem-only treatment plots compared to the
   full-tree plots led to significantly lower species diversity on loam
   sites; however, the reverse was observed on peat sites where the slash
   provided warmer, drier microsites facilitating the establishment of a
   broader array of species. Preexisting ericaceous shrub and sphagnum
   components continued to dominate on the peat sites. Compositional shifts
   were most evident for the full-tree + bladed treatment on all soil
   types, with increases in herbaceous cover including ruderal species. The
   results suggest that the intensification of harvesting on plant
   diversity varies with soil type, and these differential results should
   be considered in the refinement of forest biomass-harvesting guidelines
   to ensure ecological sustainability and biodiversity conservation over a
   broad suite of soil types.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Civilian suicide rates vary by occupation in ways related to
   occupational stress exposure. Comparable military research finds suicide
   rates elevated in combat arms occupations. However, no research has
   evaluated variation in this pattern by deployment history, the indicator
   of occupation stress widely considered responsible for the recent rise
   in the military suicide rate.
   Method. The joint associations of Army occupation and deployment history
   in predicting suicides were analysed in an administrative dataset for
   the 729 337 male enlisted Regular Army soldiers in the US Army between
   2004 and 2009.
   Results. There were 496 suicides over the study period (22.4/100 000
   person-years). Only two occupational categories, both in combat arms,
   had significantly elevated suicide rates: infantrymen (37.2/100 000
   person-years) and combat engineers (38.2/100 000 person-years). However,
   the suicide rates in these two categories were significantly lower when
   currently deployed (30.6/100 000 person-years) than never deployed or
   previously deployed (41.2-39.1/100 000 person-years), whereas the
   suicide rate of other soldiers was significantly higher when currently
   deployed and previously deployed (20.2-22.4/100 000 person-years) than
   never deployed (14.5/100 000 person-years), resulting in the adjusted
   suicide rate of infantrymen and combat engineers being most elevated
   when never deployed {[} odds ratio (OR) 2.9, 95\% confidence interval
   (CI) 2.1-4.1], less so when previously deployed (OR 1.6, 95\% CI
   1.1-2.1), and not at all when currently deployed (OR 1.2, 95\% CI
   0.8-1.8). Adjustment for a differential `healthy warrior effect' cannot
   explain this variation in the relative suicide rates of never-deployed
   infantrymen and combat engineers by deployment status.
   Conclusions. Efforts are needed to elucidate the causal mechanisms
   underlying this interaction to guide preventive interventions for
   soldiers at high suicide risk.}},

Abstract = {{In corrosion monitoring, the prediction of material constitutive and
   environment relationship can improve the optimization design process of
   pipeline. Recently, the artificial neural network (ANN) models are
   considered as a powerful tool to describe the electrochemical corrosion
   behavior of materials. Based on the experimental data from the
   potentiodynamic polarization of high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steels,
   an ANN was trained with standard back-propagation learning algorithm to
   predict the passivation current density and potential of microalloyed
   steels. The inputs of the model were chemical compositions comprising of
   ``carbon{''}, ``magnesium{''}, ``niobium{''}, ``titanium{''},
   ``nitrogen{''}, ``molybdenum{''}, ``nickel{''}, ``aluminum{''},
   ``copper{''}, ``chromium{''}, ``vanadium{''} and ``carbon equivalent{''}
   (weight percent) and microstructure consist of diffusion
   (ferrite/pearlite) and shear (bainite/martensite) transformations,
   corrosion cell characteristics such as ``reference electrode{''}, ``scan
   rate{''}, ``temperature{''}, relative pressure of oxygen{''}, ``pressure
   of purged CO2{''}, ``chloride ion{''} and ``bicarbonate
   concentration{''} whereas ``passivation current density{''} and
   ``passivation potential{''} were the outputs. According to the predicted
   and experimental results, it was indicated that the developed model
   showed a good capacity of modeling complex corrosion behavior and could
   accurately tracks the experimental data in a wide steel chemical
   compositions, microstructures, temperature ranges and corrosion cell
   characteristics. Scatter plots and statistical criteria of ``absolute
   fraction of variance (R2){''}, and ``mean relative error (MRE){''} were
   used to evaluate the prediction performance and universality of the
   developed models. Based on analyses, the proposed models could be
   further used in practical applications and corrosion monitoring of
   microalloyed steels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   severe disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and severe
   depression, medication may be needed during pregnancy and breastfeeding,
   and there is a growing but complex evidence based on the effects of
   psychotropic medication on the foetus and neonate. In addition, the
   neonatologist needs to be aware of the co-morbid problems that women
   with mental disorders are more likely to have as these may also impact
   on the neonate. Close liaison with family physicians and primary care
   where there are concerns about mental health is important to ensure
   maternal mental health is optimal for the mother and her infant. (C)

   estimate their mode shapes as well. The method is tested on some
   archived real phasor measurement unit data sets and on simulations from
   Kundur two area system. The results show that the proposed method is
   able to track damping ratio variations in power systems effectively with
   short analysis windows.}},

Abstract = {{Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are commonly used as either a
   bridge-to-transplant or a destination therapy. The traditional approach
   for LVAD implantation is via median sternotomy, but many candidates for
   this procedure have a history of failed cardiac surgeries and previous
   sternotomy. Redo sternotomy increases the risk of heart surgery,
   particularly in the setting of advanced heart failure. Robotics
   facilitates a less invasive approach to LVAD implantation that
   circumvents some of the morbidity associated with a redo sternotomy. We
   compared the outcomes of all patients at our institution who underwent
   LVAD implantation via either a traditional sternotomy or using robotic
   assistance. The robotic cohort showed reduced resource utilization
   including length of hospital stay and use of blood products. As the
   appropriate candidates become elucidated, robotic assistance may improve
   the safety and cost-effectiveness of reoperative LVAD surgery.}},

Abstract = {{The current paper exemplifies the application of ultrasound technology
   to enzymatic synthesis of a cosmetic emollient ester, cetyl oleate.
   Fermase CALB (TM) 10000, a commercial Candida antarctica lipase B was
   used as a catalyst to accomplish the ultrasound supported synthesis.
   Multiple process parameters like reaction time, temperature, enzyme
   dose, alcohol to acid molar ratio, ultrasound power, frequency and speed
   of agitation were optimised. Maximum conversion of similar to 95.96\%
   was discerned at optimum conditions, i.e., 60 degrees C temperature, 5\%
   enzyme dose, 2:1 alcohol:acid ratio, 60 W ultrasound power, 25 kHz
   ultrasound frequency, 80\% duty cycle and 80 rpm speed of agitation
   after purification steps. It was observed that the reaction reached
   equilibrium in a short duration of 30 min under the optimised
   conditions. This was considerably lesser than the time required for
   attaining equilibrium in conventional mechanical stirring method which
   was over 2 h. Bisubstrate kinetic models like random bi-bi, ping pong
   bi-bi and ordered bi-bi were applied to the experimental data to
   determine initial rates and other kinetic parameters. Ordered bi-bi
   model showed the best fit with kinetic parameters, V-max = 0.029 M/min/g

Abstract = {{Background: The incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is
   increasing, especially in young active adults. Various surgical options
   like bone-patellar tendon-bone graft and hamstring autograft have been
   the focus of evaluation and comparison in various aspects, each having
   specific advantages and demerits. We are increasingly using and
   analysing quadrupled hamstring autograft for ACL reconstruction.
   Previously it was advocated as a sports injury, but now we note that
   road traffic accidents (RTAs) are the most common cause of ACL tear.
   Objectives: Objective of this study was to evaluate clinical results of
   ACL reconstruction in terms of stability and range of motion using
   hamstring autograft.
   Materials and Methods: We enrolled 50 patients from June 2011 to May
   2014 with isolated ACL rupture, used autologous quadrupled hamstring
   graft and compared the clinical improvement of knee stability and range
   of motion preoperatively versus postoperatively using pivot shift test
   and lachman test. Every patient underwent a standardised 6-month rehab
   follow-up plan and then findings were documented and analysed using SPSS
   17.
   Results: Marked improvement was seen at 6-month follow-up.
   Preoperatively 44(88\%) patients showed grade 2 positive pivot shift
   test while postoperatively only 1(2\%) showed grade2 positive pivot
   shift, and 47(94\%) patients improved to grade0 pivot shift. Similarly,
   44(84\%) patients were having grade 2 positive lachman test
   preoperatively which improved to43(86\%), showing grade0 lachman test
   and only 5(10\%) showed grade2 positive lachman test.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model based on the shallow water equations (SWE) was
   proposed to simulate the two-dimensional (2D) average flow dynamics of
   the liquid metal spreading inside a horizontally rotating mold. The SWE
   were modified to account for the forces, such as the centrifugal force,
   Coriolis force, shear force with the mold wall, and gravity. In
   addition, inherent vibrations caused by a poor roundness of the mold and
   the mold deformation due to temperature gradients were applied
   explicitly by perturbing the gravity and the axis bending, respectively.
   Several cases were studied with the following initial conditions: a
   constant average height of the liquid metal (5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mm)
   patched as a flat or a perturbed surface. The angular frequency Omega of
   the mold (empty set 11150-3200) was 71.2 (or 30) rad/s. Results showed
   various wave patterns propagating on the free surface. In early stages,
   a single longitudinal wave moved around the circumference. As the time
   proceeded, it slowly diminished and waves traveled mainly in the axial
   direction. It was found that the mean amplitude of the oscillations
   grows with the increasing liquid height.}},

Abstract = {{Using multiresolution wavelet analysis, the spectral content of monthly
   maps of sea level anomaly time series on the Mediterranean Sea derived
   from satellite altimetry over the period 1993 to 2013 is investigated in
   order to assess its seasonal changes and its nonlinear trend. The
   multiresolution decomposition has extracted useful the seasonal signals
   (annual and semi-annual) and nonlinear trend of the analyzed time series
   by means of its signals of ``details{''} and ``approximations,{''}
   respectively. Details and approximations signals represent,
   respectively, the high-frequency and the low-frequency contained in the
   analyzed time series. The amplitude values for the annual signal are
   less than 10 cm with an average of 6.74 cm, while those for the
   semi-annual signal are mostly less than 4 cm with an average of 1.79 cm.
   However, the successive smoothing of the analyzed time series through
   the signals of approximations has allowed to better identify the rate
   and time spans of the increase and decrease of the Mediterranean Sea.
   The filtered trend has a slope about 2.30 mm/year compared to 2.46
   mm/year of the original time series estimated by linear least squares
   regression.}},

Abstract = {{Recently application of functionally graded materials(FGMs) have
   attracted a great deal of interest. These materials are composed of
   various materials with different micro-structures which can vary
   spatially in FGMs. Such composites with varying thickness and
   non-uniform pressure can be used in the aerospace engineering.
   Therefore, analysis of such composite is of high importance in
   engineering problems. Thermoelastic analysis of functionally graded
   cylinder with variable thickness under non-uniform pressure is
   considered. First order shear deformation theory and total potential
   energy approach is applied to obtain the governing equations of
   non-homogeneous cylinder. Considering the inner and outer solutions,
   perturbation series are applied to solve the governing equations. Outer
   solution for out of boundaries and more sensitive variable in inner
   solution at the boundaries are considered. Combining of inner and outer
   solution for near and far points from boundaries leads to high accurate
   displacement field distribution. The main aim of this paper is to show
   the capability of matched asymptotic solution for different
   non-homogeneous cylinders with different shapes and different
   non-uniform pressures. The results can be used to design the optimum
   thickness of the cylinder and also some properties such as high
   temperature residence by applying non-homogeneous material.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The efficacy of FOLFIRINOX for metastatic pancreatic cancer
   has led to its use in patients with earlier stages of disease. This
   study retrospectively analyzed a cohort of patients with
   locally-advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) treated with FOLFIRINOX.
   Methods: Between 2008 and 2013, 51 treatment-naive patients with LAPC at
   a single institution received first-line FOLFIRINOX with neoadjuvant
   intent, at the full dose as described in the PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 study.
   Combined chemoradiation was administered for those who remained
   unresectable after maximum response to chemotherapy. The primary outcome
   measure was overall survival (OS), and secondary outcomes were
   progression-free survival (PFS) and margin-negative (RU) resection rate,
   and toxicity profile.
   Results: A total of 429 cycles of FOLFIRINOX were given with a median of
   8 cycles (range 2-29) per patient; 66\% of cycles were full dose. After
   chemotherapy, 27(53\%) received chemoradiation. The median OS was 35.4
   months (95\% CI 25.8-45). Ten (4 borderline resectable and 6
   unresectable) patients had successful RU resections; those who had RU
   resections had a significantly longer survival than those who did not
   (3-year OS rate 67\% versus 21\%, log rank p = 0.042). Increasing number
   of full-dose cycles was significantly associated with increased
   survival. The toxicity profile was similar to previous reports of this
   regimen.
   Conclusions: FOLFIRINOX is feasible as neoadjuvant therapy for LAPC.
   Although the RU resection rate was only 20\%, the median OS of almost 3
   years appears promising. Dose intensity and duration were associated
   with increased survival in this study, arguing against dose attenuated
   versions of this regimen. Copyright (C) 2015, IAP and EPC. Published by

Abstract = {{Description and distribution of reservoir rock characterization in 3D
   space are challenging issues in study of heterogeneous reservoirs. In
   order to obviate these complications, a static model based on reservoir
   and geology characterization is created.
   Well log data has been using to extract reservoir properties. Analyzing
   a large volume of well log data in order to extract reservoir properties
   by manual approaches is difficult and time consuming. Therefore,
   reservoir properties can be determined by simultaneous process of
   several logs. The simultaneous process to classify well log data based
   on similar response is called electrofacies (EF). Electrofacies analysis
   is used to determine reservoir properties based upon lithology, porosity
   and permeability.
   This study consists of three steps. Initially, based on similarity in
   well log response and geological characteristics, electrofacies were
   created by unsupervised clustering approach in one well. These
   approaches include hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), multi resolution
   graph based clustering (MRGC) and Self-Organizing Maps (SUM). Afterward,
   the clusters were generalized to all wells by supervised clustering
   approach. Finally, geostatistical simulation was applied to generate a
   3D spatial model of reservoir electrofacies.
   According to the results, the hierarchical clustering has performed as a
   robust and more effective approach in clustering of data based on
   silhouette validity tests and geological information. Application of
   sequential indicator simulation (SIS) algorithms to estimate EF 3D model
   was successfully tested in the study area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This study is devoted to examine load-bearing capacity of a nanosystem
   composed of two adjacent perpendicular single-walled carbon nanotubes
   (SWCNTs) which are embedded in an elastic matrix. Accounting for the
   nonlocality and the intertube van der Waals forces, the governing
   equations are established based on the nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli,
   Timoshenko, and higher-order beam theories. These are sets of coupled
   integro-ordinary differential equations whose analytical solutions are
   unavailable. Hence, an efficient meshless methodology is proposed and
   the discrete governing equations are obtained via Galerkin approach. By
   solving the resulting set of eigenvalue equations, the axial buckling
   load of the elastically embedded nanosystem is evaluated. The roles of
   the radius and slenderness ratio of the constitutive SWCNTs, free
   distance between two tubes, small-scale parameter, aspect ratio,
   transverse and rotational stiffness of the surrounding matrix on the
   axial buckling load of the nanosystem are comprehensively addressed. The
   obtained results can be regarded as a pivotal step for better
   understanding the mechanism of elastic buckling of more complex systems
   such as elastically embedded-orthogonal membranes or even forests of
   SWCNTs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present work demonstrates the preparation of Ag3VO4/ZnO
   nanocomposites with an n-n heterojunction, as novel visible-light-driven
   photocatalysts, with different mole fractions of silver vanadate. The
   preparation method is facile one-pot, large-scale, and low-temperature
   and does not require any post preparation treatments. The
   microstructure, morphology, purity, and electronic properties of the
   as-prepared samples were studied using X-ray diffraction, scanning
   electron microscopy, energy dispersive analysis of X-rays, UV-vis
   diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Fourier transform-infrared
   spectroscopy, and photoluminescence techniques. Photocatalytic activity
   of the nanocomposites was examined by degradation of rhodamine B under
   visible-light irradiation. It was found that mole fraction of silver
   vanadate has a considerable influence on the photocatalytic activity.
   The nanocomposite with 0.218 mol fraction of Ag3VO4 exhibited the
   superior activity relative to the other compositions. Compared with the
   pure ZnO and Ag3VO4, the nanocomposite exhibited 10.5 and 1.6-fold
   enhancement respectively, in the degradation rate constant. In addition,
   influence of the refluxing time, calcination temperature, and scavengers
   of reactive species on the degradation activity was investigated in
   detail and the results were discussed. Moreover, the nanocomposite was
   found to be a reusable photocatalyst. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{At present, almost all mountain tunnels in Japan are excavated and
   constructed utilizing the New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM), which
   was advocated by Prof. Rabcewicz of Austria in 1964. In Japan, this
   method has been applied to tunnel construction since around 1978, after
   which there has been a subsequent decrease in the number of casualties
   during tunnel construction. However, there is still a relatively high
   incidence of labour accidents during tunnel construction when compared
   to incidence rates in the construction industry in general. During
   tunnel construction, rock fall events at the cutting face are a
   particularly characteristic of the type of accident that occurs. In this
   study, we analysed labour accidents that possess the characteristics of
   a rock fall event at a work site. We also introduced accident prevention
   measures against rock fall events.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Prolonged sitting is a health risk for cardiovascular
   diseases and all-cause mortality, independent of moderate-to-vigorous
   physical activity. Epidemiological evaluation of occupational sitting
   has received little attention, even though it may have a potential
   impact on workers' health. We prospectively examined the association
   between occupational sitting time and all-cause mortality.
   Methods Community-dwelling, Japanese workers aged 50-74 years who
   responded to a questionnaire in 2000-2003 were followed for all-cause
   mortality through 2011. Cox proportional hazard models were employed to
   calculate hazard ratios (BR) of all-cause mortality among middle (1-<3
   hours/day) or longer (>= 3 hours/day) occupationally sedentary subjects
   by gender or types of engaging industry ({''}primary industry{''} and
   ``secondary or tertiary industry{''}).
   Results During 368 120 person-years of follow-up (average follow-up
   period, 10.1 years) for the 36 516 subjects, 2209 deaths were
   identified. Among workers in primary industry, longer duration of
   occupational sitting was significantly or marginally associated with
   higher mortality {[}HR 1.23, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI)
   1.00-1.51 among men; HR 1.34, 95\% CI 0.97-1.84 among women]. No
   associations were found among secondary or tertiary industry workers
   (men: HR 0.87, 95\% CI 0.75-1.01; women: HR 1.03, 95\% CI 0.77-1.39).
   Conclusions Occupational sitting time increased all-cause mortality
   among primary industry workers, however similar relationships were not
   observed for secondary-tertiary workers. Future studies are needed to
   confirm detailed dose response relationships by using objective
   measures. In addition, studies using cause-specific mortality data would
   be important to clarify the physiological underlying mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Flash storage devices are widely used for mobile consumer electronics
   due to small size, low power consumption, and high performance.
   Generally, the flash storage device consists of NAND flash memories.
   Compared to traditional magnetic disks, NAND flash memory requires an
   additional erase operation and its blocks have limited erase cycles. For
   extending its endurance, various wear-leveling algorithms have been
   proposed. However, they invoke many read/write/erase operations and use
   many memory resources for managing their block states because they do
   not consider the property of the flash translation layer. To solve these
   problems, a new wear-leveling algorithm for the log-based flash
   translation layer is proposed in this paper. In the log-based flash
   translation layer, since log blocks are frequently updated and erased,
   the cold block rarely removed is reserved for a next log block so that
   all the blocks are evenly erased. In addition, the proposed algorithm
   reduces the usage of memory resources by exploiting k-bitwise erase
   table that only needs small k-bit erase flags for managing its block
   erase state. Through various experiments with related wear-leveling
   algorithms, this paper shows the superiority of the proposed
   wear-leveling algorithm(1).}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there have been several studies on the inspiration and
   application of optimized natural structures. One study introduced a new
   adhesion method that was inspired by the feet of geckos because of their
   superior features such as high adhesion strength, ease-of-removal, and
   they are environmentally friendly. Various micro- or nano-structures
   were fabricated and tested for gecko-like dry adhesives, but gecko-like
   dry adhesives that were developed became easily worn from frequent use.
   In this study, we propose a metal-coating method to improve the
   durability of gecko-like dry adhesives. We evaluate the initial adhesion
   strength and durability by performing repeated adhesion tests on a glass
   plate. The initial adhesive strength of gold-coated micro-structures was
   60\% of that for non-coated ones. However, the adhesive strength of
   gold-coated micro-structures was kept as 58\% of their initial adhesion
   strength, while that of non-coated ones was only 40\%.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeMany nursing home (NH) residents with dementia receive
   burdensome, aggressive treatments at the end of life (EOL). The
   Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatments (POLSTs) paradigm is a
   strategy to enhance EOL care. This article describes the history and
   features of the POLST paradigm, discusses the potential advantages of
   using this paradigm for NH residents with dementia, and briefly explores
   challenges that nurse practitioners (NPs) face in using the POLST for
   persons with dementia.
   Data sourcesReview of the literature.
   ConclusionsPotential advantages associated with implementation of POLST
   in NH residents with dementia include increased communication and
   documentation about residents' EOL care preferences, increased
   concordance between care preferences documented in POLST forms and EOL
   care provided to residents, and lower rates of unwanted, burdensome
   treatments at EOL. POLST may also guide NPs in communicating EOL care
   options with residents and/or their surrogates. However, difficulty
   interpreting and explaining POLST care options, lack of understanding of
   POLST, limited discussions, and issues with surrogate authority and
   scope of practice are challenges that NPs may face in caring for NH
   residents with dementia.
   Implications for practiceNPs should assess and optimize their knowledge
   and skills to conduct goals of care discussions, including POLST
   discussions.}},

Abstract = {{Luminal A breast cancer can present with early, unexpected lymph node
   metastasis, and sentinel lymph node biopsy has been reported false
   negative in some cases. We aimed to construct a biomarker-based model
   that predicts lymph node metastasis in luminal A breast cancer, using
   expression of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1
   (SIRT1) and apoptosis-related factors, which are known to be closely
   related. We selected tissue samples of 278 cases of luminal A invasive
   ductal carcinoma, constructed tissue microarrays, and performed
   immunohistochemical staining for SIRT1 and four apoptosis-related
   proteins. In constructing the best predictive model for lymph node
   metastasis, six clinicopathological parameters and five molecular
   markers were considered. Independent factors predictive of lymph node
   metastasis were pT stage (OR 1.829, p = 0.027), lymphovascular invasion
   (OR 4.128, p < 0.001), and decreased expression of caspase-3 (OR 0.535,
   p = 0.034) and of SIRT1 (OR 0.526, p = 0.053). A combination nuclear
   grade, lymphovascular invasion, increased B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)
   expression, and reduced expression of caspase-3 and of SIRT1 yielded the
   strongest predictive performance for lymph node metastasis with an area
   under the curve (AUC) of 0.696. This combination was also predictive of
   shortened disease-free survival (73.1 vs. 67.7 months, p = 0.003). Our
   data support a role of SIRT1 protein as tumor suppressor in luminal A
   breast cancer, in association with apoptosis-related proteins. Our model
   based upon a combination of these biomarkers is expected to increase
   accuracy of prediction of lymph node metastasis in luminal A breast
   cancer. This might serve as a valuable tool in determining the optimal
   surgical strategy in breast cancer patients.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a dual-frequency megasonic waveguide that is operated
   simultaneously by 1 and 3 MHz operating frequency, was designed and
   fabricated. Finite element analysis using ANSYS software was performed
   to design the waveguide. The predicted anti-resonance frequency (the
   maximum peak value of a impedance curve) for a 1 MHz piezoelectric
   actuator was 1000 kHz, which was in good agreement with the experimental
   result of 995 kHz with 0.5\% error. In addition, the predicted
   anti-resonance frequency for a 3 MHz megasonic waveguide was 2998 kHz,
   which coincided with the experimental value. After manufacturing the
   system, acoustic pressures were measured and average acoustic pressures
   were calculated. As a result, average values for 1 and 3 MHz operating
   frequency, increased by 59.0\% and 71.5\%, respectively. Finally, a
   pattern damage test was performed with 45 nm poly-Si patterns under 4.5
   W power supply for 1 MHz and 7.5 W for 3 MHz, respectively.
   Consequently, no pattern damage was observed. Considering these results,
   it is thought that the developed dual-frequency megasonic waveguide will
   be applicable in nano-pattern cleaning with improved efficiency.}},

Title = {{Risk of major cardiovascular events among incident dialysis patients: A
   Korean national population-based study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{198}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Dialysis patients are at high risk for cardiovascular
   diseases, but until now there have been no detailed analyses of the
   incidences among Asian patients initiating dialysis. The aims of this
   study were to determine the incidence rates of major adverse cardiac and
   cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and to compare them between incident HD
   patients and PD patients.
   Methods: We included all patients who had started dialysis between
   January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008 in Korea, and analyzed 30,279
   eligible patients {[}22,892 hemodialysis (HD) patients and 7387
   peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients] by intention-to-treat. Median
   follow-up was 21.5 months.
   Results: The crude incidence rates were as follows: MACCE, 182 per 1000
   patient-years (PY); major adverse cardiac events(MACE), 138/1000 PY;
   all-cause mortality, 116/1000 PY; non-fatal acute myocardial infarction
   (AMI), 18/1000 PY; target vessel revascularization (TVR), 17/1000 PY;
   and non-fatal stroke, 60/1000 PY. When comparing all baseline
   covariate-adjusted relative risks between HD and PD patients, HD is
   overall superior to PD in terms of MACCE. Further examined by each
   endpoint, all-cause mortality, non-fatal AMI, and TVR occurred
   significantly-more frequently in patients on PD than in those on HD,
   whereas non-fatal hemorrhagic stroke occurred significantly more
   frequently in patients on HD than in those on PD.
   Conclusions: The incidence of MACCE may be different from Western
   dialysis patients. HD is overall superior to PD in terms of MACCE as an
   initial dialysis modality. Underlying mechanisms differentially
   affecting cardiovascular outcomes by dialysis modality remain to be
   further elucidated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A general theoretical framework is developed to account for the effects
   of an external potential on the energetics of membrane proteins. The
   framework is based on the free energy relation between two
   (forward/backward) probability densities, which was recently generalized
   to non-equilibrium processes, culminating in the work-fluctuation
   theorem. Starting from the probability densities of the conformational
   states along the ``voltage coupling{''} reaction coordinate, we
   investigate several interconnected free energy relations between these
   two conformational states, considering voltage activation of ion
   channels. The free energy difference between the two conformational
   states at zero (depolarization) membrane potential (i.e., known as the
   chemical component of free energy change in ion channels) is shown to be
   equivalent to the free energy difference between the two
   ``equilibrium{''} (resting and activated) conformational states along
   the one-dimensional voltage couplin reaction coordinate. Furthermore,
   the requirement that the application of linear response approximation to
   the free energy functionals of voltage coupling should satisfy the
   general free energy relations, yields a novel closed-form expression for
   the gating charge in terms of other basic properties of ion channels.
   This connection is familiar in statistical mechanics, known as the
   equilibrium fluctuation-response relation. The theory is illustrated by
   considering the coupling of a unit charge to the external voltage in the
   two sites near the surface of membrane, representing the activated and
   resting states. This is done using a coarse-graining (CG) model of
   membrane proteins, which includes the membrane, the electrolytes and the
   electrodes. The CG model yields Marcus-type voltage dependent free
   energy parabolas for the response of the electrostatic environment
   (electrolytes etc.) to the transition from the initial to the final
   configuratinal states, leading to equilibrium free energy difference and
   free energy barrier that follow the trend of the equilibrium fluctuation
   relation and the Marcus theory of electron transfer. These energetics
   also allow for a direct estimation of the voltage dependence of channel
   activation (Q-V curve), offering a quantitative rationale for a
   correlation between the voltage dependence parabolas and the Q-V curve,
   upon site-directed mutagenesis or drug binding. Taken together, by
   introducing the voltage coupling as the energy gap reaction coordinate,
   our framework brings new perspectives to the thermodynamic models of
   voltage activation in voltage-sensitive membrane proteins, offering an a
   framework for a better understating of the structure-function
   correlations of voltage gating in ion channels as well as electrogenic
   phenomena in ion pumps and transporters. Significantly, this formulation
   also provides a powerful bridge between the CG model of voltage coupling
   and the conventional macroscopic treatments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Complex defects present structural and functional challenges to
   reconstructive surgeons. When compared to multiple free flaps or staged
   reconstruction, the use of chimeric flaps to reconstruct such defects
   have many advantages such as reduced number of operative procedures and
   donor site morbidity as well as preservation of recipient vessels. With
   increased popularity of perforator flaps, chimeric flaps' harvest and
   design has benefited from `perforator concept' towards more versatile
   and better reconstruction solutions. This article discusses perforator
   based chimeric flaps and presents a practice based classification system
   that incorporates the perforator flap concept into ``Perforator
   Chimerism{''}. The authors analyzed a variety of chimeric patterns used
   in 31 consecutive cases to present illustrative case series and their
   new classification system. Accordingly, chimeric flaps are classified
   into four types. Type I: Classical Chimerism, Type II: Anastomotic
   Chimerism, Type III: Perforator Chimerism and Type IV Mixed Chimerism.
   Types I on specific source vessel anatomy whilst Type II requires
   microvascular anastomosis to create the chimeric reconstructive
   solution. Type III chimeric flaps utilizes the perforator concept to
   raise two components of tissues without microvascular anastomosis
   between them. Type IV chimeric flaps are mixed type flaps comprising any
   combination of Types I to III. Incorporation of the perforator concept
   in planning and designing chimeric flaps has allowed safe, effective and
   aesthetically superior reconstruction of complex defects. The new
   classification system aids reconstructive surgeons and trainees to
   understand chimeric flaps design, facilitating effective incorporation
   of this important reconstructive technique into the armamentarium of the
   reconstruction toolbox. (C) 2015 British Association of Plastic,

Abstract = {{Nanosize (similar to 50 nm) alginate gel was made by loading alginate
   into the pluronic nano-carrier, followed by adding calcium ions to
   induce calcium ion-induced crosslinking inside the nano-carrier without
   using any organic solvent during the preparation. The alginate gel
   formation inside the nano-carrier did not alter the size or the surface
   charge of the nano-carrier, and the residence of alginate inside the
   nano-carrier in physiological buffer was greatly increased by calcium
   ion complexation. Also, this complex nanogel could be re-dispersed after
   lyophilization without aggregation. In addition, proteins were
   efficiently loaded into the alginate gel-filled nano-carrier by simple
   co-incubation at 4 degrees C, followed by increase to 37 degrees C, and
   this alginate gel-filled nano-carrier showed prolonged release of
   proteins over one month while preserving the bioactivity of proteins.
   Therefore, pluronic-based nanogel was effective for easy preparation of
   nanosize alginate gel in it. The presence of pluronic shell of the
   composite nanogel did not hinder the loading or sustained release of
   positively charged proteins from negatively charged alginate gel inside,
   but rather provided the neutralization of surface charge and enhanced
   stability of the nanosize alginate gel. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In a diesel engine, the wear of the cylinder liner occurs because of the
   continuous reciprocating motion of the piston ring. This wear reduces
   the performance of the diesel engine and shortens its service life. This
   study evaluated the wear characteristics of GT metal and a conventional
   metal used for cylinder liners using a ship's diesel engine. Wear tests
   were performed at temperatures of 25 degrees C, 175 degrees C, and 325
   degrees C, and under loads of 10 N, 30 N, and 50 N. The amount of wear,
   specific wear rate, and friction coefficient were evaluated for each
   condition. To analyze the wear mechanism, observations were made on an
   SEM. In the case of both metals, abrasive and adhesion wear occurred on
   the wear surfaces at room temperature, and corrosion wear was observed
   at high temperatures. The amount of wear and the specific wear rate of
   the GT metal were lower than those of the conventional metal at all
   temperatures, and hence it can be concluded that the wear
   characteristics of the GT metal are much better.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Recently, sculpturing of projected and sharp nasal tips, as
   is usual in the white population, has been of great concern in Asian
   rhinoplasty. However, tip surgery in Asians should be performed in a
   different way due to anatomic differences. The authors used an endonasal
   rhinoplasty to correct the position of lower lateral cartilage by
   adopting a modified columellar strut. This novel technique of an
   endonasal extended columellar strut (EECS) could project the nasal tip
   significantly while avoiding hard fixation. This study aimed to evaluate
   the usefulness of the EECS in Asians.
   Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was performed with 40
   patients who underwent EECS from March 2012 to August 2014. Photographs
   taken preoperatively and postoperatively were analyzed. The tip
   projection, the ratio of the length of the infratip lobule to the total
   length of the tip, and a columellar labial angle change were measured.
   Overall, surgical outcomes were rated into three grades (excellent,
   good, and fair) by two experienced rhinoplasty surgeons (J.Y.K.,
   M.S.C.). All the patients were asked to rate their cosmetic satisfaction
   by using a visual analog scale (10 points).
   Results: Postoperative nasal tip projection significantly increased,
   from 24.2 to 26.7 mm (p < 0.01). The ratio of the length of the infratip
   lobule to the total length of the tip mildly increased, from 0.45 to 046
   in men, and remained unchanged, at 0.48, in women. The columellar labial
   angle significantly increased, from 86.9 degrees to 93.7 degrees (p <
   0.01). Surgical outcomes were rated by two experienced surgeons as
   excellent (40\%), good (42\%), and fair (18\%). Subjectively, patients
   graded their satisfaction at similar to 8.7 on the visual analog scale.
   Conclusion: This novel EECS technique enabled satisfactory tip
   projection in Asians while maintaining a natural ratio of infratip
   lobule to total length of tip and leaving no external scar.}},

Abstract = {{Cordyceps militaris (a caterpillar fungus), which belongs to the class
   Ascomycetes, has extensively been used for medicinal purposes in East
   Asia. Here, we isolated and characterized 12 microsatellite loci from
   the medicinal mushroom, C.militaris. Twenty-nine individual samples were
   taken from a single locality in southwestern Korea and used to
   characterize the developed markers. The number of alleles of these loci
   ranged from two to 13 (mean allelic richness = 6.44). Observed
   heterozygosity and expected heterozygosity in the population ranged from
   0.035 to 0.880 and from 0.035 to 0.886, respectively. Five of 12 loci
   significantly deviated from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, most likely due
   to heterozygote deficiency caused by inbreeding. Tests of genotypic
   linkage disequilibrium between the 12 loci showed no significant
   association of alleles. These microsatellite markers will provide
   valuable tools for genetic analyses for the strain identification of
   C.militaris as well as for its resource conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Study objectives: We compared magnesium sulphate with control, ketamine,
   rocuronium prime, and large-dose rocuronium (0.9 mg/kg) with regard to
   intubation conditions during rapid-sequence induction.
   Design: This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study.
   Setting: The setting is at an operating room in a university-affiliated
   hospital.
   Patients: One hundred ten patients scheduled for general anesthesia were
   randomly allocated to the following 5 groups in equal numbers.
   Interventions: The control and rocuronium 0.9 groups received rocuronium
   0.6 and 0.9 mg/kg, respectively; the ketamine group was given 0.5 mg/kg
   ketamine 2 minutes before 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium; the rocuronium prime
   group received 0.06 mg/kg rocuronium 3 minutes before 0.54 mg/kg
   rocuronium; and the magnesium group received 50 mg/kg magnesium
   sulphate. Intubation was initiated 50 seconds after the rocuronium
   injection.
   Measurements: Intubating condition (primary outcome), rocuronium onset,
   rocuronium duration, train-of-four ratio upon intubation, and
   hemodynamic variables (secondary outcomes) were recorded.
   Main results: The excellent intubating condition was more frequent in
   the magnesium group (P < .05). Onset of neuromuscular block was shorter
   in the magnesium group than in the control, ketamine, and rocuronium
   prime groups (P < .05). No difference in onset time was found between
   the magnesium and rocuronium 0.9 groups. Block duration was longest in
   the rocuronium 0.9 group. The train-of-four ratio on intubation was
   lowest in the rocuronium prime group. The only adverse event was a
   burning or heat sensation reported by 5 patients in the magnesium group.
   Conclusions Magnesium sulphate pretreatment was most likely to provide
   excellent intubating condition for rapid-sequence intubation compared
   with the control, ketamine pretreatment, rocuronium prime, and
   large-dose rocuronium. However, magnesium sulphate administration is
   associated with a burning or heat sensation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Background: In childhood and adolescence, some patients with cerebral
   palsy (CP) have long-term limited mobility, which can lead to secondary
   osteoporosis, -Prevention and treatment strategies have been evaluated
   for the management of low bone mineral density (BMD) and fragility
   fractures. Currently, however, there are no established guidelines for
   the stratification and individualization of therapeutic interventions.
   Recently, an increasing number of studies have reported on the use of
   bisphosphonates to increase BMD in various pediatric conditions, and
   -bisphosphonates have been suggested as a method to treat osteoporosis
   and prevent fractures.
   Purpose: We performed the current meta-analysis to assess the effects of
   bisphosphonates on increasing BMD in children who have CP with secondary
   osteoporosis.
   Materials and methods: A search of PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase from
   inception to April 2014 was performed with the following keywords: (bone
   disease, metabolic OR osteoporosis OR osteopenia) AND (child OR
   pediatric OR adolescent) AND (cerebral palsy) AND (bisphosphonate). Four
   studies were ultimately included in the meta-analysis: one randomized,
   double-blinded, placebo-controlled study and three case-controlled
   studies.
   Results: The Z-score of lumbar spine was significantly improved after
   bisphosphonates treatment compared with pre-treatment values
   (standardized mean difference {[}SMD], 0.799; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI], 0.499-1.100; p<0.001). The Z-score of femur was also improved
   significantly compared with that of the baseline value (SMD, 0.748; 95\%
   CI, 0.382-1.114; p<0.001).
   Conclusions: Bisphosphonates have a significant effect on improving BMD
   in children with CP. Further standardization of treatment protocols
   including treatment dosage and duration needs to be established, and
   long-term follow up studies are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Korean Americans are one of the most underserved
   ethnic/linguistic minority groups owing to cultural and institutional
   barriers; there is an urgent need for culturally competent diabetes
   management programs in the Korean American community for those with type
   2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of a
   community-based, culturally tailored, multimodal behavioral intervention
   program in an ethnic/linguistic minority group with type 2 diabetes.
   Design: An RCT with waitlist comparison based on the Predisposing,
   Reinforcing, and Enabling Constructs in Education/environmental
   Diagnosis and Evaluation (PRECEDE)-Policy, Regulatory, and
   Organizational Constructs in Educational and Environmental Development
   (PROCEED) and self-help models. Data were collected between September
   2010 and June 2013 and were analyzed in August-December 2014.
   Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
   Setting/participants: In a naturally occurring community setting, a
   total of 250 Korean Americans with type 2 diabetes were randomized into
   an intervention group (n=120) or a control group (n=130).
   Intervention: The intervention consisted of key self-management
   skill-building activities through 12 hours of group education sessions,
   followed by integrated counseling and behavioral coaching by a team of
   RNs and community health workers.
   Main outcome measures: Primary (clinical) outcomes were hemoglobin Aft,
   glucose, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein at baseline and
   at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Secondary (psychosocial and behavioral)
   outcomes included diabetes-related quality of life, self-efficacy,
   adherence to diabetes management regimen, and health literacy.
   Results: During the 12-month project, the intervention group
   demonstrated 1.0\%-1.3\% (10.9-14.2 mmol/mol) reductions in hemoglobin
   A1c, whereas the control group achieved reductions of 0.5\%-0.7\%
   (5.5-7.7 mmol/mol). The differences between the two groups were
   statistically significant. The intervention group showed statistically
   significant improvement in diabetes-related self-efficacy and quality of
   life when compared with the control group.
   Conclusions: RN/community health worker teams equipped with culturally
   tailored training can be effective in helping an ethnic/linguistic
   minority group manage diabetes in the community. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{Background: The sequelae of a central venous cutdown usually include
   venous deformity causing venous stenosis or stricture. However, the
   cellular mechanisms causing these deformities have not been elucidated.
   Methods: Silicone 2.7-Fr catheters were placed via the right external
   jugular vein of 16 rats with the cutdown method. After fixation with
   formalin at scheduled intervals (1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks;
   4 rats in each group), the vein segment with the catheter in situ was
   harvested. Histological changes in the vein wall were studied and
   serially compared with light microscopy; standard hematoxylin-eosin
   staining, Masson's trichrome staining, van Gieson's elastin stain, and
   immunohistochemical stain against alpha-actin.
   Results: Pericatheter sleeve formation, circumferential smooth muscle
   cell proliferation and infiltration into the pericatheter sleeve by
   direct contact were noted in all 4 rats of 1-week model; this indicated
   the initiation of neointimal hyperplasia. The neointimal hyperplasia was
   located inside the elastin layer. At 2 weeks, the SMCs stained faintly
   but the components of the vein wall were largely replaced by collagen.
   The proliferation and infiltration of SMCs stabilized at 4 weeks and no
   SMCs were stained around the catheter. At 8 weeks, luminal narrowing was
   noted and the venous wall was composed mainly of collagen.
   Conclusions: Circumferential neointimal hyperplasia occurred after
   surgical cutdown of the external jugular vein in a rat model and was
   caused by SMC activation, proliferation, and infiltration into the
   pericatheter sleeve. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{74}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), also known as CD26, is a
   transmembrane glycoprotein that has a costimulatory function in the
   immune response. DPP4 inhibitors (DPP4i) are oral glucose-lowering drugs
   for type 2-diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study evaluated the risk of
   incident rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune diseases (AD)
   such as systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis and
   inflammatory bowel disease, associated with DPP4i in patients with T2DM.
   Methods Using US insurance claims data (2005-2012), we conducted a
   population-based cohort study that included initiators of combination
   therapy with DPP4i (DPP4i plus metformin) and non-DPP4i (non-DPP4i plus
   metformin). RA and other AD were identified with >= 2 diagnoses and >= 1
   dispensing for AD-specific immunomodulating drugs or steroids. Composite
   AD includes RA or other AD. Propensity score (PS)-stratified Cox
   proportional hazards models compared the risk of AD in DPP4i initiators
   versus non-DPP4i, controlling for potential confounders.
   Results After asymmetric trimming on the PS, 73 928 patients with T2DM
   starting DPP4i combination therapy and 163 062 starting non-DPP4i
   combination therapy were selected. Risks of incident RA and composite AD
   were lower in the DPP4i group versus non-DPP4i with the PS-stratified HR
   of 0.66 (95\% Cl 0.44 to 0.99) for RA, 0.73 (0.51 to 1.03) for other AD
   and 0.68 (95\% Cl 0.52 to 0.89) for composite AD.
   Conclusions In this large cohort of diabetic patients, those initiating
   DPP4i combination therapy appear to have a decreased risk of incident AD
   including RA compared with those initiating non-DPP4i combination
   therapy. These results may suggest possible pharmacological pathways for
   prevention or treatment of AD.}},

Abstract = {{Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of
   procalcitonin in the assessment of bacteraemia in patients in the
   emergency department, both alone and in conjunction with existing
   inflammatory markers of bacterial infection.
   Methods We enrolled 3305 cases (range 20-90 years) for which we
   retrospectively compared procalcitonin concentration, blood culture
   results, body temperature, absolute neutrophil count, and C-reactive
   protein concentration. The positive predictive value and the negative
   predictive value of procalcitonin were established at different cut-off
   concentrations. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted,
   and the areas under the ROC curves calculated, to allow assessment of
   the diagnostic accuracy of (a) a combination of three existing
   inflammatory markers of bacterial infection (body temperature,
   C-reactive protein, absolute neutrophil count), and (b) this combination
   with procalcitonin.
   Results Positive predictive values of procalcitonin using 0.1, 1, 2, and
   5ng/mL as the cut-off values were 21.2, 32.2, 34.2, and 37.0\%,
   respectively. Negative predictive values of procalcitonin using 0.1, 1,
   2, and 5ng/mL as the cut-off values were 95.1, 92.2, 91.1, and 89.0\%,
   respectively. Areas under the curve of three inflammatory markers
   (absolute neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, and body temperature)
   combined was 0.879; areas under the curve of these markers combined with
   procalcitonin was 0.932 (p=0.018).
   Conclusions When procalcitonin is used as a serum marker for ruling out
   bacteraemia, a cut-off of 0.1ng/mL may be used. Procalcitonin improves
   the diagnostic accuracy of existing markers of bacteraemia.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistical test is commonly used to
   determine if data can be regarded as a sample from a sequence of
   independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with
   specified continuous cumulative distribution function (cdf) F, but with
   small samples it can have insufficient power, that is, its probability
   of rejecting natural alternatives can be too low. However, in 1961,
   Durbin showed that the power of the KS test often can be increased, for
   a given significance level, by a well-chosen transformation of the data.
   Simulation experiments reported here show that the power can often be
   more consistently and substantially increased by a different
   transformation. We first transform the given sequence to a sequence of
   mean-1 exponential random variables, which is equivalent to a rate-1
   Poisson process. We then apply the classical conditional-uniform
   transformation to convert the arrival times into i.i.d. random variables
   uniformly distributed on {[}0, 1]. And then, after those two preliminary
   steps, we apply the original Durbin transformation. Since these KS tests
   assume a fully specified cdf, we also investigate the consequence of
   having to estimate parameters of the cdf.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the design of high-performance histogram of oriented
   gradient (HOG) feature calculation circuit for real-time pedestrian
   detection. By utilizing thoroughly analyzed results of the operations
   for overlapping blocks and windows and by managing internal memories and
   registers to store the intermediate results of HOG feature efficiently,
   not only all redundant operations are totally removed but also trilinear
   interpolation technique is successfully applied in the proposed circuit.
   The proposed circuit can process variable sizes of input image up to
   full high-definition (HD) image and it supports two types of detection
   window and color format of input image. In order to accelerate the
   processing time, the proposed circuit adopts the parallel architecture
   with pipelines, and the external memory bandwidth is minimized by the
   efficient management of internal memories and registers. The circuit
   size is reduced by sharing the circuit resources for the common
   operations and by minimizing the required storage spaces. Even though a
   large amount of computations is required due to trilinear interpolation,
   the proposed circuit can process full HD images in real time, assuming a
   scaling factor of 0.9. Therefore, it can be used for real-time
   pedestrian detection in many applications.}},

Abstract = {{The characteristics of break flows of small break loss of coolant
   accident (SBLOCA) tests in the ATLAS (Advanced thermal-hydraulic Test
   Loop for Accident Simulation) facility were investigated. For an
   investigation of the characteristics of break flows for SBLOCA tests,
   cold leg (CL) pipe break and direct vessel injection (DVI) line break
   tests were compared with respect to several kinds of viewpoints, e.g.,
   pressurizer (PZR) pressure vs. accumulated break mass; comparison of
   accumulated break masses; occurrence of choking at the break nozzle;
   comparison of upstream conditions; and comparison of the discharge
   coefficient. In the comparison of PZR pressure vs. accumulated break
   mass, the overall trends were similar between CL pipe and DVI line
   breaks. In the comparison of accumulated break masses, the accumulated
   break mass of the CL pipe break was larger than that of the DVI line
   break for four different break sizes. In the comparison of the
   occurrence of choking at the break nozzle, it was found that there
   should be choking at the break nozzle in the CL pipe and DVI line SBLOCA
   tests. For a comparison of the upstream conditions, upstream fluid
   temperatures showed effects of downcomer wall temperature in a DVI line
   break. For a comparison of the C-d values, the geometry effect, e.g.,
   the LID ratio, was discussed, especially regarding the two smallest
   break tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   temperature on their photoluminescence properties and optical constants
   were investigated. All the films had strong UV emissions in their

   were observed only for the annealed films. The average transmittance of
   all the films was about 80\% in the visible range and the absorption
   edges in the UV range at 375 nm depended strongly on the annealing
   temperature. The optical band gap of the films decreased gradually as
   the annealing temperature was increased up to 400 degrees C, and the
   Urbach energy decreased significantly as the annealing temperature
   increased. Finally, the various optical constants, the dielectric
   constant, and the optical conductivity were measured for the un-annealed
   film and the film annealed at 500 degrees C. (C) 2015 Published by

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{21-32}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Internet usage has been increasingly shifting toward massive content
   retrieval and distribution. To satisfy the demand, information-centric
   networking (ICN) approaches have emerged. These approaches have common
   features such as in-network caching and the decoupling of content and
   location to enable efficient content delivery. In this paper, we
   investigate the performance issue of file sharing in ICN. Compared to
   web and user generated content (UGC), file sharing entails relatively
   low request rates, but much larger content. These characteristics make
   it difficult for file sharing traffic to take advantage of in-network
   caching while competing with web and UGC traffic. For scalable and
   efficient file sharing, we design a peer-aware routing (PAR) protocol to
   utilize peers' storage in ICN. PAR uses a name-based shared tree without
   additional name resolution service. The shared tree is built at a
   network layer to connect peers for the same purpose, allowing a peer to
   discover the nearest peer holding the requested content in the tree. To
   evaluate the proposed PAR protocol, we conducted a large-scale
   simulation with a Bifforrent trace over the Internet-scale topology. We
   show that our protocol can substantially reduce inter-domain traffic,
   while keeping network overhead low. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Prevalent Wi-Fi networks have adopted various protections to prevent
   eavesdropping caused by the intrinsic shared nature of wireless medium.
   However, many of them are based on pre-shared secret incurring key
   management costs, and are still vulnerable from practical
   countermeasures. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using
   defensive jamming technique to protect enterprise Wi-Fi networks from
   potential eavesdroppers. This non-cryptographic approach requires
   neither any pre-shared key or high deployment costs. Defensive jammers
   geographically confine the wireless coverage of Wi-Fi access point, and
   thus block the message reception outside an arbitrary boundary at a
   physical layer. We provide a theoretical model fine tuning the jamming
   parameters for jammer placement. We then discuss practical
   considerations including optimized jammer arrangement algorithms,
   interference countermeasures to legitimate communications, and
   countermeasures against advanced attackers.}},

   Based on flow cytometry, TRO-A0001 clearly induced apoptosis after 24 h.
   The mitochondrial membrane potential disappeared after treatment with

Journal = {{FIRE SAFETY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{24-30}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Evacuation from tunnel fire emergencies may become
   problematic if tunnel occupants do not engage quickly enough into
   evacuation. Dangerous goods transporters increase the risks tunnel
   occupants are exposed to. The aim of the present study is to investigate
   the effect of an increased risk during a simulated tunnel emergency on
   participants' subjective hazard perception and evacuation behavior.
   Methods: Using a five sided CAVE system, two experimental groups were
   immersed into a virtual road tunnel fire emergency. In the dangerous
   goods condition a burning gasoline transporter was visible. In the
   control condition a burning heavy goods vehicle was visible. Hazard
   perception, pre-movement time, movement time and exit choices were
   analyzed.
   Results: In the dangerous goods condition the situation was rated
   significantly more dangerous than in the control condition. In both
   conditions participants showed appropriate behavioral reactions and
   either moved to an emergency exit or to an emergency phone.
   Discussion: In combination with the high threat ratings the results
   indicate good situation awareness of the participants, and that
   emergency signage in the given visibility conditions was effective in
   guiding participants towards an exit or to an emergency phone. (C) 2015

Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{151}},
Pages = {{198-206}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Cholecystokinin (CCK) is released in response to lipid feeding and
   regulates pancreatic digestive enzymes vital to the absorption of
   nutrients. Our previous reports demonstrated that cholecystokinin
   knockout (CCK-KO) mice fed for 10 weeks of HFD had reduced body fat
   mass, but comparable glucose uptake by white adipose tissues and
   skeletal muscles. We hypothesized that CCK is involved in energy
   homeostasis and lipid transport from the small intestine to tissues in
   response to acute treatment with dietary lipids. CCK-KO mice with
   comparable fat absorption had increased energy expenditure and were
   resistant to HFD-induced obesity. Using intraduodenal infusion of butter
   fat and intravenous infusion using Liposyn III, we determined the
   mechanism of lipid transport from the small intestine to deposition in
   lymph and adipocytes in CCK-KO mice. CCK-KO mice had delayed secretion
   of Apo B48-chylomicrons, lipid transport to the lymphatic system, and
   triglyceride (TG)-derived fatty acid uptake by epididymal fat in
   response to acute treatment of intraduodenal lipids. In contrast, CCK-KO
   mice had comparable TG clearance and lipid uptake by white adipocytes in
   response to TGs in chylomicron-like emulsion. Thus, we concluded that
   CCK is important for lipid transport and energy expenditure to control
   body weight in response to dietary lipid feeding. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

   Qatar. Findings of the study suggest that Qatar oil and gas companies
   engage in corporate social responsibility activities focusing on health,
   sports, education and environment, while neglecting other important
   areas such as human rights, labor rights, work conditions, anti-bribery
   and anti-corruption measures. They perform no research and assessments
   before or after they engage in CSR activities. CSR should be enforced by
   law, and implemented according to international standards in order to
   improve its performance and to meet local and international challenges.
   With barely a decade of practice and experience, CSR in Qatar oil and
   gas industry is developing fast and has to move to the next step where
   the focus should be given to developing policies and strategies, and
   through institutionalizing it. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Background and aim: The higher skin surface temperature in a malignancy
   breast region is due to an increase in blood flow, metabolic activity,
   and angiogenesis in the lesion site. The aim of this human breast
   thermogram analysis case study was to compare whole body PET-CT and
   thermogram in diagnosing breast cancer with breast biopsy as standard.
   Materials and methods: The present study attempted: (i) To segment the
   abnormal mass region of the breast from thermogram, and PET-CT. (ii) To
   extract statistical features of the bilateral breast from thermogram and
   comparing the same with normal subject: (iii) To evaluate asymmetrical
   surface temperature of the malignant breast using histogram approaches.
   Results: The calculated difference in measured SST between malignant
   right- breast and normal- left breast was greater than 0.4 degrees C
   whereas the same was found to be lesser ranged from 0 to 0.2 degrees C
   in normal breast thermogram. The malignant right-breast RGB histogram,
   and gray histogram showed an asymmetrical pattern. K-Color means
   segmentation algorithm result was clearly showing the location of the
   breast mass hot region in an asymmetrical SST profiles with different
   SST regions.
   Conclusion: Asymmetrical pattern in histogram and temperature profile in
   thermogram may be one of the approaches for quantifying the breast
   cancer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   The application of Pontryagin's maximum principle yields a boundary

   solution of the maximum-principle boundary value problem is complicated
   by singular modes in its optimal solution. In the construction of the
   solution to the problem, they are described in analytical form.
   Additionally, a special version of the sweep method in continuous form
   is proposed, which is of interest from theoretical and computational
   points of view. An important result is the proof of the optimality of
   the extremal solution obtained by applying the maximum-principle

Abstract = {{Most distributed parameter control problems involve manipulation within
   the spatial domain. Such problems arise in a variety of applications
   including epidemiology, tissue engineering, and cancer treatment. This
   paper proposes an approach to solve a state-constrained spatial field
   control problem that is motivated by a biomedical application. In
   particular, the considered manipulation over a spatial field is
   described by partial differential equations (PDEs) with spatial
   frequency constraints. The proposed optimization algorithm for tracking
   a reference spatial field combines three-dimensional Fourier series,
   which are truncated to satisfy the spatial frequency constraints, with
   exploitation of structural characteristics of the PDEs. The
   computational efficiency and performance of the optimization algorithm
   are demonstrated in a numerical example. In the example, the spatial
   tracking error is shown to be almost entirely due to the limitation on
   the spatial frequency of the manipulated field. The numerical results
   suggest that the proposed optimal control approach has promise for
   controlling the release of macromolecules in tissue engineering
   applications. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline TiO2 and Si-doped TiO2 samples were prepared by
   solvothermal and sol-gel methods. Before the characterization and
   photocatalytic test, the thus-obtained powder and gel were calcined
   under different atmospheric gas flows (O-2, air, and N-2). The
   physiochemical properties of the samples were determined using X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), electron
   spin resonance (ESR), transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy
   dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS). The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the degradation of
   methylene blue (MB) dye under UV and visible light irradiation. The
   solvothermal-made N-2-treated TiO2 nanocatalyst showed the highest
   photocatalytic activity under both UV and visible light irradiation. The
   addition of Si resulted in the formation of partial monolayer of Si on
   TiO2 nanocatalyst and an increase of the anatase phase stability. The
   ESR and XPS results reveal that the calcining atmosphere affected the
   distribution concentration of surface and interface species in TiO2 and
   Si-doped TiO2, such as surface oxygen and Ti3+ sites, thus improving
   photocatalytic activity. The increasing of anatase phase stability and
   the formation of Ti3+ sites due to N-2-treated and Si-doped TiO2
   nanocatalyst promoted the photocatalytic activity of MB degradation. (C)

Abstract = {{The aim of experiments was to assess the efficiency of
   choline-stabilized orthosilicic acid (ch-OSA; complex of orthosilicic
   acid with choline and a bioavailable source of silicon) application
   under increasing manganese (Mn) stress on the micronutritional
   composition and yielding of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. cvs.
   `Alboney F-1' and `Emotion F-1'). Plants were grown in rockwool with the
   application of a nutrient solution varied the Mn concentrations (in mg
   dm(-3)): 9.6 and 19.2 which cause strong oxidative stress of plants
   comparing with optimal concentration of that microelement in nutrient
   solution. The effect of ch-OSA application (at Si concentration of 0.3
   mg dm(-3) nutrient solution) was investigated at both Mn-levels.
   Increasing Mn stress modified the concentration of microelements and
   silicon (Si) in tomato leaves. Application of ch-OSA also influenced the
   concentration of nutrients, but the determined changes were generally
   multidirectional and varied depending on Mn-level and cultivar. Under
   the increasing Mn stress a significant downward trend was observed for
   the mean concentration of Fe (in both cultivars) in fruits - but changes
   of Mn, Zn and Cu were varied depend on cultivar. In the case of cv.
   `Alboney F-1' ch-OSA application caused an increase the mean
   concentrations of Fe, Zn and Cu, while in the case of cv. `Emotion F-1'
   the reduction of mean concentrations of Zn and Cu was recorded. Ch-OSA
   treatment did not influence on the Mn concentrations in fruits. A
   beneficial role of ch-OSA was also found in photosynthesis activity.
   This was especially valid for lower levels of Mn. Application of ch-OSA
   improved significantly the marketable yield of tomato under stress by a
   low Mn level. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract = {{Pulse electrodeposition has been applied to enhance properties of two
   different types of lightweight construction materials, a periodic
   cellular material (PCM) and a micro-sandwich. For the PCM, the
   deformation behaviour of the nanocrystalline Ni-18 wt-\% Fe sleeve
   material (bulk samples) has been investigated up to 548 K. The material
   exhibits plasticity of >30\% fracture strain at higher temperatures (423
   K) compared to <15\% at room temperature (295 K). TEM characterisation
   shows that coarser grains are present, which enable strain hardening by
   intra-granular dislocation accumulation. This leads to larger fracture
   strains at higher temperatures. Hence, for allowing application of the
   PCM at elevated temperatures (e.g. at temperatures of more than 400 K),
   the sleeve material has to be stabilised against deformation-induced
   grain growth. For the micro-sandwich, the similar to 100 mu m thick
   pulse-electrodeposited nickel coating on either the face sheets or
   polymer fibres of the sandwich core can provide extra strength. With
   respect to the fibres, the plating process needs to be improved further
   to achieve a continuous and homogeneous coating.}},

Abstract = {{The term managerialism' has been widely used but theoretical
   publications on managerialism remain rare while theory development
   continues to be insufficient. This article is a contribution to the
   current discussion on managerialism. Managerialism is a deeply
   ideological project transcending its traditional position when entering
   into society. The following theoretical rather than empirical article
   sets out to present a short overview of the current debate on
   managerialism, seeking to deliver some preliminary approximations on a
   possible definition of managerialism and its ideological project. The
   second part highlights what distinguishes managerialism from
   neo-liberalism. It is followed by a brief discussion on ideology.
   Clarifications on managerialism and ideology set the scene for a few
   preliminary introductory thoughts in Early Signposts for a Future
   Critical Theory of Managerialism'. The conclusion provides a brief
   emancipatory note on what lies beyond managerialism.}},

Title = {{Online Sentence Reading in People With Aphasia: Evidence From Eye
   Tracking}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{S961-S973}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: There is a lot of evidence that people with aphasia have more
   difficulty understanding structurally complex sentences (e.g., object
   clefts) than simpler sentences (subject clefts). However, subject clefts
   also occur more frequently in English than object clefts. Thus, it is
   possible that both structural complexity and frequency affect how people
   with aphasia understand these structures.
   Method: Nine people with aphasia and 8 age-matched controls participated
   in the study. The stimuli consisted of 24 object cleft and 24 subject
   cleft sentences. The task was eye tracking during reading, which permits
   a more fine-grained analysis of reading performance than measures such
   as self-paced reading.
   Results: As expected, controls had longer reading times for critical
   regions in object cleft sentences compared with subject cleft sentences.
   People with aphasia showed the predicted effects of structural
   frequency. Effects of structural complexity in people with aphasia did
   not emerge on their first pass through the sentence but were observed
   when they were rereading critical regions of complex sentences.
   Conclusions: People with aphasia are sensitive to both structural
   complexity and structural frequency when reading. However, people with
   aphasia may use different reading strategies than controls when
   confronted with relatively infrequent and complex sentence structures.}},

Abstract = {{Surfactant protein D (SP-D) modulates the lung's immune system. Its
   absence leads to NOS2-independent alveolar lipoproteinosis and
   NOS2-dependent chronic inflammation, which is critical for early
   emphysematous remodeling. With aging, SP-D knockout mice develop an
   additional interstitial fibrotic component. We hypothesize that this
   age-related interstitial septal wall remodeling is mediated by NOS2.
   Using invasive pulmonary function testing such as the forced oscillation
   technique and quasistatic pressure-volume perturbation and design-based
   stereology, we compared 29-wk-old SP-D knockout (Sftpd(-/-)) mice,
   SP-D/NOS2 double-knockout (DiNOS) mice, and wild-type mice (WT).
   Structural changes, including alveolar epithelial surface area,
   distribution of septal wall thickness, and volumes of septal wall
   components (alveolar epithelium, interstitial tissue, and endothelium)
   were quantified. Twenty-nine-week-old Sftpd(-/-) mice had preserved lung
   mechanics at the organ level, whereas elastance was increased in DiNOS.
   Airspace enlargement and loss of surface area of alveolar epithelium
   coexist with increased septal wall thickness in Sftpd(-/-) mice. These
   changes were reduced in DiNOS, and compared with Sftpd-/- mice a
   decrease in volumes of interstitial tissue and alveolar epithelium was
   found. To understand the effects of lung pathology on measured lung
   mechanics, structural data were used to inform a computational model,
   simulating lung mechanics as a function of airspace derecruitment,
   septal wall destruction (loss of surface area), and septal wall
   thickening. In conclusion, NOS2 mediates remodeling of septal walls,
   resulting in deposition of interstitial tissue in Sftpd(-/-). Forward
   modeling linking structure and lung mechanics describes the complex
   mechanical properties by parenchymatous destruction (emphysema),
   interstitial remodeling (septal wall thickening), and altered
   recruitability of acinar airspaces.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is considered to be the most promising
   and economically viable process for carbon dioxide capture. The oxygen
   carrier has a central role in the chemical-looping combustion process.
   Ilmenite, a natural mineral composed of FeTiO3, has been extensively
   used as oxygen carrier in CLC systems due to its availability,
   relatively low cost and demonstrated reactivity. During the looping
   process ilmenite undergoes a series of chemical and mechanical
   transformations that eventually lead to the break-down of particles into
   smaller fragments, which are unfit for use in circulated fluidized bed
   (CFB) applications.
   In the present study a 100 kW chemical-looping system was operated with
   ilmenite particles as oxygen carrier and with biomass char as fuel.
   Ilmenite particles were collected at the end of the run. The collected
   particles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning
   Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy
   (SEM-EDS). Thermodynamic predictions of the expected compounds at the
   given conditions were also used to compare with the experimentally
   obtained results.
   The aim of the study was to understand the change in morphology and
   chemical compositions of the collected ilmenite particles and to relate
   them to the exposure conditions in the CLC reactor.
   It was found that the aging of the ilmenite particles could be
   distinguished based on the particle morphology. Furthermore, a possible
   mechanism for the transformation of the ilmenite particles during the
   cyclic chemical-looping process was proposed. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{EMMPRIN (extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer) is a widely
   expressed glycoprotein and a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily
   which exists in both a membrane-spanning and a soluble form. Homotypic
   interactions of EMMPRIN underlie its multiple roles in normal
   development and pathological situations such as viral infections,
   Alzheimer's disease and cancer. This study employed a recombinant
   soluble, fully glycosylated EMMPRIN domain (rhsEMN) as a tool to
   characterize the structural basis of EMMPRIN-EMMPRIN receptor (EMNR)
   contacts and their functional effects on MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells.
   rhsEMN did not form dimers in solution but bound to surface EMMPRIN
   (EMN) on MCF-7 cells with high affinity and was readily internalized.
   The interaction interface for the homotypic contact was localized to the
   N-terminal Ig domain. rhsEMN exerted a stimulatory effect on
   proliferation of MCF-7 cells whereas it reduced cell migration in a
   dose-dependent manner. These effects were accompanied by an upregulation
   of endogenous EMMPRIN as well as of matrix metalloproteinase-14
   (MMP-14), a membrane-bound protease involved in the extracellular
   release of soluble EMMPRIN, indicating a regulatory feedback mechanism.
   The proliferation-promoting activity of rhsEMN was mimicked by a novel
   functional antibody directed to EMMPRIN, underscoring that crosslinking
   of cell surface EMMPRIN (EMNR) is crucial for eliciting intracellular
   signalling. Addressing malignancy-related signal transduction in HEK-293
   cells, we could show that rhsEMN triggers the oncogenic Wnt pathway.}},

Abstract = {{A special vector system was developed to monitor the in vitro and in
   vivo endogenous level of a primary transcript of miR124a during neuronal
   differentiation
   The upstream regions of miR124a were fused with luciferase (Gluc) and
   their activity was measured. During neurogenesis of P19 cells, the
   primary transcript level of miR124a was increased 1.5-times compared to
   the undifferentiated P19 cells. P19 cells grafted to nude mice exhibited
   the same pattern of luciferase activity in vivo as they did in vitro.
   The expression of primary miR124a during neurogenesis was successfully
   imaged by in vitro and in vivo luciferase reporter gene-based method.}},

Abstract = {{This article aimed to review various theories of bipedalism and provide
   a holistic answer to human evolution. There have been two questions
   regarding bipedalism: i) why were the earliest hominins partially
   bipedal?, and ii) why did hominins become increasingly bipedal over the
   time and replaced their less bipedal ancestors? To answer these
   questions, the prominent theories in the field, such as the
   savanna-based theory, the postural feeding hypotheses, and the
   provisioning model, are collectively examined. Because biological
   evolution is not a simple causation; there may be multiple answers to
   the evolution of bipedalism. The postural feeding hypothesis (reaching
   for food/balancing) provides an explanation for the partial bipedalism
   of the earliest hominins. The savannah-based theory describes how the
   largely bipedal hominins that started to settle on the ground became
   increasingly bipedal. The provisioning model (food-gathering/monogamy)
   explains questions arising after the postural feeding hypothesis and
   before the savannah theory in an evolutionary timeline. Indeed, there
   are no straight lines between the theories, and multiple forces could
   have pushed the evolution of bipedalism at different points. Finally,
   the arboreal hominins that possessed ambiguous traits of bipedalism were
   eliminated through the choice and selection. Using the biological
   analogy of the okapi and giraffe, efforts were put to explain how one of
   the branches (Homo) became increasingly bipedal, while the other (Pan)
   adapted to locomotion for forest life by narrowing the
   anatomical/biological focus in evolution.}},

Abstract = {{We have successfully synthesized various SnO2 nanostructures on p-type
   Si (100) substrates via three different processes: (1) using an
   as-deposited Au thin-film catalyst, (2) by adjusting the particle size
   of the Au catalyst via annealing treatment, and (3) without using any Au
   catalyst. Scanning electron microscopy images indicate that
   nanostructures processed by methods (1) and (2) show wire-like
   morphology. The rod-like nanostructures obtained under
   ``catalyst-free{''} conditions in method (3) present square cross
   sections and faceted surfaces. Transmission electron microscopy analysis
   shows that the SnO2 nanostructures obtained from processes (1) and (2)
   are single crystalline, while those from process (3) are polycrystalline
   with tetragonal SnO2 structures. Investigations on the room-temperature
   photoluminescence (PL) spectra reveal that the PL intensity and energy
   of the individual SnO2 nanostructures differ significantly according to
   the synthesis method. The SnO2 nanostructures synthesized using the
   ``thin-film catalyst{''} method show a somewhat broad blue (440 nm) and
   an orange (620 nm) emission peak. The PL emission of the nanomaterial
   obtained through the ``annealed catalyst{''} process (2) was
   considerably enhanced near 620 nm. The ``catalyst-free{''} process (3)
   resulted in a material with only very weak orange emission at 620 nm and
   without any blue emission. Based on these results, the growth,
   microstructure, and PL mechanism of SnO2 nanostructures are discussed in
   this paper.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Prolonged intestinal paralysis can be a problem after
   gastrointestinal surgery. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses
   have suggested the efficacy of gum chewing for the prevention of
   postoperative ileus.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of gum
   chewing for the recovery of bowel function after surgery for left-sided
   colorectal cancer and to determine the physiological mechanism
   underlying the effect of gum chewing on bowel function.
   DESIGN: This was a single-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
   prospective randomized trial.
   SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a general hospital in Japan.
   PATIENTS: Forty-eight patients with left-sided colorectal cancer were
   included.
   INTERVENTIONS: The patients were randomly assigned to a gum group (N =
   25) and a control group (N = 23). Four patients in the gum group and 1
   in the control group were subsequently excluded because of difficulties
   in continuing the trial, resulting in the analysis of 21 and 22 patients
   in the respective groups. Patients in the gum group chewed commercial
   gum 3 times a day for 5 minutes each time from postoperative day 1 to
   the first day of food intake.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The time to first flatus and first bowel movement
   after the operation were recorded, and the colonic transit time was
   measured. Gut hormones (gastrin, des-acyl ghrelin, motilin, and
   serotonin) were measured preoperatively, perioperatively, and on
   postoperative days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10.
   RESULTS: Gum chewing did not significantly shorten the time to the first
   flatus (53 2 vs 49 26 hours; p = 0.481; gum vs control group), time to
   first bowel movement (94 +/- 44 vs 109 +/- 34 hours; p = 0.234), or the
   colonic transit time (88 +/- 28 vs 88 +/- 21 hours; p = 0.968). However,
   gum chewing significantly increased the serum levels of des-acyl ghrelin
   and gastrin.
   LIMITATIONS: The main limitation was a greater rate of complications
   than anticipated, which limited the significance of the findings.
   CONCLUSIONS: Gum chewing changed the serum levels of des-acyl ghrelin
   and gastrin, but we were unable to demonstrate an effect on the recovery
   of bowel function.}},

   Cyantraniliprole when applied as fruit dip, was 6543 times more toxic to
   L. orbonalis as compared to cypermethrin. The descending order of
   toxicity of tested insecticides was cyantraniliprole >
   chlorantraniliprole > flubendiamide > cypermethrin. Under laboratory
   bioassays the third instar larvae of L. orbonalis were found to be more
   susceptible to cyantraniliprole@ 90 g a.i./ha and recorded highest per
   cent mortality of 91.66 and 99.00 at 24 and 48 hrs after treatment. In
   field experiment, cyantraniliprole@ 105 g a.i.ha(-1) was significantly

Title = {{Biochemical characterization of embryogenic calli of Vanilla planifolia
   in response to two years of thidiazuron treatment}},
Journal = {{PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{337-344}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Vanilla planifolia embryogenic calli were cultured for two years on a
   medium containing thidiazuron (TDZ). Due to the presence of TDZ, these
   calli were under permanent chemical treatment and the differentiation of
   adventitious shoots from protocorm-like-bodies (PLBs) was blocked. When
   embryogenic calli were transferred onto a medium without TDZ, shoot
   organogenesis and plantlet regeneration occurred. To gain better
   knowledge about the biochemical and molecular processes involved in the
   morphoregulatory role of TDZ, hormonal and metabolomic analyses were
   performed. Our results indicate that in the presence of TDZ, embryogenic
   calli contained a high amount of abscisic acid (ABA) essentially
   metabolized into abscisic acid glucosyl ester (ABAGE) and phaseic acid
   (PA), which was the most abundant. When transferred onto a medium
   without TDZ, shoot regeneration and development take place in four
   stages that include: embryogenic calli growth, differentiation of PLBs
   from meristmatic cells zones (MCZ), shoot organogenesis from PLBs and
   the elongation of well-formed shoots.
   From a hormonal perspective, the significant reduction in ABA metabolism
   and its readjustment in the ABAGE pathway triggered PLBs formation.
   However, this first morphogenesis was stimulated by a strong reduction
   in IAA metabolism. The organogenesis of PLBs into shoots is associated
   with an increase in ABA catabolism and a gradual shift in cellular
   metabolism towards shoot differentiation. Thus, the initiation of the

Abstract = {{Aims: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is associated with cognitive impairment. We
   examined whether undiagnosed cognitive impairment in T2DM-patients is
   associated with a reduced health status and depressive symptoms.
   Methods: In an observational study, 225 T2DM-patients aged >= 70 years
   were examined at their homes and (some of them) at a memory clinic for
   undiagnosed cognitive impairment (dementia or mild cognitive impairment
   {[}MCI], defined according to internationally accepted criteria).
   Questionnaires assessing health status (SF-36, EQ-5D, EQ-VAS) and
   depressive symptoms (CES-D) were filled out. Health status and
   depressive symptoms were compared between patients with and without
   cognitive impairment.
   Results: Patients with cognitive impairment (n = 57) showed
   significantly lower scores on the physical and mental summary scores of
   the SF-36 than patients with normal cognition (difference: 3.5 (95\%-CI
   0.7-6.3, p = 0.02, effect size 0.41) and 2.9 (95\%-CI 0.3-5.6; p = 0.03,
   effect size 0.37). EQ-5D index and EQ-VAS scores were significantly
   lower in patients with cognitive impairment. Depression (CES-D 16)
   occurred almost twice as often in patients with cognitive impairment (RR
   1.8; 95\%-CI: 1.1-3.0).
   Conclusions: Undiagnosed cognitive impairment in T2DM-patients is
   associated with a reduced health status and more depressive symptoms.
   Detection of cognitive impairment in T2DM-patients identifies a
   vulnerable patient group that could benefit from tailored treatment and
   care. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the early 20th century, there were few therapeutic options for mental
   illness and asylum numbers were rising. This pessimistic outlook
   favoured the rise of the eugenics movement. Heredity was assumed to be
   the principal cause of mental illness. Politicians, scientists and
   clinicians in North America and Europe called for compulsory
   sterilisation of the mentally ill. Psychiatric genetic research aimed to
   prove a Mendelian mode of inheritance as a scientific justification for
   these measures. Ernst Rudin's seminal 1916 epidemiological study on
   inheritance of dementia praecox featured large, systematically
   ascertained samples and statistical analyses. Rudin's 1922-1925 study on
   the inheritance of ``manic-depressive insanity{''} was completed in
   manuscript form, but never published. It failed to prove a pattern of
   Mendelian inheritance, counter to the tenets of eugenics of which Rudin
   was a prominent proponent. It appears he withheld the study from
   publication, unable to reconcile this contradiction, thus subordinating
   his carefully derived scientific findings to his ideological
   preoccupations. Instead, Rudin continued to promote prevention of
   assumed hereditary mental illnesses by prohibition of marriage or
   sterilisation and was influential in the introduction by the National
   Socialist regime of the 1933 ``Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily
   Diseased Offspring{''} (Gesetz zur Verhutung erbkranken Nachwuchses).}},

Abstract = {{Background:Midline facial clefts are rare and challenging deformities
   caused by failure of fusion of the medial nasal prominences. These
   anomalies vary in severity, and may include microform lines or midline
   lip notching, incomplete or complete labial clefting, nasal bifidity, or
   severe craniofacial bony and soft tissue anomalies with orbital
   hypertelorism and frontoethmoidal encephaloceles. In this study, the
   authors present 4 cases, classify the spectrum of midline cleft
   anomalies, and review our technical approaches to the surgical
   correction of midline cleft lip and bifid nasal deformities. Embryology
   and associated anomalies are discussed.Methods:The authors
   retrospectively reviewed our experience with 4 cases of midline cleft
   lip with and without nasal deformities of varied complexity. In
   addition, a comprehensive literature search was performed, identifying
   studies published relating to midline cleft lip and/or bifid nose
   deformities. Our assessment of the anomalies in our series, in
   conjunction with published reports, was used to establish a 5-tiered
   classification system. Technical approaches and clinical reports are
   described.Results:Functional and aesthetic anatomic correction was
   successfully achieved in each case without complication. A
   classification and treatment strategy for the treatment of midline cleft
   lip and bifid nose deformity is presented.Conclusions:The successful
   treatment of midline cleft lip and bifid nose deformities first requires
   the identification and classification of the wide variety of anomalies.
   With exposure of abnormal nasolabial anatomy, the excision of redundant
   skin and soft tissue, anatomic approximation of cartilaginous elements,
   orbicularis oris muscle repair, and craniofacial osteotomy and reduction
   as indicated, a single-stage correction of midline cleft lip and bifid
   nasal deformity can be safely and effectively achieved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this work was to investigate the
   association between coffee drinking and diabetes development and
   potential mediation by oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: In 2001-2002, a random sample of 1514 men (18-87 years
   old) and 1528 women (18-89 years old) were selected to participate in
   the ATTICA study (Athens metropolitan area, Greece). A validated
   food-frequency questionnaire was used to assess coffee drinking
   (abstention, casual, habitual) and other lifestyle and dietary factors.
   Evaluation of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers was also
   performed. During 2011-2012, the 10-year follow-up of the ATTICA study
   was carried out. The outcome of interest in this work was incidence of
   type 2 diabetes, defined according to American Diabetes Association
   criteria.
   RESULTS: During follow-up, 191 incident cases of diabetes were
   documented (incidence 13.4\% in men and 12.4\% in women). After various
   adjustments, individuals who consumed >= 250 ml of coffee (approximate
   to 1.5cup) had 54\% lower odds of developing diabetes (95\% confidence
   interval: 0.24, 0.90), as compared with abstainers. A dose-response
   linear trend between coffee drinking and diabetes incidence was also
   observed (P for trend = 0.017). When controlling for several oxidative
   stress and inflammatory biomarkers, the inverse association between
   habitual coffee drinking and diabetes was found to be mediated by serum
   amyloid-A levels.
   CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights the significance of long-term habitual
   coffee drinking against diabetes onset. The anti-inflammatory effect of
   several coffee components may be responsible for this protection.}},

   plasmas}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A fluid theory has been developed by taking account of gyro-viscosity to
   study wave propagation characteristics in a homogeneous pair-ion
   magnetized plasma with a cylindrical symmetry. The exact dispersion
   relations derived by the Hankel-Fourier transformation are shown
   comparable with those observed in the experiment by Oohara and
   co-workers. The gyro-viscosity is responsible for the change in
   propagation characteristics of the ion cyclotron wave from forward to
   backward by suppressing the effect of the thermal pressure which
   normally causes the forward nature of dispersion. Although the
   experiment has been already explained by a kinetic theory by the present
   authors, the kinetic derivations are so involved because of exact
   particle orbits in phase space, finite Lamor radius effects, and higher
   order ion cyclotron resonances. The present fluid theory provides a
   simple and transparent structure to the dispersion relations since the
   gyro-viscosity is renormalized into the ion cyclotron frequency which

Abstract = {{It is challenging to image and characterize the body of a landfill.
   High-density areas that act as obstructions to fluid flow are of
   specific interest to the landfill operators (e.g., for improvement of
   treatment technologies), and thus their imaging is important. In seismic
   reflection sections, such areas manifest themselves as sources of
   scattered energy. The heterogeneities inside the landfill, in addition
   to the surface-wave energy which is difficult to remove, add to the
   complexity in the seismic data. We propose to make use of seismic
   interferometry (SI) not only as a tool to improve the imaging of the
   scatterers, but also as a tool to remove the undesired surface-wave
   energy. We investigate the results obtained from application of SI to
   field seismic reflection data recorded at a landfill. We show that the
   data, retrieved by SI, image the scattered energy better than the
   seismic reflection data when the latter is processed in a conventional
   way. The increased stacking power of SI and its implicit consideration
   of multiple scattering result in a better illumination of the
   scatterers. We also use SI to predict the surface-wave energy and remove
   it from the original seismic reflection data using an adaptive
   subtraction method. The result from the adaptive subtraction when
   compared-to the reflection data, processed in a conventional way, shows
   improved imaging, especially of layers in the landfill. Combined
   interpretation of the stacked reflection sections together with the
   velocity fields obtained from the three different datasets (conventional
   seismic reflection, SI and adaptive subtraction) leads to an improved
   interpretation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Since publication of the German Decree on Health in Mining in 1992
   hazardous substances for application in underground workplaces have to
   be approved by the Mining Authorities. This is basically also true for
   bulk waste materials with significant contents of for example metals
   with threshold limits as airborne inhalation hazards, when these are
   used as so-called backfilling masses. In this paper a method is
   described which allows for a prospective evaluation of these backfilling
   materials and the validation of the resulting prognosis by exposure
   measurements. This method has been modified over the years in the wake
   of changes in the legal environment with respect to hazardous substances
   and needs further modification with respect to the novel German concept
   of risk based evaluation values for carcinogenic substances. The method
   is not only suitable for underground workplaces but can well be used for
   the prospective evaluation of workplaces in risk assessment, especially
   where workplaces with large quantities of relatively weakly contaminated
   masses are concerned.}},

Abstract = {{A wide variety of production technologies and the variability of the

   preparation. In preparing the oils in the near future it is appropriate

   which do not require major changes to the equipment and infrastructure
   of the oil production fields. A systematic approach involves
   simultaneous consideration of the studied object as a whole, and its
   constituent parts individually using the principle of differentiation
   and integration of the phenomena. For oil-containing systems those are
   the functions of interphase and intraphase of physical, physicochemical
   and chemical interactions: the structural and group composition, natural
   and forced association and dissociation of these factors, as well as the
   resulting viscosity, interphase tension, heat capacity, density and
   temperatures of phase polymorphic transformation. Initial oil is
   significantly different from the oil extracted in the development and
   exploitation of the deposit. The differences are due to injection into
   the oil-bearing layers a substantial quantity of water having various
   physicochemical and microbiological properties. As a result, the
   oxidative processes in the residual oil are characterized by increasing
   the share of polycyclic fragments and oxidative groups. From this follow
   differences in the quality and structure of reserved and solvation

Abstract = {{Background: Lower airway biomarkers of restored cystic fibrosis
   transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function are limited. We
   hypothesized that fractional excretion of nitric oxide (FENO), typically
   low in CF patients, would demonstrate reproducibility during
   CFTR-independent therapies, and increase during CFTR-specific
   intervention (ivacaftor) in patients with CFTR gating mutations.
   Methods: Repeated FENO and spirometry measurements in children with CF
   (Cohort 1; n = 29) were performed during hospital admission for acute
   pulmonary exacerbations and routine outpatient care. FENO measurements
   before and after one month of ivacaftor treatment (150 mg every 12 h)
   were completed in CF patients with CFTR gating mutations (Cohort 2; n =
   5).
   Results: Cohort 1: Mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 \%
   predicted) at enrollment was 72.3\% (range 25\%-102\%). Mean FENO
   measurements varied minimally over the two inpatient and two outpatient
   measurements (9.8-10.9 ppb). There were no clear changes related to
   treatment of pulmonary exacerbations, gender, genotype or microbiology,
   and weak correlation with inhaled corticosteroid use (P < 0.05). Between
   the two inpatient measurements, FEV1 \% predicted increased by 7.3\% (P
   < 0.03) and FENO did not change. In Cohort 2, mean FENO increased from
   6.6 ppb (SD = 2.19) to 11.8 ppb (SD = 4.97) during ivacaftor treatment.
   Mean sweat chloride dropped by 58 mM and mean FEV1 \% predicted
   increased by 10.2\%.
   Conclusions: Repeated FENO measurements were stable in CF patients,
   whereas FENO increased in all patients with CFTR gating mutations
   treated with ivacaftor. Acute changes in FENO may serve as a biomarker
   of restored CFTR function in the CF lower airway during CFTR modulator
   treatment (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of

Abstract = {{Occupational exposure to hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) compounds is of
   concern in many Cr-related industries and their surrounding environment.
   Cr(VI) is a proven toxin and carcinogen. The Cr(VI) compounds are easily
   absorbed, can diffuse across cell membranes, and have strong oxidative
   potential. Despite intensive studies of Cr(VI) pro-oxidative effects,
   limited data exist on the influence of Cr(VI) on selenoenzymes
   thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-important
   components of antioxidant defense system. This study investigates the
   effect of Cr(VI) exposure on antioxidant defense status, with focus on
   these selenoenzymes, and on trace element homeostasis in an acute
   experiment in rat. Male Wistar rats (130-140g) were assigned to two
   groups of 8 animals: I. control; and II. Cr(VI) treated. The animals in
   Cr(VI) group were administered a single dose of K2Cr2O7 (20 mg /kg,
   intraperitoneally (ip)). The control group received saline solution.
   After 24 h, the animals were sacrificed and the liver and kidneys were
   examined for lipid peroxidation (LP; thiobarbituric acid reactive
   substances (TBARS) concentration), the level of reduced glutathione
   (GSH) and the activities of GPx-1, TrxR-1, and glutathione reductase
   (GR). Samples of tissues were also used to estimate Cr accumulation and
   alterations in zinc, copper, and iron levels. The acute Cr(VI) exposure
   caused an increase in both hepatic and renal LP (by 70\%, p < 0.01 and
   by 15\%, p < 0.05, respectively), increased hepatic GSH level and GPx-1
   activity, and decreased renal GPx-1 activity. The activity of GR was not
   changed. A significant inhibitory effect of Cr(VI) was found on TrxR-1
   activity in both the liver and the kidneys. The ability of Cr(VI) to
   cause TrxR inhibition could contribute to its cytotoxic effects. Further
   investigation of oxidative responses in different in vivo models may
   enable the development of strategies to protect against Cr(VI) oxidative
   damage.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{185-210}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We propose a novel mode of feedback for image search, where a user
   describes which properties of exemplar images should be adjusted in
   order to more closely match his/her mental model of the image sought.
   For example, perusing image results for a query ``black shoes{''}, the
   user might state, ``Show me shoe images like these, but sportier.{''}
   Offline, our approach first learns a set of ranking functions, each of
   which predicts the relative strength of a nameable attribute in an image
   (e.g., sportiness). At query time, the system presents the user with a
   set of exemplar images, and the user relates them to his/her target
   image with comparative statements. Using a series of such constraints in
   the multi-dimensional attribute space, our method iteratively updates
   its relevance function and re-ranks the database of images. To determine
   which exemplar images receive feedback from the user, we present two
   variants of the approach: one where the feedback is user-initiated and
   another where the feedback is actively system-initiated. In either case,
   our approach allows a user to efficiently ``whittle away{''} irrelevant
   portions of the visual feature space, using semantic language to
   precisely communicate her preferences to the system. We demonstrate our
   technique for refining image search for people, products, and scenes,
   and we show that it outperforms traditional binary relevance feedback in
   terms of search speed and accuracy. In addition, the ordinal nature of
   relative attributes helps make our active approach efficient-both
   computationally for the machine when selecting the reference images, and
   for the user by requiring less user interaction than conventional
   passive and active methods.}},

Abstract = {{Although cigarette use by adolescents is declining, emerging tobacco
   products are becoming increasingly popular and youth may use more than
   one type of tobacco product. The purposes of this study were: (1) to
   assess patterns of poly-tobacco use among a representative sample of
   high school students and (2) to determine how beliefs correlate with
   poly-tobacco use. Data came from the 2013 North Carolina Youth Tobacco
   Survey (n = 4092). SAS logistic regression survey procedures were used
   to account for the complex survey design and sampling weights. Among all
   high school students in NC in 2013, 29.7\% reported current any tobacco
   use, with 19.1\% reporting current poly-tobacco use, and 10.6\%
   reporting current use of only one product. Among poly-tobacco users,
   59.3\% reported that one of the products they currently used was
   cigarettes. Positive tobacco product beliefs were found to be
   significantly associated with poly-tobacco use. Communication campaigns,
   policy efforts, and future research are needed for prevention,
   regulation, and control of poly-tobacco use among adolescents, which
   represents a significant public health problem.}},

Abstract = {{We used a combination of in situ TEM. a MEMS-based heater as a substrate
   and a dedicated biasing sample holder to study the temperature
   dependence of electromigration in Pt nanobridges (500 nm wide, 15 nm
   high and 1000 nm long). We visualised changes in the nanobridges under
   both dynamic conditions, i.e. heating (substrate temperatures up to 660
   K) and current passage. Our electromigration experiments at various
   substrate temperatures (100, 300, 420 and 660 K) show the same tendency:
   material transport occurs from the cathode to the anode side, which can
   be explained by the electron-wind force. In all cases the bridge breaks
   due to the formation of a neck closer to the cathode side. At 300, 420
   and 660 K, voids and the neck form at the cathode contact pad
   simultaneously. The higher the temperature, the bigger the voids size.
   As expected, at higher temperatures a lower power is needed to break the
   nanobridge. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{The Eurasiatic Polistes nimpha belongs to primitively eusocial wasps for
   which no data are available on its population's genetic structure and
   relatedness/relationships of individuals. The purpose of this research
   is to determine the amplification efficiency in P. nimpha of
   microsatellite primers developed for P. dominula and using these
   primers, to explore genetic diversity, population structure and
   relatedness/relationship of P. nimpha in the context of its reproductive
   options. Eight out of twelve microsatellite markers analyzed on 59
   individuals (pupae and larvae) were polymorphic (mean PIC = 0.545) and
   mutated following the stepwise mutation model. The Bayesian clustering
   method gave the probability of > 0.898 of there being 10 clusters within
   the pooled sample of 15 nests. In two or three nest clusters, full-
   and/or half-siblings and unrelated individuals occurred. A significant
   correlation between genetic and geographic distances was detected. There
   are three main possibilities that come into play to explain our genetic
   results and direct field observations: cooperative nest foundation,
   visitations, and/or usurpation events. So far there is no conclusive
   evidence to exclude or support any of these possibilities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates potential configuration challenges in the
   development of optimization-based computational re-scheduling support
   for railway traffic networks. The paper presents results from an
   experimental study on how the characteristics of different situations
   influence the problem formulation and the resulting re-scheduling
   solutions. Two alternative objective functions are applied: Minimization
   of the delays at the end stations which exceed 3 min and minimization of
   delays larger than 3 min at intermediary commercial stops and at end
   stations. The study focuses on the congested, single-tracked Iron Ore
   line located in Northern Sweden. A combinatorial optimization model
   adapted to the special restrictions of this line is applied on 20
   different disturbance scenarios and solved using commercial optimization
   software. The resulting re-scheduling solutions are analyzed numerically
   and visually in order to better understand the practical impact of using
   the suggested problem formulations in this context. The results show
   that the two alternative, objective functions result in structurally,
   quite different re-scheduling solutions. All scenarios were solved to
   optimality within 1 min or less, which indicates that commercial solvers
   can handle practical problems of a relevant size for this type of
   setting, but the type of scenario has also a significant impact on the
   computation time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{Microbial species concepts have long been the focus of contentious
   debate, fueled by technological limitations to the genetic resolution of
   species, by the daunting task of investigating phenotypic variation
   among individual microscopic organisms, and by a lack of understanding
   of gene flow in reproductively asexual organisms that are prone to
   promiscuous horizontal gene transfer. Population genomics, the emerging
   approach of analyzing the complete genomes of a multitude of closely
   related organisms, is poised to overcome these limitations by providing
   a window into patterns of genome variation revealing the evolutionary
   processes through which species diverge. This new approach is more than
   just an extension of previous multilocus sequencing technologies, in
   that it provides a comprehensive view of interacting evolutionary
   processes. Here we argue that the application of population genomic
   tools in a rigorous population genetic framework will help to identify
   the processes of microbial speciation and ultimately lead to a general
   species concept based on the unique biology and ecology of
   microorganisms.}},

Abstract = {{Whereas in many fields of surgical pathology examination of cytological
   smears and analysis of histological tissue sections provide alternative
   methods which are chosen according to the clinical requirements, in
   hematopathology both types of morphological investigation are routinely
   applied in parallel and simultaneously. This procedure improves the
   diagnostic precision and safety. Unlike other European countries in
   Germany both procedures are performed by different specialties. Cytology
   is the responsibility of hematologists whereas histology is carried out
   by pathologists, which interferes with an integrative diagnostic
   approach unless intense communication takes place. Ideally, in the
   diagnosis of hematological disorders histology of bone marrow trephines
   should be studied in conjunction with smears of peripheral blood and
   bone marrow. In many instances, further complementary investigations,
   such as flow cytometry, cytogenetics and increasingly molecular
   pathological studies are necessary to guarantee an adequate modern state
   of diagnostics in hematopathology.}},

   dioxide nanoparticles from tetraethoxysilane in helium and argon plasma
   differ insignificantly. Most probably, nanoparticles with the size in
   the interval 100-150 nm are formed in the zone of the discharge
   sustaining, but, as the particles are transported with the gas flow
   beyond the plasma zone, they undergo agglomeration. An increase in the
   nanoparticle size to 100-150 nm, observed when using perforated
   electrodes with an insulating coating, is most probably due to an
   increase in the residence time of the reaction gas medium in the zone of
   the discharge sustaining.}},

Abstract = {{Obtaining lower generalized system of preferences (GSP) tariffs requires
   meeting costly Rules of Origin (ROOs). Growing coffee in the shade is
   more costly, but yields a price premium. This paper analyzes the effects
   of such restrictions in a general equilibrium setting and shows that
   such policies may have unanticipated effects. It is shown that in a
   world with capital mobility, the GSP could result in capital outflows
   rather than inflows and consumer preferences for shade grown coffee end
   up hurting labor in developing countries. Even small subsidies that are
   contingent on the use of domestic intermediates can result in
   specialization in the targeted good. Value added contingent policies can
   easily lead to multiple equilibria despite the absence of externalities
   or market imperfections.}},

   Data System Data}},

Abstract = {{Background: The end-stage renal disease Medical Evidence Report serves
   as a source of comorbid condition data for risk adjustment of quality
   metrics. We sought to compare comorbid condition data in the Medical
   Evidence Report around dialysis therapy initiation with diagnosis codes
   in Medicare claims.
   Study Design: Observational cohort study using US Renal Data System
   data.
   Setting \& Participants: Medicare-enrolled elderly (>= 66 years)
   patients who initiated maintenance dialysis therapy July 1 to December
   31, 2007, 2008, or 2009.
   Index Tests: 12 comorbid conditions ascertained from claims during the 6
   months before dialysis therapy initiation, the Medical Evidence Report,
   and claims during the 3 months after dialysis therapy initiation.
   Reference Test: None.
   Results: Comorbid condition prevalence according to claims before
   dialysis therapy initiation generally exceeded prevalence according to
   the Medical Evidence Report. The kappa statistics for comorbid condition
   designations other than diabetes ranged from 0.06 to 0.43. Discordance
   of designations was associated with age, race, sex, and end-stage renal
   disease Network. During 23,930 patient-years of follow-up from 4 to 12
   months after dialysis therapy initiation (8,930 deaths), designations
   from claims during the 3 months after initiation better discriminated
   risk of death than designations from the Medical Evidence Report (C
   statistics of 0.674 vs 0.616). Between the Medical Evidence Report and
   claims, standardized mortality ratios changed by >10\% for more than
   half the dialysis facilities.
   Limitations: Neither the Medical Evidence Report nor diagnosis codes in
   claims constitute a gold standard of comorbid condition data; results
   may not apply to nonelderly patients or patients without Medicare
   coverage.
   Conclusions: Discordance of comorbid condition designations from the
   Medical Evidence Report and claims around dialysis therapy initiation
   was substantial and significantly associated with patient
   characteristics, including location. These patterns may engender bias in
   risk-adjusted quality metrics. In lieu of the Medical Evidence Report,
   claims during the 3 months after dialysis therapy initiation may
   constitute a useful source of comorbid condition data. (C) 2015 by the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we extend recent research on the spatial measurement of
   segregation and the spatial dynamics of urban crime by conceptualizing,
   measuring, and describing local segregation by race-ethnicity and
   economic status, and examining the linkages of these conditions with
   levels of neighborhood violent and property crime. The analyses are
   based on all 8895 census tracts within a sample of 86 large U.S. cities.
   We fit multilevel models of crime that incorporate measures of local
   segregation. The results reveal that, net of city-level and neighborhood
   characteristics, White-Black local segregation is associated with lower
   violent and property crime. In contrast, local segregation of low income
   from high income households is connected with higher crime, particularly
   neighborhood violence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing availability of soil moisture data presents an
   opportunity for its use in wildfire danger assessments, but research
   regarding the influence of soil moisture on wildfires is scarce. Our
   objective was to identify relationships between soil moisture and
   wildfire size for Oklahoma wildfires during the growing (May-October)
   and dormant seasons (November-April). We hypothesized that soil moisture
   influences wildfire size when vegetation is growing but is less
   important when most vegetation is dead or dormant. Soil moisture, as
   fraction of available water capacity (FAW), and commonly measured
   weather variables were determined for 38,419 wildfires from 2000-2012.
   Wildfires were grouped by size class (<4.05, >= 4.05 and <40.5, >= 40.5
   and <121, >= 121 and <405, and >= 405 ha), and the Kruskal-Wallis test
   with multiple comparisons was used to identify differences in each
   variable between wildfire size classes and seasons. Large fires occurred
   at lower FAW than small fires during both seasons (P < 0.001), but
   growing-season wildfires >= 405 ha occurred over a narrow range of FAW
   (0.05-0.46) whereas dormant-season fires of this size occurred across
   the entire range of FAW (0.05-1.05). For growing-season fires >= 121 ha,
   91\% occurred at FAW <0.5 and 77\% occurred at FAW <0.2. Our finding
   that large growing-season wildfires occurred exclusively under
   conditions of low soil moisture highlights the need to develop methods
   to use soil moisture data in wildfire danger assessments.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{296}},
Pages = {{73-112}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Isogeometric collocation methods have been recently proposed as an
   alternative to standard Galerkin approaches as they provide a
   significant reduction in computational cost for higher-order
   discretizations. In this work, we explore the application of
   isogeometric collocation to large deformation elasticity and frictional
   contact problems. We first derive the non-linear governing equations for
   the elasticity problem with finite deformation kinematics and provide
   details on their consistent linearization. Some numerical examples
   demonstrate the performance of collocation in its basic and enhanced
   versions, differing by the enforcement of Neumann boundary conditions.
   For problems with strong singularities, enhanced collocation is shown to
   outperform basic collocation and to lead to a spatial convergence
   behavior very similar to Galerkin, whereas for weaker or no
   singularities enhanced and basic collocation may give very similar
   results. A large deformation contact formulation is subsequently
   developed and tested in the frictional setting, where collocation
   confirms the excellent performance already obtained for the frictionless
   case. Finally, it is shown that the contact formulation in the
   collocation framework passes the contact patch test to machine precision
   in a three-dimensional setting with arbitrarily inclined non-matching
   discretizations, thus outperforming most of the available contact
   formulations and all those with pointwise enforcement of the contact
   constraints. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Induction of rheumatoid arthritis in rats was accompanied by an increase
   in diene conjugate content and glutathione reductase and glutathione
   peroxidase activities in muscles and blood serum. These changes can be
   related to mobilization of the glutathione reductase/glutathione
   peroxidase system coupled with intensification of free radical
   oxidation. In addition, activity of glucose-6-phosphodehydrogenase and
   NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase increased, which can be related
   to increased demand of NADPH for the glutathione reductase/glutathione
   peroxidase system. The content of reduced glutathione in muscles and
   blood serum decreased, probably, due to its utilization for ROS
   neutralization. Glutathione transferase activity decreased in rheumatoid
   arthritis, which can be related to shortness of reduced glutathione
   developing during oxidative stress. The observed shifts in parameters of
   free radical homeostasis in rheumatoid arthritis are probably associated
   with intensifi cation of free radical oxidation.}},

Abstract = {{Oral mucositis (OM) is a painful complication of radiation therapy (RT)
   for head and neck cancer. OM can compromise nutrition, require opioid
   analgesics and hospitalization for pain control, and lead to
   interruption of treatment. Severe oral mucositis appears inevitable in
   superselective intra-arterial chemotherapy concurrent with radiotherapy
   (SSIACRT), requiring management of OM for the patient. The objective of
   this study was to assess the utility of professional oral health care
   (POHC) for the management of OM in patients undergoing SSIACRT.
   Thirty-three patients were enrolled in this study. The first 17 patients
   underwent SSIACRT before we created an oral management team, and thus
   did not receive POHC. The remaining 16 patients received POHC. Fever
   duration, duration of oral feeding difficulty, opioid usage, duration of
   opioid administration, duration of hospitalization, and number of
   hospital days from the end of irradiation to discharge were compared
   between these two groups.
   Median total dose of morphine during SSIACRT, median number of hospital
   days from end of irradiation to discharge, and duration of
   hospitalization all differed significantly between groups (P < 0.05).
   Duration of opioid administration, fever duration, and duration of oral
   feeding difficulty did not differ significantly between groups.
   These findings indicate that POHC may reduce opioid use and shorten the
   hospital stay. Such results might be obtained through infection control
   by POHC. This report appears to be the first study to evaluate the
   efficiency of POHC in SSIACRT for oral cancer from the perspective of
   mucositis pain and opioid use.}},

Abstract = {{Though L-arginine-containing polymers show versatile biological
   functions, a precisely controlled synthesis of poly(ethylene
   glycol)-b-poly(L-arginine) (PEG-b-PArg) block copolymers has not been
   reported. Here, an effective method for the synthesis of PEG-b-PArg
   block copolymers is developed. In order to obtain PEG-b-PArg, a two-step
   reaction, i.e., synthesis of PEG-b-poly(L-ornithine) is employed,
   followed by guanidinylation with
   N,N'-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine. This
   procedure quantitatively converts amino groups to guanidium groups at
   the side chains of peptide segments under mild conditions. Polyion
   complex (PIC) micelles are prepared by mixing the positively charged
   PEG-b-PArg with negatively charged homo-polyelectrolytes such as
   hyaluronic acid (HA) or chondroitin sulfate C (CS). PIC micelles
   prepared with CS show a higher stability than those prepared with HA,
   probably due to strong interactions between guanidium cations in
   PEG-b-PArg and carboxylate/sulfate in CS. Thus, PIC micelles containing
   PArg are a potentially effective arginine carrier for the development of
   in vivo therapeutic applications for various diseases related to nitric
   oxide, which is generated from inducible nitric oxide synthase in
   macrophages using L-arginine as a substrate.}},

Abstract = {{Large mammalian carnivores create areas perceived as having high and low
   risk by their ungulate prey. Human activities can indirectly shape this
   landscape of fear by altering behavior and spatial distribution of
   carnivores. We studied how red deer perceive the landscape of fear in an
   old-growth forest system (Bialowieza Primeval Forest, Poland) both at
   large and fine spatial scale. Camera traps were placed at locations with
   and without tree logs (fine-scale risk factor) and at different
   distances from the core of a wolf territory and human settlements
   (large-scale risk factor). Red deer avoided coming close to large tree
   logs and increased their vigilance levels when they were present in
   close vicinity. The strength of these effects depended on the distance
   to the wolf core area; deer perceived tree logs as more risky when
   wolves were more often present. Hence, tree logs inside wolf core areas
   create fine-scale patches of fear with reduced deer browsing pressure,
   thereby enhancing chances for successful tree recruitment. Human
   presence shapes this landscape of fear as wolf core areas are located
   far from human settlements. This ``human shadow{''} on predator-prey
   interactions is therefore an important component that should be taken
   into account in human-dominated landscapes.}},

Title = {{Phenotypic Plasticity Conditions the Response of Soybean Seed Yield to

Volume = {{169}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Selection for cultivars with superior responsiveness to elevated
   atmospheric CO2 concentrations (eCO(2)) is a powerful option for
   boosting crop productivity under future eCO(2). However, neither
   criteria for eCO(2) responsiveness nor prescreening methods have been
   established. The purpose of this study was to identify traits
   responsible for eCO(2) responsiveness of soybean (Glycine max). We grew
   12 Japanese and U.S. soybean cultivars that differed in their maturity
   group and determinacy under ambient CO2 and eCO(2) for 2 years in
   temperature gradient chambers. CO2 elevation significantly increased
   seed yield per plant, and the magnitude varied widely among the
   cultivars (from 0\% to 62\%). The yield increase was best explained by
   increased aboveground biomass and pod number per plant. These results
   suggest that the plasticity of pod production under eCO(2) results from
   biomass enhancement, and would therefore be a key factor in the yield
   response to eCO(2), a resource-rich environment. To test this
   hypothesis, we grew the same cultivars at low planting density, a
   resource-rich environment that improved the light and nutrient supplies
   by minimizing competition. Low planting density significantly increased
   seed yield per plant, and the magnitude ranged from 5\% to 105\% among
   the cultivars owing to increased biomass and pod number per plant. The
   yield increase due to low-density planting was significantly positively
   correlated with the eCO(2) response in both years. These results confirm
   our hypothesis and suggest that high plasticity of biomass and pod
   production at a low planting density reveals suitable parameters for
   breeding to maximize soybean yield under eCO(2).}},

Journal = {{BIOCHIMIE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},
Pages = {{26-35}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Resveratrol has been shown to exhibit its anti-cancer effect through a
   variety of mechanisms. Here, TIGAR (TP53-Induced Glycolysis and
   Apoptosis Regulator) was identified as an important target of
   resveratrol for exhibiting ROS-dependent-consequences on apoptosis and
   autophagy. Resveratrol treatment decreased TIGAR protein irrespective of
   cell line used. Down-regulated TIGAR protein triggered a drop in
   reduced-glutathione levels which resulted in sustained ROS, responsible
   for apoptosis and autophagy. Over-expression and silencing experiments
   demonstrated the importance of TIGAR in affecting the ROS-dependent
   anti-cancer effects of resveratrol. Resveratrol treated cells exhibited
   autophagy to escape apoptosis, however, chloroquine treatment along with
   resveratrol, blocked protective autophagy and facilitated apoptosis.
   Collectively, results unravel the effects of resveratrol on TIGAR in
   mediating its ROS dependent influence and suggest a better combination
   therapy of resveratrol and chloroquine for probable cancer treatment.

Abstract = {{This paper deals with a more general class of singularly perturbed
   boundary value problem for a differential-difference equations with
   small shifts. In particular, the numerical study for the problems where
   second order derivative is multiplied by a small parameter epsilon and
   the shifts depend on the small parameter epsilon has been considered.
   The fitted-mesh technique is employed to generate a piecewise-uniform
   mesh, condensed in the neighborhood of the boundary layer. The cubic
   B-spline basis functions with fitted-mesh are considered in the
   procedure which yield a tridiagonal system which can be solved
   efficiently by using any well-known algorithm. The stability and
   parameter-uniform convergence analysis of the proposed method have been
   discussed. The method has been shown to have almost second-order
   parameter-uniform convergence. The effect of small parameters on the
   boundary layer has also been discussed. To demonstrate the performance
   of the proposed scheme, several numerical experiments have been carried
   out.}},

Abstract = {{Particles possess unique properties in the nanoscale, e.g., enhanced
   catalytic activity, high surface area, and light emission/absorption
   properties, that might result in interference with calorimetric in vitro
   cytotoxicity assays such as MTT, XTT or MTS. Alternatively, assays that
   do not use spectrophotometric detection, such as trypan blue exclusion
   or flow cytometry (FC) based assays, are less likely to be influenced by
   nanoparticle interference. The aim of this study was to evaluate FC
   assays to assess the cytotoxicity of three different sizes (10, 100, or
   200 nm) of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) at different mass concentrations
   (1, 25, or 50 ug/ml) in L-929 fibroblast cells. After 4 h and 24 h
   exposure, cell necrosis and apoptosis were assessed using 7-AAD and
   Annexin V dyes, respectively, with FC. The data indicate that cell
   necrosis and apoptosis in AgNP-exposed fibroblasts depends on dose,
   exposure time, and AgNP size. The data indicate that AgNPs produced a
   dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability; however, 10 nm
   AgNPs were significantly more toxic than larger-sized particles. Thus,
   standard FC assays can be utilized to assess apoptosis and necrosis in
   response to nanomaterial exposure. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Integrated hydrogeochemical, isotopic and geomorphological depiction of
   the groundwater salinization in the aquifer system of Delhi, India}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{936-947}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The problem of salinization in the Delhi aquifer, that currently
   exhibits rapid landuse change, is conspicuous and severe. Salinization
   may be caused either by a single process, or a combination of different
   processes; including anthropogenic related activities, water logging and
   evaporative concentration of salts, influx of natural saline water,
   upconing of brines from the deeper parts of the aquifer, and airborne
   salts depositions. However, there is a lack of well-proven theory that
   can explain the salinity of the order of 5000 mu S/cm in the deeper
   aquifers of Delhi. This work identifies inconclusiveness in the previous
   theories of marine ingression, evaporation enrichment and subsequent
   leaching of salt. Further, the study depicts a conceptual understanding
   of the origin of salinity in groundwater based on the integrated
   investigations of groundwater quality, age and stable isotopic
   fingerprinting as well as GIS based mapping of geomorphic features. In
   order to explain the salinity observed in groundwater of NCT Delhi, a
   phenomenological scenario is illustrated and supported by additional
   evidences. The highest average EC value was for the shallow aquifer and
   is strongly symptomatic of anthropogenic influences on groundwater
   chemistry. Piper diagram showed heterogeneous water type and sufficient
   recharge/mixing of the groundwater from different aquifers. The
   relationship between Cl-/Br- ratios vs. Cl- indicated dissolution of
   salt deposits containing evaporative fraction present in the unsaturated
   zones or in the sediments of deeper aquifers and leaching of evaporative
   minerals from dunes of the adjacent Thar Desert. Cl-/SO42- ratio
   suggested the presence of connate seawater, halite dissolution and
   concentration of dissolved salts by evapo-transpiration of river water
   diverted for irrigation. The results show, that the closed inland marine
   conditions developed and buried with the active sedimentation in the
   geological past in this region, and further intensive exploitation of
   groundwater, and enhanced evaporation have together resulted in saline
   playa condition in some part of the region. The scenario was further
   verified by matching the required condition for the formation of salt
   pan or playa with the existing geo-morphological conditions of the area.
   Isotopic results indicate that salinity flushing is possible and
   proceeds in the areas of freshwater recharge. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   A significant decrease in blood glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin and

Abstract = {{Biliary atresia (BA) accounts for most cases of pathologic infantile
   jaundice, which may lead to cirrhosis and eventually necessitate liver
   transplantation (LT). A cardinal histologic feature of BA is ductular
   reaction (DR), reflecting activation of the regenerative compartment in
   liver. We examined the immunohistochemical attributes of the progenitor
   cell population and its immediate descendants in BA patient undergoing
   Kasai procedure (KP) or LT. The EA casei were divided into those
   undergoing KP (n = 24) and thOse undergoing LT (n = 64).
   Immunohistochemistry for CD56, CK7, and CK19 was performed. Patients
   with BA (both KP and LT groups) had more DR than controls (scores 2.4,
   2.2, and 0.1, respectively; P < .001), but the degree of DR did not
   differ between BA patients undergoing KP compared to LT. There was
   significantly more CD56 staining in DR in LT (2.5) versus KP samples
   (1.3; P <.001), with a trend toward the same pattern in hepatocyte
   progenitor cells in these samples (0.6 versus 0.2;P =.05). In
   intermediate hepatocytes, CK7 staining was higher in LT versus KP
   samples (1.7 versus 0.3; P <.001). No differences in CK19 staining were
   noted in the cell types in different BA groups. Immunohistochemistry

Title = {{Improvement in the Prediction of Ventilator Weaning Outcomes by an

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Twenty-five to 40\% of patients pass a spontaneous breathing
   trial (SBT) but fail to wean from mechanical ventilation. There is no
   single appropriate and convenient predictor or method that can help
   clinicians to accurately predict weaning outcomes. This study designed
   an artificial neural network (ANN) model for predicting successful
   extubation in mechanically ventilated patients. METHODS: Ready-to-wean
   subjects (N = 121) hospitalized in medical ICUs were recruited and
   randomly divided into training (n = 76) and test (n = 45) sets. Eight
   variables consisting of age, reasons for intubation, duration of
   mechanical ventilation, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation
   II score, mean inspiratory and expiratory times, mean breathing
   frequency, and mean expiratory tidal volume in a 30-min SBT (pressure
   support ventilation of 5 cmH(2)O and PEEP of 5 cmH(2)O) were selected as
   the ANN input variables. The prediction performance of the ANN model was
   compared with the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), maximum
   inspiratory pressure, RSBI at 1 min (RSBI1) and 30 min (RSBI30) in an
   SBT, and absolute percentage change in RSBI from 1 to 30 min in an SBT
   (Delta RSBI30) using a confusion matrix and receiver operating
   characteristic curves. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curves in the test set of the ANN model was 0.83 (95\% CI
   0.69-0.92, P <.001), which is better than any one of the following
   predictors: 0.66 (95\% CI 0.50-0.80, P = .04) for RSBI, 0.52 (95\% CI
   0.37-0.67, P = .86) for maximum inspiratory pressure, 0.53 (95\% CI
   0.37-0.68, P = .79) for RSBI1, 0.60 (95\% CI 0.44-0.74, P = .34) for
   RSBI30, and 0.51 (95\% CI 0.36-0.66, P = .91) for Delta RSBI30.
   Predicting successful extubation based on the ANN model of the test set
   had a sensitivity of 82\%, a specificity of 73\%, and an accuracy rate
   of 80\%, with an optimal threshold of > 0.5 selected from the training
   set. CONCLUSIONS: The ANN model improved the accuracy of predicting
   successful extubation. By applying it clinically, clinicians can select
   the earliest appropriate weaning time.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent article, Berdahl, Uhlmann, and Bai (2015) reported that
   countries with higher gender equality won more medals at the 2012 and

   take into account the clustering of countries in regions. Here We show
   that controlling for these two factors reduces or even reverses the
   positive relation between gender equality and the number of Olympic
   medals. Gender equality was associated with fewer medals for male

Abstract = {{Hearing fast-tempo music in the background is shown to affect the pace
   of motor behavior. However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon
   remains unclear. We investigated how tempo influences behavioral pace in
   a simple perceptual-motor task in which participants heard background
   sound sequences (30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 bpm) while performing a
   line-tracing task. The order of the tempo conditions (ascending vs.
   descending series of tempo) was manipulated. When sound sequences
   changed from slower to faster tempi (that is, ascending series),
   behavioral pace accelerated. However, the pace did not change in the
   descending series. The subjective arousal level increased under faster
   tempo sounds regardless of tempo series. The results indicated that the
   ongoing tempo of background sounds did not determine the behavioral pace
   directly through increased arousal or perceptual-motor synchronization.
   Not only the ongoing tempo but also the preceding tempo of background
   sounds is shown to be an important factor for behavioral pace change.}},

Abstract = {{Fourier microscopy is becoming an increasingly important tool for the
   analysis of optical nanostructures and quantum emitters. However,
   achieving quantitative Fourier space measurements requires a thorough
   understanding of the impact of aberrations introduced by optical
   microscopes that have been optimized for conventional real-space
   imaging. Here we present a detailed framework for analyzing the
   performance of microscope objectives for several common Fourier imaging
   configurations. To this end, we model objectives from Nikon, Olympus,
   and Zeiss using parameters that were inferred from patent literature and
   confirmed, where possible, by physical disassembly. We then examine the
   aberrations most relevant to Fourier microscopy, including the alignment
   tolerances of apodization factors for different objective classes, the
   effect of magnification on the modulation transfer function, and
   vignetting-induced reductions of the effective numerical aperture for
   wide-field measurements. Based on this analysis, we identify an optimal
   objective class and imaging configuration for Fourier microscopy. In
   addition, the Zemax files for the objectives and setups used in this
   analysis have been made publicly available as a resource for future
   studies. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Isothermal crystallization kinetics was studied for Y3Al5O12 obtained
   from amorphous dispersed phases based on aggregately stable sols of
   yttrium aluminum hydroxides. To describe the formation of yttrium
   aluminum garnet from the amorphous phases, a mathematical model
   involving intermediate Y4Al2O9 and YAlO3 phases has been proposed. From
   the obtained experimental data on the phase composition of the
   crystallizing system, kinetic parameters of the crystallization process
   were determined, which allowed us to propose a probable mechanism of YAG
   crystallization from hydrosols of various composition. The actual
   mechanism of garnet formation depends not just on the temperature
   treatment conditions of the amorphous phase, but also on the type of the
   precursors. The optimization of the time-temperature regimes of YAG
   crystallization allowed preparation of samples with required properties.
   Thus, the sol-gel method involving sols of high stability towards
   aggregation is shown to be promising for the production of high-quality
   powders and optical ceramics of yttrium aluminum garnet. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Models for ignition delay are investigated and fuel-specific properties
   are included to predict the effects of different fuels on the ignition
   delay. These models follow the Arrhenius type expression for the
   ignition delay modified with the oxygen concentration and Cetane number
   to extend the range of validity. In this investigation, two
   fuel-sensitive spray ignition delay models are developed: a global model
   and a local model. The global model is based on the global combustion
   chamber charge properties including temperature, pressure, and
   oxygen/fuel content. The local model is developed to account for
   temporal and spatial variations in properties of separated spray zones
   such as local temperature, oxidizer, and fuel concentrations obtained by
   a quasi-dimensional multizone fuel spray model. These variations are
   integrated in time to predict the ignition delay. Often ignition delay
   models are recalibrated for a specific fuel but in this study, the
   global ignition delay model includes the Cetane number to capture
   ignition delay of various fuels. The local model uses Cetane number and
   local stoichiometric oxygen to fuel molar ratio. The model is therefore
   capable of predicting spray ignition delays for a set of fuels with a
   single calibration. Experimental dataset of spray ignition delay in a
   constant volume chamber is used for model development and calibration.
   The models show a good accuracy for the predicted ignition delay of four
   different fuels: JP8, DF2, n-heptane, and n-dodecane. The investigation
   revealed that the most accurate form of the models is from a calibration
   done for each individual fuel with only a slight decrease in accuracy
   when a single calibration is done for all fuels. The single calibration
   case is the more desirable outcome as it leads to general models that
   cover all the fuels. Of the two proposed models, the local model has a
   slightly better accuracy compared to the global model. Results for both
   models demonstrate the improvements that can be obtained for the
   ignition delay model when additional fuel-specific properties are
   included in the spray ignition model. Other alternative fuels like
   synthetic oxygenated fuels were included in the investigation. These
   fuels behave differently such that the Cetane number does not provide
   the same explanation for the trend in ignition delay. Though of lower
   accuracy, the new models do improve the predictive capability when
   compared with existing types of ignition delay models applied to this
   kind of fuels.}},

   weight, final prosomal width, percentage of individuals molted and mean
   molting time was detected under TBT exposures. While morphological
   abnormalities of the juveniles between TBT treatments and the control
   were statistically indistinguishable, significantly higher occurrences
   of carapace erosion and appendage loss were noted under 0.1 and 1 mg/l
   Cd exposures. Various hemolymph quality indicators, including hemolymph
   plasma protein level, amebocyte viability and percentage of
   granular-spherical state of amebocytes of the juveniles exposed to TBT
   or Cd were significantly lower than the control. Such a decrease in
   hemolymph quality suggested deleterious effects of metal
   contaminant-induced stressors on the health status of the juveniles even
   at low exposure levels (i.e., 0.01 mg/l TBT and 0.1 mg/l Cd). Changes of
   hemolymph parameters in juvenile horseshoe crabs were more sensitive

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to explore an innovative performance model
   for a two-stage sequential production process by combining data
   envelopment analysis (DEA) and back propagation neural network (BPNN).
   Recent literature shows a growing interest on performance modeling of
   two-stage production process using DEA. But, most previous studies on
   the scope of two-stage modeling are still limited to the efficiency
   measurement and also have neglected the progressive direction of
   predictive value and capacity. As an optimization technique, two-stage
   DEA model lacks predictive capacity. Despite an adaptive prediction
   model being a practical necessity, this area has rarely been addressed
   in the previous studies. This paper demonstrates an integrative approach
   to constructive performance modeling of a two-stage sequential
   production process by exploring predictive capacity of BPNN in
   conjunction with DEA. The effectiveness of our jointly integrated
   performance model through this study is empirically supported by its
   practical application to the financial banking operations across large
   U.S. banks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously shown that pluripotent stem cells can be induced from
   adult somatic cells which were exposed to protein extracts isolated from
   mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). Interestingly, generation of induced
   pluripotent stem (iPS) cells depended on the background of ES cell
   lines; possible by extracts from C57, but not from E14. Proteomic
   analysis of two different mES cell lines (C57 and E14) shows that
   embryonic Ras (E-Ras) is expressed differently in two mES cell lines;
   high level of E-Ras only in C57 mESC whose extracts allows iPS cells
   production from somatic cells. Here, we show that E-Ras augments the
   efficiency in reprogramming of fibroblast by promoting cell
   proliferation. We found that over-expression of E-Ras in fibroblast
   increased cell proliferation which was caused by specific up-regulation
   of cyclins D and E, not A or B, leading to the accelerated G1 to S phase
   transition. To figure out the common transcription factor of cyclins D
   and E, we used TRANSFAC database and selected SP1 as a candidate which
   was confirmed as enhancer of cyclins D and E by luciferase promoter
   assay using mutants. As downstream signaling pathways, E-Ras activated
   only c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) but not ERK or p38. Inhibition of
   JNK prevented E-Ras-mediated induction of pSP1, cyclins D, E, and cell
   proliferation. Finally, E-Ras transduction to fibroblast enhanced the
   efficiency of iPS cell generation by 4 factors (Oct4/K1f4/Sox2/C-myc),
   which was prevented by JNK inhibitor. In conclusion, E-Ras stimulates
   JNK, enhances binding of Sp1 on the promoter of cyclins D and E, leading
   to cell proliferation. E-Ras/JNK axis is a critical mechanism to
   generate iPS cells by transduction of 4 factors or by treatment of mESC
   protein extracts. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the introduction of archaeological ethnography as
   an approach to establish positioned research and bring context-specific
   and reflexive considerations into community archaeology projects. It
   considers recent critiques of heritage management in archaeology and the
   role of archaeologists as experts in it, contending that smaller and
   less prominent sites exist in different contexts and pose different
   problems than large-scale projects usually addressed in the literature.
   We describe how the Three Peak Sanctuaries of Central Crete' project,
   investigating prehistoric Minoan ritual sites, involves communities and
   stakeholders and what demands the latter pose on experts in the field.
   Archaeological work is always already implicated in local development
   projects which create and reproduce power hierarchies. It is therefore
   important that archaeologists maintain their critical distance from
   official heritage discourses, as they are materialized in development
   programmes, while at the same time engaging with local expectations and
   power struggles; they also have to critically address and position their
   own assumptions. We use examples from our community archaeology project
   to propose that these goals can be reached through archaeological
   ethnographic fieldwork that should precede any archaeological project to
   inform its methodological decisions, engage stakeholders, and
   collaboratively shape heritage management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a Bayesian clustering procedure based on a Dirichlet process
   prior with cluster specific random effects. Gibbs sampling of a normal
   mixture of linear mixed regressions with a Dirichlet process was
   implemented to calculate posterior probabilities when the number of
   clusters was unknown. Our approach (unlike its counterparts) provides
   simultaneous partitioning and parameter estimation with the computation
   of the classification probabilities. A Monte Carlo study of curve
   estimation results showed that the model was useful for function
   estimation. We find that the proposed Dirichlet process mixture model
   with cluster specific random effects detects clusters sensitively by
   combining vague edges into different clusters. Examples are given to
   show how these models perform on real data.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to develop guidelines for the prevention and

   adverse effects in patients with pulmonary diseases. The guideline
   development committee reviewed the literature on particulate matter,
   ADP, and pulmonary diseases. In adults, exposure to particulate matter
   with a diameter of 10 mu m or less (PM10) induces a decline in lung
   function. PM exposure confers an increased risk of lung cancer, and PM10
   is associated with increased hospital admission and mortality due to
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. ADP exposure is associated with
   increased hospital admission and emergency room visits due to chronic
   obstractive pulmonary disease exacerbation. Idiopathic pulmonary
   fibrosis exacerbation may also be induced by pollution, although the
   evidence for this is very weak. There is no published study on the
   proper prevention or management of the exacerbation of pulmonary
   diseases due to PM or ADP exposure. The preventive use of a facial mask
   with a filter in patients with pulmonary disease should be considered
   carefully because there have been no clinical study of the efficacy and
   adverse effects of masks in pulmonary diseases. The committee created
   guidelines based on a discussion of the peer-reviewed literature. The
   proper management of PM-and ADP-induced exacerbation of pulmonary
   disease and the efficacy of facial mask use should be evaluated in

Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{1-2}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we hypothesize that phosphorus (P) concentrations in
   streams vary seasonally and with streamflow and that it is important to
   incorporate this variation when predicting changes in P loading
   associated with climate change. Our study area includes 14 watersheds
   with a range of land uses throughout the U.S. Great Lakes Basin. We
   develop annual seasonal load-discharge regression models for each
   watershed and apply these models with simulated discharges generated for
   future climate scenarios to simulate future P loading patterns for two
   periods: 2046-2065 and 2081-2100. We utilize output from the Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 downscaled climate change
   projections that are input into the Large Basin Runoff Model to generate
   future discharge scenarios, which are in turn used as inputs to the
   seasonal P load regression models. In almost all cases, the seasonal
   load-discharge models match observed loads better than the annual
   models. Results using the seasonal models show that the concurrence of
   nonlinearity in the load-discharge model and changes in high discharges
   in the spring months leads to the most significant changes in P loading
   for selected tributaries under future climate projections. These results
   emphasize the importance of using seasonal models to understand the
   effects of future climate change on nutrient loads.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructured Fe75Si10B10Nb5 powders were prepared by mechanical

   diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. At early stage, the
   dissolution of B and Si atoms into the Fe lattice leads to the formation
   of bcc Fe(Si,B) solid solution. After milling until 100 h, a mixture of
   Fe(Si,B) (similar to 20 nm) and Nb(B) (similar to 10 nm) is obtained. On
   the other hand, an interesting phenomenon called mechanical
   recrystallization, related to the formation of a crystalline phase of a
   partial amorphous powder (obtained at similar to 56 h), was

Abstract = {{In recent years, particles of iron in higher oxidation states (FeIV-VI),
   commonly called ferrates, have been presented theoretically as very
   effective oxidants. They can potentially be used for elimination of a
   wide range of organic and inorganic contaminants. However, so far the
   majority of applications have been carried out only as laboratory tests
   using model samples in many cases. The application of ferrates in
   remediation programs has so far proved to be more complicated with
   results failing to meet expectations. Therefore there is a necessity to
   consider the suitability of their use or consider their possible
   combination with other agents in order to reach required removal
   efficiencies in remediation. This study is focused on laboratory
   experiments using industrial groundwater leading to the proposal of a
   pilot field application realized as an ex-situ remediation. The
   combination of ferrates with hydrogen peroxide was used in this study in
   order to enhance the removal efficiency during pilot remediation of
   groundwater strongly contaminated by a wide range of organic
   contaminants. This combination has been shown to be very effective.
   During the 24-hour reaction time the majority of detected contaminants
   were removed by approximately 60-80\%. Moreover, the unpleasant odor of
   the water was suppressed and suspended particles were removed by the
   flocculation effect of ferric sludge.}},

Abstract = {{Complete ectopia cordis (EC) is a rare congenital condition where the
   heart is extrathoracic, uncovered by pericardium and skin. This
   condition is often accompanied by intracardiac as well as other
   congenital anomalies. The thoracoabdominal type is frequently associated
   with varying degrees of Pentalogy of Cantrell (POC). Unless addressed
   early post-natally, EC is incompatible with life. Surgery is usually
   staged, with cover of exposed organs an immediate priority, followed by
   repair of structural cardiac lesions. Formal repair of the chest wall is
   performed at a later stage. We present a case of thoracoabdominal EC
   with complete POC. The patient underwent surgery to cover the exposed
   heart and the abdominal wall defect, but demised within 48 h due to
   systemic sepsis. Data gained from a literature survey shows that if the
   congenital heart defect is haemodynamically stable, and if cover is
   achieved immediately after birth, there is an associated improved
   survival. In addition, antenatal diagnosis was found to improve planning
   of delivery, resulting in improved hemodynamic stability, decreased
   incidence of sepsis, shorter time to intervention and better overall
   survival. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the poor thermal conductivity of composites and the material
   heating that occurs during fatigue loading, high temperatures may appear

   The aim of this work is to study heating in fatigue experiments on thick
   laminates. For this purpose fatigue tests on 10, 20 and 30 mm thick
   coupons under different loading conditions are reported. A reduction in
   fatigue life due to internal heating is shown. A finite element model to

   Meanwhile, the validity and feasibility of the discrete element model
   are verified by comparison of load-transfer efficacy between the
   discrete element results and experimental data. Then, a cyclic loading
   in an ideal sinusoidal wave is applied to the surface of a low-filled
   piled embankment, and the analyses of load-transfer efficacy,
   distribution of contact force and embankment settlement are performed in
   detail. Numerical simulation results indicate that the bearing capacity
   of soil arching in a low-filled embankment would be gradually weakening
   firstly under the cyclic loading and reach a steady state finally.
   Specifically, the weakening of soil arching performs as the decreases of
   the load-transfer efficacy in macroscopic and the difference between the
   contact forces upon piles and soil between piles in microscopic.
   Meanwhile, the weakening of soil arching would result in the aggravation
   of differential settlement on embankment surface.}},

Abstract = {{Connecting proteins together in prescribed geometric arrangements is an
   important element in new areas of biomolecular design. In this study, we
   characterize the degree of three-dimensional orientational control that
   can be achieved when two protein domains that have alpha-helical termini
   are joined using an alpha-helical linker. A fusion between naturally
   oligomeric protein domains was designed in this fashion with the intent
   of creating a self-assembling 12-subunit tetrahedral protein cage. While
   the designed fusion protein failed to assemble into a tetrahedral cage
   in high yield, a series of crystal structures showed that the two fused
   components were indeed bridged by an intact alpha helix, although the
   fusion protein was distorted from the intended ideal configuration by
   bending of the helix, ranging from 7 to 35 degrees. That range of
   deviation in orientation creates challenges for designing large,
   perfectly symmetric protein assemblies, although it should offer useful
   outcomes for other less geometrically demanding applications in
   synthetic biology.}},

Abstract = {{Significant structural reforms of public administration are commencing
   in Finland from 2017. Firstly, municipalities and cities are being
   combined into larger entities. Secondly, five social-welfare and
   healthcare regions are to be created, with that level being responsible
   for arranging services in this field. Thirdly, the City of Helsinki is
   outsourcing service provision. This study shows that in current thinking
   on services, the foundations of reform rest with customers and new
   service models. Little consideration has been given to the needs of
   clients or the potential that technology offers for the rationalisation
   of service practices. I consider the key change to involve a transition
   from closed systems to open ones. Open systems are core elements in the
   theory of complex adaptive systems, as discussed below.
   Public organisations are becoming less hierarchical and status-centred;
   they can be seen as relationships that lead to networks, interaction and
   understanding. The way public organisations are developing shows they
   are moving away from hierarchical bureaucracy towards more open,
   network-based and self-directed practices. Information, its
   accessibility and interpretation and the organisation's ability to use
   it have been internal drivers for change within organisations, and these
   are linked to continuous learning. The lower the predictability of
   organisational activities and the greater the uncertainty about
   everything continuing unchanged, the more important it becomes to
   enhance continuous learning, i.e. lifelong learning as an adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the high-risk nature of orthopaedic trauma, there is a dearth of
   data exploring adverse events following these interventions. With the
   current shift towards a reimbursement model grounded on episode-based
   payments, physicians may face financial penalties for higher rates of
   peri-operative complications and subsequent hospitalisations. The
   purpose of this study was thus to assess whether complication rates
   varied by anatomic region of surgery and to subsequently determine the
   pre-operative risk factors that elevated patients' chances of developing
   complications in these regions.
   A total of 50,421 orthopaedic trauma patients treated between 2006 and
   2013 were identified in the American College of Surgeons National
   Surgery Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database. Minor and
   major complications, demographics, surgical variables and pre-operative
   comorbidities were collected. Chi-square analyses identified
   pre-operative differences between the three regions. Multivariate
   regressions identified risk factors that significantly predicted adverse
   events.
   Hip and pelvis (HP) patients were found to be approximately seven times
   more likely to develop a peri-operative complication than upper
   extremity (UE) patients {[}odds ratio (OR) 7.38, 95 \% confidence
   interval (CI) 6.33-8.10, p < 0.001]. In addition, lower extremity (LE)
   patients were found to be almost three times as likely to develop any
   complication compared to UE patients (OR 2.80, 95 \% CI 2.53-3.09, p <
   0.001). Certain risk factors, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease (COPD) and the presence of a bleeding disorder, were
   significantly correlated with the development of all adverse events for
   all anatomic regions (p < 0.001).
   There is a significant difference in complication rates between the
   three cohorts of orthopaedic trauma patients. In addition, the
   predictability of certain risk factors varied between the three regions.
   Level of evidence: prognostic level II.}},

Abstract = {{It has been reported that females are underrepresented in several areas
   of psychological research, which may have significant clinical and
   theoretical implications. No one has reported, however, whether women
   are underrepresented in behavioral gerontology research. To make this
   determination we recorded the gender of participants in behavioral
   gerontology studies published in six journals. In 129 published studies
   that included older adults (i.e. people 55 or more years of age) there
   were a total of 3070 participants, and most (69\%) were female.
   Underrepresentation of men is significant insofar as treatment effects
   are sometimes gender specific, making it inappropriate to generalize
   results from females to males (or vice versa). Moreover,
   underrepresentation of older men suggests that their behavioral needs
   may not be generating the attention they deserve. Copyright (c) 2015

Abstract = {{In this article we argue that there are 2 dominant underlying themes in
   discussions of strategies for dealing with diversity-similarity and
   difference. When we are dealing with social groups, a number of basic
   psychological processes, as well as popular media and research-based
   narratives, make it easier to highlight difference rather than
   similarity. This difference-based approach in research is inherently
   divisive, but the training that we receive as researchers in the field
   of psychology has taken us down this path. As a first step, we propose
   that researchers working in the area of cultural diversity should start
   making explicit attempts to highlight similarities between groups, even
   if such similarities are only based on the absence of observed
   statistical differences. Moreover, if we are going to be serious about
   demonstrating similarity between groups and certain types of universals
   in behavior, we should start embracing new approaches to data analyses
   and consider using statistical procedures that test for equivalence. We
   illustrate these new techniques using our own data. Finally, we argue
   that shifting our primary focus from difference to similarity is a
   worthwhile direction to pursue for successfully managing diversity in
   multicultural societies.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Rotator cuff repair is a common method to treat rotator cuff
   tears; however, retear rates remain high. High-frequency, low-magnitude
   vibration has been demonstrated to promote new bone formation in both
   animal models and in humans.
   Hypothesis: This type of mechanical stimulation applied postoperatively
   will enhance tendon-to-bone healing and reduce postoperative retear
   rates.
   Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
   Methods: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial
   was conducted to investigate the effects of 5 minutes of 80-Hz vibration
   applied daily after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for 6 months on
   postoperative rotator cuff healing. The primary outcome was
   ultrasound-assessed repair integrity at 6 months after repair. Recruited
   patients were randomized into 2 groups: one group received a vibration
   device that oscillated at 80 Hz, and the other group received a placebo
   device.
   Results: The postoperative retear rates of both groups were similar
   (9.1\% {[}5/55] in the vibration group, and 9.3\% {[}5/54] in the
   placebo group) at 6 months as determined by ultrasound imaging.
   Vibration did provide acute pain relief at 6 weeks after surgery (visual
   analog scale {[}VAS] score, 2.24 0.29 cm) compared with placebo (VAS
   score, 3.67 +/- 0.48 cm) (P < .003). Six months after surgery, both
   groups had significant reductions in pain during overhead activities, at
   rest, and during sleep and overall shoulder pain compared with before
   surgery (P < .001). Both the vibration and placebo groups had
   significant increases in shoulder strength with abduction in the
   scapular plane, adduction, liftoff, internal rotation, and external
   rotation 6 months after surgery. Statistical analysis showed that
   vibration was not a contributing factor at improving these parameters in
   these periods.
   Conclusion: High-frequency, low-magnitude vibration did provide acute
   pain relief on application 6 weeks after arthroscopic rotator cuff
   repair surgery. However, vibration did not improve tendon-to-bone
   healing, shoulder range of motion, shoulder strength, or shoulder pain
   with activities, at rest, and at night when compared with placebo.}},

Abstract = {{To reduce the production surplus of grapes in the wine industry and, at
   the same time, to meet the growing demand of nutritious foods by
   health-conscious consumers, alternative processes with better
   sustainability are needed. In the production of colored grape juices for
   direct consumption, the application of heat on crushed grapes is a
   possible technology to increase extraction of anthocyanins and other
   phenolic compounds. To achieve this aim, three different thermal
   treatments were performed on crushed grapes of two different red
   varieties with peonidin or malvidin prevalence in the anthocyanin
   profile. Qualitative and quantitative differences in the chemical
   composition and color characteristics of the juices were evaluated to
   pinpoint the time-temperature combination that allowed the highest
   extraction of anthocyanins. Furthermore, the modification of skin
   mechanical properties during thermal treatment and impact of the
   peonidin/malvidin ratio on juice color were investigated. The use of
   high temperatures for short times was the most profitable
   time-temperature combination based on the extraction efficacy, color
   stability and energetic requirements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The present study evaluates the environmental profile of a PV-green roof
   (PV panels over a soil/plant layer) and other roofing systems
   (PV-bitumen, PV-gravel, gravel, extensive green and intensive green).
   The analysis is based on multiple life-cycle impact assessment
   methodologies (ReCiPe, etc), several scenarios (for example with and
   without recycling) and it provides a deeper analysis as well as
   additional results to authors' previous investigation about PV-green
   roofs. The evaluation of the PV-green system (in terms of material
   manufacturing phase) shows that PV laminates (multi-Si) and steel
   components (joist, decking, balance of system) are responsible for the
   greatest part of the total footprint, based on GWP (global warming
   potential) and ReCiPe. Among the roofs which do not produce electricity,
   material manufacturing phase reveals that intensive green configuration
   has considerably higher impact in comparison with gravel and extensive
   green systems. Concerning PV roofs, PV-green configuration on a
   long-term basis (by considering material manufacturing, use phase,
   transportation and disposal), after a critical point, pays back its
   additional environmental impact (related with the ``green layer{''}) and
   it becomes more eco-friendly than the other two PV roofs. Certainly,
   this is due to the benefits (cooling effect of evapotranspiration, etc)
   of the soil/plant layer which result in PV output increase. The above
   mentioned critical point is determined by means of ReCiPe payback time
   and greenhouse-gas payback time. Several environmental indicators are
   calculated and presented along with results from the literature. A
   critical discussion is also provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{93}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate a new type of marker and a new method of marker
   implantation and to assess interfraction cervix motion for a large
   population of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer by daily
   cone beam computed tomographic (CBCT) imaging.
   Methods and Materials: We investigated the position of markers in 50
   patients treated in prone position during at least 23 fractions. To
   reduce streaking artifacts in the planning CT scan, a new type of
   polymeric marker was used and compared with conventional gold markers.
   In addition, a new method of implantation was used in an attempt to
   reduce marker loss. In each fraction, a CT scan was acquired before dose
   delivery and aligned to the bony anatomy of the planning CT scan,
   simulating the clinical setup protocol. First, sufficient visibility of
   the markers was verified. Then, systematic and random displacement of
   the marker centroids was recorded and analyzed in 3 directions with
   regard to the planning CT and the first CBCT (to evaluate the presence
   of a vaginal catheter in the planning CT). Streaking artifacts were
   quantified with the standard deviation of the mean squared intensity
   difference in a radius around the marker.
   Results: Marker loss was minimal during treatment: in only 3 of the 50
   patients 1 marker was lost. Streaking artifacts for the new markers were
   reduced compared with conventional gold markers. For the planning CT,
   M/Sigma/sigma were 0.4/3.4/2.2 mm, 1.0/5.5/4.5 mm, and -3.9/5.1/3.6 mm
   for the left-right, anterior- posterior, and cranial-caudal directions,
   respectively. With regard to the first CBCT scan, M/Sigma/sigma were
   0.8/2.8/2.1, 0.6/4.4/4.4, and -1.3/4.5/3.6 mm.
   Conclusions: A new type of marker and implantation method was shown to
   have significantly reduced marker loss and streaking artifacts compared
   with gold fiducial markers. The recorded marker displacement confirms
   results reported in the existing literature but for a larger dataset.

Volume = {{118}},
Pages = {{234-243}},

Abstract = {{Nude mice carry a spontaneous mutation affecting the gene Foxn1 mainly
   expressed in the epidermis. This gene is involved in several skin
   functions, especially in the proliferation and the differentiation of
   keratinocytes which are key cells of epithelial barrier. The skin, a
   protective barrier for the body, is essentially composed of lipids.
   Taking into account these factors, we conducted a lipidomic study to
   search for any changes in lipid composition of skin possibly related to
   Foxn1 mutation. Lipids were extracted from skin biopsies of Nude and
   BALB/c mice to be analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to a high
   resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS). Multivariate and univariate data
   analyses were carried out to compare lipid extracts. Identification was
   performed using HRMS data, retention time and mass spectrometry
   fragmentation study. These results indicate that mutation of Foxn1 leads
   to significant modifications in the lipidome in Nude mice skin. An
   increase in cholesterol sulfate, phospholipids, sphingolipids and fatty
   acids associated with a decrease in glycerolipids suggest that the
   lipidome in mice skin is regulated by the Foxn1 gene. 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Biophotovoltaic (BPV) devices employ the photosynthetic activity of
   microalgae or cyanobacteria to harvest light energy and generate
   electrical current directly as a result of the release of electrons from
   the algal cells. NADPH oxidases (NOX) are plasma-membrane enzymes that
   transport electrons from the cytosol to generate extracellular
   superoxide anions, and have been implicated in BPV output. In this
   study, we investigated NOX activity in the diatoms Phaeodactylum
   tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana in an attempt to understand and
   enhance NOX and BPV function. We found that NOX activity was linked to
   defined growth regimes and growth phases, and was light dependent.
   Crucially, current output in a BPV device correlated with NOX activity,
   and levels of up to 14 mu A per 10(6) cells (approximately 500 mA.m(-2))
   were obtained. Expression of two putative P. tricornutum NOX genes
   (PtNOX1 and PtNOX2) was found to correspond with the observed growth
   patterns of superoxide anion production and power output, suggesting
   that these are responsible for the observed patterns of NOX activity.
   Crucially, we demonstrate that NOX activity levels could be enhanced via
   semi-continuous culturing, pointing to the possibility of maintaining
   long-term power output in BPV devices. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{Background: Approximately 0.1-0.2\% of pregnancies are complicated by
   respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilatory support, but few
   data exist to inform clinical management. This study aimed to
   characterize current practice and the effect of delivery on respiratory
   function.
   Methods: A retrospective review was perfoinied of pregnant women who
   received mechanical ventilation for more than 24 h, from four intensive
   care units in institutions with large-volume obstetric units.
   Results: Data were collected from 29 patients with a mean gestation at
   intensive care unit admission of 25.3 +/- 6 weeks. Tidal volumes were
   7.7 +/- 1.7 mL/kg predicted body weight. Estimated respiratory system
   compliance was reduced, but was higher in four patients ventilated for
   neurological conditions without lung disease. Three maternal and three
   neonatal deaths occurred. Ten patients delivered while on ventilatory
   support: one spontaneous delivery, four for obstetric indications and
   five for worsening maternal condition. Following delivery of these 10
   patients, three demonstrated a greater than 50\% decrease in oxygenation
   index and five a greater than 50\% increase in compliance. No
   characteristics identified which patients may benefit from delivery.
   Conclusions: Review of current practice in four centers suggests that
   mechanical ventilation in pregnant patients follows usual guidelines
   applicable to non-pregnant patients. Delivery was associated with modest
   improvement in maternal respiratory function in some patients. Any
   potential benefit of delivery in improving maternal physiology must be
   weighed against the stress of delivery. The risks of premature birth for
   the fetus must be weighed against continued exposure to maternal
   hypoxemia and hypotension. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   and/or occupational rhinitis (OR). The study involves five patients from
   a heat-exchanger production line who were examined (including specific
   inhalation challenge tests) for suspected OA and/or OR caused by a flux
   containing almost 100\% KAIF(4) - with fluorides' workplace air
   concentrations ranging between 1.7 and 2.8 mg/m(3). No subject had a
   previous history of asthma. All five patients had a positive specific
   challenge test (three patients were diagnosed with OA alone, one with OR
   and one with both OR and OA). At the follow-up visit, after three years
   on average, all patients needed permanent corticosteroid therapy (four
   topical, one oral). After elimination from the exposure, only one of the
   observed subjects gave an indication of an improvement, two subjects
   stabilized and two worsened. Our case series focuses on the correlation
   between patients' exposure to fluorides in air-conditioner production
   and the subsequent occurrence of OR/OA. Currently, it is uncertain
   whether these OR/OA were caused by hypersensitivity or irritation.}},

Abstract = {{The ergoline alkaloid fumigaclavine A (FuA) is one of the major
   mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus fumigatus, the main causative fungal
   agent of avian aspergillosis. To study in situ production of FuA,
   post-mortem respiratory tissues of various avian species, as well as
   blood samples of falcons (Falco sp.), were analysed by enzyme
   immunoassay (EIA). At a detection limit of 1.5 ng/ml, FuA EIA positive
   results were obtained for tissue samples from seven (64 \%) out of 11
   birds with confirmed aspergillosis, with a maximum concentration of 38
   ng/g, while all controls (n = 7) were negative. No FuA could be detected
   in blood serum (detection limit 0.7 ng/ml) of 15 falcons, experimentally
   inoculated with A. fumigatus conidia. Fungal mycelium material from
   tissue of clinical aspergillosis cases, cultured on malt extract agar,
   was highly positive in the FuA EIA in milligrams per gram range.
   Chromatographic analysis of mycelium extracts revealed the co-presence
   of FuA and the structurally related fumigaclavine C (FuC). Alkaline
   hydrolysis of FuA and FuC yielded the corresponding deacetylation
   products, FuB and FuE. This is the first report showing that
   fumigaclavine alkaloids are produced by A. fumigatus in situ during the
   course of clinical aspergillosis in birds; however, the role of these
   compounds in the pathogenesis of this disease is still unknown.}},

Abstract = {{Panobinostat is a potent oral deacetylase inhibitor that alters gene
   expression through epigenetic mechanisms and inhibits protein
   degradation. It was recently approved by the FDA and EMA for use in
   combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with multiple
   myeloma who have received >= 2 prior regimens, including bortezomib and
   an immunomodulatory drug. Panobinostat was approved based on results
   from the phase III PANORAMA 1 trial in patients with relapsed or
   relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, which showed that panobinostat
   plus bortezomib and dexamethasone significantly extended progression-
   free survival (median, 12.0 months) compared with placebo plus
   bortezomib and dexamethasone (median, 8.1 months; P < 0.0001).
   Additional ongoing trials are evaluating panobinostat in combination
   with other partners in the relapsed/refractory and newly diagnosed
   treatment settings. This review focuses on panobinostat and its
   mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and clinical data in the

Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Context: Empirical data for treating forward shoulder posture supports
   stretching the anterior shoulder musculature. Although muscle-energy
   techniques (METs) have been hypothesized to lengthen muscle, no data
   have described the usefulness of this technique among swimmers.
   Objective: To determine if an MET provides improvements in resting
   pectoralis minor length (PML), forward scapular position, and scapular
   upward rotation in female collegiate swimmers.
   Design: Controlled laboratory study.
   Setting: Athletic training room.
   Patients or Other Participants: Thirty-nine asymptomatic National
   Collegiate Athletic Association Division I women's swimmers (19
   experimental, 20 control).
   Intervention(s): The experimental group received 2 treatment sessions
   per week for 6 weeks. The control group received no intervention during
   this 6-week period.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): We administered pretest and posttest
   measurements for PML, forward scapular position, and scapular upward
   rotation in positions of rest and 608, 908, and 1208 of humeral
   elevation. The MET consisted of a 3-second stretch in the direction of
   the pectoralis minor fibers, followed by a 5-second isometric horizontal
   adduction contraction at 25\% of maximum force. Immediately after this
   contraction, the entire sequence was repeated with the muscle being
   stretched to the new endpoint. A total of 4 cycles of MET were
   continuously applied per treatment session twice per week for 6 weeks.
   We conducted 1-way analyses of covariance to determine any
   between-groups postintervention test differences.
   Results: The MET group had a greater increase in PML postintervention (P
   =.001, effect size = 1.6) and a greater decrease in forward scapular
   position postintervention (P =.001, effect size = 1.07) compared with
   the control group. No differences were found for scapular upward
   rotation (P>.10).
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that 6 weeks of MET treatments applied
   to the pectoralis minor of asymptomatic female swimmers provided
   improvements in PML and forward scapular position compared with a
   control group.}},

Abstract = {{The molecular details of the formation of the myelin sheath, a
   multilayered membrane in the nervous system, are to a large extent
   unknown. P2 is a peripheral membrane protein from peripheral nervous

   crystallographic studies and complementary experiments have provided
   information on the structure-function relationships in P2. In this
   study, a fully deuterated sample of human P2 was produced. Crystals that
   were large enough for neutron diffraction were grown by a ten-month
   procedure of feeding, and neutron diffraction data were collected to a
   resolution of 2.4 angstrom from a crystal of 0.09 mm(3) in volume. The
   neutron crystal structure will allow the positions of H atoms in P2 and
   its fatty-acid ligand to be visualized, as well as shedding light on the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a time dependent version of the fission matrix
   method called Transient Fission Matrix (TFM) that we developed to
   perform accurate spatial kinetic calculations with a reduced
   computational cost. The matrices are generated once using the Monte
   Carlo neutron transport MCNP prior to the kinetic calculations. This
   article is devoted to the description of this approach with two
   different sets of equations depending on the aimed precision. We tested
   the TFM approach in several instances. In the calculation of the kinetic
   parameters such as beta(eff) and Lambda(eff) on the Flattop and jezebel
   experiments, the results obtained are compatible with adjoint weighted
   calculations performed with the Monte Carlo neutron transport code
   SERPENT. Likewise, our calculated value of the alpha(Rossi) observable
   is also compatible with the experimental measurement. Finally a
   time-space prompt neutron propagation induced by a neutron pulse on
   Flattop has been calculated using the TFM approach and compared to a
   reference time dependent SERPENT calculation. Again, the results
   obtained demonstrate the good characterization of the time-space system
   response by the TFM approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Non-compensated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) leading to death from heart
   failure is rising rapidly in developed countries due to aging
   demographics, and there is a need for informative preclinical models to
   guide the development of effective therapeutic strategies to prevent or
   delay disease onset. In this study, we describe a novel model of heart
   failure based on cardiac-specific deletion of the prototypical mammalian
   BAR adapter-encoding gene Bin1, a modifier of age-associated disease.
   Bin1 deletion during embryonic development causes hypertrophic
   cardiomyopathy and neonatal lethality, but there is little information
   on how Bin1 affects cardiac function in adult animals. Here we report
   that cardiomyocyte-specific loss of Bin1 causes age-associated dilated
   cardiomyopathy (DCM) beginning by 8-10 months of age. Echocardiographic
   analysis showed that Bin1 loss caused a 45\% reduction in ejection
   fraction during aging. Younger animals rapidly developed DCM if cardiac
   pressure overload was created by transverse aortic constriction.
   Heterozygotes exhibited an intermediate phenotype indicating Bin1 is
   haplo-insufficient to sustain normal heart function. Bin1 loss increased
   left ventricle (LV) volume and diameter during aging, but it did not
   alter LV volume or diameter in hearts from heterozygous mice nor did it
   affect LV mass. Bin1 loss increased interstitial fibrosis and
   mislocalization of the voltage-dependent calcium channel Ca(v)1.2, and
   the lipid raft scaffold protein caveolin-3, which normally complexes
   with Bin1 and Ca(v)1.2 in cardiomyocyte membranes. Our findings show how
   cardiac deficiency in Bin1 function causes age- and stress-associated
   heart failure, and they establish a new preclinical model of this
   terminal cardiac disease. J. Cell. Biochem. 116: 2541-2551, 2015. (c)

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Many inferences on the biology, behaviour and ecology of extinct
   vertebrates are based on the reconstruction of the musculature and rely
   considerably on its accuracy. Although the advent of digital
   reconstruction techniques has facilitated the creation and testing of
   musculoskeletal hypotheses in recent years, muscle strain capabilities
   have rarely been considered. Here, a digital modelling approach using
   the freely available visualization and animation software BLENDER is
   applied to estimate cranial muscle length changes and optimal and
   maximal possible gape in different theropod dinosaurs. Models of living
   archosaur taxa (Alligator mississippiensis, Buteo buteo) were used in an
   extant phylogenetically bracketed framework to validate the method.
   Results of this study demonstrate that Tyrannosaurus rex, Allosaurus
   fragilis and Erlikosaurus andrewsi show distinct differences in the
   recruitment of the jaw adductor musculature and resulting gape,
   confirming previous dietary and ecological assumptions. While the
   carnivorous taxa T. rex and Allo. fragilis were capable of a wide gape
   and sustained muscle force, the herbivorous therizinosaurian E. andrewsi
   was constrained to small gape angles.}},

Abstract = {{High quality, reference measurements of chemical and physical properties
   of seawater are of great importance for a wide research community,
   including the need to validate models and attempts to quantify spatial
   and temporal variability. Whereas data precision has been improved by
   technological advances, the data accuracy has improved mainly by the use
   of certified reference materials (CRMs). However, since CRMs are not
   available for all variables, and use of CRMs does not guarantee
   bias-free data, we here present a recently developed Matlab toolbox for
   performing so-called secondary quality control on oceanographic data by
   the use of crossover analysis. This method and how it has been
   implemented in this toolbox is described in detail. This toolbox is
   developed mainly for use by sea-going scientists as a tool for quickly
   assessing possible bias in the measurements that canhopefullybe remedied
   during the expedition, but also for possible post-cruise adjustment of
   data to be consistent with previous measurements in the region. The
   toolbox, and reference data, can be downloaded from the Carbon Dioxide
   Information Analysis Center (CDIAC): .}},

Title = {{N-2 state population in Titan's atmosphere}},
Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{260}},
Pages = {{29-59}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{We present a detailed model for the vibrational population of all non
   pre-dissociating excited electronic states of N-2, as well as for the
   ground and ionic states, in Titan's atmosphere. Our model includes the
   detailed energy deposition calculations presented in the past (Lavvas,
   P. et al. {[}2011]. Icarus 213(1), 233-251) as well as the more recent
   developments in the high resolution N-2 photo-absorption cross sections
   that allow us to calculate photo-excitation rates for different
   vibrational levels of singlet nitrogen states, and provide information
   for their pre-dissociation yields. In addition, we consider the effect
   of collisions and chemical reactions in the population of the different
   states. Our results demonstrate that above 600 km altitude, collisional
   processes are efficient only for a small sub-set of the excited states
   limited to the A and W(v = 0) triplet states, and to a smaller degree to
   the a' singlet state. In addition, we find that a significant population
   of vibrationally excited ground state N-2 survives in Titan's upper
   atmosphere. Our calculations demonstrate that this hot N-2 population
   can improve the agreement between models and observations for the
   emission of the c'(4), state that is significantly affected by resonant
   scattering. Moreover we discuss the potential implications of the
   vibrationally excited population on the ionospheric densities. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Aseptic loosening is the most common cause of prosthesis failure after
   total hip arthroplasty (THA). We measured serum cross-linked
   carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP),
   tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b), dickkopf-1 (dkk-1) and
   sclerostin; and urinary a isomer of C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide
   of type I collagen (alpha CTX-I) to investigate their potential
   diagnostic value detecting aseptic loosening after THA. Biomarkers were
   measured in 24 subjects with aseptic loosening of THA versus 26 control
   subjects without loosening after THA. Serum ICTP in the loose group
   (7.04 ng/mL) was higher than controls (5.15 ng/mL), (p = 0.0007). ROC
   analysis demonstrated that a serum ICTP >5.5 ng/L had a sensitivity of
   91\% and specificity of 69\% for detecting aseptic loosening (area under
   ROC curve = 0.77, p = 0.0001), resulting in a positive predictive value
   (PPV) of 73\% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 90\%. Serum
   TRAP5b in the aseptic loosening group (4.17U/L) was higher than controls
   (3.44 U/L), (p = 0.03). A serum TRAP5b >2.46 U/L had sensitivity of
   100\% and a specificity of 31\% to detect aseptic loosening (AUC 0.67, p
   = 0.031), resulting in a PPV of 57\% and a NPV of 100\%. Serum dkk-1,
   serum sclerostin and urinary aCTX-I were not elevated in subjects with
   aseptic loosening (p>0.05).
   Serum ICTP and TRAP5b show potential utility as screening biomarkers for
   excluding aseptic loosening, because of their ability to discriminate
   individuals without disease. Our finding of elevated ICTP, generated by
   the action of matrix metalloproteinases, suggests a role for this group
   of endopeptidases in aseptic loosening.}},

Abstract = {{A rumen-derived microbial consortium was enriched on raw wheat straw as
   sole carbon source in a sequential batch-reactor (SBR) process under
   strict mesophilic anaerobic conditions. After five cycles of enrichment
   the procedure enabled to select a stable and efficient lignocellulolytic
   microbial consortium, mainly constituted by members of Firmicutes and
   Bacteroidetes phyla. The enriched community, designed rumen-wheat
   straw-derived consortium (RWS) efficiently hydrolyzed lignocellulosic
   biomass, degrading 55.5\% w/w of raw wheat straw over 15 days at 35
   degrees C and accumulating carboxylates as main products. Cellulolytic
   and hemicellulolytic activities, mainly detected on the cell bound
   fraction, were produced in the earlier steps of degradation, their
   production being correlated with the maximal lignocellulose degradation
   rates. Overall, these results demonstrate the potential of RWS to
   convert unpretreated lignocellulosic substrates into useful chemicals.

Abstract = {{The present work is concerned with the shape reconstruction problem of
   isotropic elastic inclusions from far-field data obtained by the
   scattering of a finite number of time-harmonic incident plane waves.
   This paper aims at completing the theoretical framework which is
   necessary for the application of geometric optimization tools to the
   inverse transmission problem in elasto-dynamics. The forward problem is
   reduced to systems of boundary integral equations following the direct
   and indirect methods initially developed for solving acoustic
   transmission problems. We establish the Frechet differentiability of the
   boundary to far-field operator and give a characterization of the first
   Frechet derivative and its adjoint operator. Using these results we
   propose an inverse scattering algorithm based on the iteratively
   regularized Gau beta-Newton method and show numerical experiments in the
   special case of starshaped obstacles.}},

Abstract = {{Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are useful markers for
   phylogenetic studies owing in part to their ubiquity throughout the
   genome and ease of collection. Restriction site associated DNA
   sequencing (RADseq) methods are becoming increasingly popular for SNP
   data collection, but an assessment of the best practises for using these
   data in phylogenetics is lacking. We use computer simulations, and new
   double digest RADseq (ddRADseq) data for the lizard family
   Phrynosomatidae, to investigate the accuracy of RAD loci for
   phylogenetic inference. We compare the two primary ways RAD loci are
   used during phylogenetic analysis, including the analysis of full
   sequences (i.e., SNPs together with invariant sites), or the analysis of
   SNPs on their own after excluding invariant sites. We find that using
   full sequences rather than just SNPs is preferable from the perspectives
   of branch length and topological accuracy, but not of computational
   time. We introduce two new acquisition bias corrections for dealing with
   alignments composed exclusively of SNPs, a conditional likelihood method
   and a reconstituted DNA approach. The conditional likelihood method
   conditions on the presence of variable characters only (the number of
   invariant sites that are unsampled but known to exist is not
   considered), while the reconstituted DNA approach requires the user to
   specify the exact number of unsampled invariant sites prior to the
   analysis. Under simulation, branch length biases increase with the
   amount of missing data for both acquisition bias correction methods, but
   branch length accuracy is much improved in the reconstituted DNA
   approach compared to the conditional likelihood approach. Phylogenetic
   analyses of the empirical data using concatenation or a coalescent-based
   species tree approach provide strong support for many of the accepted
   relationships among phrynosomatid lizards, suggesting that RAD loci
   contain useful phylogenetic signal across a range of divergence times
   despite the presence of missing data. Phylogenetic analysis of RAD loci
   requires careful attention to model assumptions, especially if
   downstream analyses depend on branch lengths.}},

Abstract = {{Growing congestion is a problem faced by cities around the world.
   Traditional solutions considered include new capital works to increase
   network capacity and expanding public transport offerings to make public
   transport more attractive. Dynamic ridesharing is a recent alternative
   in which people with similar travel plans are matched and travel
   together. Dynamic ridesharing requires no new network infrastructure and
   offers more convenience than public transport. The (long-term) success
   of ridesharing schemes, however, depends on their ability to attract a
   large number of users. We investigate the benefits, complexities, and
   costs of employing a small number of dedicated drivers to serve riders
   who would otherwise remain unmatched. An extensive computational study
   demonstrates the potential benefits of dedicated drivers and identifies
   environments in which dedicated drivers are most useful. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background: The characteristics and prognostic value of the variability
   of premature ventricular contraction (PVC) coupling intervals (CIs) for
   cardiac mortality are not yet decisive.
   Methods and Results: In 133 consecutive patients (58 +/- 14 years old,
   53 women) who had left ventricular dysfunction (LVD: ejection fraction
   <50\%) and frequent PVCs (>= 10/h) who underwent 24-h ambulatory
   electrocardiography (AECG) recording and I-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine
   myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography simultaneously,
   the heart rate turbulence onset, slope, and T-wave alternans were
   analyzed from the 24-h AECG. The CI of the PVCs (MEAN(NV)), standard
   deviation of the CI of the PVCs (SDNV) as an index of the variability of
   the PVC CI, and their ratio to the preceding N-N intervals (SDNV/SDNN)
   were calculated from constructed Poincare plots using the annotated 24-h
   AECG QRS data. The primary endpoint was cardiac mortality. The mean
   follow-up period was 63 months. Among 133 patients, 114 survived (group
   1) and 19 (14\%, group 2) died during the follow-up. The MEAN(NV) and
   SDNV were higher in group 2 (539 +/- 104 vs. 599 +/- 114 ms, P=0.021; 64
   +/- 34 vs. 83 +/- 37 ms, P=0.022, respectively). The SDNV, PVC count,
   and delayed heart/mediastinum ratio remained as significant predictors
   of cardiac mortality in the binary logistic regression analysis.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the SDNV could be another
   adjunctive parameter for predicting cardiac mortality in LVD.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a composite frame element for the simulation of the
   inelastic response of structural members made up of two or more
   components with different materials, such as reinforced concrete (RC),
   steel-concrete composite members, prestressed members, and members with
   fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement. The element accounts for
   the relative slip at the interface between the components. Nonlinear
   geometry effects are accounted for through the corotational formulation,
   which permits the response simulation of composite frame elements under
   large displacements. The element formulation enhances the standard
   Hu-Washizu variational principle with fields describing the bond-slip
   behavior between components. Three alternatives for the mixed
   formulation of the element are derived in this paper, which focuses on
   theory and implementation: mixed-displacement, mixed-force, and
   mixed-mixed. The paper presents the benefits and shortcomings of the
   formulation alternatives for modeling the pullout failure of reinforcing
   bars and the fixed-end rotation of RC members and discusses the
   numerical ramifications of each alternative. A companion paper discusses
   the convergence performance of the different mixed formulations and
   validates the proposed element through correlation studies with
   available experimental results. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

   Lyotard's sense of the term. The differend arises from a complex set of
   social, cultural, and legal sources, including patriarchal, colonial,
   and nationalistic constructions of the wrong and its victims. We seek to
   tentatively expose the nature of the differend by identifying these
   factors. We then sketch the beginnings of a possible response, drawing
   on Luce Irigaray's strategy of emphasizing sexual difference and
   separation to pave the way for reciprocality between the sexes. The
   testimonies of the ``comfort women{''} must be allowed to speak for
   themselves before a response can emerge based in other discourses.}},

   vs. 3.7 months, p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that Child-Pugh
   classification, status of intrahepatic tumor, number of metastatic LNs,
   and LN response were independently predictive of OS (p < 0.05 each).
   Based on results of multivariate analysis, patients were prognostically
   stratified according to pretreatment risk factors, including Child-Pugh
   classification, intrahepatic tumor status, and number of metastatic LNs;
   with the expected median OS in patients with a parts per thousand
   yenaEuro parts per thousand 2, 1, and 0 risk factors being 2.9, 9.8, and
   27.6 months, respectively (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion Our data showed that LN response to RT was an independent
   prognostic factor for OS in advanced HCC patients with abdominal LN
   metastases, and suggested that RT for metastatic LNs might improve OS in
   these patients. In addition, our data suggest that Child-Pugh
   classification, intrahepatic tumor status, and number of metastatic LNs
   may be useful prognostic and therapeutic indicators for selecting
   treatment strategies.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the efficacy of prolotherapy for refractory
   rotator cuff disease.
   Design: Retrospective case-control study.
   Setting: University-affiliated tertiary care hospital.
   Participants: Patients with nontraumatic refractory rotator cuff disease
   (N = 151) who were unresponsive to 3 months of aggressive conservative
   treatment. Of the patients, 63 received prolotherapies with 16.5\%
   dextrose 10-ml solution (treatment group), and 63 continued conservative
   treatment (control group).
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Visual analog scale (VAS) score of the average
   shoulder pain level for the past 1 week, Shoulder Pain and Disability
   Index (SPADI) score, isometric strength of the shoulder abductor, active
   range of motion (AROM) of the shoulder, maximal tear size on
   ultrasonography, and number of analgesic ingestions per day.
   Results: Over 1-year follow-up, 57 patients in the treatment group and
   53 in the control group were analyzed. There was no significant
   difference between the 2 groups in age, sex, shoulder dominance,
   duration of symptoms, and ultrasonographic findings at pretreatment. The
   average number of injections in the treatment group is 4.8 +/- 1.3.
   Compared with the control group, VAS score, SPADI score, isometric
   strength of shoulder abductor, and shoulder AROM of flexion, abduction,
   and external rotation showed significant improvement in the treatment
   group. There were no adverse events.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the
   efficacy of prolotherapy in rotator cuff disease. Prolotherapy showed
   improvement in pain, disability, isometric strength, and shoulder AROM
   in patients with refractory chronic rotator cuff disease. The results
   suggest positive outcomes, but one should still take caution in directly
   interpreting it as an effective treatment option, considering the
   limitations of this nonrandomized retrospective study. To show the
   efficacy of prolotherapy, further studies on prospective randomized
   controlled trials will be required. (C) 2015 by the American Congress of

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Maritime safety has become a major concern in Korea. As an alternative
   to improve maritime safety, the Korean government is considering
   enhancing infrastructure associated with maritime safety, in the form of
   a vessel traffic service (VTS) facility for high density waterways. This
   study estimates the public value of a VTS facility construction project
   using the contingent valuation (CV) method. A CV survey using
   person-to-person interviews was administered to 400 randomly selected
   households to elicit their willingness to pay (WTP) for the project.
   Overall, the respondents accepted the contingent market, and on average,
   Korean households were willing to pay a significant amount toward the
   project. The mean WTP for the project is estimated to be approximately
   KRW 4149.5 (USD 3.7) per year per household, which is statistically
   significant. The estimate of the fiduciary benefit to Korean households
   is approximately KRW 11.07 billion (USD 9.91 million) per year for five
   years. The results are expected to be useful for policy-makers in
   determining the economic feasibility of a VTS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: This study investigated whether patients with acute

   overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), as proposed by the
   International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) and the
   Korean Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (KSTH), and analyzed which
   component of the criteria most contributes to bleeding diathesis.
   Methods: A single-center retrospective analysis was conducted on newly
   diagnosed APL patients between January 1995 and May 2012.
   Results: A total of 46 newly diagnosed APL patients were analyzed. Of
   these, 27 patients (58.7\%) showed initial bleeding. The median number
   of points per patient fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of overt DIC by
   the ISTH and the KSTH was 5 (range, 1 to 7) and 3 (range, 1 to 4),
   respectively. At diagnosis of APL, 22 patients (47.8\%) fulfilled the
   overt DIC diagnostic criteria by either the ISTH or KSTH. In
   multivariate analysis of the ISTH or KSTH diagnostic criteria for overt
   DIC, the initial fibrinogen level was the only statistically significant
   factor associated with initial bleeding (p = 0.035), but it was not
   associated with overall survival (OS).
   Conclusions: Initial fibrinogen level is associated with initial
   presentation of bleeding of APL patients, but does not affect OS.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an electrospinning process was used to fabricate
   nanofibrous PAN composite yarn. During the process, PAN spun yarn was
   used as the core of the composite yam to increase the tensile strength
   of the nanofibrous yam, PAN nanofibers were spun and coated onto the
   core surface to form a sheath of the composite yam, so that it could be
   smoothly knitted and so that oxidation and carbonization/activation
   processes could be performed. Fabric knitted from the yarn was used as
   precursor for a activated carbon nanofibrous adsorbent. It was subjected
   to continuous heat treatment to carry out oxidation and
   carbonization/activation processes to examine the characteristics of the
   oxidized knitted fabric and of the adsorbents. The results suggest that
   the fiber diameter and the tensile strength of the yarn decreased after
   the oxidation and carbonization/activation processes. The limited-oxygen
   index of the oxidized fabric reached >40, indicating that it had become
   non-combustible. The tensile strength of the oxidized knitted fabric
   decreased by about 71 \% relative to that of the unoxidized knitted
   fabric. During the carbonization/activation process, the yield of the
   activated carbon nanofibrous adsorbent was similar to 17 \%, and the
   similar to 90 \% decrease in tensile strength did not affect the
   processing. The BET specific surface area of the adsorbent reached
   similar to 1100 m(2)/g, and the diameters of the activated carbon
   nanofibers were about 100-150 nm.}},

   partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), the 62 species
   clustered depending on their phylogenetic family, in particular,
   Aceraceae, Betulaceae, and Fagaceae were distinguished from Rosaceae,
   Fabaceae, and Asteraceae. Quinic acid, gallic acid, quercetin, quercetin

   family-specific metabolites, and were found in relatively high

   determine the correlation between metabolic differences among plant
   families and bioactivities. Quinic acid, quercetin, kaempferol,
   quercetin derivatives, and kaempferol derivatives were found in higher
   concentrations in Fagaceae than in Asteraceae, and were positively

Abstract = {{We design and create a unique cell geometry of templated
   micrometer-thick epitaxial nanocomposite films which contain similar to
   20 nm diameter yttria-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) nanocolumns, strain coupled
   to a SrTiO3 matrix. The ionic conductivity of these nanocolumns is
   enhanced by over 2 orders of magnitude compared to plain YSZ films.
   Concomitant with the higher ionic conduction is the finding that the YSZ
   nanocolumns in the films have much higher crystallinity and orientation,
   compared to plain YSZ films. Hence, ``oxygen migration highways{''} are
   formed in the desired out-of-plane direction. This improved structure is
   shown to originate from the epitaxial coupling of the YSZ nanocolumns to
   the SrTiO3 film matrix and from nucleation of the YSZ nanocolumns on an
   intermediate nanocomposite base layer of highly aligned Sm-doped CeO2
   nanocolumns within the SrTiO3 matrix. This intermediate layer reduces
   the lattice mismatch between the YSZ nanocolumns and the substrate.
   Vertical ionic conduction values as high as 10(-2) Omega(-1) cm(-1) were
   demonstrated at 360 degrees C (300 degrees C lower than plain YSZ
   films), showing the strong practical potential of these nanostructured
   films for use in much lower operation temperature ionic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we investigate the size effect of perpendicular-anisotropic

   nanoparticles. A sputtering system in conjunction with the postannealing
   process is employed to prepare the sheet film and standard lithography
   techniques followed by the ion etching technique are used to fabricate
   the micrometer to submicrometer MTJ devices. A strong ferromagnetic
   coupling is observed as we reduce the size of the device to
   submicrometer scale, which is due to the reduction of magnetostatic
   energy of the device. Furthermore, a magnetoresistance (MR) oscillation
   is observed at room temperature while reducing the size of the device.
   MR peaks at low bias fields are believed to have magnon contributions,
   whereas the peaks observed at higher bias fields are responsible for
   phonon-assisted tunneling. Zero-bias anomalies are also observed and are
   more prominent in antiparallel states of the devices.}},

Abstract = {{For the development of medicinal products animal models are still
   indispensable to demonstrate efficacy and safety prior to first use in
   humans. Advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP), which include
   cell-based medicinal products (CBMP), differ in their pharmacology and
   toxicology compared to conventional pharmaceuticals, and thus, require
   an adapted regime for non-clinical development. Developers are,
   therefore, challenged to develop particular individual concepts and to
   reconcile these with regulatory agencies. Guidelines issued by the
   European Medicines Agency (EMA), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
   (FDA) and other sources can provide direction.
   The published approaches for non-clinical testing of efficacy document
   that homologous animal models where the therapeutic effect is
   investigated in a disease-relevant animal model utilizing cells derived
   from the same species are commonly used. The challenge is that the
   selected model should reflect the human disease in all critical features
   and that the cells should be comparable to the investigated human
   medicinal product in terms of quality and biological activity. This is
   not achievable in all cases. In these cases, alternative methods may
   provide supplemental information. To demonstrate the scientific
   proof-of-concept (PoC), small animal models such as mice or rats are
   preferred. During the subsequent product development phase, large animal
   models (i.e. sheep, minipigs, dogs) must be considered, as they may
   better reflect the anatomical or physiological situation in humans. In
   addition to efficacy, those models may also be suitable to prove some
   safety aspects of ATMP (e.g. regarding dose finding, local tolerance, or
   undesired interactions and effects of the administered cells in the
   target tissue). In contrast, for evaluation of the two prominent
   endpoints for characterizing the safety of ATMP (i.e. biodistribution,
   tumorigenicity) heterologous small animal models, especially
   immunodeficient mouse strains, are favourable due to their tolerance to
   the human cell therapy product. The execution of non-clinical studies
   under the principles of good laboratory practice (GLP) increases the
   acceptance of the results by authorities and the scientific community.}},

Abstract = {{To realize a more accurate evaluation for elliptical profile error,
   based on the minimum zone geometry optimization approach method, an
   algorithm for evaluating elliptical profile error is presented. Firstly,
   based on the least squares method, a reference ellipse and a pair of
   initial reference points are determined, taking the pair of reference
   points as reference points, auxiliary focuses is established and
   auxiliary ellipses are constructed by using the auxiliary focuses.
   Secondly, the elliptical profile errors are calculated, when the
   reference ellipse and the auxiliary ellipses as supposed ideal ellipses.
   Through comparing, judging and changing the reference points,
   constructing new auxiliary points and auxiliary ellipses, forming new
   assumed ideal ellipses, the minimum zone evaluation for elliptical
   profile error is realized finally by using the iterative approximation
   method. The process and the steps of solving elliptical profile error
   are described in detail, the mathematical formulas are given. Which
   shows this algorithm can not only get the results accurately but also
   stably. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of Fatty Acid Synthase in Prostate Cancer Recurrence: SUV of
   {[}C-11] Acetate PET as a Prognostic Marker}},

Abstract = {{AIM. High levels of fatty acid synthase have shown to correlate with the
   aggressiveness of prostate cancer. As {[}C-11] acetate exhibits a close
   correlation with the level of fatty acid synthase, we aimed to assess
   whether the SUV in {[}C-11] acetate PET serves as a suitable prognostic
   marker in patients with recurrent prostate cancer.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. In 123 consecutive patients, examined between
   2010 and 2014, the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of local
   recurrences as well as lymph node and bone metastases was measured.
   Choosing the spleen as a standard for relatively high physiological
   uptake, a ratio of tumor to spleen uptake (SUVts) was calculated for
   standardizing the uptake, too. The corresponding initial Gleason scores
   (GS) and serum-PSA levels around the time of the performed PET/CT for
   each patient were retrospectively collected and PSA doubling together
   with PSA velocity were determined. For further analysis patients were
   divided with regard to their initial Gleason score (<= 3+4 and >= 4+3).
   The median of PSA velocity was calculated to separate patients with a
   high and low PSA velocity and Mann-Whitney U or Student's t-test were
   used, testing for significant differences. For correlation Spearmen-Rho
   test was used.
   RESULTS. PET was positive for recurrence in 82/123 patients. PSA was
   significantly higher in PET-positive than in negative patients (5.9 vs.
   3.2 ng/ml; P = 0.006). Initial Gleason score did not differ in PET
   negative and positive patients (P = 0.3), whereas PSA velocity was
   markedly higher in PET positive patients (0.4 vs. 0.1 ng/ml/month; P =
   0.01). Median SUVmax of PET positive patients was 5.23 (mean 5.78; range
   0.9-16.8) and meadian SUVts was 0.78 (mean 0.84, range 0.14-2.50). SUVts
   was significantly higher in patients with high PSA velocity (SUVts 0.76
   vs. 0.92; P = 0.009), whereas SUVmax failed statistical significance
   (5.4 vs. 6.3 ng/ml/month; P = 0.08). Patients with a high SUVmax proved
   to have a significantly higher median Gleason score compared to low
   uptake 8.0 vs. 7.0; P = 0.004). Vice versa both SUVmax (GS 6: 5.0; GS 7:
   5.6; GS 8: 5.7; GS 9: 6.5; r = 0.30, P = 0.008) and SUVts (GS 6: 0.63;
   GS 7: 0.68; GS 8: 0.85; GS 9: 0.89; r = 0.30, P = 0.006) significantly
   correlated with Gleason score. Patients with a Gleason score <= 3+4 had
   a significantly lower SUVmax (4.8 vs. 5.7; P = 0.02) and SUVts (0.67 vs.
   0.85; P = 0.02) as compared to a Gleason score >= 4+3.
   CONCLUSION. {[}C-11] acetate uptake demonstrated to correlate with
   initial Gleason score. Furthermore, patients with a high PSA velocity
   proved to have higher {[}C-11] acetate uptake in tumor lesions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Assessing environmental risk is useful for preventing adverse effects on
   human health in highly polluted cities. We design a criterion for
   environmental monitoring based on an attribute control chart for the
   number of dangerous contaminant levels when the concentration to be
   monitored follows a Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. This distribution is
   being widely applied to environmental data. We provide a novel
   justification for its usage in environmental sciences. The control
   coefficient and the minimum inspection concentration for the designed
   criterion are determined to yield the specified in-control average run
   length, whereas the out-of-control case is obtained according to a shift
   in the target mean. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the
   proposed criterion, which reports its performance to provide earlier
   alerts of out-of-control processes. An application with real-world
   environmental data is carried out to validate its coherence with what is
   reported by the health authority. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The effect of glycosylation on protein structure and function depends on
   a variety of intrinsic factors including glycan chain length. We have
   analyzed the effect of distal sugar and interglycosidic linkage of
   disaccharides on the properties of proline-rich antimicrobial
   glycopeptides, formaecin I and drosocin. Their glycosylated
   analogs-bearing lactose, maltose and cellobiose, as a glycan side chain
   on their conserved threonine residue, were synthesized where these
   disaccharides possess identical proximal sugar and vary in the nature of
   distal sugar and/or interglycosidic linkage. The structural and
   functional properties of these disaccharide-containing formaecin I and
   drosocin analogs were compared with their corresponding monoglycosylated
   forms, -d-glucosyl-formaecin I and -d-glucosyl-drosocin, respectively.
   We observed neither major secondary structural alterations studied by
   circular dichroism nor substantial differences in the toxicity with
   mammalian cells among all of these analogs. The comparative analyses of
   antibacterial activities of these analogs of formaecin I and drosocin
   displayed that -d-maltosyl-formaecin I and -d-maltosyl-drosocin were
   more potent than that of respective -d-Glc-analog, -d-cellobiosyl-analog
   and -d-lactosyl-analog. Despite the differences in their antibacterial
   activity, all the analogs exhibited comparable binding affinity to DnaK
   that has been reported as one of the targets for proline-rich class of
   antibacterial peptides. The comparative-quantitative internalization
   studies of differentially active analogs revealed the differences in
   their uptake into bacterial cells. Our results exhibit that the sugar
   chain length as well as interglycosidic linkage of disaccharide may
   influence the antibacterial activity of glycosylated analogs of
   proline-rich antimicrobial peptides and the magnitude of variation in
   antibacterial activity depends on the peptide sequence. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Coupled Euler-Lagrange simulations are performed for a subcritically
   operated model rocket combustor at 10 bar pressure (MASCOTTE A-10 test
   case). A Lagrangian spray model is used to simulate the liquid phase.
   This liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen single element combustor experiment
   has been the focus of many numerical studies. In contrast to previous
   investigations, time-accurate unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
   simulations are performed. A good spatial resolution is achieved by
   using a fifth-order multidimensional limiting process scheme to
   discretize the inviscid fluxes. Instead of assuming axisymmetry, the
   three-dimensional geometry of the rectangular combustor is taken into
   account. However, only a quarter of the combustor is simulated, to limit
   the computational cost. Presented results indicate that
   three-dimensional effects are important, questioning the assumption of
   axisymmetry. A second important finding is that time-averaged unsteady
   Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes results agree much better with
   experimental data than those of a comparable steady-state simulation.
   Close to the injector, results show a strong unsteadiness of the
   turbulent flame, which has been observed in the experiment, too.
   Finally, pressure fluctuations are monitored at several positions in the
   combustor and analyzed by fast Fourier transform. The peak amplitudes in
   the pressure spectra could successfully be assigned to the first
   longitudinal acoustic mode and its higher harmonics.}},

Abstract = {{Determining and accurately restoring the flexion-extension axis of the
   elbow is essential for functional recovery after total elbow
   arthroplasty (TEA). We evaluated the effect of morphological features of
   the elbow on variations of alignment of the components at TEA.
   Morphological and positioning variables were compared by systematic CT
   scans of 22 elbows in 21 patients after TEA.
   There were five men and 16 women, and the mean age was 63 years (38 to
   80). The mean follow-up was 22 months (11 to 44).
   The anterior offset and version of the humeral components were
   significantly affected by the anterior angulation of the humerus (p =
   0.052 and p = 0.004, respectively). The anterior offset and version of
   the ulnar components were strongly significantly affected by the
   anterior angulation of the ulna (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001).
   The closer the anterior angulation of the ulna was to the joint, the
   lower the ulnar anterior offset (p = 0.030) and version of the ulnar
   component (p = 0.010). The distance from the joint to the varus
   angulation also affected the lateral offset of the ulnar component (p =
   0.046).
   Anatomical variations at the distal humerus and proximal ulna affect the
   alignment of the components at TEA. This is explained by abutment of the
   stems of the components and is particularly severe when there are
   substantial deformities or the deformities are close to the joint.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the cosmological behavior in a universe governed by time
   asymfietric extensions of general relativity, which is a novel modified
   gravity based on the addition of new, time-asymmetric, terms on the
   Hamiltonian framework, in a way that the algebra of constraints and
   local physics remain unchanged. Nevertheless, at cosmological scales
   these new terms can have significant effects that can alter the universe
   evolution, both at early and late times, and the freedom in the choice
   of the involved amdification function makes the scenario able to produce
   a huge class of cosmological behaviors. For basicc ansatzes of
   modification, we perform a detailed dynamical analysis, extracting the
   stable late-time solutions. Amongst others, we find that the universe
   can result in dark-energy dominated, accelerating solutions, even in the
   absence of an explicit cosmological constant, in which the dark energy
   can be quintessence-like, phantom-like, or behave as an effective
   cosmological constant. Moreover, it can result to matter-domination, or
   to a Big Rip, or experience the sequence from matter to dark energy
   domination. Additionally, in the case of closed curvature, the universe
   may experience a cosmological bounce or turnaround, or even cyclic
   behavior. Finally, these scenarios can easily satisfy the observational
   and phenomenological requirements. Hence, time asymmetric cosmology can
   be a good candidate for the description of the universe.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of
   hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on fetal preterm delivery and intrauterine
   growth restriction (IUGR) in a cohort of pregnant women with systemic
   lupus erythematosus (SLE).
   Methods Over an 11-year period (January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2011),
   all women with SLE and admitted to deliver after 22 weeks of gestation
   to Bordeaux University Hospital (France), were retrospectively enrolled
   in the present study. The population was then split into two groups
   based on the treatment they received: HCQ exposed (HCQ+) versus HCQ
   non-exposed (HCQ-) group.
   Results 118 pregnancies were included, 41 in the HCQ+ group and 77 in
   the HCQ- group. The rate of adverse fetal outcome was significantly
   lower in the HCQ+ group (p=0.001), particularly in terms of preterm
   delivery, 15.8 \% versus 44.2 \% (p=0.006), and IUGR, 10.5 \% versus
   28.6 \% (p=0.03). No adverse outcomes were reported in the HCQ+ group.
   Conclusion HCQ reduces neonatal morbidity in women with SLE by
   significantly decreasing the rate of prematurity and intrauterine growth
   restriction.}},

   Effects on yield and water use efficiency}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{161}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Effective and adapted criteria for irrigation scheduling are required to
   improve yield and water use efficiency (WOE) and reduce the
   environmental impacts associated with water and nutrients losses by
   runoff and leaching. In this study, field-scale experiments were
   conducted at four commercial strawberry production sites with
   contrasting soil and climatic conditions. Within each site, the
   influence of different soil matric potential-based irrigation thresholds
   (IT) on yield and WUE was evaluated. Matric potential-based irrigation
   management was also compared with common irrigation practices used by
   producers in each site's respective areas. At Site 1 (silty clay loam;
   humid continental (Dfb) climate), an IT of -15 kPa improved yields by
   6.2\% without any additional use of water relative to common irrigation
   practices. At Site 2, with similar soil and climatic conditions, the
   irrigation treatments did not affect yield and the matric
   potential-based management decreased WOE relative to common practices.
   However, the results suggested that maintaining the soil matric
   potential lower than -9 kPa could induce stressing conditions for the
   plants. At Site 3 (sandy loam; Mediterranean (Cs) climate), the best
   yield and WOE were obtained with an IT of -8 kPa and suggested that WOE
   could be further improved by implementing high-frequency irrigation. At
   Site 4 (clay loam; Mediterranean (Cs) climate), results suggested that
   an IT between -10 and -15 kPa could optimize yield and WOE, and matric
   potential-based irrigation considerably reduced leaching under the root
   zone relative to common practices. Considering the results from all
   sites, an IT of -10 kPa appears to be adequate as a starting point for
   further optimizing irrigation under most field conditions. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Detecting a brief silent interval (i.e., a gap) is more difficult when
   listeners perceive two concurrent sounds rather than one in a sound
   containing a mistuned harmonic in otherwise in-tune harmonics. This
   impairment in gap detection may reflect the interaction of low-level
   encoding or the division of attention between two sound objects, both of
   which could interfere with signal detection. To distinguish between
   these two alternatives, we compared ERPs during active and passive
   listening with complex harmonic tones that could include a gap, a
   mistuned harmonic, both features, or neither. During active listening,
   participants indicated whether they heard a gap irrespective of
   mistuning. During passive listening, participants watched a subtitled
   muted movie of their choice while the same sounds were presented. Gap
   detection was impaired when the complex sounds included a mistuned
   harmonic that popped out as a separate object. The ERP analysis revealed
   an early gap-related activity that was little affected by mistuning
   during the active or passive listening condition. However, during active
   listening, there was a marked decrease in the late positive wave that
   was thought to index attention and response-related processes. These
   results suggest that the limitation in detecting the gap is related to
   attentional processing, possibly divided attention induced by the
   concurrent sound objects, rather than deficits in preattentional sensory
   encoding.}},

Abstract = {{Up to 10\% of cystic fibrosis (CF) children develop cirrhosis by the
   first decade. We evaluated the utility of two simple biomarkers,
   aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) and FIB-4, in
   predicting degree of fibrosis in pediatric CF liver disease (CFLD)
   validated by liver biopsy. In this retrospective, cross-sectional study,
   67 children with CFLD had dual-pass liver biopsies and 104 age- and
   sex-matched CF children without liver disease (CFnoLD) had serum to
   calculate APRI and FIB-4 collected at enrollment. CFLD was defined as
   having two of the following: (1) hepatomegaly +/- splenomegaly; (2) >6
   months elevation of ALT (>1.5x upper limit of normal ULN); or (3)
   abnormal liver ultrasound findings. Biopsies were staged according to
   Metavir classification by two blinded pathologists. Receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) analysis and continuation ratio logistic regression
   were performed to assess the predictability of these biomarkers to
   distinguish CFLD from CFnoLD and determine fibrosis stage-specific
   cut-off values. The AUC for APRI was better than FIB-4 (0.75 vs. 0.60; P
   = 0.005) for predicting CFLD and severe CFLD (F3-F4) (0.81). An APRI
   score >0.264 demonstrated a sensitivity (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]) of 73.1\% (60.9, 83.2) and specificity of 70.2\% (60.4, 78.8) in
   predicting CFLD. A 50\% increase in APRI was associated with a 2.4-fold
   (95\% CI: 1.7, 3.3) increased odds of having CFLD. APRI demonstrated
   full agreement with histology staging 37\% of the time, but was within
   one stage 73\% of the time. Only FIB-4 predicted portal hypertension at
   diagnosis (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve {[}AUC]
   = 0.91; P < 0.001). Conclusion: This is the first liver biopsy-validated
   study of APRI and FIB-4 in pediatric CFLD. APRI appears superior to
   FIB-4 in differentiating CFLD versus CFnoLD. APRI also exhibited a high
   AUC in predicting severe liver fibrosis with specific cutoffs for lower
   stages. (Hepatology 2015;62:1576-1583)}},

Abstract = {{The experimental investigation of chloride ion oxidation under the
   action of ozone and ultraviolet radiation with wavelength 254 nm in the
   bulk of acid aqueous solution at pH 0-2 has been performed. Processes of
   chloride oxidation in these conditions are the same as the chemical
   reactions in the system O-3 - OH - Cl-(aq). Despite its importance in
   the environment and for ozone-based water treatment, this reaction
   system has not been previously investigated in the bulk solution. The
   end products are chlorate ion ClO3 (-) and molecular chlorine Cl-2. The
   ions of trivalent iron have been shown to be catalysts of Cl- oxidation.
   The dependencies of the products formation rates on the concentrations
   of O-3 and H+ have been studied. The chemical mechanism of Cl- oxidation
   and Cl-2 emission and ClO3 (-) formation has been proposed. According to
   the mechanism, the dominant primary process of chloride oxidation
   represents the complex interaction with hydroxyl radical OH with the
   formation of Cl-2 (-) anion-radical intermediate. OH radical is
   generated on ozone photolysis in aqueous solution. The key subsequent
   processes are the reactions Cl-2 (-) + O-3 -> aEuro parts per thousand
   ClO + O-2 + Cl- and ClO + H2O2 -> aEuro parts per thousand HOCl + HO2.
   Until the present time, they have not been taken into consideration on
   mechanistic description and modelling of Cl- oxidation. The final
   products are formed via the reactions 2ClO -> aEuro parts per thousand
   Cl2O2, Cl2O2 + H2O -> aEuro parts per thousand 2H(+) + Cl- + ClO3 (-)
   and HOCl + H+ + Cl- a double dagger{''} H2O + Cl-2. Some portion of
   chloride is oxidized directly by O-3 molecule with the formation of
   molecular chlorine in the end.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The consumption of energy drinks is a growing health-risk
   behavior for young men in the United States. The present study
   investigated the relationship between masculinity ideology, outcome
   expectations, energy drink use, and sleep disturbances. Method: The
   authors recruited 467 adult males from universities and the Internet who
   provided data on their endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology,
   outcome expectations for use of energy drinks, use of energy drinks, and
   sleep disturbances. A theoretical model positing moderated mediation was
   tested using structural equation modeling and conditional process
   modeling. Results: The results supported the hypothesized model in which
   endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology was linked with
   increased outcome expectations for benefits of energy drinks, which in
   turn was linked with increased energy drink consumption, and which
   finally was linked with greater sleep disturbance symptoms. The
   relationship between masculinity ideology and energy drink outcome
   expectations was moderated by age (significant for younger men but not
   for older men), and the relationship between energy drink outcome
   expectations and energy drink use was moderated by race (significant for
   White men but not for racial minority men). Conclusion: The present
   study adds to the literature on potential negative health implications
   of the endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology by offering a
   link between predictors of energy drink use (masculinity ideology,
   outcome expectations) and health outcomes of energy drink use (e.g.,
   sleep disturbance).}},

Abstract = {{This article describes thermal risk assessment of vegetable oil
   epoxidation by peroxycarboxylic acid. It is a liquid-liquid system where
   several exothermic reactions occur. Acetic acid was used as the
   carboxylic acid, and oleic acid was chosen as a model molecule because
   it is a common fatty acid in the triglyceride molecule. Differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC) and accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC) were
   used to determine safety criteria such as the final temperature (T
   (Final)), T (D24,) and time to maximum rate under adiabatic condition
   (TMRad). We found that the calculation of TMRad based on DSC data could
   be incorrect when assuming a zero-order kinetic reaction. By using a
   process temperature of 70 A degrees C, the extrapolated final
   temperature was found to be 544 A degrees C from DSC experiments, T
   (D24) was estimated to 20 A degrees C based on ARC experiment, and TMRad
   was calculated to 164 min from ARC experiments. These criteria indicate
   the process can lead to a thermal runaway. Therefore, we recommend that
   vegetable oil epoxidation by peroxycarboxylic acid should not be
   performed in batch reactor, but in semi-batch mode.}},

Abstract = {{The presence and biological significance of vertebrate-related steroid
   sex hormones in aquatic invertebrates are poorly understood. We compared
   the concentrations of estrogen (17 beta-estradiol) and testosterone
   between amplexing male and female freshwater amphipods of three species
   from two continents: Gammarus duebeni celticus Liljeborg, 1852 and G.
   pulex (L., 1758) from Europe, and G. pseudolimnaeus Bousfield, 1958 from
   North America. All three species were found to have measureable
   concentrations of both hormones in whole body lysate samples but the
   concentrations differed between species, with testosterone differing
   significantly between species only for male amphipods and estradiol
   differing significantly between species only for female amphipods.
   Concentrations of both testosterone and estrogen differed between males
   and females in two of the three species (G. duebeni celticus and G.
   pseudolimnaeus). Females had the highest concentration of both hormones
   in G. duebeni celticus and the lowest concentration of both hormones in
   G. pseudolimnaeus. These results contribute to a growing body of
   evidence that these hormones are endogenously produced and biologically
   relevant in amphipods. Such evidence is particularly important in light
   of increasing prevalence of endocrine-disrupting compounds in the
   environment and the central role played by amphipods in aquatic
   ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Texture descriptions of lunar surface derived from LOLA data:
   Kilometer-scale roughness and entropy maps}},
Journal = {{PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{The lunar global texture maps of roughness and entropy are derived at
   kilometer scales from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) data obtained by
   Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) aboard on Lunar Reconnaissance
   Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft. We use statistical moments of a gray-level
   histogram of elevations in a neighborhood to compute the roughness and
   entropy value. Our texture descriptors measurements are shown in global
   maps at multi-sized square neighborhoods, whose length of side is 3, 5,
   10, 20, 40 and 80 pixels, respectively. We found that large-scale
   topographical changes can only be displayed in maps with longer side of
   neighborhood, but the small scale global texture maps are more
   disorderly and unsystematic because of more complicated textures'
   details. Then, the frequency curves of texture maps are made out, whose
   shapes and distributions are changing as the spatial scales increases.
   Entropy frequency curve with minimum 3-pixel scale has large
   fluctuations and six peaks. According to this entropy curve we can
   classify lunar surface into maria, highlands, different parts of craters
   preliminarily. The most obvious textures in the middle-scale roughness
   and entropy maps are the two typical morphological units, smooth maria
   and rough highlands. For the impact crater, its roughness and entropy
   value are characterized by a multiple-ring structure obviously, and its
   different parts have different texture results. In the last, we made a
   2D scatter plot between the two texture results of typical lunar maria
   and highlands. There are two clusters with largest dot density which are
   corresponded to the lunar highlands and maria separately. In the lunar
   mare regions (cluster A), there is a high correlation between roughness
   and entropy, but in the highlands (Cluster B), the entropy shows little
   change. This could be subjected to different geological processes of
   maria and highlands forming different landforms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{181-189}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Given the importance of the watershed protection plans, direct
   determination of phosphorus (P) mineralization rates in advanced
   wastewater treatment facility effluents is crucial for developing the
   most protective strategies minimiz eutrophication in receiving surface
   waters. In this study, algal bioassays were used to determine the uptake
   rate of dissolved P in effluents from a broad range of advanced nutrient
   removal technologies (e.g., membrane biological reactor, traditional
   biological, tertiary membrane, Blue PRO (TM), etc.). Dissolved P uptake
   kinetics were fit to a gamma model and three first-order decay models. A
   traditional one-pool model correlated poorly with the experimental data
   (i.e., r(2) = 0.73 +/- 0.09), whereas two-pool model and three-pool
   models performed much better (i.e., r(2) > 0.9). These models also
   provided strong evidence for the existence of recalcitrant P in the
   effluents from these tertiary facilities. The Gamma model showed the
   mineralization of organic P followed a reactive continuum and further
   suggested the partitioning of P loads with different bioavailability
   levels should be accounted for the future modeling practices. From a
   modeling perspective, the Gamma model should be considered to be the
   theoretically best model as it gave the most parsimonious fit to the
   data using the fewest terms. Our study suggested that the current Total
   Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) model could be easily modified with the
   updated mineralization kinetics, which should lead to both ecological
   and economic benefits. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{60-64}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This essay identifies two basic themes, human nature and the means-ends
   relationship, that can both advance philosophical reflection on
   technology and potentially serve as a basis for East-West collaboration
   in philosophy. What is central to the philosophy of technology and
   engineering are questions of how technical activity is related to human
   nature, both as founded in human nature and contributing to its
   realization. In the history of human thought, there have been a number
   of theses about human nature - the human being is a rational animal, a
   tool making and using animal, and a symbol making and using animal -
   that can have different implications for such questions. There are
   nevertheless possibilities for synthesis of different theories that
   point toward the importance of thinking about technology in terms of the
   means - ends relationship and the experience of a disharmony in the
   relationship that has been called alienation. From the perspective of
   the means - ends relationship, some suggestions are considered for
   dealing with different forms of alienation. A final suggestion is that
   some traditions of Chinese philosophy may contribute to advancing
   efforts to understand human nature and to deal with disharmonies in the
   means-ends relationship. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Deficiency in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or bone
   morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) results in fracture non-unions. Therefore,
   it is indispensable to comprehend the combined effect of VEGF and BMPs
   on the osteogenic differentiation of osteoprogenitor mesenchymal stem
   cells (MSCs) that are either naturally occurring at the fracture repair
   site or exogenously added to enhance the bone repair. We found that the
   combination of VEGF and BMP-6 enhanced COL1A2 expression, which
   correlated with upregulated expression of osterix, Dlx5, and Msx2 in
   human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs). Cross-talk between VEGF and
   BMP-6 pathways upregulated activation of p38 mitogen-activated kinase
   (p38 MAPK) and inhibited activation of protein kinase B (PKB, also known
   as Akt), whereas phosphorylation of mothers against decapentaplegic
   homologs 1/5/8 (Smads 1/5/8) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases
   1 and 2 (ERK 1/2) was not affected. Consistent with these findings, p38
   inhibitor SB203580, or siRNA knockdown of osterix, abrogated crosstalk
   between the VEGF and BMP-6 pathways and significantly reduced the
   observed upregulation of COL1A2. Nuclear translocation of the
   phosphorylated form of osterix was also inhibited by SB203580. Although
   crosstalk between the VEGF-BMP-6 pathways did not show an effect on the
   extent of mineralization, inhibition of any one of the three components
   that were upregulated through the cross-talk, i.e., osterix, Dlx5, and
   p38 activation, led to a complete inhibition of mineralization.
   Inhibition of PKB/Akt activation, which is attenuated through the
   cross-talk, significantly enhanced ALP gene expression. These
   observations imply that crosstalk between the VEGF and BMP-6 signaling
   pathways enhances osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. J. Cell. Physiol.

Abstract = {{The frequency-weighted-exponential (FWE) function was designed to fit
   various asymmetric amplitude spectra by two parameters: symmetry index
   and bandwidth factor. A relation can be built between the FWE function
   and the Q-factor of media. When a source wavelet propagates in
   attenuating media, the FWE function is used to fit the amplitude spectra
   of the source and attenuated wavelet to obtain the symmetry indexes and
   bandwidth factors. After recalculating the bandwidth factors based on
   the average of the symmetry indexes, the Q-factor can be estimated by
   the decrease in the bandwidth factor between the source and attenuated
   wavelet. Compared with the existing commonly used methods, this method
   applies to various source wavelet types, and it has better tolerance to
   random noise. On this basis, we further evaluated an approach to invert
   the interval Q-factor from seismic reflection data. We used the FWE
   function to fit the local spectral contents of the interval seismic
   reflection data to obtain the symmetry indexes and bandwidth factors.
   After recalculating the bandwidth factors with the average of the
   symmetry indexes, the reciprocal of the bandwidth factor versus
   traveltime was linearly fit, and then the Q-factor can be calculated
   from the slope. This approach has high accuracy without having to
   correct for the tuning effect when the attenuation is high. It is
   suitable for different types of synthetic seismic traces and also
   produces good results in a field-data case study.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the rapid growth of computer networks and service providing
   servers, many network environments have been becoming multi-server
   architecture and various multi-server authentication protocols have been
   proposed. In such an environment, a user can obtain different network
   services from multiple network servers without repeating registration to
   each server. Recently, Li et al. proposed a secure dynamic ID based
   authentication protocol for multi-server architecture using smart cards.
   They claimed that their protocol preserves mutual authentication and
   protected from several attacks. However, in this paper, we find that Li
   et al.'s protocol cannot provide the protection against leak-of-verifier
   attack, impersonation attack, session key disclosure attack and many
   logged-in users' attack. To remedy these security flaws, we propose an
   improved version of dynamic ID based authentication protocol, which
   covers all the identified weaknesses of Li et al.'s protocol and is more
   secure and efficient for practical multi-server environments.}},

   nanoflakes/nanorods are successfully assembled on nickel foam by a
   one-step hydrothermal method. The as-obtained Co(OH)(2)/Ni foam
   composites exhibit multidirectional structures with tertiary nanorods
   (0.5-1.2 mu m in length, 25-40 nm in diameter) growing on the secondary
   nanoflakes (10 mu m in diameter) and forming a highly dense film on the
   Ni foam. The composites display superior supercapacitor performance with
   high specific capacitance (1350 F g(-1) and 10.4 F cm(-2) at 30 mA
   cm(-2)) and excellent rate capability, suggesting its promising
   application as an efficient electrode for electrochemical capacitors.

Abstract = {{The influence of eccentricity ratio on the behaviour of 50 parallel
   bamboo strand lumber (PBSL) column specimens was studied under eccentric
   compression. The load-strain and load-deflection relationships were
   obtained from column tests, and the detailed failure modes for all
   specimens are reported. The eccentricity ratio is the main influencing
   factor on the bearing capacity of the columns, and the ultimate load
   values decreased with an increase of the eccentricity ratio. Both the
   ultimate middle deflection values and the absolute ultimate longitudinal
   strain values initially increased with the increase of the eccentricity
   ratio, and then stabilized or decreased slightly when the eccentricity
   ratio was bigger than approximately 0.8. The absolute ultimate lateral
   strain values for both face A (bracket side or compression side) and
   face C (tension side) performed similarly with the increasing of
   eccentricity ratios, increasing initially and then stabilizing or
   decreasing slowly. An equation for calculating the eccentricity
   influencing coefficient of PBSL columns is proposed. The calculation
   results obtained from the equations agreed well with the test results.}},

Abstract = {{Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a member of Picornaviridae, causes severe
   neurological and systemic illness in children. To better understand the
   virus-host cell interactions, we performed a triple-SILAC-based
   quantitative proteomics study monitoring host cell proteome changes
   after EV71 infection. Based on the quantitative data for more than 4100
   proteins, similar to 17\% of the proteins were found as significantly
   changed (p<0.01) at either 8 or 20 hours post infection. Five biological
   processes and seven protein classes showed significant differences.
   Functional screening of nine regulated proteins discovered the
   regulatory role of CHCH2, a mitochondrial protein known as a
   transcriptional activator for cytochrome c oxidase, in EV71 replication.
   Further studies showed that CHCH2 served as a negative regulator of
   innate immune responses. All MS data have been deposited in the
   ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD002483

Abstract = {{The biological and chemical sensors play an important role in human
   disease diagnosis, treatment and life safety and other industrial areas.
   Owing to the characteristic of high sensitivity to external environment,
   compactness and easy integration, nanowires (NWs) possess potential
   application in biochemical sensors and have achieved measurement for a
   variety of physical, chemical and biological variables with a high
   precision and resolution in recent years. Typically, the sensitivity and
   resolution of the NWs sensors depend on their geometric morphology; the
   selective detection technology for the characteristic variables depends
   on the specific function particle, substituent, and substrate. The
   single NWs perform more stably, yet hard to manipulate; the muti-NVVs
   integrated sensor can be manufactured easier, however, its poor
   reproducibility needs further improvement. In this paper, the
   development and characteristics of NWs sensors will be reviewed for
   various materials, such as polymer, metal oxide and semiconductor. (C)

Abstract = {{Meiosis marks the transition from the sporophyte to the gametophyte
   generation in the life cycle of flowering plants, and creates genetic
   variations through homologous recombination. In most flowering plants,
   meiosis is highly synchronized within each anther, which is significant
   for efficient fertilization. To date, little is known about the
   molecular mechanisms of entry into meiosis and exit from it, and only a
   few genes in Arabidopsis have been characterized with a role in
   regulating meiotic progression. In this study, we report the functional
   characterization of a plant-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
   protein, FEHLSTART (FST), a defect in which leads to premature meiotic
   entry and asynchronous meiosis, and results in decreased seed yield.
   Investigation of the time course of meiosis showed that the onset of
   leptotene, the first stage of prophase I, frequently occurred earlier in
   fst-1 than in the wild type. Asynchronous meiosis followed, which could
   manifest in the disruption of regular spindle structures and symmetric
   cell divisions in fst-1 mutants during the meiosis I/II transition. In
   accordance with frequently accelerated meiotic entry,
   whole-transcriptome analysis of fst-1 anthers undergoing meiosis
   revealed that 19 circadian rhythm genes were affected and 47
   pollen-related genes were prematurely expressed at a higher level. Taken
   together, we propose that FST is required for normal meiotic entry and
   the establishment of meiotic synchrony.}},

Abstract = {{With recent advances in wireless networks, communication-based train
   control (CBTC) has become a popular approach to ensure the safe and
   efficient operation of railway trains. The requirements for train-ground
   communication in CBTC systems are stringent. Most existing works about
   train-ground communication systems consider the infrastructure mode
   without train-train direct communications. Due to unreliable wireless
   communications and frequent handovers, existing CBTC systems can
   severely affect train control efficiency and performance, as well as the
   utility of railway. In this paper, with recent advances in cooperative
   and cognitive wireless networks, we propose a CBTC system to enable
   train-train direct communications. In addition, the proposed cooperative
   and cognitive CBTC system is optimized with the cognitive control
   method. Unlike the exiting works on cooperative and cognitive wireless
   networks, in this paper, train control performance in CBTC systems is
   explicitly used as the performance measure in the design. Reinforcement
   learning is applied to obtain the optimal handover decision and adaption
   policy of communication parameters. Simulation result shows that the
   performance of train control can be improved significantly in our
   proposed cooperative and cognitive CBTC system.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving coal usage by low-carbon ways through clean technologies could
   be one of the possible ways to meet the rapid growth of China's energy
   demand, and also mitigate the environmental deterioration. This paper
   first presented the important role of coal in China's energy system and
   the environmental issues caused by coal consumption, and then analyzed
   the development status of clean coal technologies (CCTs) in China. Then,
   a structural VAR model is adopted to assess the impacts of coal price,
   R\&D activities and GDP/emissions shocks on CCTs. The results indicate
   that the unexpected coal price shock and R\&D shock could increase the
   ratio of clean coal patents to energy patents in short term, while a
   GDP/emissions shock has an opposite effect. However, these effects are
   not long lasting. Finally, suggestions about coal price and government
   funds for R\&D activities are given so as to promote development of CCTs
   in China.}},

Abstract = {{Lauric acid coated iron oxide nanoparticles (LAIONPs) is very promising
   in biomedical applications. Understanding the influences from synthesis
   processes on physiochemical properties of LAIONPs is very important for
   their implementations in in vivo and in vitro studies. Here, the
   superparamagnetic spherical-shaped LAIONPs samples have been prepared
   based on coprecipitation method (CP-LAIONPs) and through thermal
   decomposition using FeO(OH) as iron precursor (TD-LAIONPs),
   respectively. The effects of different stirring speeds in
   coprecipitation reaction and different heating profiles in thermal
   decomposition route on the products properties (including size, mass
   ratio of surfactants, and saturation magnetization) were revealed. For
   nanoparticles with similar cores sizes (similar to 11 nm) obtained from
   two different synthesis methods, the TD-LAIONPs showed more spherical
   morphologies, narrower size distributions in both core sizes and
   hydrodynamic sizes, and stronger magnetic properties than the
   CP-LAIONPs. In addition, ferromagnetic cubic-shaped LAIONPs with sizes
   larger than 50 nm could be obtained using another iron precursor in
   thermal decomposition route. Thus, the synthesis methods and fabrication
   conditions should be appropriately chosen to obtain LAIONPs with
   desirable properties for specific purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Cemented paste backfill (CPB) is gaining popularity in many underground
   mines worldwide. Sufficient water is added into CPB to make a flowable
   material for pipe transportation. Barricades are built near the
   drawpoints to prevent in-rush of the fill slurry. To avoid barricade
   failures resulting from excessive backfill pressures, backfilling is
   typically performed with a plug pour followed by a final pour. The
   interval between the two pours should be shortened or removed to
   increase mining productivity and avoid pipe clogging. Recently, Li
   proposed to apply wick drains in backfilled stopes to promote drainage
   and consolidation. The preliminary simulations by considering an
   instantaneous filling indicated that the drainage of CPB can be
   significantly accelerated by using wick drains. Barricade was not
   considered. Here, some new numerical modellings are presented with more
   representative filling sequences, stope geometry, and different draining
   configurations. The results illustrate that the stope can be backfilled
   continuously by using wick drains. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Microbial activity is one of the most important processes to mediate the
   flux of organic carbon from the ocean surface to the seafloor. However,
   little is known about the microorganisms that underpin this key step of
   the global carbon cycle in the deep oceans. Here we present genomic and
   transcriptomic evidence that five ubiquitous archaeal groups actively
   use proteins, carbohydrates, fatty acids and lipids as sources of carbon
   and energy at depths ranging from 800 to 4,950m in hydrothermal vent
   plumes and pelagic background seawater across three different ocean
   basins. Genome-enabled metabolic reconstructions and gene expression
   patterns show that these marine archaea are motile heterotrophs with
   extensive mechanisms for scavenging organic matter. Our results shed
   light on the ecological and physiological properties of ubiquitous
   marine archaea and highlight their versatile metabolic strategies in
   deep oceans that might play a critical role in global carbon cycling.}},

Title = {{De novo production of resveratrol from glucose or ethanol by engineered
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae}},
Journal = {{METABOLIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Resveratrol is a natural antioxidant compound, used as food supplement
   and cosmetic ingredient. Microbial production of resveratrol has until
   now been achieved by supplementation of expensive substrates, p-coumaric
   acid or aromatic amino acids. Here we engineered the yeast Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae to produce resveratrol directly from glucose or ethanol via
   tyrosine intermediate. First we introduced the biosynthetic pathway,
   consisting of tyrosine ammonia-lyase from Herpetosiphon aurantiacus,
   4-coumaryl-CoA ligase from Arabidopsis thaliana and resveratrol synthase
   from Vitis vinifera, and obtained 2.73 +/- 0.05 mg L-1 resveratrol from
   glucose. Then we over-expressed feedback-insensitive alleles of ARO4
   encoding 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate and ARO7 encoding
   chorismate mutase, resulting in production of 4.85 +/- 0.31 mg L-1
   resveratrol from glucose as the sole carbon source. Next we improved the
   supply of the precursor malonyl-CoA by over-expressing a
   post-translational deregulated version of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase
   encoding gene ACC1; this strategy further increased resveratrol
   production to 6.39 +/- 0.03 mg L-1. Subsequently, we improved the strain
   by performing multiple-integration of pathway genes resulting in
   resveratrol production of 235.57 +/- 7.00 mg L-1. Finally, fed-batch
   fermentation of the final strain with glucose or ethanol as carbon
   source resulted in a resveratrol titer of 415.65 and 531.41 mg L-1,
   respectively. (C) 2015 International Metabolic Engineering Society

Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{108}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the nonlinear dynamic behavior of a towed
   underwater beam with two supported ends. The equation of motion is
   derived by the Newtonian approach. An ``axial added mass coefficient{''}
   is taken into account to get a better approximation for the mass of
   fluid attached to beams. Nonlinear deflection-dependent axial forces are
   also considered. The dynamics of the system is studied via Galerkin
   approach and Runge-Kutta technique. The linear dynamic analysis is
   conducted firstly. The solution for natural frequency is obtained and
   the result shows that the beam will subject to buckling-type instability
   if the moving speed exceeds a certain value. Then, the buckled
   configuration is obtained and its stability is discussed in the
   nonlinear dynamic analysis. It is found that the subcritical Hopf
   bifurcation of the first buckled mode may occur when the towing speed
   reaches to a critical value. In addition, the nonlinear dynamic
   responses are calculated and the periodic-1, period-3, period-5,
   quasi-periodic and chaotic motions are detected. Meanwhile, the result
   shows the route to chaos for the beam is via period-3 motions or
   quasi-periodic motions. The effects of several system parameters on the
   chaotic motion are also studied. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Al-MoSexOy (un-doped and Al-doped MoSexOy) films are prepared by radio
   frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, and influence of the Al doping
   contents on the structure, composition and optical properties of the
   Al-MoSexOy films has been studied. We find that the amount of the Al can
   modulate the Mo4+/Mo5+/Mo6+ composition ratios and tune the optical band
   gap of the Al-MoSexOy film. The concentrations of the higher molybdenum
   oxidation states (Mo5+, Mo6+) increase, and the value of the band gap
   increase from 1.86 to 2.90 eV with the increment of the Al doping
   contents. Back-gated field effect transistors (FETs) have been
   fabricated and investigated by utilizing the sputtered Al-MoSexOy film
   channel. The incorporation of the Al makes the ambipolar FET device
   based on un-doped MoSexOy channel into p-type FET. P-type conductive FET
   based on 5.2\% Al-MoSexOy channel has the highest field-effect mobility

Abstract = {{In this paper, the stability, stabilization and L-2-gain problems are
   investigated for periodic piecewise linear systems, in which not all
   subsystems are Hurwitz. First, some sufficient and necessary conditions
   for the exponential stability are established. By employing a
   discontinuous Lyapunov function with time-varying Lyapunov matrix,
   stabilization and L-2-gain conditions of periodic piecewise linear
   systems are proposed by allowing the corresponding Lyapunov function to
   be possibly non-monotonically decreasing over a period. A state-feedback
   periodic piecewise controller is developed to stabilize the system, and
   the corresponding algorithm is proposed to compute the controller gain.
   The L-2-gain criteria with continuous time-varying Lyapunov matrix and
   piecewise constant Lyapunov matrices are studied as well. Numerical
   examples are given to show the validity of the proposed techniques. (C)

Abstract = {{Excessive sympathetic activity propels the pathogenesis and progression
   of organ damage in hypertension. Enhanced cardiac sympathetic afferent
   reflex (CSAR) is involved in sympathetic activation in hypertension.
   Given the important role of the renin-angiotensin (Ang) system in
   regulating sympathetic outflow and cardiovascular activity, the present
   study aimed to investigate the roles of Ang-(1-7) in Ang II-induced CSAR
   and the sympathetic activation responses in the rostral ventrolateral
   medulla (RVLM) of hypertensive rats. The two-kidney one-clip (2K1C)
   method was used to induce renovascular hypertension. Responses of renal
   sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) to
   epicardial application of capsaicin were used to evaluate the CSAR in
   sinoaortic-denervated and cervical-vagotomized rats with anesthesia.
   Both Ang II and Ang(1-7) in the RVLM caused greater increases in RSNA
   and MAP in 2K1C rats than in sham-operated (sham) rats and enhanced CSAR
   independently. RVLM pretreatment with Ang-(1-7) dose dependently
   augmented the effects of Ang 11011 RSNA, MAP, and CSAR in 2K1C rats. Mas
   receptor antagonist A-779 in the RVLM exhibited more powerful inhibitory
   effects on RSNA, MAP, and CSAR than the Ang II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor
   antagonist losartan. The expression of both the AT(1) receptor and Mas
   receptor proteins in the RVLM increased, but neither the Ang II nor
   Ang-(1-7) levels in the RVLM changed significantly in the 2K1C rats
   compared with the sham rats. These results indicate that Ang-(1-7) in
   the RVLM enhances the CSAR and sympathetic output not only by itself but
   also through enhancing the effects of Ang II in renovascular
   hypertensive rats. Both endogenous Ang-(1-7) and Ang 11 in the RVLM
   contribute to the enhanced CSAR and sympathetic activation in
   renovascular hypertension. (C) 2015 American Society of Hypertension.

Abstract = {{To reveal the toxicity of multiple heavy metals from Pb-Zn tailing sands
   on soil microorganisms relating to soil organic C metabolic activity, 33
   soil samples from different karst land use types (paddy field, corn
   field and citrus field) in Sidi village, Yangshuo, Guangxi, Southwest
   China were collected. The total concentrations of Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd, and
   diethylene triamine pentacetate acid (DTPA)-extractable Zn, Cu and Cd in
   the paddy field are higher than those in the corn and citrus field,
   which indicates that this area should not be used as farmland anymore
   according to the environmental quality evaluation standards for farmland
   of edible agricultural products of China (HJ/T332-2006). Due to the
   toxicity of multiple heavy metals from Pb-Zn tailing sands on soil
   microorganisms, the soil bacteria, actinomyces and fungi populations,
   soil microbial biomass C and N, and soil microbial quotient in the paddy
   field is lower than that in the corn and citrus field; however, soil
   organic C and total nitrogen (TN) in the paddy field are significantly
   higher than those in the citrus and corn field (p < 0.05). Though C-3
   and C-4 plants appear in the citrus field and corn field, respectively,
   the data of soil microorganisms, soil microbial biomass C and N, soil
   microbial quotient, soil organic C and TN have no significant difference
   in the citrus and corn fields (p > 0.05), which indicates that the above
   results have no relation to plant photosynthesis. The carbon source
   utilization of microbial samples using Biolog EcoPlate assay shows that
   the average well color development, Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'
   and E), Simpson index (D) and McIntosh index (U) in the paddy field are
   significantly lower than those in the citrus and corn fields (p < 0.05).
   Our results revealed that soil microorganisms under the effect of toxic
   heavy metals from Pb-Zn tailing sands can decrease the mineralization
   rate of soil organic C, which in turn produces the accumulation of soil
   organic C in the severe Pb-Zn tailing sand-contaminated area.}},

Abstract = {{Tor is a popular low-latency anonymous communication system which could
   provide anonymity and anti-censorship. Based on previous researches on
   de-anonymization of Tor, this paper proposes a novel approach to attack
   users' guard selection which can pose great threat against Tor users'
   anonymity. Under the current design of Tor, once entry guards are
   compromised, the probability that an attacker observes both ends of a
   Tor circuit will be highly improved. Actual and simulated experiments
   both show that an attacker (e.g., a local or national government which
   have the power to monitor a Tor user's internet connection) can
   successfully compromise a specific Tor user's entry guard in about 30
   minutes, and this can further help de-anonymize the user's anonymous
   communication.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we study hole transport in a planar silicon
   metal-oxide-semiconductor based double quantum dot. We demonstrate Pauli
   spin blockade in the few hole regime and map the spin relaxation induced
   leakage current as a function of interdot level spacing and magnetic
   field. With varied interdot tunnel coupling, we can identify different
   dominant spin relaxation mechanisms. Application of a strong
   out-of-plane magnetic field causes an avoided singlet-triplet level
   crossing, from which the heavy hole g-factor similar to 0.93 and the
   strength of spin-orbit interaction similar to 110 mu eV can be obtained.
   The demonstrated strong spin-orbit interaction of heavy holes promises
   fast local spin manipulation using only electric fields, which is of
   great interest for quantum information processing.}},

Abstract = {{Objective This study aimed to investigate the values of serum
   2-microglobulin to predict contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) before and
   early after coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), comparing
   with creatinine-based parameters and cystatin C.
   Methods A total of 424 patients were enrolled. Serum 2-microglobulin,
   cystatin C, and creatinine were measured at 0, 24, and 48 hours of CCTA.
   Contrast-induced nephropathy was defined as an elevation of serum
   creatinine level by 25\% or higher or 0.5 mg/dL or greater from baseline
   within 48 hours. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was
   calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study equation.
   Receiver operating characteristic curves and multivariate logistic
   regression analysis were used to detect the efficiency of biomarkers in
   predicting CIN.
   Results Fifty-two subjects (12.26\%) developed CIN. Before CCTA, CIN was
   predicted by both baseline 2-microglobulin (area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve {[}AUC], 0.791; P < 0.001) and cystatin C
   (AUC, 0.781; P < 0.001), whereas creatinine and eGFR were not
   predictive. After CCTA, CIN was predicted by both the absolute post-CCTA
   levels of 2-microglobulin, cystatin C, creatinine, and eGFR (AUC, 0.842

   and cystatin C (odds ratio, 1.873; 95\% confidence interval,
   1.667-2.341; P = 0.003) were independent predictors for CIN.
   Conclusions Serum 2-microglobulin, with values superior to
   creatinine-based parameters and similar with cystatin C, was a useful
   biomarker for the prediction of CIN at pre-CCTA and early post-CCTA.}},

Abstract = {{Resampling is a critical procedure that is of both theoretical and
   practical significance for efficient implementation of the particle
   filter. To gain an insight of the resampling process and the filter,
   this paper contributes in three further respects as a sequel to the
   tutorial (Li et al., 2015). First, identical distribution (ID) is
   established as a general principle for the resampling design, which
   requires the distribution of particles before and after resampling to be
   statistically identical. Three consistent metrics including the
   (symmetrical) Kullback-Leibler divergence, Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic,
   and the sampling variance are introduced for assessment of the ID
   attribute of resampling, and a corresponding, qualitative ID analysis of
   representative resampling methods is given. Second, a novel resampling
   scheme that obtains the optimal ID attribute in the sense of minimum
   sampling variance is proposed. Third, more than a dozen typical
   resampling methods are compared via simulations in terms of sample size
   variation, sampling variance, computing speed, and estimation accuracy.
   These form a more comprehensive understanding of the algorithm,
   providing solid guidelines for either selection of existing resampling
   methods or new implementations.}},

Abstract = {{p120-catenin (p120), an E-cadherin regulator, has been implicated as
   central to a series of genetic and epigenetic changes that ultimately
   lead to tumor progression and metastasis. Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin
   substrate 1 (Rac1) and p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are effectors of
   p120. In the present study, we examined the expression of p120, Rac1 and
   Pak1 using immunohistochemistry in human gastric cancer tissues. Then,
   we used the gastric cancer SGC7901 and AGS cell lines to explore the
   possible mechanism of p120, Rac1 and Pak1 in the progress of gastric
   cancer. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of p120, Rac1
   and Pak1 in the two cell lines. Next, p120 was silenced using p120 siRNA
   or overexpression of p120 by transfection of the plasmid p120 1A into
   the two cell types, western blotting was used to investigate the
   expression changes of Rac1. and Pak1. Furthermore, the effects of p120
   siRNA-mediated knockdown or overexpression on the proliferation and
   invasive ability of gastric cancer cells were investigated using wound
   healing test and Matrigel invasion assays. The results showed that p120
   was downregulated in both poorly differentiated group and well
   differentiated human gastric cancer. However, Rac1 and Pak1 were
   upregulated in poorly differentiated tissues and remain low in well
   differentiated gastric cancer tissues. In the two gastric cancer cell
   lines, although the expression of Rac1 and Pak1 remained unchanged after
   the p120 knockdown, the expressions of Rac1 and Pak1 protein were
   decreased after p120 overexpression in both SGC7901 and AGS cells.
   Furthermore, knockdown of p120 promoted gastric cancer cell
   proliferation and invasion; overexpression of p120 reduced the
   proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells. In conclusion, based
   on our results, we speculate that p120 participates in the progress of
   gastric cancer through regulating Rac1 and Pak1, which provides a
   potential prevention and a promising therapeutical approach for the
   patients with gastric cancer.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a novel inexact two-stage stochastic robust-compensation
   programming (ITSP-RC) model is developed for CO2 emission reduction
   management under uncertainties. This model is attempted to integrate
   ITSP and stochastic RC programming into a general framework and apply
   the ITSP-RC for power management and CO2 emission reduction management,
   such that the developed model can tackle uncertainties described in
   terms of interval values and probability distributions over a two-stage
   context. Moreover, it can reflect dynamic and randomness of the energy
   systems during the planning horizon. The developed method has been
   applied to a case to solve CO2 emission management problem in electric
   supply environmental management. A number of scenarios corresponding to
   different adoption rate levels of carbon capture, utilization, and
   storage technology are examined. With the RC programming, regional
   energy systems would have a stable financial budget. The result suggests
   that the methodology is applicable for reflecting complexities of
   large-scale energy management systems and addressing CO2 emissions

Abstract = {{This paper reports, for the first time, the measurement of
   magnetostriction in Fe50Pt(50-x)Pdx thin films with varying Pd content.
   L1(0)-ordered FePtPd alloy films, with strong perpendicular magnetic
   anisotropy, are leading candidates for recording media in the
   next-generation hard disk drives and solid-state random access memory
   technologies. The magnetostrictive properties of such materials are of
   importance, as strain in these systems may thereby affect the magnetic
   anisotropy or even be intentionally applied to control the magnetic
   switching characteristics. The measurements performed using the
   cantilever bending technique indicate that the magnetostriction is
   dependent on the film composition, and a maximum magnetostriction of 28
   ppm is found in the Fe50Pt7Pd43 film. These results suggest the
   possibility of tailoring magnetostriction via film composition for
   energy-assisted data storage and synthetic multiferroic random access
   memory applications.}},

Abstract = {{High population growth, urbanization, and global climate change drive up
   the frequency of disasters, affecting the safety of people's lives and
   property worldwide. Because of the inherent big-data nature of this
   disaster-related information, the processes of data exchange and
   transfer among physically distributed locations are increasingly
   challenging. This paper presents our proposed efficient network
   transmission model for interoperating heterogeneous geospatial data in a
   cyberinfrastructure environment:This transmission model supports
   multiple data encoding methods, such as GML (Geography Markup Language)
   and GeoJSON, as well as data compression/decompression techniques,
   including LZMA and DEFLATE. Our goal is to tackle fundamental
   performance issues that impact efficient retrieval of remote data.
   Systematic experiments were conducted to demonstrate the superiority of
   the proposed transmission model over the traditional OGC Web Feature
   Service (WFS) transmission model. The experiments also identified the
   optimized configuration for data encoding And compression techniques in
   different network environments. To represent a real-world user request
   scenario, the Amazon EC2 cloud platform was utilized to deploy multiple
   client nodes for the experiments. A web portal was developed to
   integrate the real-time geospatial web services reporting with real-time
   earthquake related information for spatial policy analysis and
   collaborative decision-making. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Capillary trapping is a physical mechanism by which carbon dioxide (CO2)
   is naturally immobilized in the pore spaces of aquifer rocks during
   geologic carbon sequestration operations, and thus a key aspect of
   estimating geologic storage potential. Here, we studied capillary
   trapping of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)), and the effect of
   initial scCO(2) saturation and flow rate on the storage/trapping
   potential of Berea sandstone. We performed two-phase, scCO(2)-brine
   displacements in two samples, each subject to four sequential
   drainage-imbibition core-flooding cycles to quantify end-point
   saturations of scCO(2) with the aid of micro- and macro-computed
   tomography imaging. From these experiments, we found that between 51\%
   and 75\% of the initial CO2 injected can be left behind after the brine
   injection. We also observed that the initial scCO(2) saturation
   influenced the residual scCO(2) saturation to a greater extent than the
   rate of brine injection under the experimental conditions examined. In
   spite of differences in the experimental conditions tested, as well as
   those reported in the literature, initial and residual saturations were
   found to follow a consistent relationship.}},

Abstract = {{The doping effects of Sb2O3, SiO2 and MgO on the microstructure and
   varistor voltage gradient of ZnO varistor ceramic materials were
   investigated. Results show that Sb2O3-doping is effective to increase
   the voltage gradient. However, high content of Sb2O3 leads to
   deterioration of the nonlinear characteristic of ZnO varistor ceramics.
   SiO2 is also an effective dopant to increase the voltage gradient, and
   the nonlinear characteristic is improved by the SiO2-doping. The voltage
   gradient can be further increased by doping MgO. When the doping
   contents of Sb2O3, SiO2 and MgO are 2.8 mol\%, 0.3 mol\% and 0.2 mol\%,
   respectively, an high voltage gradient ZnO varistor ceramic is obtained
   with the voltage gradient, nonlinear coefficient and leakage current of
   470 V/mm, 89 and 0.12 mu A, respectively, and the withstanding peak
   current density of 8/20 mu s surge wave is about 2.7 kA/cm(2).}},

Title = {{A robust mosaicking procedure for high spatial resolution remote sensing
   images}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of sensor manufacturing technology, high
   spatial resolution (HR) images are becoming more easily acquired and
   more widely used. However, it is common that a region of interest (ROI)
   cannot be completely acquired from a single image. Image mosaicking can
   resolve the problem by creating a new large-area image from multiple
   images with overlapping areas. A typical mosaicking procedure for HR
   remote sensing images includes three successive steps: tonal adjustment,
   seamline detection, and image blending. In this paper, we propose a
   robust mosaicking procedure featuring novel ideas in all three steps,
   which is aimed at processing HR remote sensing images of urban areas.
   Firstly, the tonal adjustment is realized by a local moment matching
   (LMM) algorithm, which solves the nonlinear photometric correlation
   problem between adjacent images. Secondly, an automatic piecewise
   dynamic program (APDP) algorithm for seamline detection is proposed to
   detect the optimal seamline on the overlapped area. Last but not least,
   we propose a cosine distance weighted blending (CDWB) method to ensure
   that the seamline is as invisible as possible. Compared to the
   state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method was proved to be effective
   in experiments with high resolution aerial and satellite images. (C)

Abstract = {{Calcium lignosullonate (CaLS) is an organic anionic surfactant, which
   has been used for the first time as a charged additive to improve the
   performance of Pebax membranes for CO2 separation. Owing to the abundant
   hydrophobic groups and low charge density of lignosullonate ion (LS2),
   CaLS was found to efficiently interrupt the chain packing of Pebax 1657
   matrix via both metal-organic complexation and hydrophobic interaction,
   endowing membranes with tunable fractional free volume (FFV). For dry
   membranes, CaLS could slightly enlarge membrane FFV without forming
   highly crosslinked structures. For humidified membranes, water-induced
   swelling led to a remarkable enhancement of FFV, while the hydrophobic
   interaction between CaLS and Pebax avoided excessive swelling. With the
   coexistence of CaLS and water, optimal FFV and moderate salting-out
   effect were acquired, resulting in very high CO2 permeability (3585
   Barrer) and fairly good CO2/gas selectivity (29 for CO2/CH4 and 71 for
   CO2/N-2). The separation mechanism was discussed by analyzing the
   relationship between salting-out effect and the well-known
   solution-diffusion mechanism. Based on the performance comparison of
   Pebax-CaLS membrane with the previously reported Pebax-salt membranes,
   the guideline about the design of polymer electrolyte membranes for CO2
   capture was tentatively proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{On the origin of a phosphate enriched interval in the Chattanooga Shale
   (Upper Devonian) of Tennessee-A combined sedimentologic, petrographic,
   and geochemical study}},
Journal = {{SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{329}},
Pages = {{40-61}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Devonian Chattanooga Shale contains an uppermost black shale
   interval with dispersed phosphate nodules. This interval extends from
   Tennessee to correlative strata in Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio and
   represents a significant period of marine phosphate fixation during the
   Late Devonian of North America. It overlies black shales that lack
   phosphate nodules but otherwise look very similar in outcrop. The
   purpose of this study is to examine what sets these two shales apart and
   what this difference tells us about the sedimentary history of the
   uppermost Chattanooga Shale.
   In thin section, the lower black shales (PBS) show pyrite enriched
   laminae and compositional banding. The overlying phosphatic black shales
   (PhBS) are characterized by phosbioclasts, have a general banded to
   homogenized texture with reworked layers, and show well defined horizons
   of phosphate nodules that are reworked and transported. In the PhBS, up
   to 8000 particles of P-debris per cm(2) occur in reworked beds, whereas
   the background black shale shows between 37-88 particles per cm2. In the
   PBS, the shale matrix contains between 8-16 phosphatic particles per
   cm2. The shale matrix in the PhBS contains 5.6\% inertinite, whereas
   just 1\% inertinite occurs in the PBS. The shale matrix in both units is
   characterized by flat REE patterns (shale-normalized), whereas
   Phosbioclast-rich layers in the PhBS show high concentrations of REEs
   and enrichment of MREEs. Negative Ce-anomalies are common to all
   samples, but are best developed in association with Phosbioclasts.
   Redox-sensitive elements (Co, U, Mo) are more strongly enriched in the
   PBS when compared to the PhBS. Trace elements associated with organic
   matter (Cu, Zn, Cd, Ni) show an inverse trend of enrichment Deposited
   atop a sequence boundary that separates the two shale units, the PhBS
   unit represents a transgressive systems tract and probably was deposited
   in shallower water than the underlying PBS interval. The higher
   phosphate content in the PhBS is interpreted as the result of a
   combination of lower sedimentation rates with reworking/winnowing
   episodes. Three types of phosphatic beds that reflect different degrees
   of reworking intensity are observed. Strong negative Ce anomalies and
   abundant secondary marcasite formation in the PhBS suggests improved
   aeration of the water column, and improved downward diffusion of oxygen
   into the sediment The associated oxidation of previously formed pyrite
   resulted in a lowering of pore water pH and forced dissolution of
   biogenic phosphate. Phosphate dissolution was followed by formation of
   secondary marcasite and phosphate. Repeated, episodic reworking caused
   repetitive cycles of phosphatic dissolution and reprecipitation,
   enriching MREEs in reprecipitated apatite. A generally ``deeper{''}
   seated redox boundary favored P-remineralization within the sediment
   matrix, and multiple repeats of this process in combination with wave
   and current reworking at the seabed led to the formation of larger
   phosphatic aggregates and concentration of phosphate nodules in discrete
   horizons. (C) 2015 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.}},

   suitable metric to alleviate the semantic gap. In this paper, we propose
   a new distance metric learning algorithm, namely weakly-supervised deep
   metric learning (WDML), under the deep learning framework. It utilizes a
   progressive learning manner to discover knowledge by jointly exploiting
   the heterogeneous data structures from visual contents and user-provided
   tags of social images. The semantic structure in the textual space is
   expected to be well preserved while the problem of the noisy, incomplete
   or subjective tags is addressed by leveraging the visual structure in
   the original visual space. Besides, a sparse model with the mixed norm
   is imposed on the transformation matrix of the first layer in the deep
   architecture to compress the noisy or redundant visual features. The
   proposed problem is formulated as an optimization problem with a
   well-defined objective function and a simple yet efficient iterative
   algorithm is proposed to solve it. Extensive experiments on real-world
   social image datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed method for image retrieval. Encouraging experimental results
   are achieved compared with several representative metric learning
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the design of a time-based procurement contract
   when a supplier possesses private information about intrinsic completion
   time and may choose to exert time reduction effort. We first derive the
   optimal (complex) contract for the buyer, and then evaluate the
   performance of a (simple) fixed-price and fixed-time (FPFT) contract.
   Our analysis shows that the structure of the optimal time-based contract
   and the performance of an FPFT contract depend largely on time reduction
   forms. Specifically, if time reduction follows a multiplicative model,
   the optimal contract induces the intrinsically slow supplier to reduce
   time, and offers a fixed payment to the intrinsically fast supplier.
   This result is opposite to what could occur when time reduction follows
   an additive model. We also show that, in a specific multiplicative
   model, the FPFT contract achieves at least eight-ninth of the available
   surplus for the buyer, whereas the performance of an FPFT contract
   deteriorates dramatically in an additive model. In response to this
   underperformance, we then propose an enhanced linear contract, and
   demonstrate that, using this contract, the buyer loses no more than
   one-sixteenth of the available surplus. Our results shed light on the
   important effect of time reduction forms on time-based contract design.

Abstract = {{Coupling remote sensing data with a crop growth model has become an
   effective tool for estimating grain yields and assessing grain quality.
   In this study, a data assimilation approach using a particle swarm
   optimization algorithm was developed to integrate remotely sensed data
   into the DSSAT-CERES model for estimating the grain yield and protein
   content of winter wheat. Our results showed that the normalized
   difference red edge index (NDRE) produced the most accurate selection of
   spectral indices for estimating canopy N accumulation (CNA), with R-2
   and RMSE values of 0.663 and 34.05 kg ha(-1), respectively. A data
   assimilation method (R-2 = 0.729 and RMSE = 32.02 kg ha(-1)) performed
   better than the spectral indices method for estimation of canopy N
   accumulation. Simulation of drain yield by the data assimilation method
   agreed well with the measured grain yield, with R-2 and RMSE values of
   0.711 and 0.63 t ha(-1), respectively. Estimating grain protein content
   by gluten type could improve the estimation accuracy, with R-2 and RMSE
   of 0.519 and 1.53\%, respectively. Our study showed that estimating
   wheat grain yield, and especially quality, could be successfully

Abstract = {{Quantitative analysis is an important application of terahertz (THz)

   quantitative analysis of multicomponent samples using THz absorption
   spectra, which exploits artificial intelligence and offers the advantage
   of global optimization. Because the scattering effect is considered when
   the fitness function is established, almost all of the quantitative
   errors are below 2\%. Furthermore, optimal values of the crossover and
   mutation probabilities were selected considering their effects on the
   quantitative error and time used. The GA was found to be superior to the
   least-squares method for quantitative analysis of mixtures using their
   terahertz absorption spectra because of its excellent nonlinear
   discrimination ability and higher accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Microparticle image velocimetry is used to capture the flow development
   process for a Newtonian fluid (water) and a viscoelastic poly(ethylene
   oxide) (PEO) solution entering a microfabricated capillary entrance
   geometry. We show that the presence of polymers significantly modifies
   the developing flow field in the capillary region compared with the
   Newtonian solvent, resulting in a significantly increased entrance
   length (L (e)). For water over a range of Reynolds numbers 1.9 a parts
   per thousand currency sign Re a parts per thousand currency sign 37.5,
   we find fully developed parabolic velocity profiles are achieved within
   an entrance length given by L (e)/D (h) = 0.24 + 0.03Re, where D (h) is
   the hydraulic diameter of the capillary. However, the developing flow
   for PEO solution at modest Re a parts per thousand currency sign 11.5
   strongly depends on the Weissenberg number (Wi), and the flow profile
   within the capillary region evolves from parabolic to flattened and
   finally concave with Wi increasing in the range 10.8 a parts per
   thousand currency sign Wi a parts per thousand currency sign 256.2. We
   observe a clear correlation between the evolution of flow profiles
   across the capillary and the development and growth of vortices in the
   region upstream of the capillary entrance. Measurements of the excess
   pressure drop across the contraction strongly suggest that an increase
   in the extensional viscosity in the central region of the channel is
   responsible for the generation of the complex flow kinematics. These
   quantitative results are expected to be useful in optimizing industrial
   processes and the design of ``lab-on-a-chip{''} devices involving
   viscoelastic fluids and also have important implications for the
   applicability of microchannels in complex fluid rheometry.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic chitosan microspheres made from novel polymer materials show
   outstanding applied characteristics. Magnetic chitosan microspheres are
   rather cheap, non-toxic, tasteless, alkali resistant, corrosion
   resistant, easily degradable, easily recyclable, and so on. It can be
   widely used in many fields. In this paper, magnetic CoFe2O4/chitosan
   core-shell microspheres are prepared by means of emulsification
   cross-linking technique using CoFe2O4 as core and glutaric dialdehyde as
   crosslinking agent. The results demonstrated that the different
   calcining temperature of magnetic (CoFe2O4) particles, CoFe2O4/chitosan
   ratio and stirring time of the suspension medium are the most effective
   parameters that control the size, size distribution, morphology and
   magnetism of the described microspheres. Finally, the size, morphology
   and chemical structure of the prepared materials are studied by
   different methods. The results show that the optimal calcination
   temperature of magnetic particles is 700A degrees C, the optimal ratio
   of CoFe2O4/chitosan is 1: 1, ultrasonic dispersion time is 30 min. The
   prepared chitosan magnetic microspheres have small size and are well
   dispersed when the stirring time is 3 h. The prepared magnetic chitosan
   microspheres are well shaped spheres with a diameter from 1 to 50 mu m,
   in which CoFe2O4 particles are dispersed uniformly. The magnetic
   chitosan microspheres show excellent magnetic response and have good
   adsorption characteristics.}},

Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{13-28}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Dimensionality reduction in multivariate time series analysis has broad
   applications, ranging from financial data analysis to biomedical
   research. However, high levels of ambient noise and various
   interferences result in nonstationary signals, which may lead to
   inefficient performance of conventional methods. In this paper, we
   propose a nonlinear dimensionality reduction framework using diffusion
   maps on a learned statistical manifold, which gives rise to the
   construction of a low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional
   nonstationary time series. We show that diffusion maps, with affinity
   kernels based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the local
   statistics of samples, allow for efficient approximation of pairwise
   geodesic distances. To construct the statistical manifold, we estimate
   time-evolving parametric distributions by designing a family of Bayesian
   generative models. The proposed framework can be applied to problems in
   which the time-evolving distributions (of temporally localized data),
   rather than the samples themselves, are driven by a low-dimensional
   underlying process. We provide efficient parameter estimation and
   dimensionality reduction methodologies, and apply them to two
   applications: music analysis and epileptic-seizure prediction. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Health care researchers have recently developed several home-based sleep
   monitoring systems and mobile applications that support healthy sleep by
   monitoring a user's sleep environment, activities, or sleep quality.
   This study describes the design and evaluation of an electrooculogram

   polysomnogram or electroencephalogram recordings, EOG has the advantage
   of easy placement and can be operated by the users themselves. We also
   design an intelligent eye mask that is user friendly for measuring sleep
   stage and quality. Two user experiments were carried out to demonstrate
   that the proposed system produces valid measurements of sleep stage and
   sleep quality and has good usability and reliability while not
   disturbing sleep significantly. These findings suggest that our system
   can also be applied to long-term sleep monitoring or sleep environment
   control to improve the user's sleep quality and make sleep more

Abstract = {{In the past decade, miRNA emerges as a vital player in orchestrating
   gene regulation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is well
   documented that miRNA influences a variety of biological events,
   including embryogenesis, cell fate decision, and cellular
   differentiation. Adipogenesis is an organized process of cellular
   differentiation by which pre-adipocytes differentiate towards mature
   adipocytes. It has been shown that adipogenesis is tightly modulated by
   a number of transcription factors such as PPAR, KLF4, and C/EBP.
   However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the missing link between
   miRNA and adipogenesis-related transcription factors remain elusive. In
   this study, we unveiled that miR-25, a member of miR-106b-25 cluster,
   was remarkably downregulated during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis. Restored
   expression of miR-25 significantly impaired 3T3-L1 adipogenesis and
   downregulated the expression of serial adipogenesis-related genes.
   Further experiments presented that ectopic expression of miR-25 did not
   affect cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Finally, KLF4 and
   C/EBP, two key regulators of adipocyte differentiation, were
   experimentally identified as bona fide targets for miR-25. These data
   indicate that miR-25 is a novel negative regulator of adipocyte
   differentiation and it suppressed 3T3-L1 adipogenesis by targeting KLF4
   and C/EBP, which provides novel insights into the molecular mechanism of
   miRNA-mediated cellular differentiation. J. Cell. Biochem. 116:

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Low-power laser irradiation (LPLI) is known
   to regulate cell proliferation and migration in clinical use. Recent
   studies have shown that LPLI induces cell death in some certain types of
   cancer cell lines. However, the cytotoxic selectivity of LPLI for cancer
   cells is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to compare the
   cytotoxic effects of LPLI in both human oral cancer OC2 cells and normal
   human gingival fibroblast (HGF) cells.
   Materials and Methods: LPLI at 810 nm with an energy density from 10 to
   60 J/cm(2) was used to irradiate human oral cancer OC2 cells and normal
   HGF cells.
   Results: We found that LPLI significantly diminished cell viability of
   human oral cancer OC2 cells due to cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and
   the induction of cell death but that it had no or little effects on cell
   cycle progression and death in normal HGF cells. Moreover, the
   production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the loss of
   mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were elevated in human oral
   cancer OC2 cells compared with the un-irradiated cells. In contrast,
   these effects remained unchanged in normal HGF cells after exposure to
   LPLI. LPLI also induced apoptosis in caspase-3 dependent manner in human
   oral cancer OC2 cells, a mode of action that could be mediated by ROS
   and mitochondrial damage.
   Conclusion: Our findings imply LPLI might be a potential therapy for
   oral cancers. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
   Salsalate (salicylsalicylic acid) is an anti-inflammatory drug that was
   recently found to exert beneficial metabolic effects on glucose and
   lipid metabolism. Although its utility in the prevention and management
   of a wide range of vascular disorders, including type 2 diabetes and
   metabolic syndrome has been suggested before, the potential of salsalate
   to protect against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remains unclear.
   The aim of the present study was therefore to ascertain the effects of
   salsalate on the development of NASH.
   EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
   Transgenic APOE{*}3Leiden. CETP mice were fed a high-fat and
   high-cholesterol diet with or without salsalate for 12 and 20 weeks. The
   effects on body weight, plasma biochemical variables, liver histology
   and hepatic gene expression were assessed.
   KEY RESULTS
   Salsalate prevented weight gain, improved dyslipidemia and insulin
   resistance and ameliorated diet-induced NASH, as shown by decreased
   hepatic microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis, reduced hepatic
   inflammation and reduced development of fibrosis. Salsalate affected
   lipid metabolism by increasing beta-oxidation and decreasing
   lipogenesis, as shown by the activation of PPAR-alpha, PPAR-gamma
   co-activator 1 beta, RXR-alpha and inhibition of genes controlled by the
   transcription factor MLXIPL/ChREBP. Inflammation was reduced by
   down-regulation of the NF-kappa B pathway, and fibrosis development was
   prevented by down-regulation of TGF-beta signalling.
   CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
   Salsalate exerted a preventive effect on the development of NASH and
   progression to fibrosis. These data suggest a clinical application of
   salsalate in preventing NASH.}},

Abstract = {{Keloid is a type of pathological skin scar. Pathogenesis of keloid is
   complex and is not fully understood. LncRNA can regulate gene expression
   on different levels. It also participates in cell cycle regulation and
   cell proliferation. The present study investigated the potential
   biological function of IncRNA in keloid. We identified differential
   expression of lncRNAs and mRNAs between 3 pairs of keloid and normal
   skin tissue by microarray. Differentially expressed lncRNAs were
   validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR). Gene
   Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis presented the characteristics of
   associated protein-coding genes. Additionally, a co-expression network
   of lncRNA and mRNA was constructed to find potential underlying
   regulation targets. There were 1,731 IncRNAs constantly upregulated and
   782 downregulated, 1,079 mRNAs upregulated and 3,282 downregulated in
   keloid respectively (fold change 2.0, P<0.05). We chose, respectively, 3
   upregulated and 1 downregulated lncRNA for qRT-PCR and results were
   consistent with microarray. Moreover, 11 pathways were related with
   upregulated transcripts and 44 with downregulated in keloid. The
   co-expression network revealed that one lncRNA was connected with
   numerous mRNAs, and vice versa. Furthermore, bioinformation analysis
   suggested that lncRNA CACNA1G-AS1 may be crucial to keloid formation. In
   conclusion, groups of lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in keloid
   compared with normal skin tissue, which indicated that differentially
   expressed IncRNAs may play a key role in keloid formation. The present
   study provides new insights into keloid pathology and potential targets
   for treatment of keloid.}},

   Acetyl chloride was used to control the graft density. The content of
   carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen were measured by elemental analyzer. The
   graft ratio was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis and the
   molecular weight of the polymer was determined by GPC analysis. The
   retention behavior of five steroids under different temperature was
   studied. Furthermore, the influence of temperature and graft densities
   to the separation of steroid compounds was investigated. The results
   indicated that graft density had a significant influence on the
   separation efficiency. Thinner PNIPAAm chains on hydrophilic silica

Abstract = {{Biologically active peptides and proteins are novel agents that show
   promise in the development of anticancer drugs. Their relatively low
   cell permeability and poor tumor selectivity, however, impede their
   widespread applicability. In this study, we evaluated the tumor
   selectivity, cellular internalization, and biological activity of a
   cell-permeable ovarian cancer cell-specific therapeutic protein
   consisting of TAT-OSBP and constitutively active MKK6(E), an upstream
   kinase of the p38 signaling pathway that mediates cellular apoptosis.
   OSBP, a 7-amino-acid peptide with high affinity for human ovarian cancer
   HO8910 cells, was conjugated to the cell-penetrating peptide (TAT) to
   form a tumor-selective peptide (TAT-OSBP), which was further conjugated
   with EGFP or MKK6(E). Flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy were
   performed to evaluate the tumor-targeted penetration of TAT-OSBP-EGFP.
   The inhibitory effects of TAT-OSBP-MKK6(E) were determined by cell
   proliferation and apoptosis assays. The internalization efficiency of
   TAT-OSBP-EGFP was significantly higher than that of TAT-EGFP.
   TAT-OSBP-EGFP selectively penetrated HO8910 cells. TAT-OSBP-MKK6(E)
   fusion protein inhibited cancer cell growth to varying degrees, with the
   highest level of inhibition in HO8910 cells. Moreover, TAT-OSBP-MKK6(E)
   significantly induced apoptosis of HO8910 cells. However, there was no
   significant difference in apoptosis in the normal ovarian epithelial
   cells treated with either TAT-OSBP-MKK6(E) or TAT-MKK6(E). Our results
   demonstrate that TAT-OSBP-MKK6(E) is a novel artificially designed
   molecule, which induces apoptosis and selectively targets human ovarian
   carcinoma HO8910 cells. Our study provides novel insights that may aid
   in the development of a new generation of anticancer drugs.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2479-2485}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Substantial progress has been made in nutritional
   epigenetics, but little is known regarding whether mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) methylation is involved in this process.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether dietary
   lipid sources {[}various fatty acids (FAs)] modify mtDNA methylation.
   Methods: A total of 600 large yellow croakers (Larimichthys crocea) with
   an average initial weight of 151 +/- 4 g were fed 1 of 5 diets (3
   replicate cages/treatment) containing either fish oil (FO) (control),
   palmitic acid, olive oil (OO), sunflower oil, or perilla oil (PO) as the
   dietary lipid source (12\% dry weight of the diet) for 70 d.
   Pyrosequencing was used to determine the effects of dietary lipid
   sources (FAs) on mtDNA methylation.
   Results: Mitochondrial arginine transfer RNA and NAD(H) dehydrogenase 4L
   encoding region methylation in the liver was higher in the OO (9.5\% +/-
   0.52\%; P < 0.05) and PO (7.3\% +/- 0.33\%; P < 0.05) groups than in the
   FO (5.9\% +/- 0.42\%) group, whereas 12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
   methylation in the liver was lower in the OO group (2.7\% +/- 0.22\%)
   than in the FO group (4.2\% +/- 0.73\%) (P < 0.05). Additionally, fish
   fed the OO diet had lower liver mRNA levels of ND3 (P < 0.05), ND4L (P <
   0.05), ND6 (P < 0.05), 12S rRNA (P < 0.05), and 16S rRNA (P < 0.05) than
   those fed the FO diet, whereas fish fed the PO diet had lower liver mRNA
   levels of 16S rRNA than those fed the FO diet (P < 0.05). Moreover, fish
   fed the OO (P < 0.05) or PO (P < 0.05) diet had lower liver
   mitochondrial complex I activity than did those fed the FO diet.
   Conclusions: These findings provide the first evidence, to our
   knowledge, that dietary lipid sources influence mitochondrial function
   through mtDNA methylation in large yellow croakers.}},

Abstract = {{One in five American children grows up in poverty. Childhood poverty has
   far-reaching adverse impacts on cognitive, social and emotional
   development. Altered development of neurocircuits, subserving emotion
   regulation, is one possible pathway for childhood poverty's ill effects.
   Children exposed to poverty were followed into young adulthood and then
   studied using functional brain imaging with an implicit emotion
   regulation task focused. Implicit emotion regulation involved attention
   shifting and appraisal components. Early poverty reduced left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex recruitment in the context of emotional
   regulation. Furthermore, this emotion regulation associated brain
   activation mediated the effects of poverty on adult task performance.
   Moreover, childhood poverty also predicted enhanced insula and reduced
   hippocampal activation, following exposure to acute stress. These
   results demonstrate that childhood poverty can alter adult emotion
   regulation neurocircuitry, revealing specific brain mechanisms that may
   underlie long-term effects of social inequalities on health. The role of
   poverty-related emotion regulatory neurocircuitry appears to be
   particularly salient during stressful conditions.}},

Abstract = {{An inulin based polycation (Inu-EDA) has been synthesized by the
   grafting of ethylenediamine molecules onto inulin backbone. The obtained
   inulin copolymer has been though to coat SPIONs (IC-SPIONs) and obtain
   stable magnetoplexes by complexation of IC-SPIONs with a model duplexed
   siRNA, for improving oligonucleotide transfection efficiency.
   The physical-chemical characteristics of IC-SPIONs and IC-SPIONs/siRNA
   magnetoplexes have been investigated by scanning and transmission
   electron microscopies, dynamic light scattering, FT-IR and qualitative
   surface elementary analysis. Cell compatibility and internalization in
   vitro of IC-SPIONs have been evaluated by MTS and fluorescence
   microscopy respectively on cancer (HCT116) and normal human (16HBE)
   cells. The efficiency of gene silencing effect of magnetoplexes was
   studied on both tumoral (JHH6) and non tumoral (16HBE) cell lines also
   by applying an external magnet.
   IC-SPIONs showed dimension of 30 nm and resulted cytocompatible on the
   tested cell lines; in the presence of an external magnet, the magnetic
   force enhanced the IC-SPIONs uptake inside cells. Magnetically improved
   transfection was observed in 16HBE cells under magnetofective
   conditions, in accordance with the IC-SPIONs uptake enhancement in the
   presence of an external magnet.
   These findings support the potential application of this system as a
   magnetically targeted drug delivery system.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a widely-acknowledged shortage of software developers, and
   reports of a gap between industry needs and software education, the
   possible gap between students' needs and software development education
   has not been explored in detail. In their university education, students
   want to take courses and carry out projects that clearly relate to their
   lives and their goals. This paper reports on a quantitative study of 297
   software development students. The analysis of the results suggests that
   software development education has a predominantly social relevance to
   students and also has moderate personal and professional relevance. The
   following approaches are recommended to improve students' views of the
   relevance of software development education: use various learning
   environments; pay special attention to female students, students who did
   not have IT as a school subject, and students who rate their own
   academic performance as low; update educators on the latest
   developments; design programs to appeal to students and to meet societal
   demands.}},

Abstract = {{The disease oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy is caused by alanine
   codon trinucleotide expansions in the N-terminal segment of the nuclear
   poly(A) binding protein PABPN1. As histochemical features of the
   disease, intranuclear inclusions of PABPN1 have been reported. Whereas
   the purified N-terminal domain of PABPN1 forms fibrils in an
   alanine-dependent way, fibril formation of the full-length protein
   occurs also in the absence of alanines. Here, we addressed the question
   whether the stability of the RNP domain or domain swapping within the
   RNP domain may add to fibril formation. A variant of full-length PABPN1
   with a stabilizing disulfide bond at position 185/201 in the RNP domain
   fibrillized in a redox-sensitive manner suggesting that the integrity of
   the RNP domain may contribute to fibril formation. Thermodynamic
   analysis of the isolated wild-type and the disulfide-linked RNP domain
   showed two state unfolding/refolding characteristics without detectable
   intermediates. Quantification of the thermodynamic stability of the
   mutant RNP domain pointed to an inverse correlation between fibril
   formation of full-length PABPN1 and the stability of the RNP domain.}},

Abstract = {{The reported survival of implants depends on the definition used for the
   endpoint, usually revision. When screening through registry reports from
   different countries, it appears that revision is defined quite
   differently.
   The purposes of this study were to compare the definitions of revision
   among registry reports and to apply common clinical scenarios to these
   definitions.
   We downloaded or requested reports of all available national joint
   registries. Of the 23 registries we identified, 13 had published reports
   that were available in English and were beyond the pilot phase. We
   searched these registries' reports for the definitions of the endpoint,
   mostly revision. We then applied the following scenarios to the
   definition of revision and analyzed if those scenarios were regarded as
   a revision: (A) wound revision without any addition or removal of
   implant components (such as hematoma evacuation); (B) exchange of head
   and/or liner (like for infection); (C) isolated secondary patella
   resurfacing; and (D) secondary patella resurfacing with a routine liner
   exchange.
   All registries looked separately at the characteristic of primary
   implantation without a revision and 11 of 13 registers reported on the
   characteristics of revisions. Regarding the definition of revision,
   there were considerable differences across the reports. In 11 of 13
   reports, the primary outcome was revision of the implant. In one
   registry the primary endpoint was ``reintervention/revision{''} while
   another registry reported separately on ``failure{''} and
   ``reoperations{''}. In three registries, the definition of the outcome
   was not provided, however in one report a results list gave an
   indication for the definition of the outcome. Wound revision without any
   addition or removal of implant components (scenario A) was considered a
   revision in three of nine reports that provided a clear definition on
   this question, whereas two others did not provide enough information to
   allow this determination. Exchange of the head and/or liner (like for
   infection; scenario B) was considered a revision in 11 of 11; isolated
   secondary patella resurfacing (scenario C) in six of eight; and
   secondary patella resurfacing with routine liner exchange (scenario D)
   was considered a revision in nine of nine reports.
   Revision, which is the most common main endpoint used by arthroplasty
   registries, is not universally defined. This implies that some
   reoperations that are considered a revision in one registry are not
   considered a revision in another registry. Therefore, comparisons of
   implant performance using data from different registries have to be
   performed with caution. We suggest that registries work to harmonize
   their definitions of revision to help facilitate comparisons of results
   across the world's arthroplasty registries.}},

Title = {{The effect of physical exercise on salivary secretion of MUC5B, amylase

Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF ORAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Saliva secretion is regulated by the autonomic nervous
   system. Parasympathic stimuli increase the secretion of water and mucin
   MUC5B, whereas sympathetic stimuli such as physical exercise increase
   the secretion of amylase and other proteins. In the present study we
   investigated the effect of physical exercise, as a sympathetic stimulus,
   on salivary flow rate and output of MUC5B, amylase, lysozyme and total
   protein.
   Design: Unstimulated whole saliva was collected before exercise (1),
   after 10 min exercise with moderate intensity by running with a heart
   rate around 130 beats per minute (2), followed by 10 min exercise with
   high intensity by running to exhaustion (3) and after 30 min recovery
   (4). Salivary flow rate, protein and MUC5B concentration, and amylase
   and lysozyme activity were determined. Saliva protein composition was
   analysed using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.
   Results: Salivary flow rate, protein and lysozyme secretion increased
   after exercise with moderate intensity and increased further after
   exercise with high intensity (p < 0.01). Amylase and MUC5B increased
   after exercise with moderate intensity (p < 0.0001), but did not differ
   significantly between moderate and high exercise intensity. SDS-PAGE
   analysis and immunoblotting showed that, especially after exercise with
   high intensity, the concentrations of several other salivary proteins,
   including MUC7, albumin, and extra-parotid glycoprotein, also increased.
   Conclusions: Exercise may not only lead to the anticipated increase in
   amylase and protein secretion, but also to an increase in salivary flow
   rate and MUC5B secretion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This research aims to design and fabricate a system to measure the
   capsaicinoid content of red pepper powder in a non-destructive and rapid
   method using visible and near infrared spectroscopy (VNIR). The
   developed system scans a well-leveled powder surface continuously to
   minimize the influence of the placenta distribution, thus acquiring
   stable and representative reflectance spectra. The system incorporates
   flat belts driven by a sample input hopper and stepping motor, a powder
   surface leveler, charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensor-embedded VNIR
   spectrometer, fiber optic probe, and tungsten halogen lamp, and an
   automated reference measuring unit with a reference panel to measure the
   standard spectrum. The operation program includes device interface,
   standard reflectivity measurement, and a graphical user interface to
   measure the capsaicinoid content. A partial least square regression
   (PLSR) model was developed to predict the capsaicinoid content; 44 red
   pepper powder samples whose measured capsaicinoid content ranged
   13.45-159.48 mg/100 g by per high-performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC) and 1242 VNIR absorbance spectra acquired by the pungency
   measurement system were used. The determination coefficient of
   validation (R-V(2)) and standard error of prediction (SEP) for the model
   with the first-order derivative pretreatment method for Korean red
   pepper powder were 0.8484 and +/- 13.6388 mg/100 g, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The present study addresses the questions of (a) whether Korean learners
   of English show sensitivity to subject-verb agreement violations in an
   eye-tracking paradigm, and (b) how reading goals (reading for
   comprehension vs. translation) and second language (L2) proficiency
   modulate depth of morphological agreement processing. Thirty-six Korean
   speakers of L2 English and 32 native English speakers read 40 stimulus
   sentences, half of which contained subject-verb agreement violations in
   English. The factors were whether a head and a local intervening noun
   matched in number and whether a sentence was grammatical or not. In
   linear mixed models analyses, both agreement violations and noun phrase
   match/mismatch were found to be disruptive in processing for native
   speakers at the critical regions (verb and following word), and locally
   distracting number-marked nouns yielded an asymmetric pattern depending
   on grammaticality. When L2 speakers were asked to produce offline oral
   translations of the English sentences into Korean, they became more
   sensitive to agreement violations. In addition, higher L2 proficiency
   predicted greater sensitivity to morphological violations. The results
   indicate that L2 speakers are not necessarily insensitive to
   morphological violations and that L2 proficiency and task modulate the
   depth of L2 morphological processing.}},

Abstract = {{The fringe-field switching (FFS) mode that uses liquid crystals (LCs)
   with negative dielectric anisotropy is used in high-resolution FFS
   liquid crystal display owing to its higher transmittance over positive
   LC, although its response time becomes slow and operating voltage (V-op)
   becomes high. In the device, reduction of the cell gap is required to
   achieve fast response time, which results in increase in Vop in general.
   In this paper, we propose the FFS mode with electrode width 1 mu m and
   distance between the electrodes 1.5 mu m. In such an electrode
   structure, V-op decreases with decreasing cell gap to 2 mu m so that a
   proper V-op, high LC's light efficiency of 90\%, a high color
   temperature, and a fast response time less than 10 ms, can be achieved,
   which maximizes electro-optic performance of the FFS mode.}},

Abstract = {{Primary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC) testing of an Alloy
   600/182 weld was conducted at 325 degrees C for 20,725 h in a simulated

   cracking occurred only in the regions of Alloy 182 weld metal, which
   suggests that Alloy 182 weld metal is more susceptible to PWSCC than
   Alloy 600 base metal. The difference in the susceptibility of the alloys
   to PWSCC can be attributed to their different metallurgical
   characteristics, such as the yield strength, precipitation of
   intergranular chromium carbides, and grain boundary properties of the
   alloys. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The effect of magnetic stimulation on the osteogenic and chondrogenic
   differentiation of human stem cells derived from the adipose tissue
   (hASCs)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{393}},

Abstract = {{The use of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) towards the musculoskeletal
   tissues has been the focus of many studies, regarding MNPs ability to
   promote and direct cellular stimulation and orient tissue responses.
   This is thought to be mainly achieved by mechano-responsive pathways,
   which can induce changes in cell behavior, including the processes of
   proliferation and differentiation, in response to external mechanical
   stimuli. Thus, the application of MNP-based strategies in tissue
   engineering may hold potential to propose novel solutions for cell
   therapy on bone and cartilage strategies to accomplish tissue
   regeneration.
   The present work aims at studying the influence of MNPs on the
   osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of human adipose derived
   stem cells (hASCs). MNPs were incorporated in hASCs and cultured in
   medium supplemented for osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation.
   Cultures were maintained up to 28 days with/without an external magnetic
   stimulus provided by a magnetic bioreactor, to determine if the MNPs
   alone could affect the osteogenic or chondrogenic phenotype of the
   hASCs.
   Results indicate that the incorporation of MNPs does not negatively
   affect the viability nor the proliferation of hASCs. Furthermore,
   Alizarin Red staining evidences an enhancement in extracellular (ECM)
   mineralization under the influence of an external magnetic field.
   Although not as evident as for osteogenic differentiation, Toluidine
   blue and Safranin-O stainings also suggest the presence of a
   cartilage-like ECM with glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans under the
   magnetic stimulus provided.
   Thus, MNPs incorporated in hASCs under the influence of an external
   magnetic held have the potential to induce differentiation towards the
   osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Landslides have become one of the most deadly natural disasters on
   earth, not only due to a significant increase in extreme climate change
   caused by global warming, but also rapid economic development in
   topographic relief areas. How to detect landslides using a real-time
   system has become an important question for reducing possible landslide
   impacts on human society. However, traditional detection of landslides,
   either through direct surveys in the field or remote sensing images
   obtained via aircraft or satellites, is highly time consuming. Here we
   analyze very long period seismic signals (20-50 s) generated by large
   landslides such as Typhoon Morakot, which passed though Taiwan in August
   2009. In addition to successfully locating 109 large landslides, we
   define landslide seismic magnitude based on an empirical formula: Lm =
   log(A) + 0.55 log(Delta) + 2.44, where A is the maximum displacement (mu
   m) recorded at one seismic station and Delta is its distance (km) from
   the landslide. We conclude that both the location and seismic magnitude
   of large landslides can be rapidly estimated from broadband seismic
   networks for both academic and applied purposes, similar to earthquake
   monitoring. We suggest a real-time algorithm be set up for routine
   monitoring of landslides in places where they pose a frequent threat.

   using a set of structure questionnaires to measure patients' state
   anxiety levels, attitudes towards cancer prevention and need for

   were evaluated based on unmet needs and associated factors were
   determined. Among the 106 subjects surveyed, the most prominent unmet
   information needs were about obtaining the test results as soon as
   possible. Patients with precancerous oral lesions who had high levels of
   state anxiety, long duration of time since quitting betel nut chewing
   and were without a history of oral cancer were more likely to have unmet
   information needs. A high level of anxiety about precancerous oral

Abstract = {{This article develops a dynamic model of entry and exit to analyze
   quality choice and oligopoly market structure in the nursing home
   industry. I find significant heterogeneity in the competitive effects
   across market structures: Firms of similar quality levels compete more
   strongly than dissimilar firms. Sunken entry costs are extremely large,
   and quality adjustment behavior is governed by significant fixed
   adjustment costs. A proposal to eliminate low-quality nursing homes is
   found to cause a large supply-side shortage, and another proposal to
   lower entry costs has offered a perverse incentive to provide low
   quality of care.}},

   noise components by 58.3\% and 54.5\% respectively, such that the noise
   interference by flash memory can be effectively reduced when it is used
   for various electronic devices. Especially for the automobile electronic

Abstract = {{Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is gaining popularity due to anywhere
   anytime data access. However, at the same time it also introduces the
   new privacy and security threats that have become an obstacle to the
   widespread use and popularity of MCC. In this paper, we propose a
   reliable recommendation and privacy preserving based cross-layer
   reputation mechanism (RP-CRM) to provide secure and privacy-aware
   communication process in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) based MCC
   (WM-MCC). RP-CRM integrates the cross-layer design with recommendation
   reputation reliability evaluation mechanism and the privacy preserving
   scheme to identify and manage the internal malicious nodes and protect
   the security and privacy against internal multi-layer attack, bad
   mouthing attack and information disclosure attack. Simulation results
   and performance analysis demonstrate that RP-CRM can provide rapid and
   accurate malicious node identification and management, and provide
   security and privacy protection against aforementioned attacks more
   effectively and efficiently. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{OPTICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{To suppress the medium-high spatial frequency, error on optical surfaces
   is still a challenging work to date, and the tool path ripple (TPR)
   error is the main reason for these errors. With this in view, the effect
   of the tool influence function (TIF) shape of the semirigid (SR) bonnet
   to the TPR error is analyzed. The SR bonnet is a recently developed
   bonnet tool for high efficiency polishing. This tool can generate three
   kinds of TIF including Gaussian-like shape, trapezoidal shape, and
   ``M{''} shape. Experimental studies have been conducted to analyze their
   effect to the root mean square/peak-to-valley value of the TPR error,
   and discussions have been made on those results. It is found that
   different shapes of TIF can be implemented through controlling its
   inflated pressure. The Gaussian-like shape has the highest probability
   to generate lower TPR error than the trapezoidal shape and ``M{''} shape
   TIFs, which have been proven by the verification experiments. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We present a research for the MHD Marangoni boundary layer flow and heat

   Four different types of nanoparticles, copper, aluminum oxide, copper

   carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC)-water used as base fluids. A generalized
   Fourier law proposed by Zheng for varying thermal conductivity of
   nanofluids is taken into account, and the surface tension is assumed a
   quadratic function of the temperature. The governing partial
   differential equations (PDEs) are formulated, and similarity solutions
   are obtained numerically using shooting technique combined with
   Runge-Kutta iteration program and Newton's scheme. The effects of
   various physical parameters on horizontal velocity component and

   the composite powders were investigated by a vibrating sample

   hysteresis loops. The results show that both the saturation
   magnetization (M-s) and the remnant magnetization (M-r) of the composite
   powders increase with increasing the concentration of NFO in the
   composite powders. The dielectric properties of the samples were

Abstract = {{Dissociative adsorption of H2O, NH3, CH3OH and CH3NH2 polar molecules on
   the Si(100) surface results in a 1:1 mixture of two adsorbates (H and
   multi-atomic fragment A = OH, NH2, CH3O, CH3NH, respectively) on the
   surface. By using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the
   adsorption geometry, the total energies and the charge densities for
   various possible ordered structures of the mixed adsorbate layer have
   been found. Analyzing the systematic trends in the total energies
   unveils concurrently the nearest-neighbor interactions E-NN and the next
   nearest-neighbor interactions E-NNN between two polar adsorbates A. In
   going from small to large polar adsorbates, E-NN's exhibit an
   attractive-to-repulsive crossover behavior, indicating that they include
   competing attractive and repulsive contributions. Exploration of the
   charge density distributions allows the estimation of the degree of
   charge overlapping between immediately neighboring A's, the resulting
   contribution of the steric repulsions, and that of the attractive
   interactions to the corresponding E-NN's. The attractive contributions
   to nearest neighboring adsorbate-adsorbate interactions between the
   polar adsorbates under study are shown to result from hydrogen bonds or
   dipole-dipole interactions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   temperature rise and interface conductance between steel formwork and

   loading and thermal properties development. A thermal convection model
   was implemented to simulate the external heat loss. Experimentally, two

   The measured temperature time histories correlate well with the

Abstract = {{Background: Serious bleeding is a frequent and feared treatment
   complication in patients treated with oral anticoagulants (OACs). Levels
   of von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen have been linked to the risk of
   bleeding complications, mortality, and cardiovascular events.
   Objectives: In this longitudinal cohort study of evaluating patients
   treated with OACs, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between VWF
   displaying a glycoprotein Ib binding conformation (VWF activation
   factor) and the risk of cardiovascular events, bleeding complications,
   or all-cause mortality.
   Materials and methods: Blood samples were collected at baseline in 356
   patients on OACs. Patients were followed for an average of 48 months and
   bleeding complications leading to admission to hospital or death,
   cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and
   peripheral arterial emboli), and all-cause mortality were recorded and
   classified.
   Results: During the study period, 47 bleeding complications, 84
   cardiovascular events, and 97 deaths occurred. In multivariate Cox
   regression analyses, VWF activation factor was significantly associated
   with all-cause mortality (HR 1.62; 95\% CI: 1.25-2.08) and
   cardiovascular events (HR 1.28; 95\% CI: 1.01-1.63). There was no
   association observed between VWF activation factor and bleeding
   complications.
   Conclusions: Patients with high levels of VWF activation factor had an
   increased risk of cardiovascular events and all cause mortality during
   OAC treatment. The selectivity for thrombotic complications adds to the
   potential value of VWF activation factor as a biomarker or
   pharmacological target. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The amyloid hypothesis suggests that accumulation of amyloid (A)
   peptides in the brain is involved in development of Alzheimer's disease.
   We previously generated a small dimeric affinity protein that inhibited
   A aggregation by sequestering the aggregation prone parts of the
   peptide. The affinity protein is originally based on the Affibody
   scaffold, but is evolved to a distinct interaction mechanism involving
   complex structural rearrangement in both the A peptide and the affinity
   proteins upon binding. The aim of this study was to decrease the size of
   the dimeric affinity protein and significantly improve its affinity for
   the A peptide to increase its potential as a future therapeutic agent.
   We combined a rational design approach with combinatorial protein
   engineering to generate two different affinity maturation libraries. The
   libraries were displayed on staphylococcal cells and high-affinity
   A-binding molecules were isolated using flow-cytometric sorting. The
   best performing candidate binds A with a K-D value of around 300 pM,
   corresponding to a 50-fold improvement in affinity relative to the
   first-generation binder. The new dimeric Affibody molecule was shown to
   capture A(1-42) peptides from spiked E. coli lysate. Altogether, our
   results demonstrate successful engineering of this complex binder for
   increased affinity to the A peptide.}},

Abstract = {{Natriuretic peptides (NPs) may regulate adipocyte metabolism including
   adiponectin. Infusion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) Increases
   plasma adiponectin in patients with heart failure. However, this
   relation has not been examined in a clinical setting or in myocardial
   infarction (MI). Accordingly, we investigated the interplay between
   proANP and adiponectin and the prognostic implications in patients with
   MI. We prospectively included 680 patients with ST-segment elevation
   myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary
   intervention from September 2006 to December 2008. Blood samples were
   drawn immediately before percutaneous coronary intervention.
   Additionally, we included 40 patients with 4 obtained blood samples
   during STEMI. Adiponectin and proANP were measured in all plasma
   samples. All patients were followed for 5 years. End points were
   all-cause mortality (n = 137) and the combined end point (n = 170) of
   major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Plasma adiponectin and
   proANP were strongly associated at admission (r = 0.34, p < 0.001). In
   patients with increasing proANP during STEMI, adiponectin also increased
   (0.5 +/- 0.3 vs -0.1 +/- 0.1 mg/L, p = 0.026). During follow-up,
   patients with higher adiponectin at admission had increased risk of
   all-cause mortality and MACE (both, p < 0.001). After adjustment for
   confounding risk factors by Cox regression analysis, adiponectin
   remained an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and MACE:
   hazard ratio 1.31 (95\% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.60; p = 0.009) and
   1.31 (95\% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.57; p = 0.004), respectively,
   for each SD increase. However, the association vanished when proANP was
   included in the analysis. In conclusion, adiponectin is associated with
   an increased risk of all-cause mortality and MACE. However,
   concomitantly elevated proANP levels appear to confound the association
   between adiponectin and worsened outcome. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The use of structural restorations as a tool to investigate structural
   evolution, fault and horizon relationships, and validity of
   interpretation has been widespread for more than four decades. The first
   efforts relied on hand-drafted bed-length measurements of commonly
   constant thickness stratigraphic units and were typically applied to
   fold-and-thrust belt settings. The advent of computer-assisted section
   construction and restoration software allowed for the assessment of more
   complicated structural interpretations by applying several new methods
   for forward and inverse strain transformation. Although quicker and more
   accurate than hand-drafted, the results of computer-aided structural
   modeling still need to be interrogated. We have reviewed the different
   strain transformation (restoration) methods available and their
   implications for bed length and area conservation: (1) fundamental
   simple shear and its two basic modes (flexural slip and inclined shear
   inversions), (2) fault-related folding techniques, and (3) the effects
   of mechanical stratigraphy and compaction. The assessment of the
   restoration methods was illustrated by examining two examples: the Mount
   Crandell Duplex Structure in southern Alberta and the Virgin River
   Extensional Basin in the southeast of Nevada. For both examples, we
   developed tables listing and confirming the deformed/restored state line
   lengths and areas. We believe that such tables should be provided for
   any strain transformation exercise, along with the restoration results
   as parameters for quality control, to prevent over- and underestimations
   that deviate more than 5\% from the initial interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. We examined the use of low-cost social media platforms in
   communicating public health messages and outline the laugh model, a
   framework through which public health organizations can reach and engage
   communities.
   Methods. In August 2014, we developed an online campaign (Web site and
   social media) to help promote healthy family meals in Utah in
   conjunction with the state and local health departments.
   Results. By the end of September 2014, a total of 3641 individuals had
   visited the Utahfamilymeals.org Web site. Facebook ads reached a total
   of 29 078 people, and 56 900 people were reached through Twitter ads.
   The per-person price of the campaign was 0.2 cents, and the total
   estimated target population reach was between 10\% and 12\%.
   Conclusions. There are 3 key takeaways from our campaign: use of
   empowering and engaging techniques may be more effective than use of
   educational techniques; use of social media Web sites and online
   marketing tactics can enhance collaboration, interdisciplinary
   strategies, and campaign effectiveness; and use of social media as a
   communication platform is often preferable to use of mass media in terms
   of cost-effectiveness, more precise evaluations of campaign success, and
   increased sustainability.}},

   Multi-parametric MRI and histopathological outcome of MR-guided biopsies
   of a consecutive set of 130 patients were included. All cases were
   prospectively PIRADS reported and the reported lesions underwent CAD
   analysis. Logistic regression combined the CAD prediction and
   radiologist PIRADS score into a combination score. Receiver-operating
   characteristic (ROC) analysis and Spearman's correlation coefficient
   were used to assess the diagnostic accuracy and correlation to cancer
   grade. Evaluation was performed for discriminating benign lesions from
   cancer and for discriminating indolent from aggressive lesions.
   In total 141 lesions (107 patients) were included for final analysis.
   The area-under-the-ROC-curve of the combination score was higher than
   for the PIRADS score of the radiologist (benign vs. cancer, 0.88 vs.
   0.81, p = 0.013 and indolent vs. aggressive, 0.88 vs. 0.78, p < 0.01).
   The combination score correlated significantly stronger with cancer
   grade (0.69, p = 0.0014) than the individual CAD system or radiologist
   (0.54 and 0.58).
   Combining CAD prediction and PIRADS into a combination score has the
   potential to improve diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, such a
   combination score has a strong correlation with cancer grade.

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance measurements of ferumoxytol and TEMPO were made using
   an on-wafer transmission line technique with a vector network analyzer,
   allowing for broadband measurements of small sample volumes (4 nL) and
   small numbers of spins (1 nmol). On-wafer resonance measurements were
   compared with standard single-frequency cavity-based electron
   paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements using a new power conservation
   approach and the results show similar line shape. On-wafer magnetic
   resonance measurements using integrated microfluidics and microwave
   technology can significantly reduce the cost and sample volumes required
   for EPR spectral analysis and allow for integration of EPR with existing
   lab-on-a-chip processing and characterization techniques for

Abstract = {{This study reports the results of an experiment on directed networks
   with positive externalities induced by cost-sharing. Subjects
   participated in a network game in which they had to choose between
   private and public transportations. If a player chose public
   transportation, then she shared the travel cost equally with other
   players making the same choice, whereas if she chose private
   transportation, then her travel cost was fixed. Travel costs on the
   private route were manipulated across the two experimental conditions.
   In one condition, these costs were homogeneous among players; in the
   other condition, they were heterogeneous among players and only
   privately known. We found that half (none) of the player groups in the
   homogeneous (heterogeneous) condition converged toward the efficient
   equilibrium. Examination of the system dynamics shows that convergence
   toward efficiency was facilitated by: (1) the existence of an
   intermediate equilibrium choice; and (2) strategic teaching by which a
   farsighted player chooses strategies with poor short-term payoff in
   order to shift group decisions to the efficient equilibrium and thereby
   increase her own long-term benefit. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{A Bidirectional Dual Buck-Boost Voltage Balancer with Direct Coupling
   Based on a Burst-Mode Control Scheme for Low-Voltage Bipolar-Type DC

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{DC microgrids are considered as prospective systems because of their
   easy connection of distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric
   vehicles (EVs), reduction of conversion loss between dc output sources
   and loads, lack of reactive power issues, etc. These features make them
   very suitable for future industrial and commercial buildings' power
   systems. In addition, the bipolar-type dc system structure is more
   popular, because it provides two voltage levels for different power
   converters and loads. To keep voltage balanced in such a de system, a
   bidirectional dual buck-boost voltage balancer with direct coupling is
   introduced based on P-cell and N-cell concepts. This results in greatly
   enhanced system reliability thanks to no shoot-through problems and
   lower switching losses with the help of power MOSFETs. In order to
   increase system efficiency and reliability, a novel burst-mode control
   strategy is proposed for the dual buck-boost voltage balancer. The basic
   operating principle, the current relations, and a small-signal model of
   the voltage balancer are analyzed under the burst-mode control scheme in
   detail. Finally, simulation experiments are performed and a laboratory
   unit with a 5kW unbalanced ability is constructed to verify the
   viability of the bidirectional dual buck-boost voltage balancer under
   the proposed burst-mode control scheme in low-voltage bipolar-type dc
   microgrids.}},

Volume = {{206}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Nsa cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a novel Brassica napus male
   sterility system derived from Sinapis arvensis cytoplasm. Nsa CMS
   results in defective pollen production due to S. arvensis mitochondrial
   gene failure/incompatibility in the anthers, requiring nuclear genes to
   restore fertility. From ultramicroscopic observation of anther sections,
   we concluded that the induction of sterility begins at the pollen
   (microspore) mother cell stage. Most pollen mother cells do not undergo
   the first meiotic division and dissociate before the tetrad stage. At
   the tetrad stage, abortion was observed for all uninucleate pollen.
   Dysfunction of mitchondrial gene(s) leads to cell vacuolization in the
   anther tapetum and middle layer cells. Early programmed cell death (PCD)
   of the tapetum and anther middle layer cells is the main reason for
   pollen mother cell abortion. Due to this early pollen abortion, the
   sterility of Nsa CMS is stable and complete. Southern blotting of DNA
   from the Nsa male-sterile line, its maintainer and restorer lines, as
   well as the two parental lines (B. napus cv. Zhongshuang 4 and S.
   arvensis var. Yeyou 18) involved in the somatic hybridization, suggested
   that the cytoplasm of the Nsa CMS line was from S. arvensis and that of
   the restorer line was a rearrangement of both parental lines. Nsa CMS
   shows great potential for hybrid seed production in rapeseed. Our
   results provide clues to identify novel male-sterility (S) and restorer
   (R) genes as well as elucidate the mechanism underlying interactions
   between the S and R genes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the adaptive group consensus of networked
   Euler-Lagrange systems with parametric uncertainties under directed
   topology graph. A novel decomposition approach is developed by using
   both algebraic graph theory and matrix theory. Three distributed
   adaptive group consensus protocols are proposed for the cases of
   topology graphs with acyclic partition and balanced couple,
   respectively. Some necessary and sufficient conditions for solving group
   consensus problems are established. It is shown that for the case of
   directed acyclic graphs, the group consensus can always be guaranteed by
   the structure of acyclic interaction topology. In particular, an
   explicit expression of group consensus states can be obtained using the
   proposed integral protocol, which can be used to develop a unified
   approach yielding the desired group consensus. For the case of directed
   balanced couple graphs, a simple algebraic criterion for ensuring group
   consensus is presented in terms of the eigenvalue computation of
   Laplacian matrix and thus can be easily applied in practice. Finally,
   numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed control methodologies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, novel latex particles and aluminum complexes as potential
   shale stabilizers in water-based drilling fluids were successfully
   synthesized and characterized in detail. The spherical latex particles
   were prepared by emulsifier-free polymerization of styrene and methyl
   methacrylate, and it possessed uni-modal distribution from 80 nm to 345
   nm with the D90 value of 276 nm. The aluminum complexes were synthesized
   through the complexation reaction of humic acid with sodium aluminate
   and it could be completely soluble under alkaline conditions, and
   aluminum hydroxide and humic acid flocculate would precipitate from the
   filtrate under neutral or acidic conditions or interacting with
   magnesium or calcium ion. The synergistic effect on shale stability of
   latex particles and aluminum complexes was investigated quantitatively
   through the pressure transmission and membrane efficiency tests. The
   pore structure of shale cores before and after testing was also
   characterized via nuclear magnetic resonance core analysis and scanning
   electron microscope analysis. The results indicated that the latex
   particles as physical shale stabilizer could be deformable to internally
   bridge and seal micro-nano scale pore-throats and fractures of shale,
   and the aluminum complexes as chemical shale stabilizer would
   precipitate from the filtrate when exposed to pore-fluids and the
   precipitation could also plug and seal pore-throats and micro-fractures.
   The latex particles work synergistically with aluminum complexes to
   impart shale stability due to superior properties of decreasing shale
   permeability and increasing shale membrane efficiency. Furthermore, the
   compatible test results confirmed that novel latex particles and
   aluminum complexes could be alternatives to standard shale stabilizers
   in water-based drilling fluids. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The carbonized layers formed on the surfaces of the barium haxe-ferrite
   nanoparticles based on the heat treatment of barium
   haxe-ferrite/polyaniline nano-composites. The surface carbonized layers
   consisted of the amorphous carbon with the thicknesses ranging from 10
   to 30 nm. The existence of the surface carbonized layers on the magnetic
   ferrite nanoparticles could alter the interfacial and dielectric loss.
   By changing the thickness of the carbonized layer, the impendence match
   was refined and the fine microwave absorbing properties were achieved.
   The result indicated that the design and optimization of sophisticated
   interfacial structures would provide a potential way to develop
   multi-phase EM wave absorbers with better performances. (C)) 2015

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To evaluate the oncologic outcomes of patients with
   retroperitoneal teratoma only at primary retroperitoneal lymph node
   dissection (RPLND) who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 1979 and 2010, 23 patients with clinical
   stage (CS) I and II disease underwent primary RPLND at our institution
   with teratoma only in the retroperitoneum. No patient received adjuvant
   chemotherapy and the minimum follow-up was 2 years.
   RESULTS At the initial diagnosis, 13 patients (56.5\%) had CS I disease
   and 10 patients (43.5\%) had CS II disease. Pathologic staging
   demonstrated IIA in 13 patients (56.5\%), IIB in 8 patients (34.8\%),
   and IIC in 2 patients (8.7\%). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS)
   was 100\% with a median follow-up of 5.8 years (range, 2.1-25.4). DFS
   was not significantly different comparing pathologic stage IIA vs
   IIB/IIC disease (P = .73). Two patients (14\%) developed late relapses.
   One patient had a pelvic recurrence 11 years after primary RPLND. Final
   pathology from the pelvic resection demonstrated embryonal carcinoma. He
   remains disease free after his second surgery. The second patient had a
   contralateral retroperitoneal recurrence with yolk-sac tumor and
   teratoma 11 years after primary RPLND. He was treated with chemotherapy
   followed by postchemotherapy RPLND.
   CONCLUSION The relapse rate for patients with teratoma only at primary
   RPLND is low irrespective of PS. Adjuvant chemotherapy is therefore not
   recommended in the management of these patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues that a country's comparative advantage in exports
   depends on both the factor abundance and the allocation efficiency of
   the endowments. However, the latter is not considered in the traditional
   Heckscher-Ohlin model. In line with the sand view of corruption, this
   paper empirically studies the role of corruption in shaping a country's
   export pattern by distorting the allocation of financial resources. We
   find that the resource misallocation resulting from corruption
   undermines the export growth promoted by the positive external financial
   shock. The negative effects are realized by the extensive margins

Abstract = {{Both visual information and sound are required in immersive virtual
   reality. This paper proposes a computational method for fast synthesis
   of plausible fire sound that is synchronized with physically based fire
   animations. We divide fire sound into two parts: low frequency and
   mid-to high frequency, and use two processes to separately synthesize
   these two parts. By simplifying calculations using a novel combustion
   sound model as well as leveraging GPU parallel computing in a
   marching-cube-like manner, our method speeds up the computation of
   low-frequency part by an order of magnitude. To run the time-stepping
   fire simulation at a relative low frequency rather than the audio rate,
   we add synchronized mid-and high-frequency wavelet details to
   low-frequency simulation contents with a post-process to generate
   complete fire sound. We validated our method with various experiments to
   build a solid physically based basis for real-time acoustic rendering
   that can be used for immersive virtual reality scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The interruption of learning processes by breaks filled with diverse
   activities is common in everyday life. This study investigated the
   effects of active computer gaming and passive relaxation (rest and
   music) breaks on auditory versus visual memory performance. Young adults
   were exposed to breaks involving (a) open eyes resting, (b) listening to
   music, and (c) playing a video game, immediately after memorizing
   auditory versus visual stimuli. To assess learning performance, words
   were recalled directly after the break (an 8:30 minute delay) and were
   recalled and recognized again after 7 days. Based on linear
   mixed-effects modeling, it was found that playing the Angry Birds video
   game during a short learning break impaired long-term retrieval in
   auditory learning but enhanced long-term retrieval in visual learning
   compared with the music and rest conditions. These differential effects
   of video games on visual versus auditory learning suggest specific
   interference of common break activities on learning.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine whether progressive retinal nerve fiber layer
   (RNFL) loss occurs in the contralateral eye of patients with glaucoma
   showing unilateral progression according to conventional diagnostic
   methods.
   Design: Prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study.
   Participants: Three hundred forty-six eyes of 173 patients (118 eyes
   with glaucoma and 228 eyes with suspect glaucoma at baseline) followed
   up for an average of 3.5 +/- 0.7 years.
   Methods: All subjects underwent standard automated perimetry (SAP;
   Humphrey Field Analyzer; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) and
   spectral-domain (SD) optical coherence tomography (OCT; Spectralis;
   Heidelberg Engineering, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) in both eyes at 6-month
   intervals. Eyes were determined as progressing by conventional methods
   if there was progression on masked grading of optic disc
   stereophotographs or SAP Guided Progression Analysis (GPA; Carl Zeiss
   Meditec; ``likely progression{''}). Rates of change in SD OCT average
   RNFL thickness were obtained using a linear mixed effects model. Rate of
   global loss was calculated using a random coefficient model and compared
   for nonprogressing patients, progressing eyes, and fellow eyes of
   unilateral progressing patients.
   Main Outcomes Measures: Rate of change in global RNFL thickness.
   Results: Thirty-nine subjects showed evidence of unilateral progression
   by GPA, disc photographs, or both during follow-up. Mean +/- standard
   error rate of RNFL loss in eyes progressing by conventional methods was
   -0.89 +/- 0.22 mm/year (P < 0.001). The contralateral eyes of these
   subjects also showed significant loss of RNFL over time (-1.00 +/- 0.20
   mu m/year; P < 0.001). One hundred thirty-four subjects did not show
   progression by conventional methods in either eye. These eyes also
   showed a significant decline over time in average RNFL thickness (-0.71
   +/- 0.09 mu m/year; P < 0.001); however, the rate of change in these
   eyes was slower than that of the contralateral eye of patients showing
   unilateral progression (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Loss of RNFL thickness was seen in a substantial number of
   contralateral eyes of glaucoma patients showing unilateral progression
   by conventional methods. These findings indicate that assessment of RNFL
   thickness by SD OCT may show progressive glaucomatous damage that is not
   detected by visual fields or optic disc stereophotography. (C) 2015 by

Abstract = {{Background: Multiligand receptor for advanced glycation end products
   (RAGE), osteoprotegerin, and Golgb1 genes may be implicated in
   atherosclerosis and vascular diseases. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs) rs1035798 in RAGE gene, rs2073617 and rs2073618 in TNFRSF11B, and
   rs3732410 in Golgb1 will be investigated on whether there is an
   association with hemorrhagic stroke (HS) in Chinese population. Methods:
   A total of 600 subjects including 199 HS patients and 401 controls were
   assayed. These samples were divided into two groups: the <= 50year and
   >50year groups. Genotyping of SNPs was determined using the SEQUENOM
   MassARRAY matrix-assisted laser desorption
   ionization-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry. The association between
   genotype and HS risk was evaluated by computing the odds ratio (OR) and
   95\% confidence interval (CI) with multivariate unconditional logistic
   regression analyses. Results: Our data showed that in the <= 50year
   group, the rs1035798 major allele homozygote C/C in RAGE gene was
   associated with an increased risk of HS, while Golgb1 rs3732410 minor
   allele homozygote G/G was associated with a decreased risk of HS. In the
   >50year group, the major allele homozygote G/G of rs2073618 was found to
   be associated with an increased risk of HS. Conclusions: The
   polymorphisms rs1035798 of RAGE gene, rs2073618 of TNFRSF11B, and
   rs3732410 of Golgb1 might be involved in the risk of HS at different
   stage of ages.}},

Abstract = {{In artificial insemination, semen quality is considered to be closely
   related to the resultant pregnancy rate and the ratio of embryo
   development into fetus. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   quality of sex-sorted versus unsorted semen used for in vitro
   fertilization (IVF). Semen was collected from seven bulls (A)-(G); each
   sample was divided in two, sex-sorted or not. Following IVF, the
   fertilization rate, embryonic cleavage rate, blastocyst formation rate,
   total cells number (TCN) of blastocysts, inner cell mass (ICM)/TCN ratio
   and apoptotic cell ratio (ACR) were determined. The results showed that
   except for bull C, the unsorted semen yielded a significantly higher LW
   rate than sex-sorted semen (p<0.05). A significantly higher percentage
   of embryos reached the two-cell stage using unsorted semen than the
   matched sex-sorted semen from the seven bulls (both p<0.05), and the
   blastocyst stage from bulls A, C, D, E and G. However, there was no
   significant difference in the ICM/TCN ratio between the IVF blastocysts
   and the sexed blastocysts from bulls A, C, D, E, F and G (p>0.05). Also,
   there was no significant difference in the expression of IGF1 gene in
   bovine embryos produced with sorted or unsorted semen (p>0.05). However,
   the GDF9 gene expression in sexed embryos from bull D was significantly
   higher than in the others (p < 0.05). No significant difference was
   found in ACR among the seven bulls, while there were differences of Box
   and Bcl-2 expression in the sorted sperm of only one bull. The results
   obtained from the sex-sorted or unsorted semen from the seven different
   bulls varied, although semen from bull A yielded the highest embryonic
   cleavage rate, blastocyst rate and ICM/TCN ratio. In conclusion, the
   quality of unsorted semen was generally better than that of sex-sorted
   semen in the respect to embryo productivity in vitro. Additionally,
   individual differences in fertility were observed among different bulls.

Abstract = {{The present study was undertaken to investigate the metabolic responses
   of human liver cells HL-7702 on chemicals purified from traditional
   Chinese medicine: emodin, triptolide, and aristolochic acid.
   Cytotoxicity tests demonstrated a dose-dependent toxic effect of emodin,
   triptolide, and aristolochic acid on HL7702 cells for 48 h. Emodin (14
   mu M), aristolochic acid (12 mu g/mL), or triptolide (18 nM) was
   individually administrated to HL7702 and cell samples were collected
   after 48 h for metabolites extraction and analysis. Pattern recognition
   analysis reflected the significant difference in metabolic profiles
   between chemical-treated groups and the control group. Finally, eight
   metabolites including N1-acetylspermidine, Glu Gly, N-undecanoylglycine,
   C16 sphinganine, sphinganine, glutathione, L-palmitoylcarnitine, and
   elaidic carnitine were detected as potential common biomarkers. Three
   pathways including sphinganine metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and
   oxidative stress were identified. Our findings indicated that
   metabolomics would be an efficient approach to understand the molecular
   mechanism of hepatotoxicity induced by chemicals. (C) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{In this paper, an electromagnetic vibration energy harvester (EVEH) with
   dual Halbach arrays is presented based on the Faraday's law of
   electromagnetic induction. A Halbach array is a specific arrangement of
   permanent magnets which could concentrate the magnetic field on one side
   while reducing the field to almost zero on the opposite side. This array
   could increase the magnetic field intensity and improve the
   electromagnetic coupling. The experimental results show that the output
   performance of the presented harvester is optimal when the height of the
   coil equals to the sum thickness of two adjacent magnets in the array.
   An optimal output power density is 1.39 mW/cm(3) at a resonant frequency
   of 11.20 Hz with an acceleration of 0.5 g (with g = 9.8 m/s(2)) across a
   20 mm-high and 1600-turn coil. When other conditions are kept constant,
   the output power density is proportional to the length of the
   cantilever. The EVEH based on dual Halbach arrays can increase the
   output power density and minimize the overall volume, which is
   beneficial for improving the practical application.}},

Abstract = {{A heavy haze episode that occurred in Beijing from 20 September to 27
   September, 2011 was observed to explore the secondary processes of the
   haze episode. During the haze episode, the relatively stable synoptic
   conditions and regional transport from polluted areas in the south and
   southwest of Beijing favored the formation of haze. Significant
   increases of PM2.5/PM10 ratio was observed during haze period, which
   implied that the haze was caused by fine particles. Additionally, the
   presence of secondary inorganic pollutants (SO42-, NO3- and NH4+)
   sharply increased during the haze episode, which indicated that
   secondary processes significantly strengthened the haze episode. The
   sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR) sharply increased from a non-haze episode
   with a highest value of 0.11 to a haze episode with a highest value of
   0.62. Low correlations between SOR and O-3 and the temperature were
   found, whereas a high correlation between SOR and RH was found during
   the haze episode, which implied that sulfate was mainly produced by the
   aqueous-phase oxidation of SO2 rather than the gas-phase conversion of
   SO2 to sulfate in haze episode in Beijing. Furthermore, a fine linear
   relationship between SOR and the surface area (dS) of particles smaller
   than 1 mu m confirmed the heterogeneous processes of sulfate formation
   in haze episode. The nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR) also sharply
   increased from a non-haze episode with a highest value of 0.03 to a haze
   episode with a highest value of 0.26, which indicated more intense
   secondary formation of nitrate in haze episode. Nitrate was found to be
   mainly produced by a homogenous reaction under ammonium-rich conditions.
   Higher RH in haze episode reduced the thermodynamic equilibrium constant
   Ke', and favored the thermodynamic equilibrium reaction of HNO3(g) +
   NH3(g) <-> NH4NO3(s, aq) to formed nitrate, which might help explain the
   enhanced homogenous production of nitrate in haze episode. In addition,
   a good empirical fit (R-2 = 0.70) between NOR and dS was found, which
   indicated that the particle surface area significantly contributed to
   the intense homogeneous production of nitrate in haze episode.}},

   reciprocal relationship between anxiety-like and nociceptive behaviors
   in two mouse strains. C57BL/6J mice subjected to the 10-day period of SD
   stress by repeated CD-1 mice aggression exhibited significant social
   interaction avoidance behaviors in the social interaction (SI) test,
   which is believed to represent the symptoms of anxiety. These mice also
   displayed anxiety-like behaviors in elevated plus maze (EPM) and open
   field (OF) tests. Compared to C57BL/6J mice, FVB/NJNju mice showed less
   basal social contact, but their behavioral responses to 10-day SD stress
   were more resilient. CFA-inflammatory mice showed robust mechanical
   allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in both strains, but did not develop
   obvious social avoidance and anxiety-like behaviors 10 days after
   CFA-inflammation. Interestingly, CFA-inflammatory mice exposed to SD
   stress were not accompanied by a worsening of pain and anxiety-like
   behaviors in most tests. In contrast, the SD stress-induced social
   avoidance was significantly antagonized by combining with
   CFA-inflammatory pain. These findings suggest that persistent
   inflammatory pain and SD stress-induced anxiety may not necessarily
   exacerbate one another in animal models of comorbidity. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The Japanese scallop (Patinopecten (Mizuhopecten) yessoensis) is an
   important commercial species in Funka Bay, Japan, where it is farmed
   using the hanging culture method. Our study was based on 6 years (from
   2006 to 2011) of monthly in situ observations of scallop growth at
   Yakumo station. To produce a basic spatial distribution dataset, we
   developed an interpolation solution for the shortage of Chl-a
   concentration data available from the Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite. Additionally, we integrated
   four-dimensional variational (4D-VAR) assimilation water temperature
   data from ocean general circulation models (OGCMs), with four vertical
   levels (6, 10, 14, and 18 m) from the sea surface. Statistical models,
   including generalized additive models (GAMs) and generalized linear
   models, were applied to in situ observation data, satellite data, and
   4D-VARdata to identify the influence of environment factors
   (interpolated Chl-a, temperature, and depth) on the growth of scallops,
   and to develop a three-dimensional growth prediction model for the
   Japanese scallops in Funka Bay. We considered three methods to simulate
   the growth process of scallops (accumulation, summation, and product),
   and used them to select the most suitable model. All the interpolated
   Chl-a concentrations and 4D-VAR temperature data were verified by
   shipboard data. The results revealed that GAM, using an accumulation
   method that was based on a combination of integrated temperature,
   integrated log Chl-a, depth, and number of days, was best able to
   predict the vertical and spatial growth of the Japanese scallop. The
   predictions were verified by in situ observations from different depths
   (R-2 = 0.83-0.94). From the distribution of three-dimensional predicted
   scallop growth maps at each depth, it was suggested that the growth of
   the Japanese scallop was most favourable at 6 m and least favourable at
   18 m, although variations occurred in each aquaculture region in
   different years. These variations were probably due to the ocean
   environment and climate variation.}},

Abstract = {{During plant sexual reproduction, continuous exchange of signals between
   the pollen and the pistil (stigma, style, and ovary) plays important
   roles in pollen recognition and selection, establishing breeding
   barriers and, ultimately, leading to optimal seed set. After navigating
   through the stigma and the style, pollen tubes (PTs) reach their final
   destination, the ovule. This ultimate step is also regulated by numerous
   signals emanating from the embryo sac (ES) of the ovule. These signals
   encompass a wide variety of molecules, but species-specificity of the
   pollen-ovule interaction relies mainly on secreted proteins and their
   receptors. Isolation of candidate genes involved in pollen-pistil
   interactions has mainly relied on transcriptomic approaches, overlooking
   potential post-transcriptional regulation. To address this issue, ovule
   exudates were collected from the wild potato species Solanum chacoense
   using a tissue-free gravity-extraction method (if-GEM). Combined RNA-seq
   and mass spectrometry-based proteomics led to the identification of 305
   secreted proteins, of which 58\% were ovule-specific. Comparative
   analyses using mature ovules (attracting PTs) and immature ovules (not
   attracting PTs) revealed that the last maturation step of ES development
   affected almost half of the ovule secretome. Of 128 upregulated proteins
   in anthesis stage, 106 were not regulated at the mRNA level, emphasizing
   the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in reproductive
   development.}},

   concerned about her odd eating behaviors. Emily has been with her foster
   mother for 1 year after exposure to domestic violence. Emily's habit of
   eating nonfood items led to her foster mother providing 100\%
   supervision. Emily constantly picks up, smells, and tastes nonfood
   items, particularly rocks and things made of metal. She explores
   everything with her tongue. Emily scoops dirt and gravel from sidewalk
   crevices into her mouth. Although toileting, she catches and licks urine
   in her hand and searches for stool to put in her mouth. With
   redirection, Emily stopped putting feces into her mouth, but after
   spending time with her biological family, this behavior recurred.Emily
   does not like to eat foods that are hard or require chewing. She does
   not choke or gag on solid foods or liquids. She likes foods that are
   sweet. She refuses to eat vegetables and foods with certain textures.
   Emily pulls food apart with her hands before putting it in her
   mouth.Emily has global developmental delay, cerebral palsy, contractures
   in her legs, and strabismus. A medical workup resulted in a diagnosis of
   trisomy 4p and monosomy 9p. Emily works with a physical therapist and
   occupational therapist; she attends preschool in a special day class.
   She is an alert, playful, and socially engaging girl who walks with an
   abnormal gait, speaks in short sentences, and follows simple directions.}},

Abstract = {{Sea-salt aerosol (SSA) emissions have a significant impact on aerosol
   pollution and haze formation in the coastal areas. In this study, the
   Models-3/CMAQ modeling system was utilized to access the impact of SSA
   emissions on aerosol chemical formation and deposition over Pearl River
   Delta (PRD), China in July 2006. More SSAs were transported inland from
   the open-ocean under the southeast wind in summertime. Two experiments
   (with and without SSA emissions in the CMAQ model) were set up to
   compare the modeling results with each other. The results showed that
   the increase of sulfate concentrations was more attributable to the
   primary emissions of coarse SO42-particles in SSA, while the increase of
   nitrate concentrations were more attributable to secondary chemical
   formations, known as the mechanisms of chloride depletion in SSA. In the
   coastal areas, 17.6 \% of SO42-, 26.6\% of NO3- and 38.2\% of PM10
   concentrations were attributed to SSA emissions, while those portions
   were less than 1\% in the inland areas. The increases of PM10 and its
   components due to SSA emissions resulted in higher deposition fluxes
   over PRD, particularly in the coastal areas, except for the wet
   deposition of nitrate. Nitrate was more sensitive to SSA emissions in
   chemical formations than sulfate and dry deposition of aerosol was also
   more sensitive than that for wet deposition. Process analysis of sulfate
   and nitrate was applied to find out the difference of physical and
   chemical mechanisms between Guangzhou (the inland areas) and Zhuhai (the
   coastal areas). The negative contributions of dry deposition process to
   both sulfate and nitrate concentrations increased if SSA emissions were
   taken into account in the model, especially in Zhuhai. The negative
   contributions of cloud process also increased due to cloud scavenging
   and wet deposition process. In the coastal area, the gas-to-particle
   conversions became more active with high contributions of aerosol
   process to nitrate concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Delaunay meshes (DM) are a special type of triangle mesh where the local
   Delaunay condition holds everywhere. We present an efficient algorithm
   to convert an arbitrary manifold triangle mesh M into a Delaunay mesh.
   We show that the constructed DM has O(K-n) vertices, where n is the
   number of vertices in M and K is a model-dependent constant. We also
   develop a novel algorithm to simplify Delaunay meshes, allowing a smooth
   choice of detail levels. Our methods are conceptually simple,
   theoretically sound and easy to implement. The DM construction algorithm
   also scales well due to its O(nK log K) time complexity.
   Delaunay meshes have many favorable geometric and numerical properties.
   For example, a DM has exactly the same geometry as the input mesh, and
   it can be encoded by any mesh data structure. Moreover, the empty
   geodesic circumcircle property implies that the commonly used cotangent
   Laplace-Beltrami operator has non-negative weights. Therefore, the
   existing digital geometry processing algorithms can benefit the
   numerical stability of DM without changing any codes. We observe that
   DMs can improve the accuracy of the heat method for computing geodesic
   distances. Also, popular parameterization techniques, such as discrete
   harmonic mapping, produce more stable results on the DMs than on the
   input meshes.}},

   resource sharing and reuse become more and more imperative. It's a key
   issue that how to efficiently and reasonably dispatch users' tasks to
   different resources according to the Quality of Service(QoS)
   requirements of both cloud computing centers and users. In order to
   solve this problem, considering the new characteristics of cloud
   computing and original Adaptive Genetic Algorithm(AGA), a new scheduling
   algorithm based on double-fitness adaptive algorithm-job spanning time
   and user spending(QoS-GA) is proposed. This strategy not only works out
   a task scheduling sequence with shorter job spanning and average job
   computing time, but also satisfies subscriber's economic ability. At the
   same time, this paper adopts greedy algorithm to initialize the
   population, and weights multi-fitness function. Finally, we compare the
   performance of QoS-GA with AGA through simulations. It proves the
   validity of the scheduling algorithm and the effectiveness of the
   optimization method.}},

Abstract = {{Three kinds of three-dimensional (3D) CuxO catalysts were prepared to
   modify activated carbon air-cathode using a facile electrochemical
   method with addition of surfactants. The maximum power density of MFC
   using SC-Cu air cathode (added sodium citrate into the electrolyte
   solution in electrodeposition process) was 1550 +/- 47 mWm (2), almost
   77\% higher than AC cathode. Specifically, the charge transfer
   resistance significantly decreased by 89\% from 9.3980 Omega to 1.0640
   Omega compared to the control. Lumphy and mutually embedded filmy sheet
   structure were observed in SEM, which provided sufficient active sites
   for oxygen adsorption and diffusion. In XRD and TEM result, CuxO with
   mixed facets showed special structure which had a better performance.
   Crystallization condition of electrodeposited materials played a
   significant role in their nature electrochemical properties, morphology

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{Caloric effects are currently under intense study due to the prospect of
   environment-friendly cooling applications. Most of the research is
   centred on large magnetocaloric effects and large electrocaloric
   effects, but the former require large magnetic fields that are
   challenging to generate economically and the latter require large
   electric fields that can only be applied without breakdown in thin
   samples. Here we use small changes in hydrostatic pressure to drive
   giant inverse barocaloric effects near the ferrielectric phase
   transition in ammonium sulphate. We find barocaloric effects and
   strengths that exceed those previously observed near magnetostructural
   phase transitions in magnetic materials. Our findings should therefore
   inspire the discovery of giant barocaloric effects in a wide range of
   unexplored ferroelectric materials, ultimately leading to barocaloric
   cooling devices.}},

Abstract = {{Solid solutions of Ni in MgTiO3 ilmenite (geikielite) were investigated

   (Mg1-xNixTiO3, x=0-0.4) were prepared by solid-state and citrate-gel
   routes and fired pigments were characterized by XRD, SEM/EDX, UV-vis-NIR
   and color measurement techniques. The increase of Ni-doping enhanced
   ilmenite stabilization in ceramic samples, obtaining almost single phase
   of Ni-geikielite for x= 0.4 at 1200 and 1400 degrees C. Fired pigments
   exhibited intense yellow colors at both temperatures, associated to Ni2+
   ions in distorted octahedral A sites of ATiO(3) ilmenite, and an
   increase of the orange hue with firing temperature arising from an
   enhanced (Mg,Ni)O-6 polyhedral distortion. Noteworthy, citrate-gel
   samples exhibited a much higher reactivity, yielding well-crystallized
   Ni-geikielite at lower temperatures (800 degrees C/3 h), and leading to
   higher chroma yellow-orange colors even at lower Ni loadings. These
   pigments were partially stable in commercial low-temperature ceramic
   glazes, giving rise to weaker yellowish colors irrespective of the
   preparation route. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the clinical outcome among women who had
   undergone Miniarc T in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence
   (SUI).
   Study design: In this retrospective study from March 2010 to December
   2011 patients with clinically confirmed SUI and urodynamic stress
   incontinence (USI) underwent Single Incision Sling Procedure (SIS).
   Objective cure of SUI was defined as no urinary leakage on provocative
   filling cystometry and 1-hour pad test of <2 g. Subjective cure of SUI
   was the negative response to UDI-6. Assessment was done at baseline and
   after 1 year follow-up.
   Results: Postoperative data was available for 85 women. Five women were
   not able to participate in the follow-up schedule and post-op
   questionnaire. The objective data for post-operative follow-up was
   available from 80 women. The average period of follow-up was 1.4 years
   (range 1.0 to 2.1). A total of 14 women had immediate post-operative
   urine retention at the first 24 hours and 6 cases were due to
   over-tensioning of the sling after ultrasound assessment. No case of
   bladder or bowel injury was recorded and no other major complications
   noted. Pre and post clinical findings revealed a significant improvement
   after 1 year follow-up based on the response to UDI-6, IIQ-7 (<0.001)
   and PISQ-1 (0.12). Urodynamic parameters revealed an increase in MUCP
   however the other urodynamic parameters had no statistical difference (p
   > 0.05).
   Conclusions: In conclusion, Miniarc T was noted to have improvement in
   both subjective and objective clinical outcomes. Urethral indentation
   was noted and resolved by tape release on immediate postoperative
   voiding dysfunction. Copyright (C) 2015, The Asia-Pacific Association

Abstract = {{BackgroundHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common heritable
   cardiovascular disease and a leading cause of identifiable sudden
   cardiac death (SCD) in the young. Herein, we sought to determine the
   genotype-phenotype correlations in a cohort of unrelated, genotyped
   patients diagnosed with HCM at a young age, as well as to characterize
   the differences between HCM diagnosed in adulthood and HCM diagnosed at
   a young age.
   Methods and ResultsFrom 1999 to 2011, 1053 unrelated patients diagnosed
   with HCM were enrolled in research-based genetic testing. The electronic
   medical record was reviewed to identify those with HCM diagnosed at 21
   years (N = 137, mean age at diagnosis 13.2 6 years, 64\% male). From
   this cohort of patients recruited from a tertiary care referral center,
   the genetic test was positive in 71 (52\%), which was significantly
   higher than patients diagnosed >21 years (31\%; P < .001).
   Genotype-positive patients had increased maximum left ventricular wall
   thickness (24.9 +/- 8.0 vs. 21.6 +/- 7.4mm, P = .01) and higher
   incidence of reverse-curve ventricular septal morphology (71\% vs. 40\%,
   P < .001). Unrelated to genotype status, 26/137 patients (19\%)
   experienced significant HCM-related morbidity/mortality including
   progressive heart failure symptoms in 12, transplantation in 4, and
   death in 10.
   ConclusionsAmong patients diagnosed with HCM during the first two
   decades of life, the yield of genetic testing is significantly higher
   than when diagnosed at later age. While the phenotype of young HCM
   patients is worse than patients whose HCM is diagnosed at later age, the
   phenotypes of genotype-positive and genotype-negative young patients
   were similar. Independent of genotype, nearly 30\% of the patients with
   follow-up in this study had symptom progression, transplant, or death.}},

   (ca.790-605 Ma), with a well-documented subduction signature, and the
   high-grade metasedimentary rocks of the Sao Fidelis group. The
   arc-related rocks intruded the lower unit of the Sao Fidelis group,
   while both units are crosscut by syn-to late collision granitoids
   related to the development of different stages of the Brasiliano Orogeny
   (ca. 605-480 Ma). New U-Pb (LA-ICP-MS) data of detrital zircon grains
   from quartzites of the top unit of the Sao Fidelis group yielded a large
   spectrum of Mesoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic ages, with subordinated
   Archean and Neoproterozoic ones. The largest age peaks occur at ca. 1.2
   Ga and 2.2 Ga. The youngest detrital zircon of ca. 613 Ma, and
   metamorphic overprints, with ages varying from ca. 602 to 570 Ma bracket
   the age of sedimentation of the top unit. Two orthogneisses of the Rio
   Negro complex intruded within the basal unit of the Sao Fidelis Group
   rendered similar ages of ca.620 Ma. These orthogneisses and the basal
   unit of the Sao Fidelis group are interpreted as possible sources of the
   upper unit. The provenance pattern of the Sao Fidelis Group is similar
   to that of the Kaoko Belt, suggesting that the Angolan basement, where
   Mesoproterozoic ages are common, constitutes another important source
   area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) has been used for biodiesel
   production. An efficient sulfonated-glucose acid catalyst (SGAC) was
   prepared by sulfonation to catalyze the esterification reaction. The
   effect of three variables i.e. methanol-to-PFAD molar ratio, catalyst
   amount and reaction time, on the yield of PFAD esters was studied by the
   response surface methodology (RSM). The optimum reaction conditions
   were: 12.2:1 methanol-to-PFAD molar ratio, 2.9\% catalyst concentration
   and 134 min of time as predicted by the RSM. The reaction under the
   optimum conditions resulted in 94.5\% of the free fatty acid (FFA)
   conversion with 92.4\% of the FAME yield. The properties of the PFAD
   esters were determined according to biodiesel standards. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Multichannel space-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems that
   exploit receiving antenna subarrays displaced in the along-track
   direction have been shown to provide the capability to detect ground
   moving targets and potentially estimate their radial motion velocity,
   thus making possible their correct relocation inside the SAR image of
   the background. However, the use of only two receiving channels to
   contain cost, mass, and data-rate, imposes limitations in terms of
   potentiality of joint clutter cancelation and target velocity
   estimation. To overcome this problem, we propose a full MIMO SAR scheme
   obtained by transmitting nearly orthogonal waveforms with the two
   subarrays achieved from a single antenna aperture and receiving with the
   same subarrays. A complete processing chain for the joint detection,
   imaging, and radial speed estimation is presented showing that by
   properly applying the clutter cancelation step before waveform
   compression, a good clutter removal performance is obtained despite the
   waveforms are not fully orthogonal. The performance of the proposed MIMO
   system is deeply investigated and compared to the performance of
   conventional multichannel systems to assess the relative merits and
   drawbacks.}},

Abstract = {{In India, the rising prevalence of diabetes is a major public health
   challenge. The purpose of this study was to measure the level of
   diabetes knowledge in West Bengal, India, and to assess for a gradient
   in knowledge among those with varying levels of access to health care in
   both urban and rural environments. A validated questionnaire on diabetes
   knowledge was developed and administered in two health care settings in
   West Bengal: community clinics in low-income rural and urban communities
   representing the low-access group and a multi-specialty outpatient
   department (OPD) in Kolkata, India, representing the high-access group.
   Of the respondents in the low-access community clinic group, (n = 198),
   less than half knew what diabetes was (42.9 \%) compared to 89.9 \% in
   the high-access OPD group (n = 275) (p < 0.001). Those in the urban
   community clinics knew what diabetes was more often than those in the
   rural community clinics (49.5 vs. 36.1 \%, p = 0.058). Additional
   questions testing basic knowledge of diabetes, risk factors, and disease
   complications showed a similar trend that people in the low-access
   setting had limited knowledge regarding diabetes and significantly less
   knowledge when compared to those in the high-access setting.
   Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that clinic setting
   (high-access vs. low-access, p < 0.0001) and formal education (p =
   0.001) were independent predictors of diabetic knowledge, while age and
   sex were not. Diabetes knowledge among respondents with low access to
   health care in urban and rural community clinics was significantly
   poorer than those with higher access to health care in an urban hospital
   outpatient department. To help bridge this gap, diabetes education and
   prevention campaigns should be targeted towards populations with low
   access to health care in West Bengal.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent increases in the strength and frequency of occurrence of the
   trade wind inversion (TWI) are identified across a similar to 40-yr
   period (1973-2013) in Hawaii. Changepoint analysis indicates that a
   marked shift occurred in the early 1990s resulting in a 20\% increase in
   the mean TWI frequency between the periods 1973-90 and 1991-2013, based
   on the average of changes at two sounding stations and two 6-month (dry
   and wet) seasons. Regional increases in the atmospheric subsidence are
   identified in four reanalysis datasets over the same similar to 40-yr
   time period. The post-1990 period mean for the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis
   shows increases in subsidence of 33\% and 41\% for the dry and wet
   seasons, respectively. Good agreement was found between the time series
   of TWI frequency of occurrence and omega, suggesting that previously
   reported increases in the intensity of Hadley cell subsidence are
   driving the observed increases in TWI frequency. Correlations between
   omega and large-scale modes of internal climate variability such as El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific decadal oscillation
   (PDO) do not explain the abrupt shift in TWI frequency in the early
   1990s in both seasons. Reported increases in TWI frequency of occurrence
   may provide some explanation for climate change-related precipitation
   change at high elevations in Hawaii. On average, post-1990 rainfall was
   6\% lower in the dry season and 31\% lower in the wet season at nine
   high-elevation sites. Rainfall was significantly correlated with TWI
   frequency at all of the stations analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{The perceived distance between touches on the limbs is generally bigger
   for distances oriented across the width of the limb than for distances
   oriented along the length of the limb. The present study aimed to
   investigate the coherence of such distortions of tactile size perception
   across different skin surfaces. We investigated distortions of tactile
   size perception on the dorsal and palmar surfaces of both the left and
   right hands as well as the forehead. Participants judged which of two
   tactile distances felt larger. One distance was aligned with the
   proximodistal axis (along the body), the other with the mediolateral
   axis (across the body). Clear distortions were found on all five skin
   surfaces, with stimuli oriented across the width of the body being
   perceived as farther apart than those oriented along the length of the
   body. Consistent with previous results, distortions were smaller on the
   palmar than on the dorsal hand surface. Distortion on the forehead was
   intermediate between the dorsal and palmar surfaces. There were clear
   correlations between distortion on the left and right hands, for both
   the dorsal and palmar skin surfaces. In contrast, within each hand,
   there was no significant correlation between the two skin surfaces.
   Distortion on the forehead was not significantly correlated with that on
   any of the other skin surfaces. These results provide evidence for
   bilaterally symmetric representations underlying tactile size
   perception.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims. Acute leukemia (AL) is a heterogeneous group of
   diseases characterized by a disorganized clone proliferation of
   hematopoietic cells. Thymidine kinase (TK) is a cell enzyme involved in
   DNA synthesis and is considered a cellular proliferation marker in some
   solid tumors.
   Methods. A cross-sectional prospective and comparative study was
   perfonned in the Federico Gomez Children's Hospital in Mexico (HIMFG, in
   Spanish) in 125 samples of patients of the HIMFG with AL and 138 samples
   of children without leukemia. Serum TK levels were determined for both
   groups.
   Results. Of the children with AL, 90 presented B-cell acute
   lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL); 13, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
   (T-ALL); and 22, acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A median (m) TK level of
   23.7 IU (IQR 17-35.7) was observed in the group without AL and 91 IU
   (IQR 98-392) in the AL group. This difference was statistically
   significant (p < 0.0001). When analyzing TK levels according to the type
   of leukemia, the m was as follows: 68 IU (IQR 35-118) for B-ALL, 470 IU
   (IQR 88-750) for AML, and 1678 IU (IQR 288-2108) for T-ALL.
   Conclusion. TK is an enzyme showing heterogeneous levels in B-ALL

Abstract = {{Faecalibacterium prausnitzii depletion in intestinal diseases has been
   extensively reported, but little is known about intraspecies
   variability. This work aims to determine if subjects with
   gastrointestinal disease host mucosa-associated F. prausnitzii
   populations different from those hosted by healthy individuals. A new
   species-specific PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE)
   method targeting the 16S rRNA gene was developed to fingerprint F.
   prausnitzii populations in biopsy specimens from 31 healthy control (H)
   subjects and 36 Crohn's disease (CD), 23 ulcerative colitis (UC), 6
   irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and 22 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.
   The richness of F. prausnitzii subtypes was lower in inflammatory bowel
   disease (IBD) patients than in H subjects. The most prevalent
   operational taxonomic units (OTUs) consisted of four phylotypes (OTUs
   with a 99\% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity {[}OTU99]), which were
   shared by all groups of patients. Their distribution and the presence of
   some disease-specific F. prausnitzii phylotypes allowed us to
   differentiate the populations in IBD and CRC patients from that in H
   subjects. At the level of a minimum similarity of 97\% (OTU97), two
   phylogroups accounted for 98\% of the sequences. Phylogroup I was found
   in 87\% of H subjects but in under 50\% of IBD patients (P = 0.003). In
   contrast, phylogroup II was detected in >75\% of IBD patients and in
   only 52\% of H subjects (P = 0.005). This study reveals that even though
   the main members of the F. prausnitzii population are present in both H
   subjects and individuals with gut diseases, richness is reduced in the
   latter and an altered phylotype distribution exists between diseases.
   This approach may serve as a basis for addressing the suitability of F.
   prausnitzii phylotypes to be quantified as a putative biomarker of
   disease and depicting the importance of the loss of these subtypes in
   disease pathogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Our main objective is to study the prevalence of
   Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) in school children aged 6-16 years
   of an autonomous region of Spain (Castile and Leon), according to
   reports from the teachers and to analyze the impact of the disorder on
   academic performance and school behavior.
   Methods. Population study with stratified multistage, proportional and
   cluster design sample. Sample analyzed: 1,049. Cases were defined
   according to DSM-IV-TR criteria.
   Results. An overall prevalence rate of 4.2\% was found, this being
   significantly higher in males (5.7\%) compared to females (2.6\%) and in
   rural (6.8\% than in urban areas (3\%). No significant differences by
   grade or type of school were found. ODD prevalence without considering
   functional impairment would increase to 5.1\%. ODD cases have
   significantly worse academic outcomes (overall academic performance,
   reading, math and writing) and entail worse classroom behavior
   (relationship with peers, respect for rules, organizational skills,
   academic tasks and disruption of the class).
   Conclusions. Based on the prevalence, early onset, persistence of
   symptoms and social and academic dysfunction of ODD, early diagnosis and
   preventive intervention are necessary.}},

Abstract = {{The extended timescales involved in the decay of radioactive wastes to
   safe levels mean that geological disposal facilities must continue to
   function effectively long into the future. It is therefore essential to
   consider long-term climate evolution in post-closure performance
   assessments in order to evaluate a geological disposal system's response
   and robustness to a variety of potential environmental changes, driven
   by both natural and anthropogenic forcings. In this paper, we illustrate
   the multiple decay components that characterize the primary driver of
   climate change - atmospheric CO2 - in response to fossil fuel carbon
   emissions. We perform a multi-exponential analysis on a series of
   atmospheric CO2 decay curves predicted by an Earth system model and
   create an empirical response function that encapsulates the long-term (>
   1 kyr) removal of excess CO2 from the atmosphere. We present this
   response function as a simple tool for rapidly projecting the future
   atmospheric CO2 concentration resulting from any plausible cumulative
   release of CO2. We discuss the implications of the long `tail' to this
   atmospheric CO2 decay curve, both in terms of future climate evolution
   as well as potential impacts on radioactive waste repositories.}},

Journal = {{SUPERLATTICES AND MICROSTRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{47-52}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The degree of coupling between the electronic states of adjacent quantum
   wells (QWs) will depend on the sample structure and material properties
   of the QW and the barrier. The design of heterostructures containing
   multiple QWs requires the precise knowledge of the minimum barrier
   thickness to uncouple them. Due to the finite confinement in ultra-thin
   QWs (UTQWs, thickness of a few monolayers), the electron and hole wave
   functions present a large penetration within the barriers; the
   penetration length may exceed many times the thickness of the UTQW.
   Following the evolution of the electron and hole states as a function of
   the barrier thickness of a symmetric double quantum well system, we have
   determined the thickness of the ZnSe barrier required to uncouple CdSe
   UTQWs. We found that ZnSe barriers with thickness in the range from 70
   to 30 monolayers (ML) are necessary to uncouple symmetric double CdSe
   UTQWs with thickness in the range from 1 to 5 ML, respectively.
   Therefore, the thinner the QWs the thicker the barrier required to
   uncouple them. The coupling/uncoupling of asymmetric double UTQWs (2 and
   3 ML CdSe) system was experimentally verified by the analysis of the low
   temperature excitonic spectra. The sample with a 5 nm ZnSe barrier
   indicates the presence of coupling because we observe only one peak
   corresponding to the lowest energy transition; for the case of the
   uncoupled asymmetric UTQWs, with a 10 nm ZnSe barrier, the spectrum
   presents two peaks, one for each independent (single) UTQW. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The present paper aims to provide an overview on Kant's dealing with the
   main theories of causality which were proposed and discussed in his
   time. The goal is to show that, since the pre-critical period, he has
   never simply accepted the theories of causality that he could find in
   second-scholastic sources, but has always tried to develop an original
   position. Starting from a general acceptance of the theory of the
   ``physical influx{''}, Kant tries to amend this theory, as it had been
   roughly provided by Knutzen and Crusius. This emendation is carried out
   through elements coming from the Leibnitian tradition. But neither in
   this field Kant totally embraces the Wolffian, as well as the
   Baumgartenian model. The paper tries also to shed light on the way in
   which the critical conception of space allows Kant to fulfill his
   original theory of causality as an amended version of the physical
   influx.}},

   Conditions for immobilizing Arsenazo I on the aminated silica surface
   were studied: optimal equilibration time was 10 min, and a maximum
   reagent extraction was achieved between pHs 4 and 7. The stability of
   the sorbent in highly saline and weakly acidic solutions was examined:
   it was found that the reagent had not been desorbed from the surface by
   treatment with dilute solutions of HNO3 and NaCl solutions up to a
   concentration of 10 g/L. Maximum recovery of Al(III), Ca(II), Cd(II),
   Co(II), Cu(II), Fe(II), Fe(III), Mg(II), Ni(II), Pb(II), and St(II) was
   observed in the pH range of 5-7. Metals were desorbed from the surface
   with 1 M HNO3. Sorptioninductively coupled plasma optical emission
   method for the determination of metal ions had been developed, including
   group sorption preconcentration of metal ions from aqueous solutions at
   pH 7 in the hydrocarbonate buffer medium, their desorption with 1 M
   HNO3, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission determination. The
   proposed method was used to determine metal concentration in river

Abstract = {{Environmental enrichment (EE) is a non-pharmacological manipulation that
   promotes diverse forms of benefits in the central nervous system of
   captive animals. It is thought that EE influences animal behavior in a
   specie-(strain)-specific manner. Since rodents in general present
   different behaviors during distinct periods of the day, in this study we
   aimed to investigate the influence of time-of-day on behavioral
   repertoire of Swiss mice that reared in EE. Forty male Swiss mice (21
   days old) were housed in standard (SC) or enriched conditions (EC) for
   60 days. Behavioral assessments were conducted during the light phase
   (in presence of light) or dark phase (in absence of light) in the
   following tasks: open field, object recognition and elevated plus maze.
   First, we observed that the locomotor and exploratory activities are
   distinct between SC and EC groups only during the light phase. Second,
   we observed that ``self-protective behaviors{''} were increased in EC
   group only when mice were tested during the light phase. However, ``less
   defensive behaviors{''} were not affected by both housing conditions and
   time-of-day. Third, we showed that the performance of EE animals in
   object recognition task was improved in both light and dark conditions.
   Our findings highlight that EE-induced alterations in exploratory and
   emotional behaviors are just evident during light conditions. However,
   EE-induced cognitive benefits are remarkable even during dark
   conditions, when exploratory and emotional behaviors were similar
   between groups. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A multimodal damping strategy is implemented by coupling a beam to its
   analogue electrical network. This network comes from the direct
   electromechanical analogy applied to a transverse lattice of point
   masses that represents the discrete model of a beam. The mechanical and
   electrical structures are connected together through an array of
   piezoelectric patches. A discrete and a semi-continuous model are
   proposed to describe the piezoelectric coupling. Both are based on the
   transfer matrix formulation and consider a finite number of patches. It
   is shown that a simple coupling condition gives a network that
   approximates the modal properties of the beam. A multimodal tuned mass
   effect is then obtained and a wide-band damping is introduced by
   choosing a suitable positioning for resistors in the network. The
   strategy and the models are experimentally validated by coupling a
   free-free beam to a completely passive network. A multimodal vibration
   reduction is observed, which proves the efficiency of the control
   solution and its potential in term of practical implementation.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The structure and chemistry of magnesium silicate hydrates (M-S-H) is
   significantly different from calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H), although
   both phases are poorly crystalline and have a variable chemical
   composition. The molar Ca/Si ratio in synthetic C-S-H varies from
   approximately 0.7 to 1.5 and the Mg/Si ratio in M-S-H from 0.7 to 13. In
   M-S-H silica sheets are present, while the silica in C-S-H is organized
   in single chains. In addition, M-S-H contains more chemically bound
   water than C-S-H. Analyses of synthetic samples containing both
   magnesium and calcium with a total (Mg + Ca)/Si of 0.8 indicate the
   formation of separate M-S-H and C-S-H gels with no or very little uptake
   of magnesium in C-S-H or calcium in M-S-H. The clear difference in the
   silica structure and the difference in ionic radius of Ca2+ and Mg2+
   make the formation of an extended solid solution between M-S-H and C-S-H
   gel improbable. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In integrated cavity output spectroscopy (ICOS), a long optical cavity
   is often required for suppressing mode structure, which, however, blocks
   its application for fabricating compact gas sensors requiring gas cells
   with the volume at milliliter level or less. In this paper, we
   demonstrate that low-cost free-running Fabry-Perot diode lasers have
   intrinsic capability for promoting suppression of cavity resonance due
   to the broad linewidth. The ICOS is performed, for the first time to our
   best knowledge, by using a short cavity of less than 1 cm with a cavity
   volume of only 4.7 cm(3). By introduction of the scheme of correlation
   spectroscopy, the problem of laser mode competitions is resolved. A
   minimum detectable absorption of 8.7 x 10(-5) Hz(-1/2) (noise-equivalent
   absorption sensitivity of 3.3 x 10(-7) cm(-1) Hz(-1/2)) is achieved. The
   performance is suitable for applications in which both high sensitivity
   and small gas cell volume are required.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: A strong association has been established between migraine
   and depression. However, this is the first study to differentiate in a
   large sample of migraine patients for symptom dimensions of the
   affective disorder spectrum.
   Methods: Migraine patients (n = 3174) from the LUMINA (Leiden University
   Medical Centre Migraine Neuro-analysis Program) study and patients with
   current psychopathology (n = 1129), past psychopathology (n = 477), and
   healthy controls (n = 561) from the NESDA (Netherlands Study of
   Depression and Anxiety) study, were compared for three symptom
   dimensions of depression and anxiety. The dimensions lack of positive
   affect (depression specific); negative affect (nonspecific); and somatic
   arousal (anxiety specific) were assessed by a shortened adaptation of
   the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ-D30). Within the
   migraine group, the association with migraine specific determinants was
   established. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted.
   Results: Migraine patients differed significantly (p < 0.001) from
   healthy controls for all three dimensions: Cohen's d effect sizes were
   037 for lack of positive affect, 0.68 for negative affect, and 0.75 for
   somatic arousal. For the lack of positive affect and negative affect
   dimensions, migraine patients were predominantly similar to the past
   psychopathology group. For the somatic arousal dimension, migraine
   patients scores were more comparable with the current psychopathology
   group. Migraine specific determinants for high scores on all dimensions
   were high frequency of attacks and cutaneous allodynia during attacks.
   Conclusion: This study shows that affective symptoms in migraine
   patients are especially associated with the somatic arousal component.

Abstract = {{The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) requires company executives to
   certify financial statements and internal controls as a means of
   reducing fraud. Many companies have operationalized this by instituting
   a sub-certification process and requiring lower-level managers to sign
   certification statements. These lower-level organizational members are
   often the individuals who are aware of fraud and are in the best
   position to provide information on the fraudulent act. However, the
   sub-certification process may have the effect of reducing employees'
   intentions to report wrongdoing. We suggest that subordinates with
   knowledge of a superior who committed a fraudulent act and certified
   that there is no fraud will feel less personal responsibility to report
   the act, thus, decreasing reporting intentions. Additionally, we suggest
   that if the fraud is discovered subsequent to the reports being filed
   with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), employees will
   perceive lower management responsiveness to investigate the fraud, which
   will reduce intentions to report. Using an experimental approach, we
   manipulate two between-participant variables: (1) the presence or
   absence of sub-certification by the transgressor and (2) the timing of
   fraud discovery, either before or after the reports have been filed with
   the SEC. We find that when sub-certification is present, perceived
   personal responsibility and intentions to report were diminished
   compared to when sub-certification is absent. Timing of the discovery of
   the fraudulent act did not influence perceived management responsiveness
   or reporting intentions. Supplemental analysis shows that personal
   responsibility partially mediates the relationship between
   sub-certification and reporting intentions. Our findings suggest that
   audit committees and senior executives may want to carefully consider
   the costs and benefits of the sub-certification process.}},

Abstract = {{A simultaneously process for formation and coating of nanoporous carbon
   microspheres (CMS) on fluorine doped tin oxide glass using hydrothermal
   method and carrot juice as natural carbon source was demonstrated. The
   resulting material was used as a counter electrode (CE) for a
   dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The solar power conversion efficiency
   of this DSSC CE was 0.17\% under simulated solar illumination at 100
   mW/cm(2), AM 1.5. After annealing CMS in an argon atmosphere, an
   annealed-CMS (A-CMS) DSSC efficiency of 7.71\% was achieved due to
   nanoporous formation on CMS. This competes well with a DSSC using
   platinum as CE having an efficiency of 8.05\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Accurate knowledge of antecedent soil moisture (SM) and snow depth (SD)
   conditions is often important for obtaining reliable hydrological
   simulations of stream flow. Data assimilation (DA) methods can be used
   to integrate remotely sensed (RS) SM and SD retrievals into a hydrology
   model and improve such simulations. In this paper, we examine the impact
   of assumed model and observation error variance on stream flow estimates
   obtained by assimilating RS SM and SD data into a lumped hydrological
   model. The analysis is based on both synthetic and real DA experiments
   conducted within the Tuotuo River watershed at the headwaters of the
   Yangtze River. Synthetic experiments demonstrate that, when the true
   model error variance is small, DA is more sensitive to the
   overestimation of the error variance than to its underestimation.
   Conversely, if the true variance is large, DA is sensitive to the
   assumed model error variance but not the underestimation of the
   observation error variance. Given this sensitivity, the maximum a
   posteriori (MAP) estimation method is applied to accurately estimate
   model and observation error variances. In general, MAP is able to
   identify model and observation error parameters associated with an
   accurate stream flow analysis. However, its utility is somewhat limited
   by equifinality with regard to observation error statistics.}},

Abstract = {{Many authoritarian regimes lack an independent judiciary. This article
   studies the effect of firms' political connectedness on court outcomes
   using a unique hand-collected data set of 3,323 commercial lawsuits

   Chinese courts favor state firms and private firms with personal
   political ties. The positive effect of political connectedness is
   pronounced in the outcomes of litigation but not arbitration and is less
   pronounced in regions with better legal institutions. We also find that
   locally connected firms are favored in their home courts but not when
   the case is tried outside their home province. There is some evidence
   that China's 2007 Property Law reduces the advantage of state firms. Our
   results cast light on the welfare redistribution role of courts in
   emerging and transitional economies.}},

Abstract = {{Nondestructive evaluation of melon quality is in great need of
   comprehensive study. Soluble solids content (SSC) and firmness are the
   two indicators of melon internal quality that mostly affect consumer
   acceptance. To provide guidance for fruit classification, internal
   quality standards was preliminarily established through sensory test,
   as: Melon with SSC over 12 degrees Brix, firmness 4-5.5 kgf . cm(-2)
   were considered as satisfactory class sample; and SSC over 10 degrees
   Brix, firmness 3.5-6.5 kgf . cm(-2) as average class sample. The near
   infrared (NIR) nondestructive detection program was set as spectra
   collected from the stylar-end, Brix expressed by the average SSC of
   inner and outer mesocarp, each cultivar of melon was detected with its
   own optimum integration time, and the second derivative algorithm was
   used to equalize them. Using wavelength selected by genetic algorithms
   (GA), a robust SSC model of mix-cultivar melon was established, the root
   mean standard error of cross-validation (RMSECV) was 0.99 and the ratio
   performance deviation (RPD) nearly reached 3.0, which almost could meet
   the accuracy requirement of 1.5 degrees Brix. Firmness model of

Abstract = {{Noise is one of the most pervasive occupational health problems. Noise
   contours provide useful information by clearly identifying areas where
   noise hazards exist. This study finds an efficient algorithm for
   computing sound level in industrial buildings that accounts for
   reverberation effects. This study proposes an analytical image method to
   calculate workplace noise distribution by using machinery noise
   labeling. Contours are then obtained by joining locations with equal
   noise levels using commercially available software. To demonstrate the
   application of the proposed method, a manufacturing plant building is
   considered. The computation algorithm accounts for distance and sound
   reflection to construct noise contours. The proposed approach could be
   used in industry for noise management when designing new plant buildings
   and installing machines.Practical applications: Machine noise emission
   information will be widely used in practice to evaluate the potential
   and performance of noise levels in industrial buildings. Plant buildings
   should be designed to prevent or minimize any risks to health or safety
   resulting from the emission of noise. The construction of noise contours

Abstract = {{In this paper, a converter-based dc microgrid is studied. By considering
   the impact of each component in dc microgrids on system stability, a
   multistage configuration is employed, which includes the source stage,
   interface converter stage between buses, and common load stage. In order
   to study the overall stability of the above dc microgrid with constant
   power loads (CPLs), a comprehensive small-signal model is derived by
   analyzing the interface converters in each stage. The instability issue
   induced by the CPLs is revealed by using the criteria of impedance
   matching. Meanwhile, virtual-impedance-based stabilizers are proposed in
   order to enhance the damping of dc microgrids with CPLs and guarantee
   the stable operation. Since droop control is commonly used to reach
   proper load power sharing in dc microgrids, its impact is taken into
   account when testing the proposed stabilizers. By using the proposed
   stabilizers, virtual impedances are employed in the output filters of
   the interface converters in the second stage of the multistage
   configuration. In particular, one of the virtual impedances is connected
   in series with the filter capacitor, and the other one is connected at
   the output path of the converter. It can be seen that by using the
   proposed stabilizers, the unstable poles induced by the CPLs are forced
   to move into the stable region. The proposed method is verified by the
   MATLAB/Simulink model of multistage dc microgrids with three distributed
   power generation units.}},

Abstract = {{Mine fire is a serious environment, health, and safety hazard throughout
   the world. Through analyzing the drawbacks of traditional extinguishing
   techniques on dealing with fire at top of goaf, we propose a new foam
   preparation method to make extinguishing foam. It uses a jet device to
   add foaming agent and a foam generator to produce foam. The driving
   powers are water pressure and compressed gas, which have strong
   intrinsic safety for application in underground coal mines. Testing
   results show that foam diffuses fast at the initial stage of infusion in
   the goaf, while the foam diffusion velocity finally maintains at
   0.0084-0.0087 m/s. With a large tensile deformation, the foam flowing
   through a fracture aisle is within 0.4 s. The expansion foam accumulates
   upwards until it extinguishes fire at top of the goaf, making a sharp
   decrease on the fire source temperatures. It is feasible that foam is
   infused into the goaf discontinuously with an interval time less than
   the foam half-life to get a reasonable economic cost input and a good
   foam accumulation in the goaf.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental study on the effectiveness of
   simultaneous application of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) and
   steel jacket in strengthening slender reinforced concrete (RC) column.
   The columns were 200 mm square cross section with lengths ranging from
   1600 to 3000 mm. Ten columns were tested under axial load. The effects
   of the strengthening technique, slenderness ratio, cross-section area of
   steel angle and CFRP layer number were examined in terms of axial
   load-axial strain curve, CFRP strain, steel strip strain and steel angle
   strain. The experiments indicate that strengthening RC columns with
   combined CFRP and steel jacket is effective in enhancing the load
   capacity, ductility and energy dissipation capacity of RC column. Based
   on the existing models for RC columns strengthened with CFRP and with
   steel jacket, a design formula considering a slenderness reduction
   factor is proposed to predict the load capacity of the RC columns
   strengthened with combined CFRP and steel jacket. The predictions agree
   well with the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Background: To understand the threat posed by localized prostate cancer
   and the potential impact of surgery or radiation, patients and
   healthcare providers require information on long-term outcomes following
   conservative management.
   Objective: To describe15-yr survival outcomesandcancer
   therapyutilizationamongmen 65 years and oldermanaged conservatively for
   newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer. Design, settings, and
   participants: This is a population-based cohort study with participants
   living in predefined geographic areas covered by the Surveillance,
   Epidemiology, and End Results program. The study includes 31 137
   Medicare patients aged >= 65 yr diagnosed with localized prostate cancer
   in 1992-2009 who initially received conservative management (no surgery,
   radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or androgen deprivation therapy {[}ADT]). All
   patients were followed until death or December 31, 2009 (for prostate
   cancer-specific mortality {[}PCSM]) and December 31, 2011 (for overall
   mortality).
   Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Competing-risk analyses
   were used to examine PCSM, overall mortality, and utilization of cancer
   therapies.
   Results and limitations: The 15-yr risk of PCSM for men aged 65-74 yr
   diagnosed with screening-detected prostate cancer was 5.7\% (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] 3.7-8.0\%) for T1c Gleason 5-7 and 22\% (95\%
   CI 16-35\%) for Gleason 8-10 disease. After 15 yr of followup, 24\%
   (95\% CI 21-27\%) of men aged 65-74 yr with screening-detected Gleason
   5-7 cancer received ADT. The corresponding result for men with Gleason
   8-10 cancer was 38\% (95\% CI 32-44\%). The major study limitations are
   the lack of data for men aged < 65 yr and detailed clinical information
   associated with secondary cancer therapy.
   Conclusions: The 15-yr outcomes following conservative management of
   newly diagnosed Gleason 5-7 prostate cancer among men aged >= 65 yr are
   excellent. Men with Gleason 8-10 disease managed conservatively face a
   significant risk of PCSM.
   Patient summary: We examined the long-term survival outcomes for a large
   group of patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer who did not
   have surgery, radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or androgen deprivation therapy
   in the first 6 mo after cancer diagnosis. We found that the 15-yr
   disease-specific survival is excellent for men diagnosed with Gleason
   5-7 disease. The data support conservative management as a reasonable
   choice for elderly patients with low-grade localized prostate cancer.

Abstract = {{Stirred-tank reactors (STR), in which gas and liquid phases make
   intimate contact for mass transfer, are quite common in chemical
   processes. Mechanical agitation enhances the mixing performance and the
   oxygen transfer capability in bio-STR, but they cannot be aerated at
   high rates because of impeller flooding. Another type of reactor widely
   used in bioprocessing is the airlift bioreactor, which consists of a
   draft tube and operates with an internal airlift loop. In this work, the
   mass transfer characteristics of a draft tube-impeller agitation system
   (combination of a conventional airlift and a stirred bioreactor) were
   investigated in a large-scale tank. The draft tube design configuration
   shows superior mass transfer performance compared to a conventional
   down-pumping agitation system consisting of a Rushton turbine combined
   with a pitched-blade turbine.}},

Abstract = {{Seabird bycatch represents one of the main threats to vulnerable seabird
   populations, particularly albatross and petrels, and requires urgent
   conservation management interventions at a global scale. We studied
   seabird mortality associated with demersal factory trawl vessels that
   target Argentine Hake Merluccius hubbsi along the Argentine Patagonian
   Shelf and tested the efficacy of bird-scaring lines as a seabird bycatch
   mitigation measure. From November 2008 to June 2010, dedicated seabird
   observers recorded three sources of seabird mortality: entanglements
   with the trawl net; collisions with the trawl cables (corpses hauled
   aboard); and collisions with trawl cables (birds observed killed or
   injured). During 141 days and 389 hauls, we recorded 17 seabird species
   associated with vessels, ten of which interacted with fishing gear. The
   most vulnerable species was the black-browed albatross (Thalassarche
   melanophris). From 41 recovered corpses, we identified black-browed
   albatross mortality rates of 0.013 and 0.093 birds/haul for net
   entanglement and cable collision (corpses hauled aboard), respectively.
   From counts of birds killed or injured by cable collisions, we estimate
   a black-browed albatross mortality rate of 0.237 birds/h. We use
   official fishing effort data to consider the potential scale of seabird
   mortality for the entire fleet and identify the main factors
   contributing to seabird mortality in this fishery. Bird-scaring lines
   eliminated seabird mortality caused by collisions with trawl cables and
   are recommended as a short- to medium-term measure to mitigate seabird
   mortality in this fishery.}},

   INH-nf) is used to treat acute angioedema attacks in patients with
   hereditary angioedema (HAE), but data regarding use in children are
   sparse.
   Methods: Patients 2 to <12 years of age, body weight >= 10 kg, with a
   diagnosis of HAE type I or II, were recruited for a multicenter
   open-label trial. Patients were recruited into 2 weight categories
   (10-25 kg, >25 kg). Each weight category included 2 dosing levels: C1
   INH-nf (500 units {[}U], 1000 U) and C1 INH-nf (1000 U, 1500 U),
   respectively. Patients experiencing an angioedema attack were given a
   single intravenous dose. Primary efficacy end-point was the onset of
   unequivocal relief of the defining symptom within 4 h following
   initiation of C1 INH-nf treatment.
   Results: Nine children were treated: 3 (10-25 kg) received 500 U; 3 (>25
   kg) received 1000 U; and 3 (> 25 kg) received 1500 U. The lower
   weight/higher dose category (10-25 kg, 1000 U) was not successfully
   enrolled. All patients completed the study. Most angioedema attacks (n =
   5) were abdominal. All patients met the primary end-point; median time
   to unequivocal symptom relief was 0.5 (range: 0.25-2.5) h. Doses of C1
   INH-nf ranged from 20.8 to 51.9 U/kg.
   Conclusions: Treatment of a single angioedema attack with C1 INH-nf
   doses of 500 U (in patients 10-25 kg), 1000 U, and 1500 U (in patients >
   25 kg) were well tolerated. Doses of C1 INH-nf <1000 U may be
   appropriate in some pediatric patients.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of the first filling process of the Xiluodu super-high arch dam
   are studied by both field monitoring and numerical modelling methods.
   The numerical modelling is conducted by the three-dimensional nonlinear
   finite element method, which takes into account the nonlinear contact of
   the transverse joints between dam monoliths and adopts both the design
   and feedback parameters of the dam. The results obtained from the
   various numerical analysis cases for different impounded water levels
   are comprehensively compared with those obtained from the field
   monitoring. Throughout this study, it is concluded that: (1) changes of
   the hydrostatic load resulting from the filling process have a
   significant effect on the deformation and stress states of the dam and
   foundation. The foundation settles as a consequence of consolidation of
   the reservoir bed under the effect of the water mass. During the filling
   process, the compressive stress of the dam in the sealed region
   increases in the arch direction while that in the cantilever direction
   decreases, which reveals an enhancement of dam thrust into the two
   banks. (2) The transverse joints between the dam monoliths are
   compressed almost over the entire height of the poured dam, and their
   aperture gradually decreases as the impounded water level increases. (3)
   The overall deformation of the Xiluodu dam is obviously affected by the
   uneven foundation settlement due to the complex reservoir basin. The
   tensile stress concentration appears at the crossing zone of the top of
   the dam's sealed region and the dam-foundation interface. Thus,
   reasonable layout of steel bars and suitable jointing design are
   essential in these tensile stress concentration regions. (4) The dam
   behaviour predicted using the three-dimensional numerical modelling is
   in good agreements with that from the field measuring in terms of the
   stress and strain distribution characteristics in the dam and
   foundation, especially when the feedback parameters are adopted for the
   numerical analysis. The results from both the field monitoring and
   numerical modelling reveal that overall stability of the dam during the
   first filling process meets the dam operational requirements.}},

Title = {{The Association of H1N1 Pandemic Influenza with Congenital Anomaly
   Prevalence in Europe An Ecological Time Series Study}},

Abstract = {{Background: In the context of the European Surveillance of Congenital
   Anomalies (EUROCAT) surveillance response to the 2009 influenza
   pandemic, we sought to establish whether there was a detectable increase
   of congenital anomaly prevalence among pregnancies exposed to influenza
   seasons in general, and whether any increase was greater during the 2009
   pandemic than during other seasons.
   Methods: We performed an ecologic time series analysis based on 26,967
   pregnancies with nonchromosomal congenital anomaly conceived from
   January 2007 to March 2011, reported by 15 EUROCAT registries. Analysis
   was performed for EUROCAT-defined anomaly subgroups, divided by whether
   there was a prior hypothesis of association with influenza. Influenza
   season exposure was based on World Health Organization data. Prevalence
   rate ratios were calculated comparing pregnancies exposed to influenza
   season during the congenital anomaly-specific critical period for
   embryo-fetal development to nonexposed pregnancies.
   Results: There was no evidence for an increased overall prevalence of
   congenital anomalies among pregnancies exposed to influenza season. We
   detected an increased prevalence of ventricular septal defect and
   tricuspid atresia and stenosis during pandemic influenza season 2009,
   but not during 2007-2011 influenza seasons. For congenital anomalies,
   where there was no prior hypothesis, the prevalence of tetralogy of
   Fallot was strongly reduced during influenza seasons.
   Conclusions: Our data do not suggest an overall association of pandemic
   or seasonal influenza with congenital anomaly prevalence. One
   interpretation is that apparent influenza effects found in previous
   individual-based studies were confounded by or interacting with other
   risk factors. The associations of heart anomalies with pandemic
   influenza could be strain specific.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Kinesio Taping (R) has been widely used in clinical
   practice. However, it is unknown whether this type of tape is more
   effective than placebo taping in patients with chronic lower back pain.
   Objective: To compare the effectiveness of Kinesio Taping (R) in
   patients with chronic non-specific low back pain against a placebo tape
   and a control group. Method: This is a 3-arm, randomized controlled
   trial with a blinded assessor. Sixty patients with chronic non-specific
   low back pain were randomized into one of the three groups: Kinesio
   Taping (R) group (n=20), Micropore (R) (placebo) group (n=20) and
   control group (n=20). Patients allocated to both the Kinesio Taping (R)
   group and the placebo group used the different types of tape for a
   period of 48 hours. The control group did not receive any intervention.
   The outcomes measured were pain intensity (measured by an 11-point
   numerical rating scale) and disability (measured by the 24-item Roland
   Morris Disability Questionnaire). A blinded assessor measured the
   outcomes at baseline, 48 hours and 7 days after randomization. Results:
   After 48 hours, there was a statistically significant difference between
   the Kinesio Taping (R) group versus the control group (mean
   between-group difference = -3.1 points, 95\% CI=-5.2 to -1.1, p=0.003),
   but no difference when compared to the placebo group (mean between-group
   difference= 1.9 points, 95\% CI=-0.2 to 3.9, p=0.08). For the other
   outcomes no differences were observed. Conclusions: The Kinesio Taping
   (R) is not better than placebo (Micropore (R)) in patients with chronic
   low back pain.}},

Abstract = {{Human housekeeping genes are often confused with essential human genes,
   and several studies regard both types of genes as having the same level
   of evolutionary conservation. However, this is not necessarily the case.
   To clarify this, we compared the differences between human housekeeping
   genes and essential human genes with respect to four aspects: the
   evolutionary rate (dN/dS), protein sequence identity, single-nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) density and level of linkage disequilibrium (LD). The
   results showed that housekeeping genes had lower evolutionary rates,
   higher sequence identities, lower SNP densities and higher levels of LD
   compared with essential genes. Together, these findings indicate that
   housekeeping and essential genes are two distinct types of genes, and
   that housekeeping genes have a higher level of evolutionary
   conservation. Therefore, we suggest that researchers should pay careful
   attention to the distinctions between housekeeping genes and essential
   genes. Moreover, it is still controversial whether we should substitute
   human orthologs of mouse essential genes for human essential genes.
   Therefore, we compared the evolutionary features between human orthologs
   of mouse essential genes and human housekeeping genes and we got
   inconsistent results in long-term and short-term evolutionary
   characteristics implying the irrationality of simply replacing human
   essential genes with human orthologs of mouse essential genes.}},

Abstract = {{Recent wind-tunnel tests at the NASA Langley Research Center National
   Transonic Facility used high-pressure bellows to route air to the
   semispan model for evaluating aircraft circulation control testing

   measurement system. A capability has been developed to facilitate
   system-level calibrations that characterize the performance of the force
   measurement system under influence of static pressure tare and thermal
   effects. From the highest system-level perspective, the aerodynamic
   research being conducted using this system would benefit from a
   system-level calibration at conditions that most accurately simulate
   testlike operating conditions. Detail is given on the recent
   improvements and design modifications to improve performance and
   calibration of the system as well as recommendations for future
   improvements. Experimental data from recent testing using the force
   measurement system are presented, with the results supporting the
   necessity for future system enhancements to improve system performance.}},

Abstract = {{De novo sequencing software has been widely used in proteomics to
   sequence new peptides from tandem mass spectrometry data. This study
   presents a new software tool, Novor, to greatly improve both the speed
   and accuracy of today's peptide de novo sequencing analyses. To improve
   the accuracy, Novor's scoring functions are based on two large decision
   trees built from a peptide spectral library with more than 300,000
   spectra with machine learning. Important knowledge about peptide
   fragmentation is extracted automatically from the library and
   incorporated into the scoring functions. The decision tree model also
   enables efficient score calculation and contributes to the speed
   improvement. To further improve the speed, a two-stage algorithmic
   approach, namely dynamic programming and refinement, is used. The
   software program was also carefully optimized. On the testing datasets,
   Novor sequenced 7\%-37\% more correct residues than the state-of-the-art
   de novo sequencing tool, PEAKS, while being an order of magnitude
   faster. Novor can de novo sequence more than 300 MS/MS spectra per
   second on a laptop computer. The speed surpasses the acquisition speed
   of today's mass spectrometer and, therefore, opens a new possibility to
   de novo sequence in real time while the spectrometer is acquiring the
   spectral data.}},

Abstract = {{Chromium (VI) {[}Cr(VI)] and nitrosamines such as N-nitrosodimethylamine
   (NDMA) exist commonly in the environment. To evaluate the potential
   influence of Cr(VI) co-exposure on the carcinogenic risk of NDMA, Female
   Wistar rats were treated with various concentrations of Cr(VI) and/or
   NDMA via drinking water for 15 days and the DNA adducts
   (O-6-methylguanine, O-6-MeG) of NDMA in liver tissue was used as a
   bioindicator. The results showed that Cr(VI) synergistically enhanced
   the O-6-MeG formation, which could lead to an increase in DNA damage and
   carcinogenic potential. Although Cr(VI) did not alter the CYP 2E1 enzyme
   activity, it decreased GSH content, which would be an potential
   mechanism for the potentiated O-6-MeG formation by Cr(VI) co-exposure.
   These results would contribute to the development of quantitative risk
   assessment of NDMA or even for a group of nitrosamines under
   environmental mixture exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The compatibility between isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and
   ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer (EPDM) in the blends was studied.
   SAXS analysis indicates that iPP and EPDM phases in the binary blend are
   incompatible. Isothermal crystallization behaviors of iPP in
   phase-separated iPP/EPDM were studied by in situ POM equipped with a
   Linkam shear hot stage. It was found that typical spherulites of iPP
   were formed both in neat iPP and in iPP/EPDM blends. The radial growth
   rate (dR/dt) of spherulites of iPP in the blend was not influenced by
   EPDM phases. Further investigations on isothermal crystallization of iPP
   in iPP/EPDM after shear with a fixed shear time showed that the
   crystallization rate of iPP in the blends increased with increasing
   shear rates, whereas, the crystallization rate was much lower than that
   of neat iPP. WAXD results showed that beta-crystal iPP was formed in
   neat iPP as well as in iPP/EPDM blends after shearing and the percentage
   of beta-crystal bore a relationship to the applied shear rate. The
   presence of EPDM resulted in lower percentage of beta-crystal in the
   blends than that in neat iPP under the same constant shear conditions.
   SAXS experiments revealed that shear flow could induce formation of
   oriented lamellae in iPP and iPP in the blends, and the presence of EPDM
   led to a reduced fraction of oriented lamellae.}},

Abstract = {{Polycrystalline Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 thin films were synthesized as absorber
   layers in solar cells using a simple synthetic route. In this synthesis,
   selenium ion-containing precursors were heated in a reducing atmosphere
   to yield CIGS films instead of conventional heating in a
   selenium-containing atmosphere. Selenium ions were incorporated into the
   precursor films to form chalcopyrite-type CIGS films at comparatively
   low temperature (350 degrees C). As the heating temperature increased,
   the crystallinity and density of the formed CIGS films improved. The
   open circuit voltage (V-oc), short circuit current density (J(sc)), fill
   factor (FF) and conversion efficiency (eta) of the prepared solar cells
   also substantially increased with the heating temperature. CIGS solar
   cells with absorber layers that had been heated at 550 degrees C
   exhibited a conversion efficiency of 8.27\%. The corresponding values of
   V-oc, J(sc), and FF were obtained as 0.452 V, 32.9 mA/cm(2) and 55.5\%
   respectively. The diode parameters were reduced and the external quantum
   efficiency (EQE) of the CIGS solar cells was improved by increasing the
   heating temperature. The photoluminescence peaks that were associated
   with the donor acceptor pairs became weaker as the heating temperature
   increased. The suppression of electron hole recombination led to improve
   the photovoltaic properties of the solar cells. This study demonstrates
   that directly heating selenium ion-containing precursors is an effective
   way to prepare highly efficient CIGS absorber layers for solar cells
   applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights

Abstract = {{The number of proper q-colorings of a graph G, denoted by P-G(q), is an
   important graph parameter that plays fundamental role in graph theory,
   computational complexity theory and other related fields. We study an
   old problem of Linial and Wilf to find the graphs with n vertices and m
   edges which maximize this parameter. This problem has attracted much
   research interest in recent years, however little is known for general
   m, n, q. Using analytic and combinatorial methods, we characterize the
   asymptotic structure of extremal graphs for fixed edge density and q.
   Moreover, we disprove a conjecture of Lazebnik, which states that the
   Turan graph T-s(n) has more q-colorings than any other graph with the
   same number of vertices and edges. Indeed, we show that there are
   infinite many counterexamples in the range q = O (s(2)/log s). On the
   other hand, when q is larger than some constant times s(2)/log s, we
   confirm that the Turan graph T-s (n) asymptotically is the extremal
   graph achieving the maximum number of q-colorings. Furthermore, other
   (new and old) results on various instances of the Linial Wilf problem
   are also established. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{CeO2/Pd nanocomposites with high catalytic activity were synthesized by
   pulsed laser ablation in liquids. The size distribution, morphology,
   crystallinity, and optical properties of these nanostructures were
   determined by careful characterization using transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-visible spectroscopy, and
   photoluminescence. The CeO2/Pd composites consisted of two-dimensional
   (2D) CeO2 nanoplates with an average size of approximately 20 nm and
   spherically shaped Pd nanostructures with diameters of 9 nm. The
   synthesized composite showed a dual-band absorption spectrum with
   absorption maxima at 266 and 343 nm. The absorption band at 266 nm was
   assigned to typical inter-band transitions of a metallic Pd system. The
   other absorption peak, located at 343 nm, was the characteristic band of
   CeO2. The photoluminescence spectra showed more significant quenching of
   the blue emission from the CeO2/Pd composite compared with that of CeO2.
   The CeO2/Pd composite showed much higher catalytic activity than bare
   CeO2 nanostructures toward the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to
   4-aminophenol. The significant enhancement of the catalytic activity
   could be ascribed to the interaction between the CeO2 and Pd

Title = {{Wellbore stability analysis and well path optimization based on the
   breakout width model and Mogi-Coulomb criterion}},

Abstract = {{The failure criterion is a very important aspect of the wellbore
   stability analysis. But the Mohr-Coulomb criterion, a most commonly used
   failure criterion, is usually too conservative, due to the influence of
   the intermediate principal stress is not taken into account.
   Furthermore, the safe mud weight (MW) predicted by the conventional
   method is usually too high, due to the safe MW is predicted to yield no
   shear failure around the borehole. To solve the above problems, a
   semi-analytic model of wellbore stability analysis was proposed based on
   the stress distribution model, failure criteria and the breakout width
   model. The Mogi-Coulomb criterion, a new true-triaxial failure
   criterion, is involved in this semi-analytic model to determine the
   shear failure. The computational models of the lowest and highest safe
   MW are derived for different failure mode. The numerical method and
   flowchart of this semi-analytic model is provided, and a computer
   program is also developed in Matlab software. The impacts of the failure
   criteria, stress regimes and breakout width had been systematically
   analyzed. The optimal well path had been optimized for different stress
   regimes. The results showed that the lowest safe MW predicted by
   Mogi-Coulomb criterion is always lower than the Mohr-Coulomb criterion.
   The most stable drilling direction is along the minimum horizontal
   stress for the NF and NF-SS stress regimes, while it's along the maximum
   horizontal stress in the SS, SS-RF and RF stress regimes. If the
   breakout width model is used, the lowest safe MW is always lower than
   the traditional method. The optimal well path and the wellbore stability
   are different between traditional and new methods. The most stable path
   is always the horizontal and deviated well for the traditional method,
   instead, it's always the vertical well for this new method, it's more
   consistent with the actual situation. These results also illustrated
   that an acceptable breakout is usually allowed to occur in the actual
   borehole, and the borehole still has enough arc to support the wellbore
   wall and to prevent collapse accident. Finally, both of the traditional
   and new methods are applied in the field case studies. The results
   showed that the lowest safe MW predicted by the integration of the
   breakout width model and Mogi-Coulomb criterion is closest to the real
   MW, instead, the lowest safe MW predicted by the traditional methods has
   exceeded the actual MW. It also illustrated the traditional method is
   too conservative in predicting wellbore stability, while this new method
   is more accurate for the integration of the breakout width model and
   MG-C criterion. This research can provide support to optimize the well
   path and MW in the drilling practices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{72}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In Part II of this study, the roles of surface sensible heat fluxes
   (SHX) in tropical cyclones (TCs) are further investigated in the context
   of sea spray processes. Results show that the sea spray evaporation is
   favorable for the TC intensification through enhancing the surface
   latent heat fluxes (LHX).Unlike the results in Part I, the removal of
   SHX has led to a somewhat weaker TC by inclusion of sea spray. This is
   because the spray-mediated latent heat fluxes are simultaneously
   diminished after cutting down the SHX. Without the warming of SHX from
   the ocean, the surface air becomes cooler and thereby closer to
   saturation, which substantially hinders the evaporation of sea spray
   droplets. Therefore, the SHX are instrumental for sustaining the release
   of latent heat fluxes by sea spray evaporation. In the experiments of
   Part I and this study, the reduced total surface enthalpy fluxes as a
   result of the removal of SHX do not necessarily result in weakened TCs,
   while the larger LHX basically correspond to stronger TCs. This suggests
   that the TC intensity is largely dependent on the LHX rather than the
   total surface enthalpy fluxes, although the latter is generally
   dominated by the former. Relative roles of thermal and moisture effects
   in radially elevating the surface equivalent potential temperature (e)
   are also compared. The contributions of thermal effects account for
   30\%-35\% of the total changes in (e) for mature TCs, no matter whether
   SHX from the ocean are included. This further implies that the SHX
   contribute insignificantly to the spinup of a TC.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Drought can affect the qualitative and nutritional
   attributes of plum (Prunus salicina L.). The aim of this work was to
   study the effect of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) on the quality of
   plum fruits. Materials and methods. Experiments were conducted during
   two consecutive seasons (2011-2012) with three cultivars ('Black
   Diamond', `Black Gold' and `Black Star') recently introduced in the
   region of Regueb (center of Tunisia) characterized by a semi-arid
   climate. During the fruit growth period, treated trees (RDI 50) received
   50\% of the irrigation water provided to the control (CI) for three
   months. Results and discussion. Water restriction reduced the diameter
   and weight of the fruit though the extent depended on the cultivar.
   However, other measures of fruit quality were improved for all cultivars
   with an increase of fruit firmness, pH, soluble solids and sucrose
   content, and a decrease of total acidity. Additionally, `Black Diamond'
   fruit from treated trees had high level of total phenolics and
   flavonoids. Conclusion. Regulated deficit irrigation may save water in
   semi-arid regions and improve fruit quality with only moderate impact on
   productivity.}},

   the Dragon King), the second cel-animated feature produced at the
   Shanghai Animation Film Studio, the major animation film studio in the
   People's Republic of China (PRC) from the 1950s until the 1980s.
   Released in 1979, the story of Nezha Conquers is an adaptation from
   three chapters of a popular Ming Dynasty 16th-century novel about a
   rebellious boy-god. The year Nezha Conquers the Dragon King is released,
   1979, is a turning point for the hero in PRC cinema. Visual design for
   Nezha Conquers the Dragon King seems to be a combination of Osamu
   Tezuka's Astroboy and Chinese Communist sports propaganda. Chief
   director and screenwriter Wang Shuchen considered the film to be a
   return to fantastic subject matter after the Cultural Revolution. Nezha
   Conquers the Dragon King signaled a return to mythological themes in PRC
   film and ends with an elliptical, open-ended finale, suggesting the
   propensity for future social and cultural contradictions.}},

Abstract = {{This work aims to record the therapeutical practices of the community
   Catole utilizing local diversity of medicinal plants verifying the
   versatility of the species, consensus usage and knowledge of the
   informants. Were recorded 46 native species for medicinal purposes,
   belonging to 42 genres and 26 families, highlighting Fabaceae. Ten
   specimens exhibited great versatility of use, however Ximennia americana
   L. and Croton heliotropiifolius Kunth showed the highest values of IR
   (2.0 and 1.65). The Therapeutic uses were grouped in 15 categories of
   bodily systems, with higher factor consensus among informants in:
   Infectious and parasitic diseases (1.0), disorder of the respiratory
   system (0.82) and Endocrine, nutrition and of metabolism (0.81). Due to
   the diversity of native species registered, it can be concluded that the
   preservation of these areas is of great importance for biodiversity

Abstract = {{Introduction. It is very important to determine as accurately as
   possible the renal function in potential living renal transplant donors,
   especially those with limited renal function (CrCl <90 mL/m/1.73 m(2)),
   age older than 50 years, and cardiovascular risk factors that might
   favor the development of long-term kidney diseases.
   Objective. The objective of this study was to compare the direct
   measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using EDTA-Cr51 and the
   estimations based on creatinine (eGFR): Cr clearance (CCr) with 24-hour
   urine and estimated using Cockroft-Gault (adjusted by using body surface
   area-Mosteller formula-SC), MDRD-4, MDRD-6, and CKD-EPI to determine the
   usefulness of different methods from EDTA-Cr51 to evaluate the kidney
   function.
   Patients and Methods. The kidney function evaluation has been made to
   105 potential kidney donors using the EDTA-Cr51 method. The GFR obtained
   through the EDTA-Cr51 is compared with the CCr values in 24-hour urine
   and eGFR based on creatinine (Cockcroft-Gault, MDRD4, MDRD6, and
   CKD-EPI).
   Results. Using the Bland Altman graphic we have observed that the most
   dispersed results are obtained with the eGFR using CCr in 24-hour urine
   and CKD-EPI. By means of Pasing \& Bablock, we realized that MDRD-4 and
   MDRD-6 show the highest approximation to the reference method proposed
   to be substituted, whereas CCr shows a high dispersion.
   Conclusions. eGFR using MDRD-4 and MDRD-6 formulas reveal the best
   adjustment to the measure by EDTA-Cr51. This might represent the best
   option if a direct eGFR measure is not available.}},

Abstract = {{This study developed a short form of the National Adult Reading Test -
   an inventory that estimates intellectual ability - to produce an
   instrument suitable for lay administration in population surveys. Data
   were provided by 816 participants in the dress rehearsal for wave 12 of
   the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey.
   Participants were administered the 50-item National Adult Reading Test
   (NART) in a brief battery of cognitive assessments. Three methods of
   short form construction were applied to responses and the measurement
   properties of the resultant short forms were compared. Use of Item
   Response Theory (IRT) threshold and slope parameters to choose efficient
   items with negligible guessing across the full range of ability resulted
   in a better short form than the more common practice of relying on
   factor loadings alone. Simulation of an alternative approach involving
   conditional administration of part of the test was found to yield biased
   measurements and did not substantially reduce average test length. A
   25-item IRT-derived short form of the NART maintains good precision of
   measurement across a broad spectrum of intellectual ability. Halving the
   number of items presented will reduce burden, increase acceptability,
   and increase accuracy of response judgement by test administrators. (C)

Abstract = {{Introduction: Current building ventilation standards are based on
   acceptable minimums. Three decades of research demonstrates the human
   health benefits of increased ventilation above these minimums. Recent
   research also shows the benefits on human decision-making performance in
   office workers, which translates to increased productivity. However,
   adoption of enhanced ventilation strategies is lagging. We sought to
   evaluate two of the perceived potential barriers to more widespread
   adoptionEconomic and environmental costs. Methods: We estimated the
   energy consumption and associated per building occupant costs for office
   buildings in seven U.S. cities, representing different climate zones for
   three ventilation scenarios (standard practice (20 cfm/person), 30\%
   enhanced ventilation, and 40 cfm/person) and four different heating,
   ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system strategies (Variable Air
   Volume (VAV) with reheat and a Fan Coil Unit (FCU), both with and
   without an energy recovery ventilator). We also estimated emissions of
   greenhouse gases associated with this increased energy usage, and, for
   comparison, converted this to the equivalent number of vehicles using
   greenhouse gas equivalencies. Lastly, we paired results from our
   previous research on cognitive function and ventilation with labor
   statistics to estimate the economic benefit of increased productivity
   associated with increasing ventilation rates. Results: Doubling the
   ventilation rate from the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and
   Air-Conditioning Engineers minimum cost less than \$40 per person per
   year in all climate zones investigated. Using an energy recovery
   ventilation system significantly reduced energy costs, and in some
   scenarios led to a net savings. At the highest ventilation rate, adding
   an ERV essentially neutralized the environmental impact of enhanced
   ventilation (0.03 additional cars on the road per building across all
   cities). The same change in ventilation improved the performance of
   workers by 8\%, equivalent to a \$6500 increase in employee productivity
   each year. Reduced absenteeism and improved health are also seen with
   enhanced ventilation. Conclusions: The health benefits associated with
   enhanced ventilation rates far exceed the per-person energy costs
   relative to salary costs. Environmental impacts can be mitigated at
   regional, building, and individual-level scales through the transition
   to renewable energy sources, adoption of energy efficient systems and
   ventilation strategies, and promotion of other sustainable policies.}},

Abstract = {{This article aimed to gain an understanding of the process of debriefing
   during major competitions in elite team sports. Debrief interviews were
   conducted with 9 head coaches. The interview data were used to identify
   how head coaches divided up the tasks given to staff and team members
   prior to, and during the post-match debriefing. Results showed that
   debriefing consisted of two steps: preparation and presentation.
   Preparation referred to four successive tasks. Presentation to the team
   of players consisted of eight tasks relating to transformational and
   transactional styles of leadership. Coaches were shown to divide the
   labor within the staff and team. The data tend to support the view that
   in elite team sports, coaches are both transformational and
   transactional leaders, adapting their style of leadership to the
   situation, athletes and time available. This study provides insights

Title = {{COSMIC REIONIZATION AFTER PLANCK: COULD QUASARS DO IT ALL?}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{813}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{We assess a model of late cosmic reionization in which the ionizing
   background radiation arises entirely from high-redshift quasars and
   other active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The low optical depth to Thomson
   scattering reported by the Planck Collaboration pushes the redshift of
   instantaneous reionization down to z = 8.8(-1.4)(+1.7) and greatly
   reduces the need for significant Lyman-continuum emission at very early
   times. We show that if recent claims of a numerous population of faint
   AGNs at z = 4-6 are upheld and the high inferred AGN comoving emissivity
   at these epochs persists to higher, z greater than or similar to 10,
   redshifts, then active galaxies may drive the reionization of hydrogen
   and helium with little contribution from normal star-forming galaxies.
   We discuss an AGN-dominated scenario that satisfies a number of
   observational constraints: the H I photoionization rate is relatively
   flat over the range 2 < z < 5, hydrogen gets fully reionized by z
   similar or equal to 5.7, and the integrated Thomson scattering optical
   depth is tau similar or equal to 0.056, in agreement with measurements
   based on the Ly alpha opacity of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and
   cosmic microwave background polarization. It is a prediction of the
   model that helium gets doubly reionized before redshift 4, the heat

Abstract = {{PurposeTo assess the possible utility of machine learning for
   classifying subjects with and subjects without osteoarthritis using
   sodium magnetic resonance imaging data. Theory: support vector machine,
   k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, discriminant analysis, linear
   regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision tree, and
   tree bagging were tested.
   MethodsSodium magnetic resonance imaging with and without fluid
   suppression by inversion recovery was acquired on the knee cartilage of
   19 controls and 28 osteoarthritis patients. Sodium concentrations were
   measured in regions of interests in the knee for both acquisitions. Mean
   (MEAN) and standard deviation (STD) of these concentrations were
   measured in each regions of interest, and the minimum, maximum, and mean
   of these two measurements were calculated over all regions of interests
   for each subject. The resulting 12 variables per subject were used as
   predictors for classification.
   ResultsEither Min {[}STD] alone, or in combination with Mean {[}MEAN] or
   Min {[}MEAN], all from fluid suppressed data, were the best predictors
   with an accuracy >74\%, mainly with linear logistic regression and
   linear support vector machine. Other good classifiers include
   discriminant analysis, linear regression, and naive Bayes.

Abstract = {{The role of non-conventional machining processes (NCMPs) in today's
   manufacturing environment has been well acknowledged. For effective
   utilization of the capabilities and advantages of different NCMPs,
   selection of the most appropriate NCMP for a given machining application
   requires consideration of different conflicting criteria. The right
   choice of the NCMP is critical to the success and competitiveness of the
   company. As the NCMP selection problem involves consideration of
   different conflicting criteria, of different relative importance, the
   multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are very useful in
   systematical selection of the most appropriate NCMP. This paper presents
   the application of a recent MCDM method, i.e., the multi-objective
   optimization on the basis of ratio analysis (MOORA) method to solve NCMP
   selection which has been defined considering different performance
   criteria of four most widely used NCMPs. In order to determine the
   relative significance of considered quality criteria a pair-wise
   comparison matrix of the analytic hierarchy process was used. The
   results obtained using the MOORA method showed perfect correlation with
   those obtained by the technique for order preference by similarity to
   ideal solution (TOPSIS) method which proves the applicability and
   potentiality of this MCDM method for solving complex NCMP selection
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{Recent reflections on the study of forced migration stress the
   importance of constructing ethically sound research relationships that
   both respect research participants as autonomous agents and protect them
   from all forms of harm in the research process. Although this is
   important, very little research in this area has focused directly on the
   production of intimacy in the research process and how intimate research
   relationships that are produced can subsequently become the basis on
   which disclosures are shared and how this can contribute to both the
   quality of the research process and output. In this article I reflect on
   my intimate research relationship with Zimbabwean migrant parents who I
   interviewed in the United Kingdom. I argue that there is an element of
   (gift) exchange to intimate qualitative research encounters that yields
   benefits to both the researcher and the researched. In so doing, I also
   highlight some of the ethical dilemmas I encountered and how they were
   overcome.}},

Abstract = {{Mitochondria are multifunctional organelles that play a central role in
   cellular homeostasis. Severe mitochondrial dysfunction leads to
   life-threatening diseases in humans and accelerates the aging process.
   Surprisingly, moderate reduction of mitochondrial function in different
   species has anti-aging effects. High-throughput screenings in the
   nematode Caenorhabditis elegans lead to the identification of several
   pro-longevity genetic and pharmacological interventions. Large-scale
   screens, however, are manual, subjective, time consuming and costly.
   These limitations could be reduced by the identification of
   automatically quantifiable biomarkers of healthy aging. In this study we
   exploit the distinct and reproducible phenotypes described in C. elegans
   upon different levels of mitochondrial alteration to develop an
   automated high-content strategy to identify new potential pro-longevity
   interventions. Utilizing the microscopy platform Cellomics ArrayScan
   Reader, we optimize a workflow to automatically and reliably quantify
   the discrete phenotypic readouts associated with different degrees of
   silencing of mitochondrial respiratory chain regulatory proteins, and
   validate the approach with mitochondrial-targeting drugs known to extend
   lifespan in C. elegans. Finally, we report that a new mitochondrial
   ATPase modulator matches our screening phenotypic criteria and extends
   nematode's lifespan thus providing the proof of principle that our
   strategy could be exploited to identify novel mitochondrial-targeted
   drugs with pro-longevity activity. This article is part of a Special
   Issue entitled: Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Aging. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background. Acute kidney injury (AKI) continues to complicate cardiac
   operations. We sought to determine whether nadir oxygen delivery (DO2)
   on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was a risk factor for AKI while also
   accounting for other postoperative factors.
   Methods. Using propensity scoring, we matched 85 patients who developed
   AKI after cardiac operations on CPB with 85 control patients who did
   not. We analyzed the following variables through midnight on
   postoperative day 1 (POD1): DO2, antibiotics, blood products and
   vasopressors (intraoperatively and postoperatively), and hemodynamic
   variables.
   Results. Univariable analysis revealed AKI patients had lower nadir DO2
   on CPB (208 vs 230 mL O-2/min/m(2) body surface area, p = 0.03), lower
   intensive care unit admission blood pressure gradient across the kidney
   (mean arterial pressure minus central venous pressure; 60 vs 68 mm Hg; p
   < 0.001), a greater proportion of patients with mean arterial pressure
   of less than 60 mm Hg for more than 15 minutes in the postoperative
   period (70\% vs 42\%, p < 0.001), a greater chance of having a cardiac
   index of less than 2.2 (74\% vs 49\%, p = 0.02), and greater total
   vasopressor use through the end of POD1 (5.2 vs 2.3 mg, p = 0.002). On
   multivariable analysis, predictors of AKI were a DO2 on CPB of less than
   225 mL O-2/min/m(2) (odds ratio, 2.46; 95\% confidence interval, 1.21 to
   5.03; p = 0.01) and postoperative mean arterial pressure of less than 60
   mm Hg for more than 15 minutes (odds ratio, 3.96; 95\% confidence
   interval, 1.92 to 8.20; p < 0.001). An average postoperative pressor
   dose greater than 0.03 mg/kg/min did not reach significance (odds ratio,
   1.98; 95\% confidence interval, 0.95 to 4.11; p = 0.07).
   Conclusions. Postoperative hypotension on POD0 or POD1 and low DO2 on
   CPB both independently increase the AKI risk in cardiac surgical
   patients. (C) 2015 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we studied the enhancement of the breakdown voltage in
   the 4H-SiC MESFET-MOSFET (MES-MOSFET) structure which we have proposed
   in our previous work. We compared this structure with Conventional
   Bulk-MOSFET (CB-MOSFET) and Field plated Conventional Bulk-MOSFET
   (FCB-MOSFET) structures. The 4H-SiC MES-MOSFET structure consists of two
   additional schottky buried gates which behave like a Metal on
   Semiconductor (MES) at the interface of the active region and substrate.
   The motivation for this structure was to enhance the breakdown voltage
   by introducing a new technique of utilizing the reduced surface field
   (RESURF) concept. In our comparison and investigation we used a
   two-dimensional device simulator. Our simulation results show that the
   breakdown voltage of the proposed structure is 3.7 and 2.9 times larger
   than CB-MOSFET and FCB-MOSFET structures, respectively. We also showed
   that the threshold voltage and the slope of drain current (ID) as a
   function of drain-source voltage (V-DS) for all the structures is the
   same. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates the role of electron shuttles and trace metals
   in the biotransformation of azo dye reactive black-5 and hexavalent
   chromium (CrVI) that are released simultaneously in tannery effluent.
   Previously isolated bacterial strain Pseudomonas putida KI was used for
   the simultaneous reduction of the dye (100 mg L-1) and CrVI (2 mg L-1)
   in a mineral salts medium (MSM). Among various trace metals, only Cu(II)
   had a stimulating effect on the bacterial-mediated reduction process.
   Application of electron shuttles such as hydroquinone and uric acid at a
   low concentration (1 mM) had a positive effect on the reduction process
   and caused simultaneous reduction of 100\% dye and 97\% CrVI in 12-18 h.
   Mannitol, EDTA and sodium benzoate at all concentrations (ranging from 1
   to 9 mM) showed an inhibitory effect on the reduction of reactive
   black-5 and CrVI. An inverse linear relationship between the velocity of
   reaction (V) and the concentration {[}S] of electron shuttles was
   observed. The results imply that both types and concentration of an
   electron shuttle and trace metals can affect the simultaneous reduction
   of reactive black-5 and CrVI. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents an extensive analysis of the sensitivity of

   tested on a large number of parameter setting combinations for a water
   distribution system optimisation problem. The optimisation model
   comprises two operational objectives minimised concurrently, the pump
   energy costs and deviations of constituent concentrations as a water
   quality measure. This optimisation model is applied to a regional
   non-drinking water distribution system, and solved using the
   optimisation software GANetXL incorporating the NSGA-II linked with the
   network analysis software EPANet. The sensitivity analysis employs a set
   of performance metrics, which were designed to capture the overall
   quality of the computed Pareto fronts. The performance and sensitivity
   of NSGA-II parameters using those metrics is evaluated. The results
   demonstrate that NSGA-II is sensitive to different parameter settings,
   and unlike in the single-objective problems, a range of parameter
   setting combinations appears to be required to reach a Pareto front of
   optimal solutions. Additionally, inadequately scaled objective functions
   cause the NSGA-II bias towards the second objective. Lastly, the
   methodology for performance and sensitivity analysis may be used for
   calibration of algorithm parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of continuous hydrogen charging on tensile properties of

   Continuous hydrogen charging results in a reduction of the grain
   boundary cohesion of the EUROFER 97 and ODS-EUROFER steels tested at RT.
   With increase of the testing temperature up to 300 degrees C EUROFER 97
   steel exhibits relatively high amount of micro-cracks which agglomerate

   supportive relationships among teachers (teacher-teacher affiliation).
   Data from 46 teachers in seven schools enrolled in the treatment arm of
   a longitudinal, cluster-randomized, controlled trial were analyzed.
   Teacher perceptions of a school's tendency to be innovative was
   associated with a greater number of lessons taught and self-reported
   quality of delivery, and teacher-teacher affiliation was associated with
   a higher use of supplementary activities. The findings suggest that
   perceptions of a school's organizational climate impact teachers'
   implementation of SECD programs and have implications for school
   administrators and technical assistance providers as they work to
   implement and sustain prevention programs in schools.}},

Abstract = {{Skin detail of the hand is used in photographic comparisons, yet its
   reliability has not been evaluated. This study examines a count-based
   method for documenting skin features. In Part I, 14 individuals counted
   skin features on 40 color images of the hand, three of which were
   repeated. An average correlation value of 0.557 was obtained for
   interobserver assessment; values ranged from 0.545 to 0.832 for
   intra-observer assessment. The variation in correlation values for hands
   suggests that there are certain distinguishing characteristics that
   increase reliability. In Part II, 17 examiners assessed 20 nonrepeated
   grayscale images of hands by circling skin features. An average
   correlation value of 0.674 was obtained, but visual assessment of
   examiner markings suggested some examiners grouped features whereas
   others viewed them individually. The results suggest further research is
   warranted, some hands may be more suitable for comparisons, and a
   standardized method for examining skin features is needed.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this research is to propose a method for
   decomposing the total drag of a nacelle into external, internal, and
   wake drag. From a bookkeeping agreement, the internal drag (i.e., the
   drag generated inside a nacelle) is the engine manufacturer's
   responsibility and is not to be included in the aircraft's total drag.
   Consequently, computing the internal drag is mandatory for the airframe
   and engine constructors concerned and can be achieved either
   experimentally or by computational-fluid-dynamics analysis. Up to now,
   aerodynamic engineers have used a near-field approach to compute the
   internal drag using computational-fluid-dynamics analysis, but this
   method has serious drawbacks, including its dependency on the accurate
   location of the stagnation line. The new method proposed here has been
   applied to multiple two-and three-dimensional test cases, and results
   show that it is independent of the location of the stagnation line and
   yields accurate results that agree well with experimental and empirical
   data. Results also show that the wake drag of a through-flow nacelle is
   caused by the flow passing through the nacelle and so needs to be added
   to the internal drag.}},

Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{4202-4213}},

Abstract = {{With finite-rate feedback, we propose two feedback methods for transmit
   beamforming in a point-to-point MISO-OFDM channel. For the first method,
   a receiver with perfect channel information, quantizes and feeds back
   the optimal transmit beamforming vectors of a few selected subcarriers,
   which are equally spaced. Based on those quantized vectors, the
   transmitter applies either constant, linear, or higher-order
   interpolation with the remaining beamforming vectors. With constant
   interpolation, we derive the approximate sum achievable rate and the
   optimal cluster size that maximizes the approximate rate. For linear
   interpolation, we derive a closed-form expression for the phase rotation
   by utilizing the correlation between OFDM subcarriers. We also propose a
   higher-order interpolation that requires more than two quantized vectors
   to interpolate transmit beamformers, and is based on existing channel
   estimation methods. Numerical results show that interpolation with the
   optimized cluster size can perform significantly better than that with
   an arbitrary cluster size. For the second proposed method, a channel
   impulse response is quantized with a uniform scalar quantizer. With
   channel quantization, we also derive the approximate sum achievable
   rate. We show that switching between the two methods for different
   feedback-rate requirements can perform better than the existing schemes.}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{4, SI}},

Abstract = {{Aspects of criminological theory are premised on the belief that
   criminals make poor decisions. There have been suggestions that
   individual differences in self-control, willpower, impulsivity, time
   orientation, or more recently, thoughtfully reflective decision making
   (TRDM) influence choices and, ultimately, deviant outcomes. While much
   of the literature suggests there are differences among these concepts,
   they are often used interchangeably or at least noted to share common
   ground. Using survey data collected from university undergraduate
   students, this article explores the conceptual and empirical overlap and
   areas of distinction between key theoretical constructs. Using
   hypotheses derived from a dual-systems model, findings suggest
   impulsivity, self-control, temptation, and TRDM are distinct but
   interrelated constructs. Impulsivity was positively related to
   intentions to drink and drive in a hypothetical scenario, but
   temptation, self-control, and TRDM had no significant effect on
   intentions. Consistent with a dual-systems conceptualization, we found
   impulsivity and self-control work in tandem, as the risk of drinking and
   driving was highest for those respondents who were highly impulsive and
   had low self-control. Future research may seek to use a dual-system
   model to further reconcile trait-based and decision-based models of
   criminological theory.}},

Abstract = {{Graduate medical education is increasingly focused on patient safety and

   address these changes. We propose a novel curriculum for emergency
   medicine ( EM) residency training programs specifically addressing
   patient safety, systems-based management, and practice-based performance
   improvement, called ``EM Debates.{''} Following implementation of this
   educational curriculum, we performed a cross-sectional study to evaluate
   the curriculum through resident self-assessment. Additionally, a
   cross-sectional study to determine the ED clinical competency
   committee's (CCC) ability to assess residents on specific competencies
   was performed. Residents were overall very positive towards the
   implementation of the debates. Of those participating in a debate, 71\%
   felt that it improved their individual performance within a specific
   topic, and 100\% of those that led a debate felt that they could propose
   an evidence-based approach to a specific topic. The CCC found that it
   was easier to assess milestones in patient safety, systems-based
   management, and practice-based performance improvement (sub-competencies
   16, 17, and 19) compared to prior to the implementation of the debates.
   The debates have been a helpful venue to teach EM residents about

Abstract = {{A delta-shaped anastomosis in totally laparoscopic Billroth I
   gastrectomy could be performed easily and sufficiently using only
   laparoscopic linear staplers. However, the restricted maneuverability
   and severe blurring of these staplers along with their limited
   hemostability induced strain. In this study, we determined the
   feasibility and safety of performing delta-shaped anastomosis using the
   Endo GIA (TM) Reloads with Tri-Staple (TM) Technology combined with Endo
   GIA (TM) Ultra Universal stapler (Tri-Staple) with a particular focus on
   short-term surgical outcomes.
   We performed a single-institutional prospective interventional study
   (UMIN 000008014). The Tri-Staple was prospectively used on 23
   consecutive patients who underwent a curative totally laparoscopic
   Billroth I gastrectomy with delta-shaped anastomosis. These patients
   were matched with the 19 patients previously treated using the
   ENDOPATH(A (R)) ETS Articulating Linear Cutters (ETS) on clinical and
   demographic characteristics.
   There were no differences between the groups in anastomosis-related
   local complications, morbidity, non-anastomosis-related local
   complications, total systemic complications, and short-term outcomes
   with the exception of significantly reduced blood loss in the Tri-Staple
   group (ETS vs. Tri-Staple: 37 {[}10-306] vs. 15 {[}5-210] mL, p = 0.02).
   Intraoperative bleeding from the staple line was significantly reduced
   in the Tri-Staple group. The postoperative drain indwelling period (ETS
   vs. Tri-Staple, 6 {[}4-10] vs. 4 {[}2-43] days, p = 0.032), fasting
   period (5 {[}3-7] vs. 3 {[}3-24] days, p = 0.022), and hospital stay (14
   {[}10-47] vs. 11 {[}6-58] days, p = 0.025) were significantly shorter in
   the Tri-Staple group. There was no mortality in this series.
   Acceleration assessed as indices of blurring of stapler tip might have a
   significant adverse influence on staple-line bleeding at stapling sites.
   Totally laparoscopic Billroth I distal gastrectomy using Tri-Staple was
   feasible and safe with favorable short-term surgical outcomes. Reduced
   blurring while stapling may be a novel endpoint which newly developed
   stapling devices should target.}},

Abstract = {{Crime persists in plaguing society, with most crimes committed by repeat
   offenders. This causes an increase in the incarcerated population and
   strains correctional systems. Understanding why individuals who have
   been incarcerated continue to recidivate remains an important focus for
   investigation. Psychopathic personality traits and criminogenic thinking
   have both been shown to predict recidivism. However, there is currently
   little research that focuses on the relationship between these two risk
   factors, and no prior research has examined this relationship
   specifically among incarcerated offenders. To address this gap, the
   present study examined psychopathy and criminogenic thinking among 399
   adult males incarcerated in the Mississippi Department of Corrections.
   Results indicated that after controlling for demographic variables,
   increased primary and secondary psychopathy significantly predicted
   increased overall and particular subtypes of criminogenic thinking.
   Implications for addressing psychopathic personality characteristics and
   criminogenic thinking conjointly in prison-based treatment programming
   to reduce recidivism are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The pharmacokinetic behavior of cefquinome was studied in healthy and
   febrile buffalo calves after single intramuscular administration (2
   mg/kg). The fever was induced with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide
   (1 mu g/kg, IV). The drug concentration in plasma was detected by HPLC
   method. Pharmacokinetic analysis of disposition data indicated that
   intramuscular administration data were best described by one-compartment
   open model. At 2.5 min, concentrations of cefquinome in healthy and
   febrile animals were 2.21 +/- 0.38 and 2.52 +/- 0.38 mu g/ml,
   respectively, and drug was detected up to 24 h. The peak plasma levels
   of cefquinome in febrile buffalo calves (7.70 +/- 0.46 mu g.ml(-1)) and
   healthy buffalo calves (6.70 +/- 0.46 mu g.ml(-1)) were achieved at 45
   min and 30 min, respectively. The absorption half life (t(1/2ka)) of
   cefquinome was similar in healthy and febrile buffalo calves. Drug
   distribution was altered by fever as febrile animals showed volume of
   distribution (0.37 +/- 0.07L/kg) lower than healthy animal (0.69 +/-
   0.04 L/kg). Total body clearances in healthy and febrile animals were
   0.09 and 0.04 L/kg/h, respectively. To maintain minimum therapeutic
   concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, a satisfactory dosage regimen of cefquinome
   in healthy and febrile buffalo calves would be 2.8 mg/kg and 1.2 mg/kg
   body weight, respectively, to be repeated at 24 h intervals.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent water supply is a common issue in the history of
   Mediterranean civilizations, where hydraulic solutions, such as
   cisterns, wells, reservoirs and aqueducts, were adopted for private and
   public supply. In this context, the island of Pantelleria, where surface
   freshwater is virtually non-existent, represents a unique case for
   understanding human-environment interaction in waterless environments.
   Here, in historical times, year-round water supply was only possible
   through the storage of rainwater in underground cisterns. An intensive
   field survey carried out across the island led to the discovery of
   hundreds of cisterns dated from the Punic and Roman periods to the
   present day. The study of the spatial distribution of the cisterns was
   compared with archaeological data on the island to gain new insights on
   historical settlement and demographic patterns. The present work
   focusses on a semi-quantitative assessment of water storage on the
   island of Pantelleria based on the evaluation of potential volumes of
   stored water for different periods. Data available for cisterns in
   Pantelleria have been analysed and compared with those from coeval
   Mediterranean regions. Calculations on the seasonal fluctuation between
   water demand and supply have been estimated to evaluate the efficiency
   of such system for sustaining human population and subsistence
   activities through time.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The aim this study was to examine the effect of changes in
   physical and psychosocial working conditions on physical health
   functioning among ageing municipal employees.
   Methods Follow-up survey data were collected from midlife employees of
   the City of Helsinki, Finland, at three time points: wave 1(2000-2002),
   wave 2(2007), and wave 3 (2012). Changes in physical and psychosocial
   working conditions were assessed between waves 1 and 2. Physical health
   functioning was measured by the physical component summary (PCS) of the
   Short-Form 36 questionnaire at each of the three waves. In total, 2784
   respondents (83\% women) who remained employed over the follow-up were
   available for the analyses. Linear mixed-effect models were used to
   assess the associations and adjust for key covariates (age, gender,
   obesity, chronic diseases, and health behaviors).
   Results Repeated and increased exposure to adverse physical working
   conditions was associated with greater decline in physical health
   functioning over time. In contrast, decrease in exposures reduced the
   decline Of the psychosocial working conditions, changes in job demands
   had no effects on physical health functioning. However, decreased job
   control was associated with greater decline and repeated high or
   increased job control reduced the decline in physical health functioning
   over time.
   Conclusions Adverse changes in physical working conditions and job
   control were associated with greater decline in physical health
   functioning over time, whereas favorable changes in these exposures
   reduced the decline. Preventing deterioration and promoting improvement
   of working conditions are likely to help maintain better physical health
   functioning among ageing employees.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Sensitivity and resolution in NMR experiments are affected by magnetic
   field inhomogeneities (of both external and RF), errors in pulse
   calibration, and offset effects due to finite length of RF pulses. To
   remedy these problems, built-in compensation mechanisms for these
   experimental imperfections are often necessary. Here, we propose a new
   family of phase-modulated constant-amplitude broadband pulses with high
   compensation for RF inhomogeneity and heteronuclear coupling evolution.
   These pulses were optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA), which
   consists in a global optimization method inspired by Nature's
   evolutionary processes. The newly designed pi and pi/2 pulses belong to
   the `type A' (or general rotors) symmetric composite pulses. These
   GA-optimized pulses are relatively short compared to other general
   rotors and can be used for excitation and inversion, as well as
   refocusing pulses in spin-echo experiments. The performance of the
   GA-optimized pulses was assessed in Magic Angle Spinning (MAS)
   solid-state NMR experiments using a crystalline U-C-13, N-15 NAVL
   peptide as well as U-C-13, N-15 microcrystalline ubiquitin. GA
   optimization of NMR pulse sequences opens a window for improving current
   experiments and designing new robust pulse sequences. (C) 201 5 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fe-x-ZrSiO4 is known for the applications in the ceramic industry such
   as ceramic pigment. In this article, we focus our attention to the
   structural, microstructural and vibrational changes of Fe-x-ZrSiO4 from
   free-mineralizer precursors, treated at different temperatures in the
   range of 1100-1600 degrees C. The refinements of X-ray diffraction
   patterns show that Fe3+ cations were distributed into tetrahedral sites
   replacing Si4+. The evolution of the shape distribution analyzed by
   transmission electron microscopy, reveal a polyhedral morphology at 1100
   degrees C during 3h. In comparison, well-rounded and homogeneous
   particle size was determined in the sample heated at 1600 degrees C
   during 24 h. On the other hand, it was observed that increase the
   content of iron and the increased heat treatment (temperature and time)
   both plays an important effect on the observed Raman results. The
   profile line deconvolution applied through the nu(3) vibration of the
   SiO4 group shows a spectral change similar to that seen in
   radiation-damaged zircon: a decrease in frequency and increase in
   bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{As the name reveals, acetate-free biofiltration (AFB) is featured by
   lack of acetate and this would seem to allow better hemodynamic
   stability. However, AFB also has a unique characteristic of carbon
   dioxide (CO2)-free dialysate, whereas all other modern dialysis
   techniques imply an overload of CO2 from dialysate to the patient. This
   notwithstanding the role of CO2 in tolerance to dialysis treatment, both
   AFB and all other dialysis techniques seem not investigated in due
   depth. Specifically, the amount of CO2 coming back to the patient's
   bloodstream during AFB and bicarbonate dialysis (BD) is unknown. We
   measured partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in blood samples withdrawn
   from the venous line of the extracorporeal circuit during BD and
   subsequently during AFB in 22 stable chronic hemodialysis outpatients.
   The amount of CO2 coming back to the patient's bloodstream is higher in
   BD (59.1 +/- 4.0mmol/L) than in AFB (42.8 +/- 4.5mmol/L, P<0.0001). Such
   difference exceeds 30\%. Moreover, shifting from BD to AFB shows,
   notably for each patient, the reduction of pCO(2) toward physiological
   values. BD implies CO2 overload from dialysate, whereas AFB does not.
   Further studies are required to evaluate if AFB would be the most
   appropriate dialysis technique in patients affected by chronic, but
   especially acute, lung diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) is commonly used for preparation of
   stimulating drinks in South America. In this study, 24 elements were
   determined in different brands of yerba mate commercialized in Brazil,
   Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. The element concentrations were
   determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission
   spectrometry (ICP OES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
   (ICP-MS). The element concentrations found were submitted to
   hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis
   (PCA), in order to identify the yerba mate according to the country of
   origin. The HCA revealed a clustering tendency by country of origin and
   distinct characteristics of some samples. The HCA also revealed the
   influence of some element in the yerba mate plant or their absorption by
   the plant. The results obtained by means of PCA corroborated with those
   of HCA, indicating that the form of yerba mate processing and the
   elements absorption by the plant must be responsible for the formation
   of the observed clusters.}},

Abstract = {{The families of TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta) proteins are
   the most important growth factors in the ovary, and three related
   oocyte-derived members, namely GDF9 (growth differentiation factor 9),
   BMP15 (bone morphogenetic protein 15), and BMPR1B (bone morphogenetic
   protein receptor 1B), have been shown to be essential for follicular
   growth and ovulation. Although the essential role of these genes in
   determining litter size in sheep and mouse and in controlling
   folliculogenesis in human has been demonstrated, there is limited
   information on their action in other species, especially in bovine.
   Bovine is a monotocous specie, as humans, with one or sometimes two
   newborns per birth. The twinning is a complex trait determined by both
   genetic and environmental factors. This study aimed at investigating the
   nucleotide sequences of different fragments of GDF9, BMP15, and BMPR1B
   genes in Maremmana cows reared in Castelporziano Presidential Estate
   (Rome). In this herd, in the period between 1996 and 2008, a twinning
   rate of 12 \% (on average) was observed. We identified nine
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), five in the coding region, and
   four in the noncoding region: Two polymorphisms caused non-synonymous
   mutations, g.6045 G>A (V202I) in the BMP15 gene, and g.231 T>C (L66S) in
   GDF9 gene. The mutation L66S was found only in cows with double birth.
   In the literature, there are different evidences that mutations in
   proregion of GDF9 protein could affect its correct function. A
   relationship between mutations in this region of protein and granulosa
   cells proliferation and oocyte development was hypothesized.}},

Title = {{Collapse of blastocysts is strongly related to lower implantation
   success: a time-lapse study}},
Journal = {{HUMAN REPRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2501-2508}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{STUDY QUESTION: Is there an association between blastocyst collapse
   patterns and implantation potential?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: Embryos that exhibit collapse are as likely to hatch as
   those that do not, but are less likely to implant and should not be
   replaced if alternatives are available.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Studies of blastocyst collapse in different
   species of mammals have found that most blastocysts, that experience
   consecutive weak contractions, hatch successfully whereas those that
   exhibit strong contractions or collapse, fail to hatch.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Retrospective cohort study. Seven hundred
   and fifteen transferred blastocysts were analyzed from July 2012 to May
   2013.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: University-affiliated
   infertility center. Participant patients were recipients of oocyte
   donation and autologous IVF cycles (n = 460). Embryo development was
   analyzed with a time-lapse imaging system. Variables studied included
   blastocyst collapse (defined as the separation of >= 50\% of the surface
   of the trophectoderm of the blastocyst from the zona pellucida), kinetic
   variables, embryo morphology, implantation and clinical pregnancy rates.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 139 blastocysts
   presented collapse (19.4\%), of these 8 presented 2 collapses and 2
   presented 3 collapses. The timings of embryo cleavages and the time
   taken to reach the morula stage and blastulation were significantly
   shorter in embryos with collapse than in those without. Implantation
   rates were compared in cycles where either all or none of the embryos
   replaced, implanted so that implantation data were known for every
   embryo. Among 408 embryos without collapse and 94 embryos with at least
   one collapse (94) the implantation rates were 48.5\% (95\% confidence
   intervals (CI) 46.7-53.4\%) and 35\% (95\% CI 25.3-44.9\%),
   respectively. The percentage of embryos that hatched was similar in both
   groups 28.7 and 31\%, respectively.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The retrospective nature of the study
   limits its potential value.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Study the collapse pattern of the
   blastocyst, may assist selection of the blastocysts most likely to
   implant and increase IVF/ICSI success rates.}},

Abstract = {{The MUC16 mucin is overexpressed and aberrantly glycosylated in ovarian
   carcinomas. Immunodetection of circulating MUC16 is one of the most used
   cancer biomarker assays, but existing antibodies to MUC16 fail to
   distinguish normal and aberrant cancer glycoforms. Although all
   antibodies react with the tandem-repeat region, their epitopes appear to
   be conformational dependent and not definable by a short peptide.
   Aberrant glycoforms of MUC16 may constitute promising targets for
   diagnostic and immunotherapeutic intervention, and it is important to
   develop well-defined immunogens for induction of potent MUC16 immunity.
   Here, we developed a MUC16 vaccine based on a 1.7TR (264 aa) expressed
   in Escherichia coli and in vitro enzymatically glycosylated to generate
   the aberrant cancer-associated glycoform Tn. This vaccine elicited a
   potent serum IgG response in mice and we identified two major
   immunodominant linear peptide epitopes within the tandem repeat. We
   developed one monoclonal antibody, 5E11, reactive with a minimum epitope
   with the sequence FNTTER. This sequence contains potential N- and
   O-glycosylation sites and, interestingly, glycosylation blocked binding
   of 5E11. In immunochemistry of ovarian benign and cancer lesions, 5E11
   showed similar reactivity as traditional MUC16 antibodies, suggesting
   that the epitope is not efficiently glycosylated. The study provides a
   vaccine design and immunodominant MUC16 TR epitopes.}},

   increase when the drain bias is swept up to 600 V; (ii) several
   mechanisms can be responsible for off-state current conduction,
   including band-to-band tunneling and impact ionization; (iii)
   two-dimensional numerical simulations indicate that band-to-band
   tunneling plays a major role, while impact ionization does not
   significantly contribute to the overall leakage. Temperature-dependent
   I-V measurements were also carried out to identify the origin of the
   vertical drain-bulk leakage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The production of Tuber magnatum Pico, the most prized and ecologically
   the most complex, constantly declines in natural habitats, while the
   success in plantation lacks. Contrary to the data from its habitats in
   Mediterranean sites, in Serbia this truffle colonizes typical developed
   alluvial forests, implying that dynamics of soil parameters and nutrient
   availability, rather than presence of specific ectomycorrhizal (EMC)
   plant host species or climate, might be crucial for supporting truffle
   life cycle. In order to reveal specific relationship generating soil
   microenvironments in productive and unproductive sites, soil water
   content (SWC) and temperature (T) were measured periodically in two
   depths, in a typical T. magnatum habitat in Western Serbia and compared
   to the atmospheric parameters (precipitation, air temperature). In three
   key time-points (spring soil water saturation, summer drought and autumn
   ascocarp production) soil was sampled through the profile and analyzed
   for nutrients that might be important for plant/fungal growth and
   ectomycorrhiza establishment. Results revealed that specific dynamics of
   soil water, aeration, available P and N, and possibly vegetation
   phenology, might be determining productivity of the microsites within
   the productive area. The hypothesis on soil water and nutrient
   availability seasonal dynamics, which might be controlling truffle
   establishment and life cycle completion in investigated area, was
   proposed. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Subconscious Social Intelligence refers to the design of social services
   oriented towards user problem solving, providing an underlying
   innovation layer is able to generate new solutions to yet unknown
   problems. The innovation layer is achieved by Computational Intelligence
   techniques, encompassing machine learning to build models of user
   satisfaction over solution quality, and stochastic search as the means
   for innovation generation. The SandS project provides an instance of
   such paradigm, where household appliances are the subject of the social
   service. This paper proposes a specific architecture, reporting results
   on a synthetic database build according to SandS project current
   designs. Database synthesis for system tuning and validation is a
   critical issue, hence the paper details the considerations guiding its
   design and generation, as well as the validation procedure ensuring the
   ecological validity of the innovation process simulation. The
   architecture is composed of a Support Vector Regression (SVR) module for
   user satisfaction modeling, and an Evolution Strategy (ES) achieving
   recipe innovation. The paper reports some computational experiments that
   may guide the real life implementation. The reported results are

Abstract = {{The ex utero intrapartum treatment is a rare surgical procedure

   Anesthetic management is substantially different from that regarding
   standard cesarean delivery and its main goals include uterine
   relaxation, fetal anesthesia and preservation of placental blood flow.
   We present the case of an ex utero intrapartum treatment procedure
   performed on a fetus with a large cervical lymphangioma and prenatal
   evidence of airway compromise. Modifications to the classic ex utero
   intrapartum treatment management strategies were successfully adopted

Abstract = {{Autoimmune hypophysitis has been described in patients on ipilimumab, a
   humanised monoclonal antibody increasingly used in the treatment of
   metastatic melanoma. A 67-year-old woman presented with severe fatigue,
   nausea and headaches following the third dose of ipilimumab, which was
   being given as treatment for metastatic melanoma (four administrations
   at three-weekly intervals). Hormonal evaluation confirmed
   hypocortisolism, with low gonadotrophins and a low thyroid-stimulating
   hormone with normal free T4 (she was on long-standing levothyroxine
   because of past surgery for a multinodular goitre). Magnetic resonance
   imaging scanning revealed pituitary enlargement compatible with
   autoimmune hypophysitis. She was commenced on replacement with
   hydrocortisone with significant improvement of her symptoms. The
   enlarged pituitary was reduced in size 4 months later. The patient is
   currently asymptomatic on glucocorticoid and levothyroxine replacement.
   This case highlights relevant clinical, diagnostic and management
   aspects of ipilimumab-induced autoimmune hypophysitis, and emphasises

   monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), carotene and vitamin D intakes than
   lower educated men, and the differences decreased in 2006-2012. In
   1993-1999, higher educated women had higher fiber, iron, carotene,
   vitamin D and alcohol intakes than lower educated women, and the
   differences decreased in 2006-2012. Total energy, polyunsaturated fatty
   acids, retinol and alcohol intakes decreased, while mono/disaccharides,
   MUFA and carotene intake increased in both genders. Lower educated men
   had stronger decreases in saturated fatty acid (SFA) and calcium intakes

Abstract = {{Halophilic archaea are extremophiles, adapted to high-salt environments,
   showing a big biotechnological potential as enzyme, lipids and pigments
   producers. Four inert supports (perlite, vermiculite, polyurethane foam
   and glass fiber) were employed for solid-state fermentation (SSF) of the
   halophilic archaeon Natronococcus sp. TC6 to investigate biomass and
   esterase production. A very low esterase activity and high water
   activity were observed when perlite, vermiculite and polyurethane were
   used as supports. When glass fiber was employed, an important moisture
   loss was observed (8.6 \%). Moreover, moisture retention was improved by
   mixing polyurethane and glass fiber, resulting in maximal biomass and
   esterase production. Three halophilic archaea: Natronococcus sp. TC6,
   Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and Haloarcula marismortui were cultured by
   submerged fermentation (SmF) and by SSF; an improvement of 1.3- to
   6.2-fold was observed in the biomass and esterase production when SSF
   was used. Growth was not homogeneous in the mixture, but was predominant
   in the glass fiber thus was probably because the glass fiber provides a
   holder to the cells, while the polyurethane acts as an impregnation
   medium reservoir. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first
   report on haloarchaea cultivation by SSF aiming biomass and
   esterase/lipase activity production.}},

Abstract = {{Up to now our knowledge of water mite diet has been fragmentary. It is
   derived from observations in the field and laboratory or from a few
   selective laboratory experiments on food choice. In the present study,
   we were able to detect chironomid DNA in water mite bodies for the first
   time using molecular methods. Prey DNA was detected in virtually all
   Hygrobates fluviatilis (Hygrobatidae) that were fed on chironomid larvae
   after a starvation period of up to approximately 1 week. From the
   shortest interval (1 h after feeding) to the longest period after
   feeding (50 h) the relative amount of detected prey DNA was
   significantly reduced. In addition, there was a relationship between the
   relative amount of prey DNA and the assumed amount of the ingested prey
   (classified in categories of the dead prey which reflect the increasing
   ingestion of the mites and the decreasing body content of the prey
   individuals). The results of our study indicate that similar molecular
   analyses will be a powerful tool for diet investigations of mites from
   the field on various taxonomic resolutions of prey taxa. Moreover, the
   results of food selection experiments from the laboratory could be
   compared to evidence of predation by individuals from the field. For
   many mite taxa, especially ones which turned out to be difficult to
   breed in the laboratory (e.g. by unknown diet), the new methods might
   enable us to gain the first ever data on diet and thus may help us to
   consider the role of water mites in food webs more adequately in the
   future.}},

Title = {{Incidence and prognosis of ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis

Abstract = {{Background Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis has been suggested as
   an intermediate process between tracheobronchial colonisation and
   ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients receiving mechanical
   ventilation. We aimed to establish the incidence and effect of
   ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis in a large, international
   patient cohort.
   Methods We did a multicentre, prospective, observational study in 114
   intensive care units (ICU) in Spain, France, Portugal, Brazil,
   Argentina, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Colombia over a preplanned time of 10
   months. All patients older than 18 years admitted to an ICU who received
   invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h were eligible. We
   prospectively obtained data for incidence of ventilator-associated lower
   respiratory tract infections, defined as ventilator-associated
   tracheobronchitis or ventilator-associated pneumonia. We grouped
   patients according to the presence or absence of such infections, and
   obtained data for the effect of appropriate antibiotics on progression
   of tracheobronchitis to pneumonia. Patients were followed up until death
   or discharge from hospital. To account for centre effects with a binary
   outcome, we fitted a generalised estimating equation model with a logit
   link, exchangeable correlation structure, and non-robust standard
   errors. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number
   NCT01791530.
   Findings Between Sept 1, 2013, and July 31, 2014, we obtained data for
   2960 eligible patients, of whom 689 (23\%) developed
   ventilator-associated lower respiratory tract infections. The incidence
   of ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis and that of
   ventilator-associated pneumonia at baseline were similar (320 {[}11\%;
   10.2 of 1000 mechanically ventilated days] vs 369 {[}12\%; 8.8 of 1000
   mechanically ventilated days], p=0.48). Of the 320 patients with
   tracheobronchitis, 250 received appropriate antibiotic treatment and 70
   received inappropriate antibiotics. 39 patients with tracheobronchitis
   progressed to pneumonia; however, the use of appropriate antibiotic
   therapy for tracheobronchitis was associated with significantly lower
   progression to pneumonia than was inappropriate treatment (19 {[}8\%] of
   250 vs 20 {[}29\%] of 70, p<0.0001; crude odds ratio 0.21 {[}95\% CI
   0.11-0.41]). Significantly more patients with ventilator-associated
   pneumonia died (146 {[}40\%] of 369) than those with tracheobronchitis
   (93 {[}29\%] of 320) or absence of ventilator-associated lower
   respiratory tract infections (673 {[}30\%] of 2271, p<0.0001). Median
   time to discharge from the ICU for survivors was significantly longer in
   the tracheobronchitis (21 days {[}IQR 15-34]) and pneumonia (22
   {[}13-36]) groups than in the group with no ventilator-associated lower
   respiratory tract infections (12 {[}8-20]; hazard ratio 1.65 {[}95\% CI
   1.38-1.97], p<0.0001).
   Interpretation This large database study emphasises that
   ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis is a major health problem
   worldwide, associated with high resources consumption in all countries.
   Our findings also show improved outcomes with use of appropriate
   antibiotic treatment for both ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis
   and ventilatorassociated pneumonia, underlining the importance of
   treating both infections, since inappropriate treatment of
   tracheobronchitis was associated with a higher risk of progression to
   pneumonia.}},

Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Age-related effects of the vascular wall have been associated with
   several hemodynamic dysfunctions, including medial vascular
   calcification. Vascular aging has been traditionally addressed using
   proliferative senescence of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in
   vitro, which induces osteoblastic transition and favors calcification in
   vitro. In this work, we have analyzed the relationship between
   organismal aging and proliferative senescence by comparing the
   proliferative aging of VSMC obtained from young, mature, and old rats
   (2-,12-, and 24-month cell lines {[}CL], respectively). VSMC
   proliferated to more than 100 cumulative population doublings (CPD)
   without evidence of proliferative senescence, most likely as a
   consequence of telomerase induction. The apoptosis rate increased with
   CPD in all three CL, but the oxidation status of the cells was not
   modified. The magnitude of all gene expression changes caused by CPD was
   higher than the magnitude of the changes caused by donor age: the
   expressions of VSMC markers a-actin and SM22a decreased, while the
   expressions of transcription factors Msx2 and Runx2 and of bone
   morphogenetic protein-2 increased. Treatment of the cells with 2 mmol/L
   Pi revealed that the intensity of the effect of CPD on calcium
   deposition was greater than the effect of donor age. In conclusion, the
   proliferative lifespan of VSMC magnifies the effect of donor age on the
   osteoblastic transition of VSMC, therefore suggesting that in vivo
   vascular aging changes can be less dramatic than what is shown by in
   vitro aging.}},

Abstract = {{Surgical nerve injury sometimes leads to chronic postsurgical
   neuropathic pain (CPSNP). The risk factors for this condition are not
   well understood. We prospectively assessed 46 patients scheduled for
   iliac crest bone harvest, 2 days (02) and 3 months (M3) after surgery,
   to determine the time course of nerve fiber degeneration and expression
   of the TNF-alpha and NGF genes in skin punch biopsies. Mechanical and
   thermal detection and pain thresholds were evaluated at 02 and M3, by
   quantitative sensory testing. Skin punch biopsies were also obtained
   from the thighs ipsilateral and contralateral to iliac crest bone
   harvest. Intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) and cutaneous TNF-a
   and NGF gene expression were analyzed. Forty-five volunteers matched for
   age, sex, skin color were examined as controls. Chronic postsurgical
   neuropathic pain was defined as pain in an area of hypesthesia with a
   positive Douleur Neuropathique 4 questionnaire score. Overall, 73\% (N =
   32) of patients developed hypesthesia and 40\% (N = 13) of these
   patients had developed CPSNP at M3. Quantitative sensory testing
   results, IENFD, and skin TNF-a and NGF gene expression at 02 and M3 did
   not differ between patients with and without CPSNP. However, in patients
   with CPSNP, burning, compression, and pain provoked by brushing were
   correlated with IENFD at M3, suggesting a possible association between
   partial nerve lesions and more intense CPSNP, than with total nerve
   lesion. Furthermore, preoperative pain and opioid use were higher in
   patients who developed CPSNP than in those without CPSNP. These findings
   suggest that the predictors of CPSNP development are clinical rather
   than histological or biochemical.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose the use of electrically-addressable lens
   devices for performing fast non-mechanical axial scanning when imaging
   three-dimensional samples. This non-mechanical method can be implemented
   in any commercial microscope. The approach is based on the insertion of
   the tunable lens at the aperture stop of the microscope objective. By
   tuning the voltage, a stack of depth images of 3D specimens can be
   captured in real time and with constant magnification and resolution.
   The main advantage of our technique is the possibility of performing
   fast axial scanning free of mechanical vibrations.}},

Abstract = {{Little information on evolutionary relationships of Neotropical
   organisms or on the factors that have shaped the diversity currently
   encountered in this region is available. However, it is clear that
   biotic interactions and abiotic aspects have played important roles for
   species diversification in the region. This study focuses on Dolichandra
   (Bignonieae, Bignoniaceae), a clade of Neotropical lianas that is
   distributed broadly across different habitats and with diverse
   pollination and dispersal systems. We used sequences from two plastid
   DNA markers (ndhF and rpl32-trnL) and one nuclear gene (PepC) to infer
   phylogenetic relationships in Dolichandra using parsimony and Bayesian
   approaches. We then used this phylogenetic framework as basis to study
   the biogeographic history, reconstruct the evolution of morphological
   characters and test the impact of morphology and environment on the
   diversification of the genus. More specifically, we: (1) time-calibrate
   the phylogenetic tree of Dolichandra; (2) estimate the ancestral areas
   of the various lineages; (3) estimate the ancestral states of discrete
   and continuous morphological traits; (4) test for phylogenetic signal in
   environmental and phenotypic data; and (5) test whether morphological
   characters and/or niche evolution are correlated with cladogenesis. All
   Dolichandra spp. are monophyletic in the combined molecular phylogeny;
   relationships among species are generally well resolved, although poorly
   supported in some instances. The genus is inferred to have originated
   36.43-26.23 Mya, possibly in eastern South America. Ancestral state
   reconstructions of continuous and discrete floral characters inferred a
   mixed morphology as the ancestral condition for the group. Phylogenetic
   signal differed between perianth and sexual whorls and gradual evolution
   was recovered for all traits except style length and anther length.
   Environmental variables showed no phylogenetic signal and a pattern of
   variation that was not correlated with branch length, suggesting that
   environmental transitions were concomitant with speciation. Dispersal is
   inferred to be the main driver of the differential distribution observed
   among species. In addition, climatic preferences and floral characters
   seem to have been important reproductive barriers in Dolichandra. (C)

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate bacterial and fungal aerosol
   concentrations at the holy mosque (Al-Masjid Al-Haram). Air samples were
   collected from different locations inside and outside the holy mosque,
   during the month of Ramadan-2011 (the fasting month), using a portable
   Air-port MD8 gelatin filter sampler. Trypticase soya agar and Capek's
   dox agar media were used to count bacteria and fungi, respectively. The
   mean concentrations of airborne bacteria and fungi ranged between
   10(5)-10(6) colony forming unit per cubic meter of air (CFU/m(3))
   outside, and similar to 10(2)-10(5) CFU/m(3) inside locations. The
   highest outside bacterial concentrations 10(6) CFU/m(3) were found at
   the Al Umra, Al Fatah and eastern plazas, and the highest inside fungal
   concentrations similar to 10(5) CFU/m(3) were found at the courtyard,
   expansion of 1st floor, and roof. Significant differences (P < 0.05)
   were found between bacterial and fungal concentrations inside and
   outside sampling locations, higher concentrations shifted towards to
   outside locations. Significant differences were also found between the
   bacterial and fungal concentrations insideeun-closed and semi-closed (P
   < 0.05) with inside-closed locations. Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus
   and Micrococcus, and fungi, Aspergillus niger were the dominant
   microbial aerosol genera. The obtained data is considered a step to make
   up the gap about airborne microbial contamination inside the holy
   mosque, and microbial air quality should be studied along over the year
   at the holy mosque in the future. Copyright (c) 2015 Turkish National

Abstract = {{Close peer networks can affect adolescents' health behaviors by altering
   their social environments, and thus their risk for and protection
   against substance use involvement. We tested a 20 minute intervention
   named Peer Network Counseling that integrates motivational interviewing
   and peer network strategies with 119 urban adolescents who reported
   occasional or problem substance use. Adolescents presenting at primary
   care clinic were randomized to intervention or control conditions and
   followed for 6 months. Mixed-effect latent growth models were used to
   evaluate intervention effects on trajectories of alcohol and marijuana
   use, offers to use substances, and moderation models to test for
   interactions between intervention condition and peer network
   characteristics. A significant intervention effect was found for boys
   for offers to use alcohol from friends (p < .05), along with a trend
   significant effect for alcohol use (p < .08). Intervention was more
   effective in reducing marijuana use, vs. control, for participants with
   more peer social support (p < .001) and with more peer encouragement for
   prosocial behavior (school, clubs, sports, religious activities);
   however, intervention did not affect these network characteristics.
   Results provide support to continue this line of research to test brief
   interventions that activate protective peer network characteristics
   among at-risk adolescents, while also raising some interesting
   gender-based intervention questions for future research. (C) 2015

   parameters. The exchange interactions between the magnetic atoms Mn-Mn
   in Mn2Au are given by using the experiment results and the mean field
   theory. The High Temperature Series Expansions (HTSEs) of the magnetic
   susceptibility with the magnetic moments in Mn2Au (m(Mn)) is given up to

Title = {{A surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm based on the genetic
   diversity objective}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{87-100}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a novel surrogate-assisted memetic algorithm is proposed
   which is based on the preservation of genetic diversity within the
   population. The aim of the algorithm is to solve multi-objective
   optimization problems featuring computationally expensive fitness
   functions in an efficient manner. The main novelty is the use of an
   evolutionary algorithm as global searcher that treats the genetic
   diversity as an objective during the evolution and uses it, together
   with a non-dominated sorting approach, to assign the ranks. This
   algorithm, coupled with a gradient-based algorithm as local searcher and
   a back-propagation neural network as global surrogate model,
   demonstrates to provide a reliable and effective balance between
   exploration and exploitation. A detailed performance analysis has been
   conducted on five commonly used multi-objective problems, each one
   involving distinct features that can make the convergence difficult
   toward the Pareto-optimal front. In most cases, the proposed algorithm
   outperformed the other state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms
   considered in the comparison, assuring higher repeatability on the final
   non-dominated set, deeper convergence level and higher convergence rate.
   It also demonstrates a clear ability to widely cover the Pareto-optimal
   front with larger percentage of non-dominated solutions if compared to
   the total number of function evaluations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus is a durophagous brachyuran.
   Right-handed crabs are predominant, but left-handed crabs are also found
   in nature. Left-handedness may arise from loss of the right crusher. We
   examined whether heterochely (morphology) was correlated with
   differences in closing force (physical property) and handedness
   (behaviour). The closing force was stronger in larger chela with greater
   apodeme height and handedness resided in the chela with stronger closing
   force. With loss of the right chela (autotomy), handedness transitioned
   from the right to left chela, and all crabs were left-handed thereafter.
   Reversed handedness was accompanied with a reduction of size and closing
   force in the regenerated right chela, and growth of the original left
   chela. After handedness reversal, dentition on the left dactylus of the
   newly-converted crusher was close to that of the original right crusher,
   but did not attain the same shape, even after 10 moults. Left-handed
   crabs were significantly worse than right-handed crabs at crushing
   hard-shelled prey. Chela formation was symmetrical in the zoea, and
   heterochely and right-handedness started in the megalopa, regardless of
   maternal handedness. Since the left chela is capable of being the
   crusher, heterochely may be caused by differences in morphogenetic
   velocity between the right and left chelae, under a signal
   discriminating right from left. Right-handedness is an attribute of P.
   trituberculatus, that would be inheritable across generations. It is
   probable that right-handedness was used in the earliest durophagous
   crabs, and this trend has been succeeded to extant species.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed study about magnetic sensing techniques based on anisotropic
   magnetoresistive sensors shows that the technology is suitable for
   low-frequency space applications like the eLISA mission. Low noise
   magnetic measurements at the sub-millihertz frequencies were taken by
   using different electronic noise reduction techniques in the signal
   conditioning circuit. We found that conventional modulation techniques
   reversing the sensor bridge excitation do not reduce the potential 1/f
   noise of the magnetoresistors, so alternative methods such as flipping
   and electro-magnetic feedback are necessary. In addition, a
   low-frequency noise analysis of the signal conditioning circuits has
   been performed in order to identify and minimize the different main
   contributions from the overall noise. The results for chip-scale
   magnetoresistances exhibit similar noise along the eLISA bandwidth (0.1
   mHz - 1 Hz) to the noise measured by means of the voluminous fluxgate
   magnetometers used in its precursor mission, known as LISA Pathfinder.

   necessary for reporter gene expression. It was also confirmed that these
   aspartates are important for the production of viral mRNA and antigenome

   that these two aspartates are key players in the nucleotidyl transfer

Abstract = {{Bacteria and fungi drive the decomposition of dead plant biomass
   (litter), an important step in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Here we
   investigate the sensitivity of litter microbial communities to simulated
   global change (drought and nitrogen addition) in a California annual
   grassland. Using 16S and 28S rDNA amplicon pyrosequencing, we quantify
   the response of the bacterial and fungal communities to the treatments
   and compare these results to background, temporal (seasonal and
   interannual) variability of the communities. We found that the drought
   and nitrogen treatments both had significant effects on microbial
   community composition, explaining 2-6\% of total compositional
   variation. However, microbial composition was even more strongly
   influenced by seasonal and annual variation (explaining 14-39\%). The
   response of microbial composition to drought varied by season, while the
   effect of the nitrogen addition treatment was constant through time.
   These compositional responses were similar in magnitude to those seen in
   microbial enzyme activities and the surrounding plant community, but did
   not correspond to a consistent effect on leaf litter decomposition rate.
   Overall, these patterns indicate that, in this ecosystem, temporal
   variability in the composition of leaf litter microorganisms largely
   surpasses that expected in a short-term global change experiment. Thus,
   as for plant communities, future microbial communities will likely be
   determined by the interplay between rapid, local background variability
   and slower, global changes.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare 3.8- and 4.8-mm abutments
   submitted to simulations of masticatory cycles to examine whether
   abutment diameter and cemented vs screw-retained crowns affect torque
   loss of the abutments and crowns. Materials and Methods: Forty
   implant/abutment sets were divided into the following groups (n = 10 in
   each group): (1) G4.8S included 4.8-mm abutment with screw-retained
   crown; (2) G4.8C included 4.8-mm abutment with cemented crown; (3) G3.8S
   included 3.8-mm abutment with screw-retained crown; and (4) G3.8C
   included 3.8-mm abutment with cemented crown. All abutments were
   tightened with torque values of 20 Ncm, and 10 Ncm for screw-retained
   crowns. Torque loss was measured before and after cycling loading
   (300,000 cycles). Results: Torque loss of screw-retained crowns
   significantly increased after cycling in abutments of groups G3.8S (P =
   .05) and G4.8S (P = .001). No difference was noted between the abutments
   before cycling (P = .735), but G3.8S abutments presented greater torque
   loss than the other groups after cycling (P = .008). Significant
   differences were noted in the abutment torque loss before and after
   cycling loading only for the G3.8C group (P = .05). Conclusion: The
   abutment diameter affects torque loss of screw-retained crowns and leads
   to failure during the test; mechanical cycling increases torque loss of
   abutment screw and screw-retained crowns.}},

Abstract = {{A highly sensitive ions flow controller, for lab-on-a-chip devices,
   operating through the nanochannels and low external potentials is
   demonstrated. The ion concentration can be modulated upto 50\% while
   working in sub-micro molar range. The device is a fluidic-field-effect
   transistor (Fluid-FET) which has nanodimensional fluidic channel,
   connecting two fluid reservoirs and is capped with high quality thermal
   SiO2 (i.e., low surface charges compared with plasma enhanced chemical
   vapor deposition SiO2), which is used as gate oxide; analogous to a
   channel between source-drain of a conventional FET. The ionic
   conductance modulation in the range of 40\%-50\% is demonstrated at low
   voltages (<= 2 V) through an external gate potential, providing a
   simpler way to modulate the surface charges of the channel. The
   conductance of nanochannel is modeled as a function of gate voltage and
   gate electrode position (symmetrical and asymmetrical with respect to
   nanochannels). The precise movement of the ions in one preferred
   direction (diodic behavior) is achieved by asymmetrically positioned
   external gate electrode. Fluid-FETs are realized using standard silicon
   process techniques with polysilicon as sacrificial material, allowing
   thermally grown silicon oxide as capping layer with low surface charges.
   The devices are analyzed using 3-D optical imaging, scanning electron
   microscopy, and electrical characterization in the presence of various
   ionic solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Global acute malnutrition (GAM) is the sum of moderate acute
   malnutrition (MAM) and severe acute malnutrition (SAM). The use of
   different foods and protocols for MAM and SAM treatment can be
   cumbersome in emergency settings.
   Objective: Our objective was to determine the recovery and coverage
   rates for GAM of an integrated protocol with a single food product,
   ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF), compared with standard management.
   Methods: This was a cluster-randomized controlled trial in Sierra Leone
   conducted in 10 centers treating GAM in children aged 6-59 mo. The
   integrated protocol used midupper arm circumference (MUAC) as the
   criterion for admission and discharge, with a MUAC <12.5 cm defining
   malnutrition. The protocol included a decreasing ration of RUTF and
   health maintenance messages delivered by peers. Standard therapy treated
   MAM with a fortified blended flour and SAM with RUTF and used
   weight-for-height to determine admission to the treatment program.
   Coverage rates were the number of children who received treatment/number
   of children in the community eligible for treatment.
   Results: Most of the children receiving integrated management had MAM
   (774 of 1100; 70\%), whereas among those receiving standard management,
   SAM predominated (537 of 857; 63\%; P = 0.0001). Coverage was 71\% in
   the communities served by integrated management and 55\% in the
   communities served by standard care (P = 0.0005). GAM recovery in the
   integrated management protocol was 910 of 1100 (83\%) children and was
   682 of 857 (79\%) children in the standard therapy protocol.
   Conclusion: Integrated management of GAM in children is an acceptable
   alternative to standard management and provides greater community
   coverage.}},

   Large-Scale Distributed Graph Processing}},
Journal = {{ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The vertex-centric programming model is an established computational
   paradigm recently incorporated into distributed processing frameworks to
   address challenges in large-scale graph processing. Billion-node graphs
   that exceed the memory capacity of commodity machines are not well
   supported by popular Big Data tools like MapReduce, which are
   notoriously poor performing for iterative graph algorithms such as
   PageRank. In response, a new type of framework challenges one to ``think
   like a vertex{''} (TLAV) and implements user-defined programs from the
   perspective of a vertex rather than a graph. Such an approach improves
   locality, demonstrates linear scalability, and provides a natural way to
   express and compute many iterative graph algorithms. These frameworks
   are simple to program and widely applicable but, like an operating
   system, are composed of several intricate, interdependent components, of
   which a thorough understanding is necessary in order to elicit top
   performance at scale. To this end, the first comprehensive survey of
   TLAV frameworks is presented. In this survey, the vertex-centric
   approach to graph processing is overviewed, TLAV frameworks are
   deconstructed into four main components and respectively analyzed, and
   TLAV implementations are reviewed and categorized.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the prevalence and correlates of sexting (i.e.,

   do sext each other, but it is much less common than within young adult
   relationships, and consists mainly of sexy or intimate talk (29\%
   reported engaging in sexy talk with partners) rather than sexually
   explicit photos or videos (12\% reported sending nude or nearly-nude
   photos). Sending sexy talk messages was positively related to
   relationship satisfaction only among those with high levels of
   avoidance, and sending sexually explicit pictures was related to
   satisfaction for men, and for women with high levels of attachment
   anxiety. Additionally, sending sexually explicit pictures was related to
   greater ambivalence among both men and women. These findings support and
   extend previous research with young adults.}},

Abstract = {{Although most crimes follow seasonal cycles, homicide is an apparent

   assault, a closely related offense, has an obvious annual pattern.
   Focusing on large U.S. cities, this article reevaluates seasonality in
   homicide rates using data with more extensive spatial and areal
   dimensions than in previous research. Panel decompositions reveal
   seasonal cycles in both homicide and assault rates. Seasonality stands
   out more clearly in assault, however, and the patterns differ somewhat
   in their details. The findings support the idea that assault and
   homicide have similar seasonal fluctuations, but they also suggest that
   the crimes are more distinct than criminologists often believe.}},

   recognized as a sub-specialty of its own. The aim of this study was to
   assess and analyze the publication patterns of the pediatric burns
   literature over the last six decades.
   Methods: A search strategy for the Web of Science database was designed
   for pediatric burns publications, with output analyzed between two
   periods: 1945-1999 (period 1) and 2000-2013 (period 2).
   Results: There were 1133 and 1194 publications for periods 1 (1945-1999)
   and 2 (2000-2013), respectively. The mean citation counts of the top 50
   publications were 77 (range 45-278) and 49 (range 33-145) for periods 1
   and 2, respectively. There were 26 and 20 authors with two or more
   publications in the top 50 list in periods 1 and 2, respectively. Of
   these there are two authors that have published 47 papers in both
   combined time-periods. There were 29 and 9 journals that have published
   50\% of the publications for time-period 1 and 2 respectively. In period
   2, there were two burns journals that have published 37.2\% of the total
   articles.
   Conclusions: Pediatric burns research has evolved from an associated,
   dispersed entity into a consolidated sub-specialty that has been
   successfully integrated into mainstream burns journals. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a heterogeneous disease that varies in the
   extent of affected colon and the severity of symptoms. Studies have
   suggested that at the time of diagnosis, approximately 46\% of patients
   have inflammation limited to the rectum (ulcerative proctitis) or
   limited to the rectum and the sigmoid colon (ulcerative
   proctosigmoiditis). For distal forms of UC, a number of treatment
   options are available, including rectal and oral formulations. Rectal
   therapies (i.e., suppositories, foams, enemas) may be recommended for
   the management of patients with distal forms of UC, either as
   monotherapy, or in combination with oral therapies. First-line treatment
   for patients with distal UC is often 5-aminosalicylic acid rectal
   therapies, and is supported by a history of safety and efficacy in this
   patient population. However, second-generation corticosteroid (i.e.,
   budesonide, beclomethasone dipropionate) rectal therapies have also been
   developed to treat active distal forms of UC. Despite the demonstrated
   safety and efficacy of rectal therapies for the induction and
   maintenance of remission of UC, rectally administered agents are widely
   underused and associated with nonadherence to treatment. However,
   decreased dosing frequency and the introduction of formulations of
   rectal agents that improve retention may increase use of rectal
   therapies and help to overcome barriers associated with nonadherence.
   Data support the use of rectal therapies for the induction and
   maintenance of remission of distal forms of UC.}},

Abstract = {{With many surgical training programmes providing less time for training
   it can be challenging for trainees to acquire the necessary surgical
   skills to perform complex video assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS)
   lung resections. Indeed as the utilization of single port operations
   increases the need to approach the operating theatre with
   already-existing excellent hand-eye coordination skills increases. We
   suggest that there are a number of ways that trainees can begin to
   develop these necessary skills. Firstly, using computer games that
   involve changing horizons and orientations. Secondly, utilizing
   box-trainers to practice using the thoracoscopic instruments. Thirdly,
   learning how essential tools such as the stapler work. Trainees will
   then be able to progress to meaningfully assisting in theatre and indeed
   learning how to perform the operation themselves. At this stage is
   useful to observe expert surgeons whilst they operate-to watch both
   their technical and non-technical skills. Ultimately, surgery is a
   learned skill and requires implementation of these techniques over a
   sustained period of time.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. A program to promote research by pharmacy students created
   through the collaboration of an academic medical center and a college of
   pharmacy is described.
   Summary. In 2009, Midwestern University Chicago College of Pharmacy and
   Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH) expanded their existing partnership
   by establishing a program to increase opportunities for pharmacy
   students to conduct clinical translational research. All professional
   year 1, 2, or 3 students at the college, as well as professional year 4
   students on rotation at NMH, can participate in the program. Central to
   the program's infrastructure is the mentorship of student leads by
   faculty- and hospital-based pharmacists. The mentors oversee the student
   research projects and guide development of poster presentations; student
   leads mentor junior students and assist with orientation and training
   activities. Publication of research findings in the peer-reviewed
   literature is a key program goal. In the first four years after program
   implementation, participation in a summer research program grew nearly
   10-fold (mainly among incoming professional year 2 or 3 students, and
   student poster presentations at national pharmacy meetings increased
   nearly 20-fold; the number of published research articles involving
   student authors increased from zero in 2009 to three in 2012 and two in
   2013.
   Conclusion. A collaborative program between an academic medical center
   and a college of pharmacy has enabled pharmacy students to conduct
   research at the medical center and has been associated with increases in
   the numbers of poster presentations and publications involving students.}},

Title = {{An Examination of the Indirect Effect of Anxiety Sensitivity in terms of
   Asthma and Smoking Cessation Processes}},
Journal = {{ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{188-191}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Despite the increased rates of smoking and poor cessation
   outcomes among individuals with asthma relative to those without, little
   scholarly attention has examined mechanisms linking asthma to smoking
   cessation processes. The current study sought to examine the indirect
   effect of anxiety sensitivity in terms of asthma and smoking cessation
   processes (i.e., duration of longest quit attempt, motivation to quit
   smoking, smoking dependence motives).
   Methods: Participants were 90 regular daily smokers: 43 with asthma
   (51.2\% male, M-age = 38.0 years, SD = 12.5) and 47 without asthma
   (46.8\% male, M-age = 35.4 years, SD = 11.2) who were participating in a
   larger smoking cessation study. Data from the baseline (pre-quit
   attempt) assessment session were used.
   Results: After accounting for the effects of gender, race, daily smoking
   rate, and negative affectivity, asthma status was indirectly related to
   motives for smoking related to nicotine dependence and motivation to
   quit smoking through anxiety sensitivity. There was no significant
   indirect effect for duration of longest quit attempt.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that smokers with asthma may be
   particularly fearful of physiological arousal, which in turn, may
   account for greater motivation to quit smoking, but also stronger
   dependence motives for smoking. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective This survey was developed to assess the prevalence and effects
   of the perception of shame in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery
   residency training in the United States.
   Study Design Survey.
   Setting US otolaryngology training programs.
   Subjects Faculty and trainees in US otolaryngology training programs.
   Methods A 14-item survey to assess the prevalence of the experience of
   shame and the attitudes toward use of shame in otolaryngology residency
   training was sent to all otolaryngology-head and neck surgery program
   directors for distribution among their respective faculty and resident
   cohorts.
   Results A total of 267 responses were received (women, 24.7\%; men,
   75.3\%): 42.7\% of respondents were trainees; 7.0\% of trainees thought
   that shame was a necessary/effective tool, compared with 11.4\% of
   faculty; 50\% of respondents felt that they had been personally shamed
   during residency; and 69.9\% of respondents had witnessed another
   trainee being shamed during residency training. Trainees were most
   commonly shamed in the operating room (78.4\%). Otolaryngology faculty
   members did the shaming 95.1\% of the time. Although shaming prompted
   internal reflection/self-improvement in 57.4\% of trainees, it also
   caused loss of self-confidence in 52.5\%. Trainees who had been shamed
   were more likely to view shame as an appropriate educational tool (P <
   .05).
   Conclusion Half of respondents have felt shamed during their residency
   training, and a majority has witnessed a colleague being shamed.
   Understanding the negative impact that shaming behaviors have on the
   learning environment and on the performance of the individual within it
   is an important first step in creating an environment maximally
   conducive to learning, professional development, and patient safety.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally show that Daphnia magna can use terrestrial-derived
   dissolved organic matter (t-DOM) to support growth and reproduction when
   alternative food sources are limiting or absent. Unlike previous
   studies, we restricted available food to limiting algae (0.1 mg C L-1 of
   Scenedesmus obliquus, provided to all treatments) and bacteria
   (conditions were not sterile) by excluding heterotrophic protists and
   running our experiment in darkness to prevent algal growth. Daphnia
   receiving 10 mg t-DOC L-1 leached from either beech (Fagus sylvatica,
   t-DOMbeech) or hazel leaves (Corylus maxima, t-DOMhazel) had
   significantly higher juvenile growth rates and deposited larger clutch
   sizes across a range of realistic temperatures (15, 20, 25 degrees C)
   than Daphnia receiving no t-DOM, which failed to deposit eggs. Growth
   rates of t-DOM-supplied Daphnia were similar (0.10 +/- 0.01 d(-1)) and
   clutch sizes were low (<2 eggs female(-1)) across temperatures. Our
   experimental leachate additions mimic fresh t-DOM inputs in natural
   systems (e.g. during runoff or precipitation) and suggest that t-DOM and
   t-DOM-supported bacteria can supplement Daphnia growth and reproduction
   across a range of temperatures even when algae are strongly limiting.
   Low growth and reproduction rates, however, indicate that t-DOM based
   resources are unlikely to sustain Daphnia populations independently from
   sufficient algal contributions.}},

Abstract = {{The classifications of uncertain data turned into one of the dreary
   procedures in the data mining domain. The uncertain data have tuples
   with distinctive probability distribution, which helps to find similar
   class of tuples. When we consider an uncertain data, the feature vector
   will not be a single valued but a function. In this paper, we proposed
   fuzzy entropy and similarity measure to characterize the uncertain data
   through binary decision tree algorithm. Fuzzy entropy is used to find
   the best split point for the decision tree to handle the uncertain data.
   Similarity measure is used to make the better decision for the uncertain
   data with high accuracy. Initially, fuzzy entropy for each feature
   vector is calculated to select the best feature vector. Then, best split
   is selected from the selected feature vector. With the help of trained
   uncertain data, the binary tree starts to grow. Once the split point is
   selected, then the constructed decision tree is evaluated by the testing
   phase of uncertain data. The testing data are subjected to the trained
   decision tree to obtain the classified data. The experimental analyses
   are made to evaluate the performance of the proposed FUDT approach.
   Proposed FUDT algorithm is compared with the existing classification
   algorithm UDT in terms of accuracy and running time. The experimental
   analysis finalizes that our FUDT algorithm outperforms the existing UDT
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{It is in general challenging to provide confidence intervals for
   individual variables in high dimensional regression without making
   strict or unverifiable assumptions on the design matrix. We show here
   that a `group bound' confidence interval can be derived without making
   any assumptions on the design matrix. The lower bound for the regression
   coefficient of individual variables can be derived via linear
   programming. The idea also generalizes naturally to groups of variables,
   where we can derive a one-sided confidence interval for the joint effect
   of a group. Although the confidence intervals of individual variables
   are by the nature of the problem often very wide, it is shown to be
   possible to detect the contribution of groups of highly correlated
   predictor variables even when no variable individually shows a
   significant effect. The assumptions that are necessary to detect the
   effect of groups of variables are shown to be weaker than the weakest
   known assumptions that are necessary to detect the effect of individual
   variables.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: A negative computed tomographic (CT) scan may be used to
   rule out cervical spine (c-spine) injury after trauma. Loss of lordosis
   (LOL) is frequently found as the only CT abnormality. We investigated
   whether LOL should preclude c-spine clearance.
   METHODS: All adult trauma patients with isolated LOL at our Level I
   trauma center (February 1, 2011 to May 31, 2012) were prospectively
   evaluated. The primary outcome was clinically significant injury on
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), flexion-extension views, and/or repeat
   physical examination.
   RESULTS: Of 3,333 patients (40 +/- 17 years, 60\% men) with a c-spine
   CT, 1,007 (30\%) had isolated LOL. Among 841 patients with a Glasgow
   Coma Scale score of 15, no abnormalities were found on MRI,
   flexion-extension views, and/or repeat examinations, and all collars
   were removed. Among 166 patients with Glasgow Coma Scale less than 15, 3
   (.3\%) had minor abnormal MRI findings but no clinically significant
   injury.
   CONCLUSION: Isolated LOL on c-spine CT is not associated with a
   clinically significant injury and should not preclude c-spine clearance.

Abstract = {{The longstanding issue of extrajudicial police shootings of racial and
   ethnic minority members has received unprecedented interest from the
   general public in the past year. To better understand this issue,
   researchers have examined racial shooter biases in the laboratory for
   more than a decade; however, shooter biases have been operationalized in
   multiple ways in previous studies with mixed results within and across
   measures. We meta-analyzed 42 studies, investigating five
   operationalizations of shooter biases (reaction time with/without a gun,
   false alarms, shooting sensitivity, and shooting threshold) and relevant
   moderators (e.g., racial prejudice, state level gun laws). Our results
   indicated that relative to White targets, participants were quicker to
   shoot armed Black targets (d(av) = -.13, 95\% CI {[}-.19,-.06]), slower
   to not shoot unarmed Black targets (d(av) =.11, 95\% Cl {[}.05,.18), and
   more likely to have a liberal shooting threshold for Black targets
   (d(av) = -.19, 95\% Cl {[}-.37,-.01]). In addition, we found that in
   states with permissive (vs. restrictive) gun laws, the false alarm rate
   for shooting Black targets was higher and the shooting threshold for
   shooting Black targets was lower than for White targets. These results
   help provide critical insight into the psychology of race-based shooter
   decisions, which may have practical implications for intervention (e.g.,
   training police officers) and prevention of the loss of life of racial
   and ethnic minorities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal decomposition of dysprosium nitrate is a complex process
   which begins with the simultaneous condensation of the initial monomer
   Dy(NO3)(3)center dot 6H(2)O into a cyclic hexamer 6{[}Dy(NO3)(3)center
   dot 6H(2)O]. This cluster gradually loses water and nitric acid, and
   intermediate oxynitrates Dy6O7(NO3)(4)center dot 6H(2)O and
   Dy6O8(NO3)(2)center dot 5H(2)O are formed. At higher temperatures, these
   products undergo further degradation, lose nitrogen dioxide, water, and
   oxygen, and finally, after having lost lattice water, are transformed
   into the cubic form of dysprosium oxide. The models of intermediate
   oxynitrates represent a reasonably good approximation to the real
   structures and a proper interpretation of experimental data. The
   comparison of the potential energies of consecutive oxynitrates
   permitted an evaluation of their stability. The mechanism was studied by
   thermal analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, infrared
   spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The mass losses were related to the
   vibrational energy levels of the evolved gases.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. CO2 laser cordectomy for glottic carcinoma offers excellent
   oncologic control on a per stage basis as compared with primary
   radiotherapy. We aim to further investigate the fluctuations of
   postoperative vocal outcomes following extended laser cordectomy for
   glottic cancer.
   Design. Single center retrospective cohort study.
   Methods. Eleven patients with glottic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) who
   received CO2 laser cordectomy European Laryngological Society type
   III-IV with complete datasets at preoperative, immediate postoperative
   (within 4 months), and delayed (greater than 6 months) time points were
   included.
   Results. All patients (n = 11) received cordectomy as their primary
   treatment. Tumor stage was divided evenly between T1 and T2. One patient
   was referred for post-cordectomy thyroplasty. Mean Voice Handicap Index
   (VHI) scores increased in the immediate postoperative period (43.3-46.2)
   but did not reach significance (P > 0.05). Delayed postoperative VHI
   (23.3) demonstrated substantial improvement from both pre-and immediate
   postoperative levels (P = 0.047). Objective voice rating significantly
   declined initially (P = 0.03; Grade, P = 0.01; Breathiness) and
   recovered to similar preoperative levels. Maximum phonation time (MPT)
   showed substantial decreases at the initial postoperative period (P =
   0.007). Although significant improvement was made at the delayed
   postoperative point (P = 0.009), MPT remained below the preoperative
   level (P = 0.028). No significant changes were seen in phonatory
   subglottic pressures.
   Conclusions. Patients undergoing extended CO2 laser cordectomy for
   glottic cancers can experience initial decline in voice quality;
   however, vocal function routinely returns to preoperative levels
   following the initial healing period. A small percentage of extended
   cordectomy patients may require further vocal interventions.}},

Abstract = {{The accumulation of biogenic greenhouse gases (methane, carbon dioxide)
   in organic sediments is an important factor in the redevelopment and
   risk management of many brownfield sites. Good practice with brownfield
   site characterization requires the identification of free-gas phases and
   pathways that allow its migration and release at the ground surface. Gas
   pockets trapped in the subsurface have contrasting properties with the
   surrounding porous media that favor their detection using geophysical
   methods. We have developed a case study in which pockets of gas were
   intercepted with multilevel monitoring wells, and their lateral
   continuity was monitored over time using resistivity. We have developed
   a novel interpretation procedure based on Archie's law to evaluate
   changes in water and gas content with respect to a mean background
   medium. We have used induced polarization data to account for errors in
   applying Archie's law due to the contribution of surface conductivity
   effects. Mosaics defined by changes in water saturation allowed the
   recognition of gas migration and groundwater infiltration routes and the
   association of gas and groundwater fluxes. The inference on flux
   patterns was analyzed by taking into account pressure measurements in
   trapped gas reservoirs and by metagenomic analysis of the
   microbiological content, which was retrieved from suspended sediments in
   groundwater sampled in multilevel monitoring wells. A conceptual model
   combining physical and microbiological subsurface processes suggested
   that biogas trapped at depth may have the ability to quickly travel to
   the surface.}},

Abstract = {{Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers of digestive system
   globally and Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection is believed to be a
   major risk factor. HP can be classified into different types based on
   the presence and expression level of CagA and VacA, and, when exposed to
   adverse environment, HP changes its phenotype from helical type to
   coccoid type, with each having different pathogenicity. The mechanisms
   of HP-induced gastric carcinogenesis and progression are complicated,
   including DNA nitration and oxidation induced by mutagenic factors,
   HP-induced epigenetic modifications, HP-induced disruption of the
   balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis, and HP-induced cancer
   cell invasion and metastasis. HP may also affect the biological function
   of cancer stem cells and induction of cell autophagy. The
   lipopolysaccharide produced by HP can act through toll-like receptor-4
   (TLR-4) to induce gastric mucosal inflammation and is thereby linked to
   the development of gastric cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. Retrospective review.
   Objective. To report the incidence of and risk factors for
   intraoperative cardiopulmonary arrest (ICA) in children undergoing
   spinal deformity surgery.
   Summary of Background Data. Spinal deformities in children are
   associated with comorbidities that can pose substantial risks during
   surgery.
   Methods. We reviewed records of patients who underwent surgery at two
   pediatric tertiary-care hospitals from 2004 through 2014. Fisher exact
   test and the Student t test were used to compare ICA and non-ICA groups
   by patient diagnosis, estimated blood loss, number of vertebral levels
   fused, and proportion of blood volume lost (significance, P < 0.05). We
   classified proximate causes of ICA based on hemoglobin, metabolic
   panel/electrolyte imbalance, electrocardiogram/echocardiography, and
   vital signs.
   Results. ICA occurred in 11 of 2524 (0.4\%) patients. Patients with
   neuromuscular disorders had a 3-fold higher risk of ICA compared with
   those without neuromuscular disorders. At the time of ICA, hemoglobin
   levels were 5 g/dL or less in four patients, potassium was higher than
   5.5 mEq/L in six patients, and ionized calcium was less than or equal to
   1 mmol/L in two patients. There were significant differences between the
   ICA and non-ICA groups in mean number of vertebral levels fused (15 vs.
   12), patient weight (34 vs. 49 kg), estimated blood loss (2623 vs. 959
   mL), and proportion of blood volume lost (1.03 vs. 0.33) (all P < 0.01).
   Suspected causes of ICA were cardiovascular causes (eight patients) and
   anaphylaxis, primary rhythm disturbance, and respiratory/airway cause
   (one patient each). The incidence of ICA for patients with idiopathic
   scoliosis was 0.13\%. Ten of the 11 patients were successfully
   resuscitated, and one patient died.
   Conclusion. ICA occurs in approximately 0.4\% of children undergoing
   spinal fusion surgery. Patients with neuromuscular disorders are at
   greater risk of ICA than those without these disorders.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the Impact of Dwell Time on Solder Interconnect Durability
   Under Bending Loads}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{4549-4556}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{With the increasing portability and miniaturization of modern-day
   electronics, the mechanical robustness of these systems has become more
   of a concern. Existing standards for conducting mechanical durability
   tests of electronic assemblies include bend, shock/drop, vibration, and
   torsion. Although these standards provide insights into both cyclic
   fatigue and overstress damage incurred in solder interconnects (widely
   regarded as the primary mode of failure in electronic assemblies), they
   fail to address the impact of time- dependent (creep) behavior due to
   sustained mechanical loads on solder interconnect durability. It has
   been seen in previous studies that solder durability under thermal
   cycling loads is inversely proportional to the dwell time or hold time
   at either temperature extreme of the imposed temperature cycle. Fatigue
   life models, which include dwell time, have been developed for solder
   interconnects subject to temperature cycling. However, the fatigue life
   models that have been developed in the literature for solder
   interconnects under mechanical loads fail to address the influence of
   the duration of loading. In this study, solder interconnect test
   vehicles were subjected to cyclic mechanical bending with various dwell
   times in order to understand the impact of the duration of mechanical
   loads on solder interconnect durability. The solder interconnects
   examined in this study were formed with 2512 resistor packages using
   various solder compositions {[}tin-lead (Sn-Pb) and 96.5Sn-3Ag-0.5Cu
   (SAC305)]. To evaluate the impact of dwell time, the boards were tested
   with 0 s, 60 s, and 300 s of dwell time at both extremes of the loading
   profile. It was observed that an increase in the dwell time of the
   loading profile resulted in a decrease in the characteristic life of the
   solder interconnects. The decrease in fatigue life was attributed to
   increased creep damage as identified using finite-element simulations.
   An energy partitioning approach was then used to estimate the mean
   cycles to failure for the various testing conditions. The estimated mean
   cycles to failure were within 10\% of the experimentally obtained mean
   cycles to failure.}},

Abstract = {{Military sexual trauma (MST) is known to impact women's health, but
   little is known about the occurrence of MST perpetrated by a past or
   current intimate partner. This study identified the occurrence of
   intimate partner violence (IPV)-related MST in a sample of female
   veterans. We also examined the associations between MST history (no MST
   history, IPV-related MST, and MST by a nonintimate partner) and mental
   and physical health symptoms. Participants were 369 female veteran
   patients of Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) facilities in the New
   England region of the United States who completed a larger 2012 mail
   survey that included validated assessments of MST, posttraumatic stress
   disorder (PTSD Checklist) and depressive symptoms (CES-D), and general
   physical and mental health functioning (Short Form-36). Approximately
   half (49\%) of the women in this sample reported a history of MST, of
   which 27 (15\%) were categorized as IPV-related MST. Few differences in
   health measures were observed among women with IPV-related MST compared
   with women who experienced MST by a nonintimate partner or women with no
   MST history. However, women who experienced IPV-related MST had
   similarly severe health symptoms as women who reported MST by a
   nonintimate partner and more severe PTSD symptoms than women without a
   history of MST. Some women veterans have experienced MST at the hands of
   an intimate partner and face health impacts. This topic warrants
   additional attention in clinical and research efforts.}},

Title = {{Electron density and temperature in the solar corona from multifrequency
   radio imaging}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{583}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Context. The 2D images obtained through rotational aperture synthesis
   with the Nancay Radioheliograph are suitable for quantitative
   exploitation. First results are presented.
   Aims. We study the variations of the quiet corona in brightness and size
   during an 8-year period and derive electron density and temperature in
   the corona.
   Methods. Images at 6 frequencies between 150 and 450 MHz for 183 quiet
   days between 2004 and 2011 were used. Measurements of the brightness
   temperature T-b beyond the limb allowed coronal density models to be
   derived in both EW and NS radial directions, with a weak dependence on
   the electron temperature. The total ranges in the heliocentric distance
   r are 1.15-1.60 R-circle dot (EW) and 1.0-1.4 R-circle dot (NS). The
   agreement between results from different frequencies, in the ranges of r
   where there is overlapping shows the robustness of the method. The
   electron temperature, in turn, can be derived from the comparison of the
   observed mean spectra on the disk with those predicted through transfer
   calculations from the density models derived from limb observations.
   Results. The widths of the brightness profiles that were averaged yearly
   have minima at cycle minimum (2008-2009). These minima are more
   pronounced for EW profiles than for NS ones. The derived yearly-averaged
   density models along equatorial and polar diameters are consistent with
   isothermal and hydrostatic models. They are characterized by their
   density value no extrapolated down to the base of the corona and their
   scale-height temperature T-H. Changes in no and TH with solar cycle are
   given for equatorial and polar regions. The kinetic temperature T-e of
   electrons in the corona (similar to 0.62 MK) is found to be
   significantly less than T-H (similar to 1.5 MK). This implies an ion
   temperature T-i similar to 2.2 MK.
   Conclusions. The yearly-averaged variations of these models are less
   than the dispersion between models derived from other techniques, such
   as white light and EUV observations, partly because these two techniques
   are not time-averaged, and they refer to particular days. The radio
   models are generally less dense, which is compatible with isothermal
   hydrostatic equilibrium in their range of heliocentric distances, and
   they show different behaviors with the solar cycle in the equatorial or
   polar radial directions. The electron kinetic temperature T-e is
   substantially less than T-H.}},

Abstract = {{The nosology of bullous lesions or equivalents (vesicles, erosions, and
   crusts) in patients with lupus erythematosus (LE) is rarely
   addressed.The primary aim of this study was to draw up a precise
   phenotypic inventory of such skin lesions; the secondary objective was
   to assess a potential relationship between the different types of loss
   of epidermis and extracutaneous lupus manifestations.We conducted a
   retrospective multicenter study including 22 patients with definite LE
   and bullous lesions or equivalents. All biopsies were reviewed. Patients
   were recruited in the dermatology departments of 6 centers. Patients
   were included if they met the diagnosis of systemic LE according to
   American College of Rheumatology and/or Systemic Lupus International
   Collaborating Clinics criteria or diagnosis of cutaneous LE based on
   classic clinical criteria and/or histological ascertainment of LE.
   Patients were recruited through clinician's memory and photographic
   collections.Three clinico-pathological patterns could be individualized.
   First, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)-like, sheet-like, skin
   detachment; sun-exposure, mild mucosal involvement, and dermal mucin
   deposition allow differential diagnosis with classical Lyell syndrome.
   Second, vesiculo-bullae and/or crusting occurring on typical lesions of
   subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus or chronic cutaneous lupus
   erythematosus. Third, tense vesicles and/or blisters with an underlying
   neutrophilic dermatosis and a usual response to dapsone.A careful
   analysis of 22 LE patients with epidermal detachment reveals 2 main
   pathomechanisms: a classic LE interface dermatitis, which can be
   hyperacute and lead to TEN-like skin detachment; and a neutrophilic
   dermatosis, with tense vesicles and/or blisters, including classic
   bullous LE.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},

Pages = {{55-66}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Stiffness scales linearly with density in stretch-dominated lattice
   meta-materials offering the possibility of very light yet very stiff
   structures. Current additive manufacturing techniques can assemble
   structures from lattice materials, but the design of such structures
   will require accurate, efficient simulation methods. Equivalent
   continuum models have several advantages over discrete truss models of
   stretch dominated lattices, including computational efficiency and ease
   of model construction. However, the development an equivalent model
   suitable for representing the dynamic response of a periodic truss in
   the small deformation regime is complicated by microinertial effects.
   This paper derives a dynamic equivalent continuum model for periodic
   truss structures suitable for representing long-wavelength wave
   propagation and verifies it against the full Bloch wave theory and
   detailed finite element simulations. The model must incorporate
   microinertial effects to accurately reproduce long wavelength
   characteristics of the response such as anisotropic elastic soundspeeds.
   The formulation presented here also improves upon previous work by
   preserving equilibrium at truss joints for simple lattices and by
   improving numerical stability by eliminating vertices in the effective
   yield surface. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Opioid addiction is no longer a primarily urban problem. As dependence
   on heroin and prescription pain relievers has become a significant issue
   in rural areas, the need for effective treatment of opioid-dependent
   pregnant women and their neonates has grown accordingly. In addition to
   the adverse perinatal outcomes associated with opioid addiction in
   pregnant women, the high costs of caring for these mothers and their
   babies motivate efforts to develop appropriate treatment models. We
   found that integration and coordination of services that promote
   maternal recovery and ability to parent are key requirements for
   treatment of opioid dependence during pregnancy. Unfortunately, lack of
   experience and resources makes such coordination a real challenge in
   rural areas. In this review, we discuss how we managed the challenges of
   developing a comprehensive program for treatment of opioid dependence
   during pregnancy. In addition, we outline our approach for facilitating
   the development of community-based programs to help these patients and
   families in rural regions of Vermont. Close relationships between our
   tertiary care center, local hospitals, community health care
   infrastructure, and legislators bolstered our efforts. In particular,
   appreciation for the severity and importance of the opioid-dependence
   problem in Vermont among health care providers and state legislators was
   paramount for our success in developing a state-wide treatment program.
   This approach can inform similar efforts in other rural regions of the
   United States, and has great potential to improve both access and
   quality of care for women struggling with opioid dependence. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Eddy current distortion is an important issue that may influence the
   quantitative measurements of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The
   corrections of eddy current artifacts could be performed using bipolar
   diffusion gradients or unipolar gradients with affine registration.
   Whether the diffusion pulse sequence affects the quantification of DTI
   indices and the technique that produces more reliable DTI indices in
   terms of reproducibility both remain unclear. Therefore, the purpose of
   this study was to compare the reproducibility and mean values of
   DTI-derived indices between unipolar and bipolar diffusion pulse
   sequences based on actual human brain data. Five repeated datasets of
   unipolar and bipolar DTI were acquired from 10 healthy subjects at
   different echo times (TEs). The reproducibility and mean values of DTI
   indices were assessed by calculating the coefficient of variation and
   mean values of the 5 repeated measurements. The results revealed that
   the reproducibility and mean values of DTI indices were significantly
   affected by the pulse sequence. Unipolar DTI exhibited significantly
   higher reproducibility than bipolar DTI even at the same TE, and the
   mean values of DTI indices were significantly different between them.
   Therefore, we concluded that the reproducibility and mean values of DTI
   indices were significantly influenced by diffusion pulse sequences.}},

Title = {{Gaia astrometry for stars with too few observations. A Bayesian approach}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{583}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Context. The astrometric solution for Gaia aims to determine at least
   five parameters for each star, representing its position, parallax, and
   proper motion, together with appropriate estimates of their
   uncertainties and correlations. This requires at least five distinct
   observations per star. In the early data reductions the number of
   observations may be insufficient for a five-parameter solution, and even
   after the full mission many stars will remain under-observed, including
   faint stars at the detection limit and transient objects. In such cases
   it is reasonable to determine only the two position parameters. The
   formal uncertainties of such a two-parameter solution would however
   grossly underestimate the actual errors in position, due to the
   neglected parallax and proper motion.
   Aims. We aim to develop a recipe to calculate sensible formal
   uncertainties that can be used in all cases of under-observed stars.
   Methods. Prior information about the typical ranges of stellar
   parallaxes and proper motions is incorporated in the astrometric
   solution by means of Bayes' rule. Numerical simulations based on the
   Gaia Universe Model Snapshot (GUMS) are used to investigate how the
   prior influences the actual errors and formal uncertainties when
   different amounts of Gaia observations are available. We develop a
   criterion for the optimum choice of priors, apply it to a wide range of
   cases, and derive a global approximation of the optimum prior as a
   function of magnitude and galactic coordinates.
   Results. The feasibility of the Bayesian approach is demonstrated
   through global astrometric solutions of simulated Gaia observations.
   With an appropriate prior it is possible to derive sensible positions
   with realistic error estimates for any number of available observations.
   Even though this recipe works also for well-observed stars it should not
   be used where a good five-parameter astrometric solution can be obtained
   without a prior. Parallaxes and proper motions from a solution using
   priors are always biased and should not be used.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater bivalve molluscs are considered as effective indicators of
   environmental pollution. The comet assay allows the detection of DNA
   damage such as DNA strand breaks and alkali-labile sites. The main
   oxidative lesion, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), which
   is a pre-mutagenic lesion, can be detected by the comet assay coupled
   with the hOGG1 DNA repair enzyme. With this modified assay we recently
   observed that BaP induced 8-oxodG lesions and with the modified
   comet-Fpg assay we observed that Cd induced oxidative DNA damage. The
   aim of this study was to determine the stability of DNA lesions in Cd
   and BaP exposed zebra mussels using the comet-hOGG1 assay. Mussels were
   exposed for 24 h to these two chemicals and then placed in clean water
   for 6 days. We observed that BaP (7, 12 and 18 A mu g/L) induced an
   increase of DNA strand break levels as soon as 6 h of exposure and that
   the two highest concentrations of BaP induced a low level of
   hOGG1-sensitive sites. After 2 days of depuration, BaP induced DNA
   lesions returned to the basal level, indicating an effective DNA repair.
   Cd (3, 32 and 81 A mu g/L) induced an increase of the DNA strand break
   levels and a low level of hOGG1-sensitive sites. This study revealed
   that BaP-induced DNA lesions are repaired more efficiently than
   Cd-induced DNA lesions. As the level of hOGG1 sensitive sites was
   increased in Cd and BaP exposed mussels, it seems that these chemicals
   induce 8-oxo-dG.}},

Abstract = {{This article aims to investigate the role of married men and their work
   and assets in the economy of the households belonging to the middle and
   lower classes of eighteenth-century Turin. According to traditional
   representations, the husband/father was expected to be the pater
   familias, to act as the main provider and the economic leader of the
   family. In addition, in getting married he was expected to achieve
   economic independence. This research offers evidence that in Turin these
   tasks were part of an ideological and cultural construct, rather than
   the concrete experience of all adult men. Moreover, there were not
   necessary links between marriage, mastery and leadership. Male labour
   was irregular and piecemeal and husbands/fathers could not always ensure
   a regular economic contribution to their family. In several
   circumstances, they could not perform the role of economic leader of the
   household since marriage did not mark the possibility for a man to
   freely handle either his heritage and assets or the resources brought by
   his wife. Finally the article suggests that this model of masculinity
   was in competition with another coexisting ideology that allocated to
   both spouses the responsibility for the survival of the family.}},

Abstract = {{Heart-rate (f(H)) changes during diving and exercise are well documented
   for marine mammals, but changes in stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output
   (CO) are much less known. We hypothesized that both SV and CO are also
   modified following intense exercise. Using transthoracic ultrasound
   Doppler at the level of the aortic valve, we compared blood flow
   velocities in the left ventricle and cardiac frequencies during rest and
   at 1, 3 and 4 min after a bout of exercise in 13 adult bottlenose
   dolphins (Tursiops truncatus, six male and seven female, body mass range
   143-212 kg). Aortic cross-sectional area and ventricle blood velocity at
   the aortic valve were used to calculate SV, which together with f(H)
   provided estimates of left CO at rest and following exercise. f(H) and
   SV stabilized approximately 4-7 s following the post-respiratory
   tachycardia, so only data after the f(H) had stabilized were used for
   analysis and comparison. There were significant increases in f(H), SV
   and CO associated with each breath. At rest, f(H), SV and CO were
   uncorrelated with body mass, and averaged 41 +/- 9 beats min(-1), 136
   +/- 19 ml and 5514 +/- 1182 l min(-1), respectively. One minute
   following high intensity exercise, the cardiac variables had increased
   by 104 +/- 43\%, 63 +/- 11\% and 234 +/- 84\%, respectively. All
   variables remained significantly elevated in all animals for at least 4
   min after the exercise. These baseline values provide the first data on

Abstract = {{Purpose: To report the imaging features of subretinal fibrosis secondary
   to exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) on optical coherence
   tomography angiography.
   Methods: All consecutive patients diagnosed with subretinal fibrosis
   complicating exudative AMD were imaged by color retinal photographs or
   multicolor imaging, fluorescein angiography, spectral domain optical
   coherence tomography, and optical coherence tomography angiography. Eyes
   with active exudative features observed during the last 6 months were
   compared with those without any sign of exudation >6 months.
   Results: Forty-nine eyes of 47 consecutive patients were included. A
   blood flow inside the fibrotic scar could be detected in 46 of 49 cases
   (93.8\%). Three patterns of vascular networks could be distinguished,
   that were described as pruned vascular tree (26 of 49 eyes; 53.1\%),
   tangled network (14 of 49; 28.6\%), and/or vascular loop (25 of 49;
   51.0\%). Furthermore, 2 types of hyporeflective structures, large flow
   void, and/or dark halo were observed in 63\% and in 65\% of eyes,
   respectively. The observed patterns did not differ between eyes with
   active or inactive lesions.
   Conclusion: Optical coherence tomography angiography of subretinal
   fibrosis showed almost constantly a perfused, abnormal vascular network
   and collateral architectural changes in the outer retina and the
   choriocapillaris layer. These features were associated with both active
   and inactive fibrotic choroidal neovessels.}},

Abstract = {{The application of the histochemical stain of sodium rhodizonate to the
   entrance wound for the detection of the lead (Pb) residues coming from
   the gunshot may be affected by false positive cases due to the
   contamination of the environmental Pb. The aim of the Authors is to
   histochemically search the Pb of GSR in a region which should be more
   protected by the contamination: the intracorporeal channel.
   Two hundreds and eighteen serial histological specimens of the
   intracorporeal channels coming from 25 subjects (dead due to gunshots
   and being autopsied at the Section of Legal Medicine of the Milan
   University, in the years 2013-2014) were stained with the sodium
   rhodizonate and sodium rhodizonate in acid environment (HCl 5\%), and
   then observed by the microscope.
   The sodium rhodizonate showed a positivity for the Pb residues in the
   intracorporeal channel, with the detection of the particles within the
   first 2 cm beyond the entrance wound in 6 cases over the total number of
   25 (24\%). Victims were characterized by common features: short-barreled
   weapon; contact shots or short-distance shots; involvement of regions
   that were not covered by clothing; preservation of the microscopic
   structure of organs interested by the intracorporeal channel.
   The searching of GSR in the intracorporeal channel, even in conditions
   securing a high sensitivity, could represent an important test for the
   discrimination between an environmental contamination of Pb and the
   presence of Pb residues by GSR: once confirmed the presence of GSR in

Abstract = {{Purpose: Aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that peak
   injection pressures and image quality using low concentrated contrast
   media (CM) (240 mg/mL) injected with high flow rates will be comparable
   to a standard injection protocol (CM: 300 mg/mL) in coronary computed
   tomographic angiography (CCTA).
   Material and methods: One hundred consecutive patients were scanned on a
   2nd generation dual-source CT scanner. Group 1 (n= 50) received
   prewarmed Iopromide 240 mg/mL at an injection rate of 9 mL/s, followed
   by a saline chaser. Group 2 (n = 50) received the standard injection
   protocol: prewarmed Iopromide 300 mg/mL; flow rate: 7.2 mL/s. For both
   protocols, the iodine delivery rate (IDR, 2.16 gI/s) and the total
   iodine load (22.5 gI) were kept identical. Injection pressure (psi) was
   continuously monitored by a data acquisition program. Contrast
   enhancement was measured in the thoracic aorta and all proximal and
   distal coronary segments. Subjective and objective image quality was
   evaluated between both groups.
   Results: No significant differences in peak injection pressures were
   found between both CM groups (121 + 5.6 psi vs. 120 + 5.3 psi, p =
   0.54). Flow rates of 9 mL/s were safely injected without any
   complications. No significant differences in contrast-to-noise ratio,
   signal-to-noise ratio and subjective image quality were found (all p
   >0.05). No significant differences in attenuation levels were found in
   the thoracic aorta and all segments of the coronary arteries (all p
   >0.05).
   Conclusion: Usage of low iodine concentration CM and injection with high
   flow rates is feasible. High flow rates (9 mL/s) of Iopromide 240 were
   safely injected without complications and should not be considered a
   drawback in clinical practice. No significant differences in peak
   pressure and image quality were found. This creates a doorway towards
   applicability of a broad variety in flow rates and IDRs and subsequently
   more individually tailored injection protocols. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background. Living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) is the best
   treatment option in the late stage of chronic kidney disease. The
   objective of the study was to analyze the attitudes of nursing students
   at the Medical University of Poznan toward living donation of kidney.
   Methods. Sampling points were compulsory attendance in the 5 nursing
   courses of the degree of fulfilment of 80\%. The validated questionnaire
   (PCID-DVR Rios) was self-administered and anonymous.
   Results. The completion rate was 92\% (324 of 354). Among the students,
   91\% (n = 296) were in favor of LDKT, 5\% (n = 15) were undecided, and
   4\% (n = 11) remained is against. When the living kidney donor is not
   related, 57\% (n = 185) of respondents were in favor. The factors that
   are associated with a more favourable attitude are 1) the needs of
   organs for transplantation are covered (P = .012); 2) attitude in favor
   of organ donation and transplantation (P <= .001); 3) attitude toward
   living liver donation (P =.001); 4) attitude in favor of acceptance of
   LDKT for a relative (P < .001); 5) discussing organ donation and
   transplantation with friends (P = .002); and 6) attitude in favor of
   organ donation from a family member (P = .011). In the multivariate
   analysis, highlights are acceptance of the donation of a living kidney
   donor from a family member {[}OR = 9.900 (35.714-2.770); P <= .001] and
   donating a piece of liver in life {[}OR = 50 (166.666-14.492); P <=
   .001].
   Conclusions. Among the nursing students, 91\% are in favor of living
   kidney donation.}},

   Questionnaire and the Ages \& Stages Questionnaire.
   Results: Overall, there were associations among parental ratings of

   parental perception of sleep problems. There were no relationships
   between any sleep variables and developmental outcomes, including

Abstract = {{The effects of topographic variables (elevation above sea level, slope
   position, topographic (wetness) index, and global solar radiation) on
   mite abundances and on quantitative composition of Oribatida communities
   in soil and litter have been studied in six sites along a hill slope in
   a tropical lowland forest in the Bu Gia Map National Park, Southern
   Vietnam. A positive relationship existed between abundance and species
   richness of Oribatida in soil cores, and global solar radiation (W h
   m(-2)) which quantifies the total sun energy available to the local
   ecosystem. There was no significant relationship between abundance of
   Mesostigmata and topographic variables. The Oribatida community
   composition in soil and in litter was significantly different, with a
   large number of species unique to either litter or soil. The canonical
   correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that the topographic variables
   together explained 75 \% (in litter) and 83 \% (in soil) of the
   variation in Oribatida community structure. The species-topography
   relationship was globally significant in the litter, weaker in the soil;
   the eigenvalue of the CCA axis 1 (related to elevation and global solar
   radiation) was significant in both substrates. CCA ordinations
   identified groups of species associated with high landscape positions
   (hill crest, high elevation, high global solar radiation) versus species
   associated with low-lying landscape positions, where moisture tends to
   accumulate (hill footslope, low elevation, low solar radiation, high
   topographic index values). The importance of relief and geographical
   position for soil Oribatida is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Articular cartilage is a tissue specifically adapted to a specific niche
   with a low oxygen tension (hypoxia), and the presence of such conditions
   is a key factor in regulating growth and survival of chondrocytes. Zinc
   deficiency has been linked to cartilage-related disease, and presence of
   Zinc is known to provide antibacterial benefits, which makes its
   inclusion attractive in an in vitro system to reduce infection.
   Inclusion of 1\% zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONP) in poly octanediol
   citrate (POC) polymer cultured in hypoxia has not been well determined.
   In this study we investigated the effects of ZnONP on chondrocyte
   proliferation and matrix synthesis cultured under normoxia (21\% O-2)
   and hypoxia (5\% O-2). We report an upregulation of chondrocyte
   proliferation and sulfated glycosaminoglycan (S-GAG) in hypoxic culture.
   Results demonstrate a synergistic effect of oxygen concentration and 1\%
   ZnONP in up-regulation of anabolic gene expression (Type II collagen and
   aggrecan), and a down regulation of catabolic (MMP-13) gene expression.
   Furthermore, production of transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor
   1A (HIF-1A) in response to hypoxic condition to regulate chondrocyte
   survival under hypoxia is not affected by the presence of 1\% ZnONP.
   Presence of 1\% ZnONP appears to act to preserve homeostasis of
   cartilage in its hypoxic environment. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

   their ductility behaviour. 3D woven reinforced concretes display
   superior ductile character showing ray of hope to develop seismic
   resistant building. Simulation of three 3D woven fabrics and their
   composites was carried to predict ductility and strengths of fabric
   reinforced concrete structures. Maximum deformation was observed for
   beam reinforced with orthogonal interlock fabric under the same load and
   minimum deformation was observed for plain concrete. Maximum equivalent
   stress was observed to be highest for plain concrete followed by beam
   reinforced with angle interlock fabric followed by orthogonal fabric and
   warp interlock fabric under similar loading conditions. From the results
   it was clear that 3D fabric reinforced structures are more ductile than
   the traditional steel reinforced structures. Hence 3D fabric reinforced
   concrete structures are much better in strength and ductility as
   compared to conventional construction materials. Among the three 3D
   fabric, orthogonal fabric reinforced composites are most ductile and are
   also less stiff. They can deform more than the other two fabric
   composites. Hence, orthogonal fabric reinforced composites can undergo
   higher deformations without collapsing. These composites can be more
   elastic under earthquake shaking. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Navigating choices when applying multiple imputation in the presence of
   multi-level categorical interaction effects}},
Journal = {{STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{82-99}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Multiple imputation (MI) is an appealing option for handling missing
   data. When implementing MI, however, users need to make important
   decisions to obtain estimates with good statistical properties. One such
   decision involves the choice of imputation model - the joint modeling
   (JM) versus fully conditional specification (FCS) approach. Another
   involves the choice of method to handle interactions. These include
   imputing the interaction term as any other variable (active imputation),
   or imputing the main effects and then deriving the interaction (passive
   imputation). Our study investigates the best approach to perform MI in
   the presence of interaction effects involving two categorical variables.
   Such effects warrant special attention as they involve multiple
   correlated parameters that are handled differently under JM and FCS
   modeling. Through an extensive simulation study, we compared active,
   passive and an improved passive approach under FCS, as JM precludes
   passive imputation. We additionally compared JM and FCS techniques using
   active imputation. Performance between active and passive imputation was
   comparable. The improved passive approach proved superior to the other
   two particularly when the number of parameters corresponding to the
   interaction was large. JM without rounding and FCS using active
   imputation were also mostly comparable, with JM outperforming FCS when
   the number of parameters was large. In a direct comparison of JM active
   and FCS improved passive, the latter was the clear winner. We recommend
   improved passive imputation under FCS along with sensitivity analyses to
   handle multi-level interaction terms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   undetectable viral load was positively associated with caregiver's
   limited physical functioning and negatively associated with caregivers
   having few family members to turn to for problem solving, a greater
   number of current drug users in their network, and poorer perceptions of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{128}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Tendrils are filamentous plant organs that coil on contact with an
   object, thereby providing mechanical support for climbing to reach more
   sunlight. Plant tendrils are considered to be modified structure of
   leaves, stems, or inflorescence, but the origin of cucurbit tendrils is
   still argued because of the complexity in the axillary organ patterning.
   We carried out morphological and genetic analyses of the Chiba
   Tendril-Less (ctl) melon (Cucumis melo) mutant, and found strong
   evidence that the melon tendril is a modified organ derived from a
   stem-leaf complex of a lateral shoot. Heterozygous (CTL/ctl) plants
   showed traits intermediate between tendril and shoot, and ontogenies of
   wild-type tendrils and mutant modified shoots coincided. We identified
   the CTL locus in a 200-kb region in melon linkage group IX. A single
   base deletion in a melon TCP transcription factor gene (CmTCP1) was
   detected in the mutant ctl sequence, and the expression of CmTCP1 was
   specifically high in wild-type tendrils. Phylogenetic analysis
   demonstrated the novelty of the CmTCP1 protein and the unique molecular
   evolution of its orthologs in the Cucurbitaceae. Our results move us
   closer to answering the long-standing question of which organ was
   modified to become the cucurbit tendril, and suggest a novel function of
   the TCP transcription factor in plant development.}},

Abstract = {{Disasters are characterized by severe disruptions in society's
   functionality and adverse impacts on humans, environment and economy.
   Decision-making in times of crisis is complex and usually accompanied by
   acute time pressure. Environment can change rapidly and decisions may

   support can systematically help to identify response and recovery
   measures, especially when time for decision-making is sparse, when
   numerous options exist, or when events are not completely anticipated.
   This paper proposes a case- and scenario-based approach to supporting
   the management of nuclear events in the early and later phases.
   Important information needed for decision-making as well as approaches
   to reusing experience from previous events are discussed. This work is
   embedded in a decision support method to be applied to nuclear
   emergencies. Suitable management options based on similar historical
   events and scenarios could possibly be identified to support disaster

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Although a large body of quantitative environmental justice research
   exists, only a handful of studies have examined the processes by which
   racial and socioeconomic disparities in the location of polluting
   industrial facilities can occur. These studies have had mixed results,
   we contend, principally because of methodological differences, that is,
   the use of the unit-hazard coincidence method as compared to
   distance-based methods. This study is the first national-level
   environmental justice study to conduct longitudinal analyses using
   distance-based methods. Our purposes are to: (1) determine whether
   disparate siting, post-siting demographic change, or a combination of
   the two created present-day disparities; (2) test related explanations;
   and (3) determine whether the application of distance-based methods
   helps resolve the inconsistent findings of previous research. We used a
   national database of commercial hazardous waste facilities sited from
   1966 to 1995 and examined the demographic composition of host
   neighborhoods around the time of siting and demographic changes that
   occurred after siting. We found strong evidence of disparate siting for
   facilities sited in all time periods. Although we found some evidence of
   post-siting demographic changes, they were mostly a continuation of
   changes that occurred in the decade or two prior to siting, suggesting
   that neighborhood transition serves to attract noxious facilities rather
   than the facilities themselves attracting people of color and low income
   populations. Our findings help resolve inconsistencies among the
   longitudinal studies and builds on the evidence from other subnational
   studies that used distance-based methods. We conclude that racial
   discrimination and sociopolitical explanations (i.e., the proposition
   that siting decisions follow the `path of least resistance') best
   explain present-day inequities.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The paper reports an experimental study of the flow structure over an
   immobile gravel bed in open channel at intermediate submergence, with
   particular focus on the near-bed region. The experiments consisted of
   velocity measurements using three-component (stereoscopic) Particle
   Image Velocimetry (PIV) in near-bed horizontal plane and two-component
   PIV in three vertical planes that covered three distinctly different
   hydraulic scenarios where the ratio of flow depth to roughness height
   (i.e., relative submergence) changes from 7.5 to 10.8. Detailed velocity
   measurements were supplemented with fine-scale bed elevation data
   obtained with a laser scanner. The data revealed longitudinal
   low-momentum and high-momentum ``strips'' in the time-averaged velocity
   field, likely induced by secondary currents. This depth-scale pattern
   was superimposed with particle-scale patches of flow heterogeneity
   induced by gravel particle protrusions. A similar picture emerged when
   considering second-order velocity moments. The interaction between the
   flow field and gravel-bed protrusions is assessed using cross
   correlations of velocity components and bed elevations in a horizontal
   plane just above gravel particle crests. The cross correlations suggest
   that upward and downward fluid motions are mainly associated with
   upstream-facing and lee sides of particles, respectively. Results also
   show that the relative submergence affects the turbulence intensity
   profiles for vertical velocity over the whole flow depth, while only a
   weak effect, limited to the near-bed region, is noticed for streamwise
   velocity component. The approximation of mean velocity profiles with a
   logarithmic formula reveals that log-profile parameters depend on
   relative submergence, highlighting inapplicability of a conventional
   ``universal'' logarithmic law for gravel-bed flows with intermediate
   submergence.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of Quality by Design (QbD) is being malized gradually, as
   it is gaining popularity aniong the generic companies. However, the
   major hurdle faced by these industries is the lack of common guidelines
   or format for performing a, risk based assessment of the manufacturing
   process. This article tries to highlight a possible sequential pathway
   for performing QbD with the help of a case study. The main fochs of this
   articles on the usage of failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) as a
   tool for risk assessment, which helps In the identification of critical
   process parameters (CPPs) and critical material attributes (CMAs) and
   later on becothes the unbiased input for the design of experitnent
   (DoE). In this case study, the DoE was helpful in establishing a risk
   based relationship between critical quality attributes (CQAs) and
   CMAs/CPPs. Finally, a control strategy was established fOr all of the
   CPPs and CMAs, which hi turn gave rise to a robust process during
   commercialization. It is noteworthy that FMEA was used twice during the
   QbD: initially to identify the CPPs and CMAs, and,subsequently after DoE
   completion to ascertain whether the risk due to CPPs and CMAs had
   decreased.}},

Title = {{Acoustic shadowing impairs accurate characterization of stenosis in
   carotid ultrasound examinations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1236-1244}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Duplex ultrasonography (DUS) has been the mainstay for
   diagnosing carotid artery stenosis and is often the sole diagnostic
   modality used prior to intervention. Highly calcified plaque, however,
   results in an acoustic shadow (AcS) that obscures the vessel lumen and
   inhibits the sonographer's ability to obtain Doppler velocity
   measurements. It is unknown whether DUS can accurately determine the
   degree of carotid stenosis in these settings.
   Methods: From July 2012 to December 2013, all patients with AcS on DUS
   measuring >= 5 mm in the longitudinal axis were cross-referenced with
   multidetector computed tomographic angiography (MD-CTA) images of the
   neck to define the study population. After standardizing the MD-CTA
   windows, percent stenosis was determined by cross-sectional area
   reduction using two separate previously described methods based on North
   American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and European
   Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) criteria. DUS waveform parameters in the
   internal carotid artery near the AcS were then compared with these
   MD-CTA measurements to determine the accuracy of DUS in characterizing
   the severity of carotid stenosis.
   Results: During this period, 8517 DUS studies were performed at the
   Massachusetts General Hospital, 550 of which had AcS, for an incidence
   of 6.45\%. There were 92 lesions with a concomitant MD-CTA; however,
   seven were excluded because of poor study quality, because >= 6 months
   had elapsed between DUS and MD-CTA, or because the patient had undergone
   carotid reconstruction between studies. Of the 85 remaining lesions, DUS
   characterized 17 as severe (peak systolic velocity {[}PSV] > 250 cm/s),
   31 as moderate (PSV=151-250 cm/s), and 37 as mild (PSV <= 150 cm/s)
   stenoses using PSV criteria. PSV weakly correlated with CTA-NASCET (r
   =0.361; P =.004) and CTA-ECST (r =0.306; P =.004) percent stenosis.
   Using PSV > 250 cm/s as the predictor of > 70\% stenosis, and a >= 70\%
   cutoff by both CTA-ECST and CTA-NASCET methods as the reference measure,
   DUS sensitivity ranged from 22.7\% to 32.5\%, specificity from 89.4\% to
   91.1\%, positive predictive value from 88.2\% to 76.4\%, and negative
   predictive value from 25\% to 60.2\%. A subgroup analysis of lesions
   identified as non-severe by DUS revealed that waveforms with lower
   deceleration were associated with severe stenosis on CTA.
   Conclusions: In the presence of AcS, DUS alone is inadequate to
   accurately determine the degree of carotid stenosis with sensitivity,
   specificity, and negative predictive values far below that needed for
   clinical decision-making. MD-CTA may be necessary for improved
   characterization of plaque in these AcS lesions. Further studies are
   needed to determine DUS parameters that may identify patients who should
   undergo further evaluation with MD-CTA to characterize the true severity
   of the stenosis.}},

Abstract = {{HFPO-Amidol (CAS \# 75888-49-2) is a new hexafluoropropylene oxide
   (HFPO)-based intermediate developed as an alternative to longer chain
   perfluorinated compounds. The repeated-dose toxicity of this material
   was evaluated in an Organization for Economic Cooperation and
   Development 422-compliant, 28-day oral exposure study with a concurrent
   reproductive/developmental toxicity screening test. Wistar rats received
   doses of 0, 30, 300, or 1000 mg/kg/d by oral gavage. Statistically
   significant changes in body weight gain of 1000 mg/kg/d females during
   the postcoitum period were possibly related to treatment but were
   considered not adverse, given the slight nature of the changes. The
   lower food consumption of 300 mg/kg/d females during the postcoitum and
   lactation period was not considered treatment related given the absence
   of a time- and dose-related trend and because food intake was generally
   similar to control levels after allowance for body weights.
   Statistically significant changes in motor activity (total movements and
   total ambulations) were noted in 1000 mg/kg/d main male and female rats.
   The changes observed in female rats were considered not treatment
   related in the absence of a dose-response trend. The higher motor
   activity of high-dose males was primarily apparent within the first 10
   minutes of the 60-minute measurement period and was suggestive of
   temporary hyperreactivity to a new environment/stimulus. This increased
   peak motor activity remained present although at an apparent lower
   magnitude when measured 13 days after withdrawal of treatment. Because
   the possible toxicological relevance of the temporarily increased motor
   activity observed in 1000 mg/kg/d males could not be excluded, these
   changes were considered possibly adverse in nature. No treatment-related
   or toxicologically relevant effects were noted on the other parental,
   reproductive, and developmental parameters investigated in this study.
   The parental systemic no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for this
   study is 300 mg/kg/d (based on increased motor activity in males), while
   the reproductive and developmental NOAEL is 1000 mg/kg/d.}},

Abstract = {{Great efforts have been made in the European Union to harmonize data
   gathering for work accident statistics, as they are basic for the
   decision making of the different agents involved in occupational risk
   prevention.
   Objective: This study aims to analyse the coding reliability and
   validity of a set of variables of work accident report forms notified to
   the Catalan labour authority.
   Methods: Cross sectional double-blind study. Study population: workers
   who had suffered a work accident with associated sick leave between
   October 1st and December 31st 2010 in Catalonia. Reliability of
   variables related to the characteristics of the worker, their workplace
   and the accident was analysed with the agreement reliability coefficient
   (Kappa index). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative
   predictive values were calculated to determine its validity.
   Results: The variables selected in relation to the characteristics of
   the worker and his/her workplace had a good to excellent reliability;
   those variables related to the accident causes had low to moderate
   reliability.
   Conclusions: There is great room for improvement in the quality of data
   of work accident report forms and the different governments involved
   should increase their efforts in this sense. These actions should be
   aimed to improve quality of preventive public policies and its
   efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep deprivation (SD) can induce muscle atrophy. We aimed to
   investigate the changes underpinning SD-induced muscle atrophy and the
   impact of this condition on rats that were previously submitted to
   resistance training (RT). Adult male Wistar EPM-1 rats were randomly
   allocated into 1 of 5 groups: control, sham, SD (for 96 h), RT, and
   RT+SD. The major outcomes of this study were muscle fiber
   cross-sectional area (CSA), anabolic and catabolic hormone profiles, and
   the abundance of select proteins involved in muscle protein synthesis
   and degradation pathways. SD resulted in muscle atrophy; however, when
   SD was combined with RT, the reduction in muscle fiber CSA was
   attenuated. The levels of IGF-1 and testosterone were reduced in SD
   animals, and the RT+SD group had higher levels of these hormones than
   the SD group. Corticosterone was increased in the SD group compared with
   the control group, and this increase was minimized in the RT+SD group.
   The increases in corticosterone concentrations paralleled changes in the
   abundance of ubiquitinated proteins and the autophagic proteins LC3 and
   p62/SQSTM1, suggesting that corticosterone may trigger these changes. SD
   induced weight loss, but this loss was minimized in the RT+SD group. We
   conclude that SD induced muscle atrophy, probably because of the
   increased corticosterone and catabolic signal. High-intensity RT
   performed before SD was beneficial in containing muscle loss induced by
   SD. It also minimized the catabolic signal and increased synthetic
   activity, thereby minimizing the body's weight loss.}},

Title = {{Large-Reynolds-number asymptotics of the streamwise normal stress in

Abstract = {{A more poetic long title could be `A voyage from the shifting grounds of
   existing data on zero-pressure-gradient (abbreviated ZPG) turbulent
   boundary layers (abbreviated TBLs) to infinite Reynolds number'. Aided
   by the requirement of consistency with the Reynolds-averaged momentum
   equation, the `shifting grounds' are sufficiently consolidated to allow
   some firm conclusions on the asymptotic expansion of the streamwise
   normal stress < uu >(+), where the + indicates normalization with the
   friction velocity u(tau) squared. A detailed analysis of direct
   numerical simulation data very close to the wall reveals that its inner
   near-wall asymptotic expansion must be of the form f(0)(y(+)) -
   f(1)(y(+))/U-infinity(+) + O(U-infinity(+))(-2), where U-infinity(+) =
   U-infinity/u(tau), y(+) = yu(tau)/v and f(0), f(1) are O(1) functions
   fitted to data in this paper. This means, in particular, that the inner
   peak of < uu >(+) does not increase indefinitely as the logarithm of the
   Reynolds number but reaches a finite limit. The outer expansion of < uu
   >(+), on the other hand, is constructed by fitting a large number of
   data from various sources. This exercise, aided by estimates of
   turbulence production and dissipation, reveals that the overlap region
   between inner and outer expansions of < uu >(+) is its plateau or second
   maximum, extending to y(break)(+) = O(U-infinity(+)), where the outer
   logarithmic decrease towards the boundary layer edge starts. The common
   part of the two expansions of < uu >(+), i.e. the height of the plateau
   or second maximum, is of the form A infinity - B-infinity/U-infinity(+)
   + . . . with A(infinity) and B infinity. constant. As a consequence, the
   logarithmic slope of the outer < uu >(+) cannot be independent of the
   Reynolds number as suggested by `attached eddy' models but must slowly
   decrease as (1/U-infinity(+)). A speculative explanation is proposed for
   the puzzling finding that the overlap region of < uu >(+) is centred
   near the lower edge of the mean velocity overlap, itself centred at y(+)
   = O(Re-delta{*}(1/2)) with Re-delta{*} the Reynolds number based on free
   stream velocity and displacement thickness. Finally, similarities and
   differences between < uu >(+) in ZPG TBLs and in pipe flow are briefly
   discussed.}},

   early decades of the twentieth century and the letters produced by
   immigrants and refugees in the early twenty-first century. The

Abstract = {{This study prepared three liposomal formulations coloaded with elacridar
   and tariquidar to overcome the P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux at the
   bloodbrain barrier. Their pharmacokinetics, brain distribution, and
   impact on the model P-glycoprotein substrate, loperamide, were compared
   to those for the coadministration of free elacridar plus free
   tariquidar. After intravenous administration in rats, elacridar and
   tariquidar in conventional liposomes were rapidly cleared from the
   bloodstream. Their low levels in the brain did not improve the
   loperamide brain distribution. Although elacridar and tariquidar in
   PEGylated liposomes exhibited 2.6 and 1.9 longer half-lives than free
   elacridar and free tariquidar, respectively, neither their K-p for the
   brain nor the loperamide brain distribution was improved. However, the
   conjugation of OX26 F(ab')(2) fragments to PEGylated liposomes increased
   the K(p)s for the brain of elacridar and tariquidar by 1.4- and
   2.1-fold, respectively, in comparison to both free P-gp modulators.
   Consequently, the K-p for the brain of loperamide increased by 2.7-fold.
   Moreover, the plasma pharmacokinetic parameters and liver distribution
   of loperamide were not modified by the PEGylated OX26 F(ab')(2)
   immunoliposomes. Thus, this formulation represents a promising tool for
   modulating the P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux at the bloodbrain barrier
   and could improve the brain uptake of any P-glycoprotein substrate that
   is intended to treat central nervous system diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Productive arbovirus infections require mechanisms to suppress or
   circumvent the cellular RNA interference (RNA pathway, a major antiviral
   response in mosquitoes. In this study, we demonstrate that two
   flaviviruses, Dengue virus and Kunjin virus, significantly repress
   siRNA-mediated RNAi in infected human cells as well as during infection
   of the mosquito vector Culex quinquefasciatus. Arthropod-borne
   flaviviruses generate a small structured non-coding RNA from the viral
   3' UTR referred to as sfRNA. Analysis of infections with a mutant Kunjin
   virus that is unable to generate appreciable amounts of the major sfRNA
   species indicated that RNAi suppression was associated with the
   generation of the non-coding sfRNA. Co-immunoprecipitation of sfRNA with
   RNAi mediators Dicer and Ago2 suggest a model for RNAi suppression.
   Collectively, these data help to establish a clear role for sfRNA in
   RNAi suppression and adds to the emerging impact of viral long
   non-coding RNAs in modulating aspects of anti-viral immune processes.

   systems, and it has come to justify a host of current actions in the
   name of sustainability. Through the examination of a new second-home
   destination currently being built in The Bahamas, I point out shifting
   trends in tourism design moving away from the anchor resort model of
   enclave mass tourism. I make the case that Anthropocene notions of
   sustainability not only rearticulate building practices and destination
   branding, but also analytic possibilities for the study of island place
   making and transnational processes. I advocate for a greater
   incorporation of design and urban anthropology into the study of
   Caribbean tourism as a means to understand these emerging events.}},

Abstract = {{The spinal cord ependymal layer (SEL) is a recent focus in spinal cord
   injury (SCI) research because of its potential to serve as a source of
   endogenous neural stem cells. Dogs are an important spontaneous model of
   SCI; however, there is a paucity of information available in the
   literature regarding the canine SEL. Here we describe the histologic
   appearance and immunohistochemical staining patterns of the SEL in
   normal dogs (n = 4) and dogs with acute SCI caused by intervertebral
   disk extrusion (n = 7). Immunohistochemical staining for PCNA, Ki-67,
   caspase 3, E-cadherin, GFAP, and vimentin was employed in both groups.
   Staining for Ki-67 was absent in the SEL of normal and SCI-affected
   dogs, indicating possible restricted proliferative capacity of the
   canine SEL acutely after SCI. GFAP-positive cells were increased after
   SCI at both at the lesion epicenter and at proximal spinal cord sites (P
   = .001 and P = .006, respectively), supporting the possibility of
   astrocytic differentiation within the SEL after SCI. Total E-cadherin
   staining did not differ between normal and SCI-affected dogs (P = .42
   for lesion epicenter, P = .09 at proximal sites) and was restricted to
   the apical cell surface in normal dogs. After SCI, E-cadherin staining
   was membrane-circumferential and cytosolic in nature, indicating
   possible loss of cellular polarity after injury that could drive cell
   migration from the SEL to injury sites. Enhanced GFAP expression and
   changes in E-cadherin expression patterns support additional studies to
   evaluate the canine SEL as a source of endogenous neural precursors that
   may be modulated for future clinical interventions after SCI.}},

Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{224-229}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{An investigation was carried out to characterize top soils collected in
   a prototypical urban area impacted by industrial and agricultural
   activities. Soils of the studied zone receive also the contribution of
   traffic from the urban area, marine aerosols from the Atlantic Ocean and
   dust from the Patagonian steppe. Top soil samples were sampled and then
   sieved in two fractions (F1 < 37 mu m, and 37 < F2 < 50 mu m) for
   subsequent digestion using an acid mixture containing HCl, HNO3 and HF
   (6:2:1). Elemental determination of Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg,
   Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Ti, V and Zn was carried out by inductively coupled
   plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) and/or inductively
   coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Accuracy tests for the entire
   analytical procedure were performed by means of the certified reference
   material NIST SRM 2711 Montana soil. Limit of detection reached varied
   from 0.08 mu g g(-1) (Cd) to 2.4 mu g g(-1) (Ba). Elemental
   concentrations ranged from 0.10 +/- 0.01 mu g g(-1) (Mo) to 14.6 +/-
   0.6\% (Ca). Aluminum, Ca, Fe, Mg and Ti (geological elements) were found
   at concentrations in the percentage order. The ratios of elemental
   concentrations Mo/Ca, Ni/Ca and Ti/Ca were identified as chemical
   markers suitable for distinguishing the different soil samples by
   exposing the relative differences in the 4-element chemical profile. The
   concentrations of metals and metalloids in size-fractionated top soils
   reported in this study will be an important tool for future studies
   aimed to characterize soil resuspension and its contribution to airborne
   particulate matter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Phylogeny of the Polybotryoid Fern Clade (Dryopteridaceae)}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{176}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{880-891}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Premise of research.The polybotryoid fern clade is completely
   Neotropical and consists of Cyclodium, Maxonia, Olfersia, Polybotrya,
   and Polystichopsis. It has never received a detailed phylogenetic
   analysis. We performed such an analysis to examine the relationships
   among species and genera and to map the evolution of their morphological
   and anatomical characters.Methodology.Our study included 46 (77\%) of
   the 60 species in the clade. It also included 37 outgroup species from
   19 genera. We sequenced four plastid DNA markers (rbcL, rps4-trnS,
   trnG-trnR, and trnL-trnF) and analyzed the data with maximum likelihood
   and Bayesian inference. One anatomical and 11 morphological characters
   were mapped on the resulting phylogenetic trees using the criterion of
   maximum parsimony.Pivotal results.The polybotryoid clade was strongly
   supported as monophyletic, as were its component genera. Nearly all its
   species have long-creeping rhizomes. Polystichopsis was resolved sister
   to the other polybotryoid genera. Its monophyly is supported by the
   morphological synapomorphies of distichous phyllotaxy, long straightish
   white hairs on the leaves, and tuberculate perines. Two species
   currently classified in Arachniodes (Arachniodes macrostegia and
   Arachniodes ochropteroides) form a clade with Olfersia. No known
   morphological characters support this clade. Olfersia, however, is
   highly distinct from all other polybotryoids by the combination of its
   imparipinnate laminae, submarginal connecting vein, strong
   sterile-fertile leaf dimorphy, loss of indusia, and evolution of
   acrostichoid sori. Maxonia is defined by its terrestrial root-climbing
   habit and dimorphic sterile and fertile leaves. Cyclodium and Polybotrya
   were resolved as sister. The presence of peltate indusia is
   synapomorphic for Cyclodium. Polybotrya is defined by several
   morphological synapomorphies: a rhizome anatomy unique among dryopteroid
   ferns (each individual meristele is surrounded by a dark
   sclerenchymatous sheath), strong sterile-fertile dimorphy, and loss of
   indusia. A possible synapomorphy for Polybotrya is the terrestrial
   root-climbing habit. Within Polybotrya, anastomosing veins and round
   discrete sori have evolved more than once.Conclusions.This is the first
   phylogenetic analysis of the polybotryoid ferns. The clade was resolved
   as monophyletic, as were its genera. An unexpected result was that two
   species currently classified in Arachniodes (A. macrostegia and A.
   ochropteroides) were resolved sister to Olfersia. Most of the main
   clades of polybotryoids were supported by morphological and/or
   anatomical characters.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use changes are expected to affect plant-disperser conditional
   mutualisms through changes in animal behavior. We analyzed the
   oak-rodent conditional mutualism in Mediterranean fragmented forests at
   two climatically different locations. We quantified fragmentation
   effects on seed dispersal effectiveness and assessed if such effects
   were due to changes in habitat structure and intraspecific competition
   for acorns in fragmented areas. Fragmentation decreased cover from
   predators within mouse territories as well as intraspecific competition
   for acorns. This resulted in lower dispersal effectiveness in small
   forest fragments. Globally, habitat structure was the main driver in
   mouse foraging decisions. In small fragments, low shelter availability
   precluded mouse movements, leading to short mobilization distances and
   low caching rates. However, as the proportion of cover from predators
   increased, mice were able to modulate their foraging decisions depending
   on intraspecific competition for acorns, resulting in higher dispersal
   quality. In addition to fragmentation effects, delayed breeding in the
   southern locality caused lower number of rodents during the dispersal
   season, which reduced acorn mobilization rates. Our study shows that
   seed dispersal patterns in managed systems can be analyzed as the result
   of management effects on key environmental factors in dispersers'
   foraging decisions.}},

Title = {{Locality-Aware Network Utilization Balancing in NoCs}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Hierarchical and multi-network networks-on-chip (NoCs) have been
   proposed in the literature to improve the energy-and
   performance-efficient scalability of the traditional flat-mesh NoC
   architecture. Theoretically, based on a small-world network-based
   analysis, traditional hierarchical NoCs are expected to provide good
   scalability. However, the traditional theoretical analysis (e.g. for
   small-worldness) does not take into account the congestion phenomenon
   experienced in such networks. Counterintuitively, as shown in this work,
   breaking the hierarchy in traditional hierarchical NoCs and utilizing
   the proposed locality-aware network utilization (NU) balancing technique
   performs better. This improvement in performance is observed through
   experimental analysis, which is contrasted with the theoretical analysis
   that does not account for congestion. In addition to the novelties for
   hierarchical networks, the application of the proposed locality-aware NU
   balancing scheme is extended to multi-network NoC topologies (with
   already separated networks). Results of the analysis show the
   superiority of applying the locality-aware NU balancing technique for a
   throughput and energy-efficient scaling of the multi-network NoC
   architectures, much like those of the hierarchical NoCs. For instance,
   for a NoC with 1024 nodes, the proposed NU balancing technique provides
   up to 95\% higher throughput efficiency and consumes up to 29\% less
   energy per flit compared to the best NoC topology without the NU
   balancing technique. The analysis also helps to render the choice of a
   NoC topology for traffic patterns varying in locality and nonlocality on
   exascale computing CMPs.}},

Title = {{Three-peak GRBs and their implications for central engines}},
Journal = {{NEW ASTRONOMY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{53-58}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{GRB 110709B presented a peculiar three-peak lightcurve; this burst twice
   triggered the BAT detector onboard Swift. The two triggers were
   separated by similar to 10 min. In order to explain such an event, we
   unify into a single description the millisecond (ms) protomagnetar and
   the collapsar central-engine models. We find that such a scenario could
   produce GRBs with three peaks. One for the ms-protomagnetar stage, a
   second one for the BH-formation event and a third one for the collapsar
   phase. We show that the three peaks for GRB 110709B originate from
   different phases of the same collapsing object. We estimate the energies
   and timescales of the different episodes of this burst using our model
   and compare with previous results as well as with a reanalysis we
   perform on the data. We show that not only the light curve, but also the
   photon index evolution and the delay between the prompt emission and the
   afterglow of the second central-engine activity phase point toward a
   model like the one proposed here. We find that, with reasonable
   assumptions, our model correctly describes the activity in GRB 110709B.
   We further suggest careful study of future GRBs lightcurves which may
   help show the validity of our model. If our model is correct, this would
   be the first time that the formation of a BH from a core-collapse event
   is observed unimpededly. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Travel medicine is a common and challenging area of clinical
   practice and practitioners need up-to-date knowledge and experience in a
   range of areas. Australian general practitioners (GPs) play a
   significant role in the delivery of travel medicine advice. We aimed to
   describe the rate and nature of travel medicine consultations, including
   both the clinical and educational aspects of the consultations.
   Methods. A cross-sectional analysis from an ongoing cohort study of GP
   trainees' clinical consultations was performed. Trainees
   contemporaneously recorded demographic, clinical, and educational
   details of consecutive patient consultations. Proportions of all
   problems/diagnoses managed in these consultations that were coded
   ``travel-related{''} and ``travel advice{''} were both calculated with
   95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Associations of a problem/diagnosis
   being ``travel-related{''} or ``travel advice{''} were tested using
   simple logistic regression within the generalized estimating equations
   (GEE) framework.
   Results. A total of 856 trainees contributed data on 169,307 problems
   from 108,759 consultations (2010-2014). Travel-related and travel advice
   problems were managed at a rate of 1.1 and 0.5 problems per 100
   encounters, respectively. Significant positive associations of
   travel-related problems were younger trainee and patient age; new
   patient to the trainee and practice; privately billing, larger, urban,
   and higher socioeconomic status practices; and involvement of the
   practice nurse. Trainees sought in-consultation information and
   generated learning goals in 34.7 and 20.8\% of travel advice problems,
   respectively, significantly more than in non-travel advice problems.
   Significant positive associations of travel advice problems were seeking
   in-consultation information, generation of learning goals, longer
   consultation duration, and more problems managed.
   Conclusions. Our findings reinforce the importance of focused training
   in travel medicine for GP trainees and adequate exposure to patients in
   the practice setting. In addition, our findings have implications more
   broadly for the delivery of travel medicine in general practice.}},

Abstract = {{Background. End-of-life discussions (EOLds) occur infrequently until
   cancer patients become terminally ill.
   Methods. To identify factors associated with the timing of EOLds, we
   conducted a nationwide survey of 864 medical oncologists. We surveyed
   the timing of EOLds held with advanced cancer patients regarding
   prognosis, hospice, site of death, and do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status;
   and we surveyed physicians' experience of EOLds, perceptions of a good
   death, and beliefs regarding these issues. Multivariate analyses
   identified determinants of early discussions.
   Results. Among 490 physicians (response rate: 57\%), 165 (34\%), 65
   (14\%), 47 (9.8\%), and 20 (4.2\%) would discuss prognosis, hospice,
   site of death, and DNR status, respectively, ``now{''} (i.e., at
   diagnosis) with a hypothetical patient with newly diagnosed metastatic
   cancer. In multivariate analyses, determinants of discussing prognosis
   ``now{''} included the physician perceiving greater importance of
   autonomy in experiencing a good death (odds ratio {[}OR]: 1.34; p =
   .014), less perceived difficulty estimating the prognosis (OR: 0.77; p =
   .012), and being a hematologist (OR: 1.68; p = .016). Determinants of
   discussing hospice ``now{''} included the physician perceiving greater
   importance of life completion in experiencing a good death (OR: 1.58; p
   = .018), less discomfort talking about death (OR: 0.67; p = .002), and
   no responsibility as treating physician at end of life (OR: 1.94; p =
   .031). Determinants of discussing site of death ``now{''} included the
   physician perceiving greater importance of life completion in
   experiencing a good death (OR: 1.83; p = .008) and less discomfort
   talking about death (OR: 0.74; p = .034). The determinant of discussing
   DNR status ``now{''} was less discomfort talking about death (OR: 0.49;
   p = .003).
   Conclusion. Reflection by oncologists on their own values regarding a
   good death, knowledge about validated prognostic measures, and learning
   skills to manage discomfort talking about death is helpful for
   oncologists to perform appropriate EOLds.}},

Abstract = {{Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the
   tooth-supporting tissues. Gingival fibroblasts are the most abundant
   cells in periodontal tissues and they participate actively in the host
   inflammatory response to periodontal pathogens that is known to mediate
   local tissue destruction in periodontitis. The Japanese apricot, known
   as Ume in Japanese, has been a traditional Japanese medicine for
   centuries and is a familiar and commonly consumed food. The health
   benefits of Ume are widely recognized and have been confirmed in recent
   studies showing that MK615, an extract of compounds from Ume, has strong
   anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the potential role of
   MK615 in oral health is unknown. We hypothesized that the
   anti-inflammatory activities of MK615 could be exploited to inhibit the
   effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produced by periodontal bacterial
   pathogens, such as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and
   Porphyromonas gingivalis. Here, we show that LPS-induced interleukin
   (IL)-6 and IL-8 production by gingival fibroblasts was dose-dependently
   inhibited by MK615. As a potent inhibitor of the inflammatory responses
   induced by periodontal pathogens, MK615 merits further testing as a
   therapeutic agent in inflammatory diseases such as periodontitis. (C)

Abstract = {{The effects of helium gas on ablation and ICP processes were
   investigated. Differences in the size, shape, and abundance of aerosol
   particles generated in argon and helium atmosphere were studied off-line
   using SEM imaging of aerosol particles impacted on polycarbonate filter
   disks. In general, ablation in helium generated fewer large particles,
   and larger, more densely-packed soft agglomerates. However,
   corresponding changes in the ion densities in the ICP, observed in
   high-resolution images obtained using LIF, were not always predictable.
   In all cases, higher He/Ar ratios led to lower ion densities in the ICP.
   This effect was attributed to increased rates of off-axis diffusion at
   higher He/Ar ratios. Differences in the ion densities produced during
   ablation in argon vs helium were highly dependent on sample type, the
   axial position of vaporization, and the He/Ar ratio. There was evidence
   that vaporization efficiencies of soft agglomerates were less affected
   than micron-sized particles by particle acceleration at higher He/Ar
   ratios. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The growth hormone/insulin-like factor I (GH/IGF-I) somatotropic axis is
   responsible for somatic growth in vertebrates, and has important
   functions in the nervous system. Among these, learning and memory
   functions related to the neural expression of ionotropic glutamate
   receptors, mainly types AMPA
   (alpha-amino-3hydroxy-5methylisoxazole-4propionic) and NMDA
   (N-methyl-D-aspartate) can be highlighted. Studies on these mechanisms
   have been almost exclusively conducted on mammal models, with little
   information available on fish. Consequently, this study aimed at
   evaluating the effects of the somatotropic axis on learning and memory
   of a GH-transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio) model (F0104 strain).
   Long-term memory (LTM) was tested in an inhibitory avoidance apparatus,
   and brain expression of igf-I and genes that code for the main subunits
   of the AMPA and NMDA receptors were evaluated. Results showed a
   significant increase in LTM for transgenic fish. Transgenic animals also
   showed a generalized pattern of increase in the expression of AMPA and
   NMDA genes, as well as a three-fold induction in igf-I expression in the
   brain. When analyzed together, these results indicate that GH, mediated
   by IGF-I, has important effects on the brain, with improvement in LTM as
   a result of increased glutamate receptors. The transgenic strain F0104
   was shown to be an interesting model for elucidating the intricate
   mechanisms related to the effect of the somatotropic axis on learning
   and memory in vertebrates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Four wild Asparagus species including Asparagus officinalis L., A.
   persicus Baker, A. verticillatus L. and A. breslerianus Schult. \&
   Schult. f. were collected from natural regions of Iran. Forty six
   morphological traits were investigated for all of these species. The
   results revealed that in edible wild Asparagus in Iran, spear appeared
   from early May (accession of Kerman-Jiroft) to late May (accession of
   Kurdestan-Bayanloo). The mature fruits (red fruits) were formed about
   July (accession of Semnan-Yazdoo) to September (other accessions). The
   number of seeds per fruit varied from one to six among species. The
   spear fresh weight was correlated with plant height (r = 0.61),
   internode length to the first branch (r = 0.59), length of primary
   branches (r = 0.72), number of secondary branches (r = 0.57), scale
   number (r = 0.74) and spear dry weight (r = 0.97). Results from the
   principal component analysis indicated that 92.30 \% of the observed
   variability was explained by the first six components. The first two
   components explained about 45.90 \% of the total observed variability.
   The first hierarchical cluster analysis mainly included accessions of
   two species A. o fficinalis and A. breslerianus and the second cluster
   mainly included A. persicus and A. verticillat us. Results of scatter
   plot supported the results of cluster analysis and species were
   distributed in two sides of scatter plot.}},

   surfactants. At solution/air and solution/oil interfaces, SDS and DoTAB
   produce ion pairs with low water affinity and relatively low oil
   solubility. SDS + DoTAB partition coefficient between hexane and water

   spots can materialize without warning in areas such as ways of knowing,

   selects for face-to-face, blended or online teaching contexts. This
   article draws examples from online courses designed and taught by the

   and argues that course lecturers and their students alike need to
   examine and critique certain background assumptions to teaching and
   learning, their pedagogical models and ways of knowing, along with the
   practical teaching and learning strategies that they select to support
   these areas. The two courses referred to are EDUC6043, Religious

Abstract = {{The forward acceptance of the LHCb detector allows it to probe
   proton-ion collisions in a unique kinematic range, complementary to the

   two muons is studied at the LHCb experiment in proton-lead collisions at
   a proton-nucleon centre-of-mass energy sNN = 5 TeV. The analysis is
   based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.6
   nb(-1). The nuclear modification factor and the forward-backward
   production ratio are determined for J/ and ?(1S) mesons. Clear
   suppression of prompt J/ production is observed with respect to the
   production in proton-proton collisions at large rapidity, while the
   suppression of J/ from b-hadron decays is less pronounced. The nuclear
   modification factor for ?(1S) mesons in the forward region is found to
   be similar to those for J/ from b-hadron decays. Furthermore, a first
   observation of Z bosons at large rapidities in proton-lead collisions is

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE The ability to perceive and regulate one's own emotions has
   been tightly linked to the processing of afferent bodily signals
   (interoception). Thus, disturbed interoception might contribute to the
   core feature of emotional dysregulation in borderline personality
   disorder (BPD), as increased levels of depersonalization, body image
   disturbances, and reduced sensitivity to physical pain suggest poor body
   awareness in BPD.
   OBJECTIVE To determine neural correlates of disturbed body awareness in
   BPD and its associations with emotional dysregulation and to explore
   improvements in body awareness with BPD symptom remission.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Case-control study performed at
   Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany. Heartbeat evoked
   potentials (HEPs), an indicator of the cortical representation of
   afferent signals from the cardiovascular system, were investigated in 34
   medication-free patients with BPD, 31 healthy volunteers, and 17
   medication-free patients with BPD in remission. The HEPs were assessed
   using 5-minute resting-state electroencephalograms and parallel
   electrocardiograms. Core BPD symptoms, history of childhood
   traumatization, and psychiatric disorders were assessed by means of
   self-reports and structured interviews. To measure neural correlates of
   disturbed body awareness, high-resolution T1-weighted structural
   magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected and analyzed using
   voxel-based morphometry and region-of-interest-based approaches. The
   study was performed between 2012 and 2014, and data analysis was
   performed in 2014.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mean HEP amplitudes in resting-state
   electroencephalograms and their correlation with self-reported emotional
   dysregulation, as well as with gray matter volume.
   RESULTS Patients with BPD had significantly reduced mean HEP amplitudes
   compared with healthy volunteers (F-1,F-61 = 11.32, P = .001), whereas
   the mean HEP amplitudes of patients with BDP in remission lie somewhere
   in between these 2 groups of participants (P > .05). The HEP amplitudes
   were negatively correlated with emotional dysregulation (R = -0.30, P =
   .01) and positively associated with gray matter volume in the left
   anterior insula (R = 0.53, P < .05) and the bilateral dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex (R = 0.47, P < .05), 2 structures that have been
   identified as core regions for interoception.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results indicate state-dependent deficits
   in the cortical processing of bodily signals in patients with BPD, which
   appear to be associated with core features of BPD. The analysis of
   patients with BPD in remission suggests an improvement in cortical
   representation of bodily signals with symptom remission. Results
   recommend the integration of techniques to strengthen bodily awareness
   in psychotherapeutic interventions of BPD.}},

Abstract = {{How do we process stimuli that stem from the external world and stimuli
   that are self-generated? In the case of voice perception it has been
   shown that evoked activity elicited by self-generated sounds is
   suppressed compared with the same sounds played-back externally. We here
   wanted to reveal whether neural excitability of the auditory
   cortex-putatively reflected in local alpha band power-is modulated
   already prior to speech onset, and which brain regions may mediate such
   a top-down preparatory response. In the left auditory cortex we show
   that the typical alpha suppression found when participants prepare to
   listen disappears when participants expect a self-spoken sound. This
   suggests an inhibitory adjustment of auditory cortical activity already
   before sound onset. As a second main finding we demonstrate that the
   medial prefrontal cortex, a region known for self-referential processes,
   mediates these condition-specific alpha power modulations. This provides
   crucial insights into how higher-order regions prepare the auditory
   cortex for the processing of self-generated sounds. Furthermore, the
   mechanism outlined could provide further explanations to

Abstract = {{Mapping wetlands across both natural and human-altered landscapes is
   important for the management of these ecosystems. Though they are
   considered important landscape elements providing both ecological and
   socioeconomic benefits, accurate wetland inventories do not exist in
   many areas. In this study, a multi-scale geographic object-based image
   analysis (GEOBIA) approach was employed to segment three high spatial
   resolution images acquired over landscapes of varying heterogeneity due
   to human-disturbance to determine the robustness of this method to
   changing scene variability. Multispectral layers, a digital elevation
   layer, normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) layer, and a
   first-order texture layer were used to segment images across three
   segmentation scales with a focus on accurate delineation of wetland
   boundaries and wetland components. Each ancillary input layer
   contributed to improving segmentation at different scales. Wetlands were
   classified using a nearest neighbor approach across a relatively
   undisturbed park site and an agricultural site using GeoEye1 imagery,
   and an urban site using WorldView2 data. Successful wetland
   classification was achieved across all study sites with an accuracy
   above 80\%, though results suggest that overall a higher degree of
   landscape heterogeneity may negatively affect both segmentation and
   classification. The agricultural site suffered from the greatest amount
   of over and under segmentation, and lowest map accuracy (kappa: 0.78)
   which was partially attributed to confusion among a greater proportion
   of mixed vegetated classes from both wetlands and uplands. Accuracy of
   individual wetland classes based on the Canadian Wetland Classification
   system varied between each site, with kappa values ranging from 0.64 for
   the swamp class and 0.89 for the marsh class. This research developed a
   unique approach to mapping wetlands of various degrees of disturbance
   using GEOBIA, which can be applied to study other wetlands of similar
   settings. (C) 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote

Abstract = {{The upgrading of pyrolysis bio-oil is an important process for obtaining
   stable, high-quality bio-oil. Rapid and uniform heating of both the
   biomass and the catalyst bed plays an important role in the product
   quality and in the overall process efficiency. Induction heating offers
   numerous advantages over conventional heating methods: rapid, efficient
   heating and precise temperature control. In this study, an advanced
   induction heating technology was tested for pyrolysis as well as
   catalyst bed heating. Three different catalyst-to-biomass ratios were
   studied (1:1, 1.5:1, and 2:1 weight basis), and the effect of catalyst
   bed temperature (290, 330, and 370 degrees C) was also investigated. The
   results were compared with conventionally heated catalyst bed reactor.
   Higher-quality bio-oil was obtained with induction heating reactor with
   increased yield of aromatic hydrocarbons and reduced oxygen content
   compared to conventional heating. Inductively heated catalyst was also
   observed to have lower carbon deposition after reaction, compared to
   conventionally heated catalyst. Higher Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)
   surface area was available post-reaction for inductively heated
   catalysts. This observation could be attributed to higher thermal
   gradients in conventional reactors, which causes the condensation of
   molecules on the catalyst surface with cooler temperatures; these
   effects are less pronounced for the inductively heated catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{For ac negative bias temperature instability (NBTI), the composite model
   that combines the reaction-diffusion (R-D) model for permanent component
   and the trap-detrap (T-D) model for recoverable component has almost
   been accepted. However, simple analytical formulas, which are useful for
   product qualification, have not yet been established. In this paper, we
   present a coarse-graining approach to analyze the rate equations in the
   T-D and R-D schemes. Here, the time-averaged rate equations are derived
   from the equations for stress and recovery phases. The analytical
   solutions obtained by solving this set of equations can explain the
   essential features of ac-NBTI, such as the duty-cycle dependence and the
   memory effect of hole-trapping determined by the standby condition. For
   the T-D scheme, the exact analytical solutions of the original equations
   verify this approach, whereas for the R-D scheme, the double-interface
   R-D model rather than the conventional R-D model captures the duty-cycle
   dependence observed in the experimental universal curve. Our
   experimental data on the ac-NBTI are also consistent with the developed
   analytical model providing a general validity of the approach presented
   here.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In patients with Parkinson's disease, executive deficits are
   known to correlate with motor dysfunctions, such as gait and postural
   instability. However executive deficits are sometimes difficult to
   detect using common frontal assessment batteries. Behavioral Assessment
   of Dysexecutive Syndrome includes six subtests to evaluate different
   aspects of executive function required in daily life. Among these the
   Modified Six Elements Test examines higher levels of executive function
   with regard to prospective memory and organization of behavior.
   Aim: Using Behavioral Assessment of Dysexecutive Syndrome we examined
   which types of executive dysfunction correlate with motor symptoms in
   Parkinson's disease without apparent dementia.
   Methods: A total of 54 Parkinson's disease patients with Mini-Mental
   State Examination scores over 24 were assessed with the Unified
   Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (total score of parts II and III as
   general motor function, subscores of tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia,
   gait disturbance and postural instability) for motor assessment, and
   both the Behavioral Assessment of Dysexecutive Syndrome (total raw score
   of all subtests and subscores of each of the 6 subtests) and Frontal
   Assessment Battery for executive function. Correlation coefficients for
   executive and motor assessments were compared.
   Results: Among the Behavioral Assessment of Dysexecutive Syndrome
   subtests, the Modified Six Elements Test showed the strongest
   correlation with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale subscore
   of gait disturbance, but did not correlate with patient background
   factors, such as age.
   Conclusion: Even in Parkinson's disease without apparent dementia,
   deficits in complex executive functions, such as prospective memory and
   organization of behavior, correlate with motor dysfunctions, especially
   gait. We believe the Modified Six Elements Test is useful to evaluate
   early executive deficits.}},

Abstract = {{The management of chronic extensor mechanism disruption can be complex.
   One of the options is allograft reconstruction. The goal of this study
   was to present the surgical procedure and provide preliminary results
   with this technique. The allograft uses the whole extensor mechanism
   (anterior tibial tubercle, patellar ligament, patella, quadriceps
   tendon). The native patella can be completely removed if the quality of
   the bone is poor, otherwise a bone groovecan be created to receive the
   allograft. The allograft is tightly tensioned with the knee in full
   extension. This surgical technique was performed 5 times with a minimum
   follow-up of 1 year. Active extension was recovered in all cases. The
   mean postoperative KOOS was 55.5 the IKS function score was 68.5 and the
   IKS knee score was 83. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{Refugia play a critical role in preserving species unable to move or
   adapt to cope with environmental change. The role of refugia as museums
   of diversity' means these environments have a high conservation
   priority. Less well known, however, is the role that isolated and
   fragmented refugia can play in the generation of new diversity. Here, we
   examined the diversification and evolutionary history of a community of
   endemic invertebrates that inhabit Australian desert spring refugia. We
   compared the phylogenies of seven endemic groups (Haloniscus and
   Phreatomerus isopods, chiltoniid amphipods, Ngarawa ostracods,
   Trochidrobia and Fonscochlea snails and Gymnochthebius beetles) from
   these springs and examine the rates and timing of diversification and
   reconstructed the phylogeographic history of each taxon. Despite major
   life-history differences among these taxa, they demonstrate remarkable
   similarities in their evolutionary histories. All groups have multiple
   lineages that extend back to a time before the formation of present-day
   deserts, and significant geographic-based diversification since adapting
   to a refugial habitat. The results provide further evidence that refugia
   act as museums of biodiversity, preserving lineages that would have
   otherwise gone extinct. However, we also observed that isolation in
   refugia corresponds with significant diversification, leading to a
   recently evolved, novel endemic fauna, supporting the idea that
   fragmented refugia provide ideal conditions for the generation of future
   biodiversity hotspots.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary wastewater discharged by the Kaduna refining and petrochemical
   company in Kaduna (Nigeria) was characterized and treated in six
   vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands (VSF CW) under field
   conditions. The secondary refinery wastewater had high levels of BOD
   (106 +/- 58.9 mg/L), COD (232 +/- 121.2 mg/L), TSS (86.1 +/- 99.7 mg/L),
   TDS (278.8 +/- 112.7 mg/L) and a turbidity of 56.8 +/- 59.2 NTU. Cyperus
   alternifolius and Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. were planted in four VSF
   CWs and the last two VSF CWs served as the unplanted control. Good
   reduction efficiencies in the concentration of the contaminants were
   achieved which corresponds to removal rates of 54\%, 85\%, 68\%, 65\%,
   68\%, 58\% and 43\% for TDS, turbidity, BOD, COD, ammonium-N, nitrate-N
   and phosphate-P respectively, for the C. alternifolius planted vertical
   flow constructed wetland and 50\%, 82\%, 70\%, 63\%, 49\%, 54\% and 42\%
   for the C. dactylon planted wetland system. Hence, C. alternifolius and
   C. dactylon planted VSF CWs were shown capable of treating secondary
   refinery effluent to discharge permit limits. For most of the parameters
   considered, the performance of the C. alternifolius and C. dactylon
   planted vertical flow constructed wetland systems was not significantly
   different from each other, however, they performed significantly better
   than the unplanted control. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An Assessment of Participatory Integrated Vector Management for Malaria
   Control in Kenya}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1145-1151}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends integrated
   vector management (IVM) as a strategy to improve and sustain malaria
   vector control. However, this approach has not been widely adopted.
   OBJECTIVES: We comprehensively assessed experiences and findings on IVM
   in Kenya with a view to sharing lessons that might promote its wider
   application.
   METHODS: The assessment used information from a qualitative external
   evaluation of two malaria IVM projects implemented between 2006 and 2011
   and an analysis of their accumulated entomological and malaria case
   data. The project sites were Malindi and Nyabondo, located in coastal
   and western Kenya, respectively. The assessment focused on
   implementation of five key elements of IVM: integration of vector
   control methods, evidence-based decision making, intersectoral
   collaboration, advocacy and social mobilization, and capacity building.
   RESULTS: IVM was more successfully implemented in Malindi than in
   Nyabondo owing to greater community participation and multistakeholder
   engagement. There was a significant decline in the proportion of malaria
   cases among children admitted to Malindi Hospital, from 23.7\% in 2006
   to 10.47\% in 2011 (p < 0.001). However, the projects' operational
   research methodology did not allow statistical attribution of the
   decline in malaria and malaria vectors to specific IVM interventions or
   other factors.
   CONCLUSIONS: Sustaining IVM is likely to require strong participation
   and support from multiple actors, including community-based groups,
   non-governmental organizations, international and national research
   institutes, and various government ministries. A cluster-randomized
   controlled trial would be essential to quantify the effectiveness and
   impact of specific IVM interventions, alone or in combination.}},

Abstract = {{An exceptional probe comprising indole-3-carboxaldehyde fluorescein
   hydrazone (FI) performs multiple tasks, namely, disaggregating amyloid
   beta (A beta) aggregates in different biomarker environments such as
   cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), A beta 1-40 fibrils, beta-amyloid lysozyrne
   aggregates (LA), and U87 MG human astrocyte cells. Additionally, the
   probe FT binds with Cu2+ ions selectively, disrupts the A beta
   aggregates that vary from few nanometers to micrometers, and prevents
   their reaggregation, thereby performing disaggregation and modulation of
   amyloid-beta in the presence as well as absence of Cu2+ ion. The
   excellent selectivity of probe FT for Cu2+ was effectively utilized to
   modulate the assembly of metal-induced A beta aggregates by metal
   chelation with the ``turn-on{''} fluorescence via spirolactam ring
   opening of FT as well as the metal-free A beta fibrils by noncovalent
   interactions. These results confirm that FT has exceptional ability to
   perform multifaceted tasks such as metal chelation in intracellular
   conditions using A beta lysozyme aggregates in cellular environments by
   the disruption of beta-sheet rich A beta fibrils into disaggregated
   forms. Subsequently, it was confirmed that FT had the ability to cross
   the blood-brain barrier and it also modulated the metal induced A beta
   fibrils in cellular environments by ``turn-on{''} fluorescence, which
   are the most vital properties of a probe or a therapeutic agent.
   Furthermore, the morphology changes were examined by atomic force
   microscopy (AFM), polarizable optical microscopy (POM), fluorescence
   microscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies. These results
   provide very valuable clues on the A beta (CSF A beta fibrils, A beta
   1-40 fibrils, beta-amyloid lysozyme aggregates) disaggregation behavior
   via in vitro studies, which constitute the first insights into
   intracellular disaggregation of A beta by ``turn-on{''} method thereby
   influencing amyloidogenesis.}},

   Bioplastic and Perennial Grass}},
Journal = {{ACS Sustainable Chemistry \& Engineering}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Biocomposites from poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) and perennial grass
   (miscanthus fibers) were successfully prepared by extrusion and
   injection molding methods with different fiber loadings. The tensile
   strength of uncompatibilized PBS/miscanthus composites was much lower
   compared to that of neat PBS. Unlike tensile strength, the flexural and
   impact strengths were significantly enhanced after incorporation of
   miscanthus fibers into the PBS matrix. The enhanced flexural strength
   was attributed to the reinforcing effect of miscathus fibers. The fiber
   pull-out mechanism is likely responsible for the observed impact
   strength improvement. Addition of 5 wt \% maleic anhydride (MAR) grafted
   PBS (MAH-g-PBS) into PBS composites showed a significant improvement in
   tensile and flexural strength compared to the corresponding
   uncompatibilized composites and neat matrix. For example, the PBS
   composites with 50 wt \% miscanthus fiber and S wt \% MAH-g-PBS resulted
   in 22, 139, and 47\% improvements in tensile, flexural, and impact
   strength compared to neat PBS. These improvements were attributed to the
   enhanced interfacial interaction between the components, as confirmed by
   adhesion parameter values and by surface morphological analysis. The
   load-bearing capacity of the compatibilized and uncompatibilized
   PBS/miscanthus composites was analyzed using a mathematical model.
   Overall, this study provides an option for preparing a sustainable
   biocomposite with superior mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) have low
   physical activity levels and are at high risk for psychosocial
   morbidities, including depression, heightened anxiety and low
   health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
   Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the associations of
   physical activity level with depression, anxiety, and HRQoL in children
   with T1DM.
   Subjects and methods: A cross-sectional study design, including children
   with T1DM aged between 8 and 12 years and healthy controls, was used.
   Physical activity (PA) level was assessed with the Physical Activity
   Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C). Anxiety was screened by The
   Screen for Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) questionnaire.
   Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Children's Depression
   Inventory (CDI). Quality of life was assessed with the The Pediatric
   Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL 4.0).
   Results: Forty-seven T1DM and 55 healthy children were included with
   mean ages of 9.87 +/- 1.63 and 9.56 +/- 1.60 years, respectively. The
   T1DM group had significantly higher depression and anxiety score (p <
   0.05) and lower HRQoL-child self-report score (p < 0.05, for all)
   compared with the control group. Significant associations were found
   between PAQ-C and PedsQL 4.0 (p < 0.05), between SCARED and PedsQL 4.0
   (p < 0.05), and between HbA1c and PedsQL 4.0 (p < 0.05) in children with
   T1DM.
   Conclusions: The result of our study suggested that only HRQoL was
   related to physical activity, anxiety and HbA1c in children with T1DM.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of volatiles in silicate-COH melts and fluids and hydrogen
   isotope fractionation between melt and fluid were determined
   experimentally to advance our understanding of the role of volatiles in
   magmatic processes. Experiments were conducted in situ while the samples
   were at the desired temperature and pressure to 825 degrees C and
   similar to 1.6 GPa and with variable redox conditions. Under oxidizing
   conditions, melt and fluid comprised CO2, CO3, HCO3, OH, H2O, and
   silicate components, whereas under reducing conditions, the species were
   CH4, H-2, H2O, and silicate components. Temperature-dependent hydrogen
   isotope exchange among structural entities within coexisting fluids and
   melts yields Delta H values near 14 and 24 kJ/mol and -5 and -1 kJ/mol
   under oxidizing and reducing conditions, respectively. This temperature
   (and probably pressure)-dependent D/H fractionation is because of
   interaction between D and H and silicate and C-bearing species in
   silicate-saturated fluids and in COH fluid-saturated melts. The
   temperature-and pressure-dependent D/H fractionation factors suggest
   that partial melts in the presence of COH volatiles in the upper mantle
   can have delta D values 100\% or more lighter relative to coexisting
   silicate-saturated fluid. This effect is greater under oxidizing than
   under reducing conditions. It is suggested that delta D variations of
   upper mantle mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) sources, inferred from the
   delta D of MORB magmatic rocks, can be explained by variations in redox
   conditions during melting. Lower delta D values of the MORB magma
   reflect more reducing conditions in the mantle source.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated catanionic mixtures of the anionic surfactant
   sodium oleate with various alkyltrimethyl ammonium bromides of different
   alkyl chain length between octyl and tetradecyl. Around equimolar mixing
   vesicles are formed but only for a chain length of decyl and longer. For
   shorter chains and with increasing asymmetry of the mixing ratio, the
   vesicle phase disappears and instead wormlike micelles are formed, which
   leads to a viscoelastic behaviour of the samples. The vesicle systems
   are often also viscoelastic, if they contain densely packed
   multi-lamellar vesicles but this depends also on their salt content, as
   for instance the salt-free decyl system forms unilamellar vesicles of
   low viscosity. It is observed that the most well-defined vesicles
   (unilamellar) occur upon admixing the intermediate cationic surfactant
   with the dodecyl chain, which then results in low viscous solutions. In
   general, by appropriately choosing the mixing ratio, the length of the
   alkyl chain and also the ionic strength of the solution can tune the
   structure and the properties of these catanionic surfactant mixtures
   over a wide range in a systematic fashion.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper illustrates the potential of the adjoint method for a

   an efficient way to incorporate inverse dynamics to engineering

   sticking probabilities of Cu, Zn, and Sn are almost the same. On the
   other hand, the sticking probability of S atom was found to be as low as
   0.7 +/- 0.1, if we assume unity for the sticking probabilities of Cu,

   investigated in terms of formation energy. The adsorption properties of
   chlorine on In2O3 are studied and the most appropriate adsorption sites
   of Cl-2 on In2O3 nanostructures are reported. The adsorption properties
   of hydrogen on In2O3 nanostructures are also investigated and inferred
   that In2O3 exhibits good sensing characteristics towards hydrogen. The
   adsorbed energy, HOMO-LUMO gap, Mulliken population analysis, and
   average energy gap variation are used to identify the prominent

   left globe (1.5 mm) due to fibrous dysplasia. Reconstruction was
   performed with computed tomography-derived and 3D printed custom
   polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implantation. PEEK is a nonabsorbable,
   nonporous thermoplastic polymer notable for its ability to be modified
   intraoperatively and ideal imaging properties postoperatively. Never, to

Abstract = {{Background. The global landscape of higher education has repositioned
   itself, moving away from insular institutions towards open responsive
   systems of teaching and learning with an emphasis on cultivating a new
   mode of knowledge production. The South African higher education system
   has responded to these global changes by recognising the contribution of
   research productivity as a commodity within the overall worldwide
   knowledge economy. These changes have contributed towards an increased
   intake of candidates in many university faculties, including nursing, to
   meet the demand of producing highly skilled graduates.
   Objectives. To explore and describe the current practices and
   experiences of nurse academics regarding postgraduate research
   supervision.
   Methods. A descriptive exploratory design with in-depth interviews was
   used, and a self-reported questionnaire eliciting information on
   research supervision practices.
   Results. Three emergent themes were identified from the results of this
   study: a lack of standardised guidelines for nurse academics to
   effectively supervise postgraduate research; the pressure that nurse
   academics experience regarding postgraduate research supervision; other
   demanding roles of an academic, such as a high teaching and clinical
   workload.
   Conclusion. The study demonstrated gaps in research supervision, shared
   frustrations such as feelings of isolation, and a lack of support
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{The homoeopathic medicines are ``extremely diluted solutions{''} showing
   anomalous behaviour and are obtained through the combination of two
   processes: a dilution of 1:100 in mass followed by succussion. The
   densities, rho, ultrasonic speeds, u and viscosities, eta and refractive
   indices, n(D), of pure ethanol, 15 samples of succussed ethanol
   controls, 15 formulations of sulphur in unsuccussed ethanol and 15
   formulations of sulphur in succussed ethanol have been measured for
   potencies from 2 C to 30 C (with an interval of 2 C) at 298.15, 308.15
   and 318.15 K and atmospheric pressure. From these experimental data, the
   isentropic compressibilities, kappa(s), intermolecular free length, L,
   acoustic impedance, Z, relative association, RA, excess isentropic
   compressibility, kappa(E)(s) excess intermolecular free length, L-f(E),
   excess acoustic impedance, Z(E), excess viscosity, eta(E) and excess
   refractive index, n(D)(E) have been calculated. The results have been
   qualitatively discussed in terms of interactions/physicochemical
   behaviour of sulphur in these solutions. The results indicate that even
   in extreme dilutions the molecules of sulphur may be present in these
   homoeopathic formulations. Both the presence of sulphur as well as
   succussion phenomenon is responsible for the variation of the
   physicochemical properties of these homoeopathic formulations. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Introduction: Ureteroscopic stone extraction devices are effective tools
   in the management of urolithiasis, but on occasion, their improper use
   can cause injury to the ureter. Avulsion and perforation of the ureter
   as a result of excessive forces on the extraction device are some of the
   more serious complications of this treatment.
   Materials and Methods: In this article, avulsion and perforation forces
   were measured by two different test setups. Eleven clinicians were asked
   to apply three ranges of forces (safe, cautious, and dangerous).
   Results: The output force measurements were recorded and plotted for
   further analysis. The maximal average perforation forces were 7.132.36N
   in the benchtop tests and 7.07 +/- 2.20N in the ex-vivo porcine tests
   (P=0.54). The maximal average avulsion forces were measured to be 10.14
   +/- 2.01N in the benchtop tests. Although the average forces were
   similar in the proximal and distal parts of the ureter (P=0.27), higher
   values were recorded for the distal part. The operative time was noted
   to be significantly different in the safe and cautious force regions
   (P=0.006). The average forces were higher in the benchtop tests compared
   with the porcine ureter tests. The extraction forces were measured and
   were noted to be significantly different for attending physicians and
   residents. The results suggest the need for force feedback training for
   residents.
   Conclusion: The findings can be used to design a smart device that can
   provide visual force feedback to clinicians while they are operating,
   leading to improved patient outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to clarify the diagnostic
   significance of the presence of intranuclear inclusions in clear cell
   carcinoma (CCC).
   Materials and Methods: We analyzed 98 imprint specimens and 53 ascites
   specimens from 98 ovarian carcinoma cases {[}28 CCCs, 37 serous
   carcinomas (SCs), 22 endometrioid carcinomas (ECs), and 11 mucinous
   carcinomas (MCs)]. We examined (1) frequency of intranuclear
   inclusion-positive cases of each ovarian carcinoma subtype, using
   imprint specimens, (2) frequency of intranuclear inclusion-positive
   cells of each ovarian carcinoma subtype, using imprint specimens, (3)
   frequency of intranuclear inclusion-positive cases of each ovarian
   carcinoma subtype, using ascites specimens, and (4) sensitivity and
   specificity of the presence of intranuclear inclusions for the
   cytological diagnosis of CCC.
   Results: (1) The frequency of intranuclear inclusion-positive cases in
   CCC (96.4\%) was significantly higher than in SC (13.5\%), EC (13.6\%),
   and MC (18.2\%) (P < 0.001). Two or more intranuclear inclusions in a
   single nucleus were observed only in CCC. (2) The frequency of
   intranuclear inclusionpositive cells in CCC (median, 0.41\%) was
   significantly higher than in non-CCC subtypes (0.010\%) (P < 0.001). (3)
   Using ascites specimens, the frequency of intranuclear
   inclusion-positive cases in CCC (78.6\%) was significantly higher than
   in SC (10.3\%), EC (0\%), and MC (0\%) (P < 0.001). (4) The sensitivity
   of intranuclear inclusions was 96.4\%, and the specificity was 85.7\%.
   Conclusions: The identification of intranuclear inclusions, in
   particular a high frequency and multiple intranuclear inclusions in a
   single nucleus, is useful for the cytological diagnosis of CCC.
   Furthermore, these results may be applicable to ascites cytology. (C)

Abstract = {{Introduction Hospital readmission rates are an important measure of
   quality care and have recently been tied to reimbursement. This study
   seeks to identify the risk factors for postoperative readmission in
   patients treated by a gynecologic oncology service.
   Methods A 7-year retrospective review (2007-2013) of all patients
   operated on by the University of Virginia gynecologic oncology service
   who were readmitted within 30 days of discharge was performed.
   Abstracted data included demographics, dates of surgery, operative
   details, cancer history, and relevant medical history. The readmitted
   patients (n = 166) were compared with randomly selected controls (n =
   168) from the same service in a matching time frame and analyzed using
   univariate and multivariate models.
   Results In the study period, 2993 operations were performed. One hundred
   sixty-six unique patients (5.5\%) were readmitted within 30 days of
   discharge from their operative procedure. On multivariate analysis, the
   factors that were associated with a higher risk of readmission were a
   history of psychiatric disease, postoperative complication, type of
   insurance, surgical modality, and lysis of adhesions at the time of
   surgery. The most common readmission diagnoses were infection (44\%),
   nausea/vomiting (28\%), thrombosis (6\%), bowel leak (4\%), and bleeding
   (4\%).
   Conclusions Postoperative readmissions are a common problem and are
   increasingly important as a measure of quality. Although patients were
   generally admitted for infections or gastrointestinal complaints, we
   also found that individual factors such as mental health and
   socioeconomic status also contributed. Our data suggest that we can
   preoperatively identify high-risk individuals for whom extra resources
   can be directed postoperatively to avoid unnecessary readmissions.}},

Abstract = {{A novel microfluidic device which consists of two stages for particle
   focusing and separation using a viscoelastic fluid has been developed. A
   circular capillary tube was used for three-dimensional particle
   pre-alignment before the separation process, which was inserted in a
   polydimethylsiloxane microchannel. Particles with diameters of 5 and 10
   mu m were focused at the centerline in the capillary tube, and the
   location of particles was initialized at the first bifurcation. Then, 5
   and 10 mu m particles were successfully separated in the expansion
   region based on size-dependent lateral migration, with similar to 99\%
   separation efficiency. The proposed device was further applied to
   separation of MCF-7 cells from leukocytes. Based on the cell size
   distribution, an approximate size cutoff for separation was determined
   to be 16 mu m. At 200 mu l/min, 94\% of MCF-7 cells were separated with
   the purity of similar to 97\%. According to the trypan blue exclusion
   assay, high viability (similar to 90\%) could be achieved for the
   separated MCF-7 cells. The use of a commercially available capillary
   tube enables the device to be highly versatile in dealing with particles
   in a wide size range by using capillary tubes with different inner
   diameters. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-loop PID control system is widely used in process industry where
   finding good values for the controller parameters is very challenging
   without systematic procedures. In this paper, based on the multi-scale
   control scheme a simultaneous multi-loop tuning method for an arbitrary
   n x n MIMO processes is proposed. The salient feature of the method is
   that it reduces the multi-loop PID tuning parameters from 4n to only 4
   common multi-scale control parameters. Both heuristic- and
   optimization-based procedures are proposed in order to apply the
   simultaneous tuning method, which should substantially simplify
   difficult multi-loop tuning involving numerous controller parameters. To
   ensure adequate robustness of the multi-loop control system, the
   balanced sensitivity function is used with the tuning method. Numerical
   studies based on 2 x 2,3 x 3,4 x 4 and 5 x 5 MIMO processes demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the tuning method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Objectives: To assess metabolic abnormalities in patients with
   percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) that could pose a risk for stone
   recurrence.
   Materials and methods: The data was collected retrospectively on all
   patients who had PCNL and metabolic studies, between January 2000 and
   September 2012.
   Results: There were 144 patients; median age and follow up were 49.5
   (15-4) years and 80.2 (16-180) months, respectively. Nearly half of the
   patients had staghorn calculus. Metabolic abnormalities (MAs) were found
   in 55 (38.2\%). The 31 (21.5\%) of these had multiple metabolic
   abnormalities (MMA) while 24 (16.6\%) had a single metabolic abnormality
   (SMA). Uricosuria was found in 24 (16.6\%), hyperoxaluria in 22
   (15.3\%), hyperphosphaturia in 18 (12.5\%), hypercalciuria in 10 (7\%),
   hypomagnesuria in 6 (4.2\%), cystinuria in 5 (3.5\%) and hypocitraturia
   in 5 (3.5\%). Hyperuricaemia was present in 10 (7\%), hypercalcaemia in
   5 (3.5\%), hyperphosphataemia in 7 (5\%) and renal tubular acidosis in 1
   (0.7\%). In nonstaghorn, MAs were found in 25 (35.2\%) and 16 (64\%) of
   these had MMA. In patients with staghorn, MAs were present in 30 (41\%)
   patients. Half of the patients 15 (50\%) in this group had MMA. A high
   proportion of the first time stone formers requiring surgical treatment
   had MAs and 57\% of these had MMA. Stone analysis was available for 69
   (48\%) and 37 (53.6\%) of these had mixed composition. The highest
   proportion of patients with uric acid stones had MA 89\% followed by
   cystine stones 80\%, matrix stones 50\%, calcium oxalate 36.6\%,
   carbonate apatite 36.4\% and triple phosphate 33.3\%.
   Conclusion: A high proportion of first time stone formers, staghorn and
   non-staghorn stone formers with PCNL had MA. These findings suggest that
   the treatment of metabolic abnormalities can play an important role in
   reducing the risk of stone recurrences and management may include
   referral to dedicated metabolic stone clinics.}},

Abstract = {{Chlamydia trachomatis is obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen that
   remains a significant public health burden worldwide. A critical early
   event during infection is chlamydial entry into non-phagocytic host
   epithelial cells. Like other Gram-negative bacteria, C. trachomatis uses
   a type III secretion system (T3SS) to deliver virulence effector
   proteins into host cells. These effectors trigger bacterial uptake and
   promote bacterial survival and replication within the host cell. In this
   review, we highlight recent cryo-electron tomography that has provided
   striking insights into the initial interactions between Chlamydia and
   its host. We describe the polarised structure of extracellular C.
   trachomatis elementary bodies (EBs), and the supramolecular organisation
   of T3SS complexes on the EB surface, in addition to the changes in host
   and pathogen architecture that accompany bacterial internalisation and
   EB encapsulation into early intracellular vacuoles. Finally, we consider
   the implications for further understanding the mechanism of C.
   trachomatis entry and how this might relate to those of other bacteria
   and viruses. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on

   comprised children aged 6-12 years with simple femur shaft fractures.
   The patients were randomised into two equal groups. Group A patients
   were treated with titanium elastic nail and group B patients with Thomas
   splint traction. Patients were mobilised without weight-bearing on the
   5th to 7th postoperative day. In group B, traction was maintained for
   about 8 to 10 weeks. After splint removal, patients were referred to
   physical therapy. Patients were available for one-year follow-up.
   Results: There were 30 patients; 15(50\%) in each of the two groups.
   Those group A had full weight-bearing at 4-6 weeks and early return to
   routine activities compared to group B patients who took 8-12 weeks. The

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the reliability, validity and correlates of
   measures of food insecurity (FI) obtained using an individually focused
   food insecurity access scale (IFIAS) among pregnant women of mixed HIV
   status in northern Uganda.
   Design: A mixed-methods study involving cognitive interviews nested
   within a cross-sectional survey.
   Setting: The antenatal care clinic of Gulu Regional Referral Hospital.
   Subjects: Survey respondents included 403 pregnant women, recruited in a
   ratio of one HIV-infected to two HIV-uninfected respondents, twenty-six
   (nine of them HIV-infected) of whom were asked to participate in the
   cognitive interviews.
   Results: Over 80 \% of cognitive interview participants reported
   understanding the respective meanings of six of the nine items (i.e.
   items 4 to 9) on the IFIAS. Two main factors emerged from rotated
   exploratory factor analysis of the IFIAS: mild to moderate FI (IFIAS
   items 1-6) and severe FI (items 7-9). Together, they explained 90.4 \%
   of the FI measure's variance. The full IFIAS and the two subscales had
   moderate to high internal consistency (Cronbach's a ranged from 0.75 to
   0.87). Dose-response associations between IFIAS scores, and measures of
   socioeconomic status and women's diet quality, were observed.
   Multivariate linear regression revealed significant positive
   associations between IFIAS scores and HIV infection, maternal age,
   number of children and a history of internal displacement. IFIAS scores
   were negatively associated with women's diet diversity score, asset
   index and being employed.
   Conclusions: The IFIAS showed strong reliability, validity and
   contextual relevance among women attending antenatal care in northern

Abstract = {{The effects of compact TiO2 overlayers, deposited on TiO2
   photoelectrodes through the hydrolysis of TiCl4, on the overall
   performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were investigated. A
   thermal treatment at high-enough temperature was required for a more
   effective and higher dye-loading of the compact TiO2 overlayers. This
   led to improvements in the crystallinity and porosity of the layer,
   which contributed to higher power conversion efficiencies (POE) of DSSCs
   compared with the electrodes prepared at relatively lower temperatures.
   Moreover, the existence of an additional secondary overlayer led to an
   increase in the net POE of the cells by increasing the amount of
   dye-loading, even though this layer itself, in the absence of a first
   overlayer formed under high thermal treatment, did not enhance cell
   efficiency, because of the higher charge transport resistance over the
   layers and an increase in surface states.}},

Abstract = {{Marine operations, e.g., the sea transport of heavy objects and the
   installation of offshore units and equipment, need to be planned and
   executed with proper consideration for environmental conditions and
   operational limits with respect to vessel motions and structural loads.
   Marine operations with a limited duration, usually less than 72 h, are
   typically designed as weather-restricted operations. The environmental
   design criteria are thus predefined, and the actual weather conditions
   are confirmed by weather forecasts issued immediately prior to the start
   of such an operation. Marine operations of longer duration are typically
   designed as weather-unrestricted operations, and the environmental
   conditions are calculated based on long-term statistics, possibly
   depending on the season. More detailed information about uncertainties
   in weather forecasts could increase the feasible duration of
   weather-restricted operations. The uncertainty inherent in weather
   forecasts, notably that in the significant wave height, is studied.
   Further, a method to assess the reliability of weather forecasts is
   described. Data from the Norwegian Sea are used to quantify the
   uncertainty in forecasted data. The probability of exceeding the design
   criteria used in the planning of a weather-unrestricted marine operation
   can be estimated based on forecast statistics. The corresponding
   uncertainty can be incorporated into structural reliability analyses.

Abstract = {{Information can be encoded in the temporal patterning of spikes. How the
   brain reads these patterns is of general importance and represents one
   of the greatest challenges in neuroscience. We addressed this issue in
   relation to temporal pattern recognition in the anuran auditory system.
   Many species of anurans perform mating decisions based on the temporal
   structure of advertisement calls. One important temporal feature is the
   number of sound pulses that occur with a species-specific interpulse
   interval. Neurons representing this pulse count have been recorded in
   the anuran inferior colliculus, but the mechanisms underlying their
   temporal selectivity are incompletely understood. Here, we construct a
   parsimonious model that can explain the key dynamical features of these
   cells with biologically plausible elements. We demonstrate that interval
   counting arises naturally when combining interval-selective inhibition
   with pulse-per-pulse excitation having both fast-and slow-conductance
   synapses. Interval-dependent inhibition is modeled here by a simple
   architecture based on known physiology of afferent nuclei. Finally, we
   consider simple implementations of previously proposed mechanistic
   explanations for these counting neurons and show that they do not
   account for all experimental observations. Our results demonstrate that
   tens of millisecond-range temporal selectivities can arise from simple
   connectivity motifs of inhibitory neurons, without recourse to internal
   clocks, spike-frequency adaptation, or appreciable short-term
   plasticity.}},

   coupling of subband states in an asymmetric double quantum well}},
Journal = {{AIP ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We show that sharp nonmonotic variation of low temperature electron
   mobility mu can be achieved in GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs barrier delta-doped
   double quantum well structure due to quantum mechanical transfer of
   subband electron wave functions within the wells. We vary the potential
   profile of the coupled structure as a function of the doping
   concentration in order to bring the subbands into resonance such that
   the subband energy levels anticross and the eigen states of the coupled
   structure equally share both the wells thereby giving rise to a dip in
   mobility. When the wells are of equal widths, the dip in mobility occurs
   under symmetric doping of the side barriers. In case of unequal well
   widths, the resonance can be obtained by suitable asymmetric variation
   of the doping concentrations. The dip in mobility becomes sharp and also
   the wavy nature of mobility takes a rectangular shape by increasing the
   barrier width. We show that the dip in mobility at resonance is governed
   by the interface roughness scattering through step like changes in the
   subband mobilities. It is also gratifying to show that the drop in
   mobility at the onset of occupation of second subband is substantially
   supressed through the quantum mechanical transfer of subband wave
   functions between the wells. Our results can be utilized for performance
   enhancement of coupled quantum well devices. (C) 2015 Author(s). All

Abstract = {{While theory and evidence show that firms' competitive actions mediate
   the resource-performance relationship, details of top managements' roles
   in shaping resource utilization choices have been underemphasized. We
   address this oversight by integrating top management team heterogeneity

   resource-action-performance model to investigate how TMT composition
   differentially affects the model's two linkages. Specifically, we argue
   that TMT heterogeneity positively affects the resource-action linkage,
   yet negatively affects the action-performance linkage. Moreover, when
   heterogeneity begets strong faultlines, all such positive effect is
   lost. Supportive evidence from the in-vitro medical diagnostic substance
   manufacturing industry allows us to discuss how our findings contribute
   to upper echelons theory, as well as the emerging stream on resource

Abstract = {{Introduction/Aim. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is the most
   common cause of wound infections, following the disruption of the skin
   or mucous membranes integrity. The aim of this study was to analyze of
   the presence P. aeruginosa in wound swabs, antibiotics susceptibility
   testing, determination of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
   of antibiotics, testing of the metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs)
   production, isolates serotyping and analysis of the most common
   serotypes resistance. Methods. A total of 90 outpatients and 55
   intpatients wound swabs were cultivated. Wound swabs were taken from the
   patients with wound infections symptoms. Antibiotics susceptibility
   testing was performed to: meropenem, imipenem, piperacillintazobactam,
   ceftazidime, cefepime, amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, ofloxacin,
   ciprofloxacin and colistin (HiMedia). Polyvalent and monovalent antisera
   for agglutination (Biorad) were used in P. aeruginosa agglutination.
   Results. P. aeruginosa was isolated from 36.55\% wound swabs (36.66\% of
   the inpatients wounds and 36.36\% of the outpatients). The analyzed
   isolates showed the highest degree of sensitivity to colistin (100\%)
   and meropenem (93.44\%) and the lowest to cefepime (19.54\%). The
   majority of the inpatients isolates had 12 mu g/mL (28.57\%) MIC for
   piperacillin-tazobactam and 16 mu g/mL (28.57\%) for the outpatients.
   The most common MICs for ciprofloxacin were 0.19 mu g/mL (31.81\%) for
   the nosocomial isolates, and 0.25 mu g/mL (28.57\%) for the outpatients'
   ones. The most common MICs for amikacin of the nosocomial isolates were
   6 mu g/ml (40.9\%), and for the outpatients ones 4 mu g/mL (33.33\%).
   Five (9.43\%) isolates produced MBLs. The most common serotypes were P11
   (22.64\%), P6 (15.09\%) and P1 (11.32\%). Conclusion. Neither the
   increased presence of P. aeruginosa was noticed in wounds swabs, nor the
   antibiotic resistance in the nosocomial isolates compared to those from
   outpatients. The analyzed isolates had the ingest sensitivity to
   colistin and meropenem, and the lowest to cefepime.}},

Title = {{Ten-year legacy effects of baseline blood pressure `treatment naivety'

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYPERTENSION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2331-2337}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives:Current blood pressure (BP) management guidelines recommend
   that treatment thresholds for BP be based on absolute cardiovascular
   disease (CVD) risk rather than on elevated BP levels alone. Clinicians
   are concerned that delayed pharmacotherapy in individuals with high BP,
   but low CVD risk, may increase long-term CVD events. To investigate
   this, we examined differences in CVD events within the Second Australian
   National BP study (ANBP2) for those previously on pharmacotherapy and
   those who were not, as well as fatal events in the 6-year post-trial
   period.Methods:Population consisted of ANBP2 participants without a
   prior CVD event. Adjusted Cox-regression hazard models were used to
   assess the effects of prior BP pharmacotherapy use on cardiovascular
   endpoints within ANBP2. An extended 6-year follow-up analysis for
   cardiovascular and all-cause mortality was also conducted.Results:We
   found a higher in-trial CVD and all-cause mortality rate and incidence
   of new-onset diabetes for those on previous treatment versus those who
   were treatment-naive. We investigated whether this was an effect of the
   in-trial protocol, but this did not explain the observed differences. No
   difference in CVD or all-cause mortality at 10 years was observed
   between treatment-naive' and previous treatment' groups.Conclusion:We
   found no long-term adverse mortality associated with treatment naivety
   of elevated BP in an elderly hypertensive cohort, but this finding is
   likely to be confounded as seen by the lower in-trial mortality in the
   treatment-naive' group. Legacy effects need to be explored in randomized
   trials of middle-aged populations where the clinical concern lies.}},

Abstract = {{Describing the process of spontaneous mutation is fundamental for
   understanding the genetic basis of disease, the threat posed by
   declining population size in conservation biology, and much of
   evolutionary biology. Directly studying spontaneous mutation has been
   difficult, however, because new mutations are rare. Mutation
   accumulation (MA) experiments overcome this by allowing mutations to
   build up over many generations in the near absence of natural selection.
   Here, we sequenced the genomes of 85 MA lines derived from six
   genetically diverse strains of the green alga Chlamydomonas rein hardtii
   We identified 6843 new mutations, more than any other study of
   spontaneous mutation. We observed sevenfold variation in the mutation
   rate among strains and that mutator genotypes arose, increasing the
   mutation rate approximately eightfold in some replicates. We also found
   evidence for fine-scale heterogeneity in the mutation rate, with certain
   sequence motifs mutating at much higher rates, and clusters of multiple
   mutations occurring at closely linked sites. There was little evidence,
   however, for mutation rate heterogeneity between chromosomes or over
   large genomic regions of 200 kbp. We generated a predictive model of the
   mutability of sites based on their genomic properties, including local
   GC content, gene expression level, and local sequence context. Our model
   accurately predicted the average mutation rate and natural levels of
   genetic diversity of sites across the genome. Notably, trinucleotides
   vary 17-fold in rate between the most and least mutable sites. Our
   results uncover a rich heterogeneity in the process of spontaneous
   mutation both among individuals and across the genome.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Oncologic imaging is a key for successful cancer treatment.
   While the quality assurance (QA) of image acquisition protocols has
   already been focussed, QA of reading and reporting offers still room for
   improvement. The latter was addressed in the context of a prospective
   multicentre trial on fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG)-positron-emission
   tomography (PET)/CT-based chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced
   non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
   Material and methods: An expert panel was prospectively installed
   performing blinded reviews of mediastinal NSCLC involvement in
   FDG-PET/CT. Due to a high initial reporting inter-observer disagreement,
   the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) triggered an
   interventional harmonisation process, which overall involved 11 experts
   uttering 6855 blinded diagnostic statements. After assessing the
   baseline inter-observer agreement (IOA) of a blinded re-review (phase
   1), a discussion process led to improved reading criteria (phase 2).
   Those underwent a validation study (phase 3) and were then implemented
   into the study routine. After 2 months (phase 4) and 1 year (phase 5),
   the IOA was reassessed.
   Results: The initial overall IOA was moderate (kappa 0.52 CT; 0.53 PET).
   After improvement of reading criteria, the kappa values improved
   substantially (kappa 0.61 CT; 0.66 PET), which was retained until the
   late reassessment (kappa 0.71 CT; 0.67 PET). Subjective uncertainty was
   highly predictive for low IOA.
   Conclusion: The IOA of an expert panel was significantly improved by a
   structured interventional harmonisation process which could be a model
   for future clinical trials. Furthermore, the low IOA in reporting nodal
   involvement in NSCLC may bear consequences for individual patient care.

Abstract = {{Networks with homogeneous routing nodes are constantly at risk as any
   vulnerability found against a node could be used to compromise all
   nodes. Introducing diversity among nodes can be used to address this
   problem. With few variants, the choice of assignment of variants to
   nodes is critical to the overall network resiliency. We present the
   Diversity Assignment Problem (DAP), the assignment of variants to nodes
   in a network, and we show how to compute the optimal solution in
   medium-size networks. We also present a greedy approximation to DAP that
   scales well to large networks. Our solution shows that a high level of
   overall network resiliency can be obtained even from variants that are
   weak on their own. We provide a variation of our problem that matches
   the specific communication requirements of applications run over the
   network (e.g., Paxos and BFT). Also, we analyze the loss in resiliency
   when optimally assigning variants based on inaccurate information about
   compromises.}},

Abstract = {{Civil administration departments require reliable measures of
   accessibility so that residential care facility shortage areas can be
   accurately identified. Building on previous research, this paper
   proposes an enhanced variable two-step floating catchment area (EV2SFCA)
   method that determines facility catchment sizes by dynamically summing
   the population around the facility until the facility-to-population
   ratio (FPR) is less than the FPR threshold (FPRT). To minimize the
   errors from the supply and demand catchments being mismatched, this
   paper proposes that the facility and population catchment areas must
   both contain the other location in calculating accessibility. A case
   study evaluating spatial accessibility to residential care facilities in
   Nanjing demonstrates that the proposed method is effective in accurately
   determining catchment sizes and identifying details in the variation of
   spatial accessibility. The proposed method can be easily applied to
   assess other public healthcare facilities, and can provide guidance to
   government departments on issues of spatial planning and identification
   of shortage and excess areas.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel biosensor based on Carbon dots (C-dots) for
   sensitive detection of hydroquinone (H(2)Q) is reported. It is
   interesting to find that the fluorescence of the C-dots could be
   quenched by H(2)Q. directly. The possible quenching mechanism is
   proposed, which shows that the quenching effect may be caused by the
   electron transfer from C-dots to oxidized H(2)Q-quinone. Based on the
   above principle, a novel C-dots based fluorescent probe has been
   successfully applied to detect H(2)Q Under the optimal condition,
   detection limit down to 0.1 mu M is obtained, which is far below U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency estimated wastewater discharge limit of
   0.5 mg/L Moreover, the proposed method shows high selectivity for H(2)Q
   over a number of potential interfering species. Finally, several water
   samples spiked with H(2)Q are analyzed utilizing the sensing method with
   satisfactory recovery. The proposed method is simple with high
   sensitivity and excellent selectivity, which provides a new approach for
   the detection of various analytes that can be transformed into quinone.

Abstract = {{Manifold regularization, which learns from a limited number of labeled
   samples and a large number of unlabeled samples, is a powerful
   semi-supervised classifier with a solid theoretical foundation. However,
   manifold regularization has the tendency to misclassify data near the
   boundaries of different classes during the classification process. In
   this paper, we propose a novel classification method called locality
   preserving semi-supervised support vector machine (LPSSVM) with an
   extended manifold regularization framework based on within-class
   locality preserving scatter. LPSSVM is good at exploring the underlying
   discriminative information as well as the local geometry of the samples
   as much as possible rather than merely relying on the smoothness
   information regarding manifold regularization. Meanwhile, benefiting
   from the geodesic distance metric, LPSSVM can more effectively reflect
   the true local geometry of data instances in the manifold space, which
   further strengths its accuracy in reality. The extensive comparisons
   with respect to LPSSVM and several state-of-the-art approaches were
   carried out on both artificial and real-word data sets. These
   experimental studies demonstrate the advantages as well as the
   superiority of our proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Corynebacterium glutamicum that expresses the exogenous L-glutamate
   decarboxylase (GAD) gene can synthesize gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
   To prevent GABA decomposition in the recombinant C. glutamicum GAD
   strain, GABA uptake and the GABA shunt pathway were blocked.
   GABA uptake is catalyzed by GABA permease encoded by gabP. The first
   reaction of the GABA shunt pathway is catalyzed by the GABA transaminase
   encoded by gabT. Initially, the effects of pH on GABA decomposition in
   recombinant C. glutamicum co-expressing two GAD genes (gadB1 and gadB2)
   were analyzed, demonstrating that GABA could be decomposed under neutral
   pH. Next, the gabP and gabT were individually deleted, and the GABA
   production of the related GAD strains was investigated by controlling
   the pH of the final fermentation stage at a neutral state. During this
   stage, the GABA concentration of the gabT-deleted GAD strain decreased
   from 23.9 +/- A 1.8 to 17.7 +/- A 0.7 g/l. However, the GABA
   concentration of the gabP-deleted GAD strain remained at 18.6-19.4 g/l.
   This study demonstrated that GABA was decomposed under neutral pH and
   that the deletion of gabP could effectively alleviate GABA decomposition
   in C. glutamicum.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolic compartmentation is a key feature of mammalian cells.
   Mitochondria are the powerhouse of eukaryotic cells, responsible for
   respiration and the TCA cycle. We accessed the mitochondrial metabolism
   of the economically important Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using
   selective permeabilization. We tested key substrates without and with
   addition of ADP. Based on quantified uptake and production rates, we
   could determine the contribution of different elementary flux modes to
   the metabolism of a substrate or substrate combination. ADP stimulated
   the uptake of most metabolites, directly by serving as substrate for the
   respiratory chain, thus removing the inhibitory effect of NADH, or as
   allosteric effector. Addition of ADP favored substrate metabolization to
   CO2 and did not enhance the production of other metabolites. The
   controlling effect of ADP was more pronounced when we supplied
   metabolites to the first part of the TCA cycle: pyruvate, citrate,
   alpha-ketoglutarate and glutamine. In the second part of the TCA cycle,
   the rates were primarily controlled by the concentrations of
   C4-dicarboxylates. Without ADP addition, the activity of the pyruvate
   carboxylase-malate dehydrogenase-malic enzyme cycle consumed the ATP
   produced by oxidative phosphorylation, preventing its accumulation and
   maintaining metabolic steady state conditions. Aspartate was taken up
   only in combination with pyruvate, whose uptake also increased, a fact
   explained by complex regulatory effects. Isocitrate dehydrogenase and
   alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase were identified as the key regulators
   of the TCA cycle, confirming existent knowledge from other cells. We
   have shown that selectively permeabilized cells combined with elementary
   mode analysis allow in-depth studying of the mitochondrial metabolism
   and regulation. (C) 2015 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

Abstract = {{Purpose
   This study was conducted to longitudinally assess the impact of an
   automatically generated survivorship care plan (SCP) on patient-reported
   outcomes in routine clinical practice. Primary outcomes were patient
   satisfaction with information and care. Secondary outcomes included
   illness perceptions and health care use.
   Methods
   Twelve hospitals were randomly assigned to SCP care or usual care in a
   pragmatic, cluster randomized trial. Newly diagnosed patients with
   endometrial cancer completed questionnaires after diagnosis (n = 221;
   75\% response), 6 months (n = 158), and 12 months (n = 147). An SCP
   application was built in the Web-based ROGY (Registration System
   Oncological Gynecology). By clicking the SCP button, a patient-tailored
   SCP was generated.
   Results
   In the SCP care arm, 74\% of patients received an SCP. They reported
   receiving more information about their treatment (mean {[}M] = 57,
   standard deviation {[}SD] = 20 v M = 47, SD = 24; P = .03), other
   services (M = 35, SD = 22 v M = 25, SD = 22; P = .03), and different
   places of care (M = 27, SD = 25 v M = 23, SD = 26; P = .04) than the
   usual care arm (scales, 0 to 100). However, there were no differences
   regarding satisfaction with information or care. Patients in the SCP
   care arm experienced more symptoms (M = 3.3, SD = 2.0 v M = 2.6, SD =
   1.6; P = .03), were more concerned about their illness (M = 4.4, SD =
   2.3 v M = 3.9, SD = 2.1; P = .03), were more affected emotionally (M =
   4.0, SD = 2.2 v M = 3.7, SD = 2.2; P = .046), and reported more
   cancer-related contact with their primary care physician (M = 1.8, SD =
   2.0 v M = 1.1, SD = 0.9; P = .003) than those in the usual care arm
   (scale, 1 to 10). These effects did not differ over time.
   Conclusion
   The present trial showed no evidence of a benefit of SCPs on
   satisfaction with information and care. Furthermore, SCPs increased
   patients' concerns, emotional impact, experienced symptoms, and the
   amount of cancer-related contact with the primary care physician.
   Whether this may ultimately lead to more empowered patients should be
   investigated further. (C) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology}},

Abstract = {{In this Update, we cover the basic principles of the estimation and
   prediction of the rates of the many interconnected biochemical reactions
   that constitute plant metabolic networks. This includes metabolic flux
   analysis approaches that utilize the rates or patterns of redistribution
   of stable isotopes of carbon and other atoms to estimate fluxes, as well
   as constraints-based optimization approaches such as flux balance
   analysis. Some of the major insights that have been gained from analysis
   of fluxes in plants are discussed, including the functioning of
   metabolic pathways in a network context, the robustness of the metabolic
   phenotype, the importance of cell maintenance costs, and the mechanisms
   that enable energy and redox balancing at steady state. We also discuss
   methodologies to exploit `omic data sets for the construction of
   tissue-specific metabolic network models and to constrain the range of
   permissible fluxes in such models. Finally, we consider the future
   directions and challenges faced by the field of metabolic network flux
   phenotyping.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-criteria collaborative filtering (MC-CF) presents a possibility to
   provide accurate recommendations by considering the user preferences in
   multiple aspects of items. However, scalability and sparsity are two
   main problems in MC-CF which this paper attempts to solve them using
   dimensionality reduction and Neuro-Fuzzy techniques. Considering the
   user behavior about items' features which is frequently vague, imprecise
   and subjective, we solve the sparsity problem using Neuro-Fuzzy
   technique. For the scalability problem, higher order singular value
   decomposition along with supervised learning (classification) methods is
   used. Thus, the objective of this paper is to propose a new
   recommendation model to improve the recommendation quality and
   predictive accuracy of MC-CF and solve the scalability and alleviate the
   sparsity problems in the MC-CF. The experimental results of applying
   these approaches on Yahoo!Movies and TripAdvisor datasets with several
   comparisons are presented to show the enhancement of MC-CF
   recommendation quality and predictive accuracy. The experimental results
   demonstrate that SVM dominates the K-NN and FBNN in improving the MC-CF
   predictive accuracy evaluated by most broadly popular measurement
   metrics, F1 and mean absolute error. In addition, the experimental
   results also demonstrate that the combination of Neuro-Fuzzy and
   dimensionality reduction techniques remarkably improves the
   recommendation quality and predictive accuracy of MC-CF in relation to
   the previous recommendation techniques based on multi-criteria ratings.}},

   samples were measured at ambient temperature by a vibrating sample
   magnetometer. It is found that all composite samples exhibit
   ferromagnetism. This could be local-structurally explained by the
   existed oxidation states of Ni2+ and Fe3+ in the samples. Moreover,
   local environments around Ni and Fe ions could be revealed by X-ray
   absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurement including X-ray absorption

   the overall response rate. Patients received 6-8 cycles of CVDD at four
   dose levels. There were no dose-limiting toxicities. The MPD was

   days 1, 4, 8, 11, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 30mg/m(2) IV on day 4,
   and dexamethasone 20mg orally on the day of and after bortezomib (21-d
   cycle). Forty-nine patients were treated at the MPD of which 22\% had
   high-risk myeloma. The most common grade 3 toxicities included
   myelosuppression, infection, and fatigue. Overall response and complete
   response rates were 91\% and 26\% in standard-risk, and 100\% and 58\%
   in high-risk cohort, respectively. After a median follow-up of 34months,
   the median progression-free survival was 31.3months. The 2-yr overall

Abstract = {{Ceramic is an important material with outstanding physical properties
   whereas impurities and porosities generated by traditional manufacturing
   methods limits its further industrial applications. In order to solve
   this problem, direct fabrication of Al2O3 ceramic structures is
   conducted by laser engineered net shaping system and pure ceramic
   powders. Grain refinement strengthening method by doping ZrO2 and
   dispersion strengthening method by doping SiC are proposed to suppress
   cracks in fabricating Al2O3 structure. Phase compositions,
   microstructures as well as mechanical properties of fabricated specimens
   are then analyzed. The results show that the proposed two methods are
   effective in suppressing cracks and structures of single-bead wall, arc
   and cylinder ring are successfully deposited. Stable phase of
   alpha-Al2O3 and t-ZrO2 are obtained in the fabricated specimens.
   Micro-hardness higher than 1700 HV are also achieved for both Al2O3 and
   Al2O3/ZrO2, which are resulted from fine directional crystals generated
   by the melting-solidification process. Results presented indicate that
   additive manufacturing is a very attractive technique for the production
   of high-performance ceramic structures in a single step.}},

Abstract = {{A novel Gram-staining-positive, aerobic, endospore-forming, rod-shaped
   bacterial strain, YN2(T), was isolated from ripened Pu'er tea.
   Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the strain
   represented a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus. The strains most
   closely related to strain YN2(T) were Paenibacillus vulneris JCM
   18268(T) and Paenibacillus rigui JCM 16352(T), with 16S rRNA
   similarities of 98.6 and 95.5 \%, respectively. Chemotaxonomic data
   supported the affiliation of the new isolate to the genus Paenibacillus,
   including MK-7 as the major menaquinone, DNA G + C content of 51 mol\%,
   cell-wall type A1 gamma (mesodiaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic
   diamino acid) and anteiso-C-15 : 0 and iso-C-16 : 0 as the major fatty
   acids. Major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol,
   phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol,
   phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine and phospholipid. Strain YN2(T) could
   be differentiated from recognized species of the genus Paenibacillus
   based on phenotypic characteristics, chemotaxonomic differences,
   phylogenetic analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization data. On the basis of
   evidence from this polyphasic study, Paenibacillus yunnanensis sp. nov.,
   is proposed, with strain YN2(T) (=CGMCC 1.12968(T) =JCM 30953(T)) as the

Title = {{Imagining Library 4.0: Creating a Model for Future Libraries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to suggest a Library 4.0 model
   based on the concepts of Library 4.0 discussed in the literature as the
   future of library service. The concepts and model of Library 4.0 can be
   adapted to fit every different kind of library.
   Design/Methodology/Approach: For this purpose, first, major reference
   databases (e.g. Google Scholar, EbscoHost, LISA, etc.) were examined for
   literature that discusses Web 4.0 and Library 4.0. Second, examples of
   information technology environments as well as studies and news articles
   related to information technology were comprehensively collected and
   analyzed by focusing on those which may influence libraries. Third,
   examples of cutting-edge information technology applied in libraries
   were examined and analyzed. Other examples were found of cutting-edge
   information technologies that have not yet been used in libraries but
   would be applicable to the next-generation library. Fourth, this study
   developed a model for next-generation library service provided by
   Library 4.0 and representative keywords explaining Library 4.0.
   Findings: First, opinions of scholars tracking the rise of Web 4.0 vary
   widely, but Web 4.0 features commonly suggested by previous researchers
   are: reading, writing, and executing simultaneously, intelligence-based
   agents, connected web, ubiquitous web, intelligence connections, and
   intelligence-based web. Secondly, this study determined the features of
   Library 4.0 as: intelligence-based, massive data, augmented reality,
   context aware, cutting-edge displays, and infinite creative space.
   Third, in this context, the keywords that best explain Library 4.0 are:
   Intelligent, Makerspace, Context-Aware Technology, Open Source, Big
   Data, Cloud Service, Augmented Reality, State-of-the-art Display, and
   Librarian 4.0.
   Originality/Value: Discussions about Web 4.0 have begun, but little has
   been written about Library 4.0. This study is significant for deriving
   keywords for Library 4.0 and presenting the development direction of
   Library 4.0. In the future, research on Library 4.0 can actively proceed
   from this starting point (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. A retrospective comparative study.
   Objective. We compared the outcomes between patients treated either by
   selective thoracic anterior (ASF) or posterior spinal fusion (PSF), with
   a minimum 10-year follow-up.
   Summary of Background Data. A retrospective long-term follow-up study
   was conducted to compare PSF (P group) and ASF (A group) with Lenke type
   1 or 2. There were no significant differences in the correction rate and
   incidence of degenerative discs (DDs) on the lumbar area. Loss of
   correction was greater in the A group.
   Methods. The inclusion criteria were female, AIS Lenke type 1 or 2,
   minimum 10-year follow-up, MRI check-up at 5 years and 10 years postop.
   The number of patients, age, and curve types at the time of surgery were
   matched in both groups. Complications, pulmonary function, and SRS-30
   were also evaluated.
   Results. P group: adding-on (AO) occurred in 14 patients. Two patients
   demonstrated progression of scoliosis >5 degrees during follow-up.
   Degenerative discs occurred in 43\% of patients at 10 years postop.
   There were significant differences in the \% VC and FVC before surgery
   and at the final visit (P< 0.05). A group: AO occurred in 16 patients.
   Eleven showed progression of scoliosis > 5 degrees. Degenerative disc
   was recognized in 53\% of the patients. There was no significant
   difference in the pulmonary function. There was a significant difference
   in selfimage score in the SRS-30 between the two groups (P< 0.05).
   Conclusion. Correction of scoliosis was significantly better ASF than
   PSF immediately postop. Greater loss of correction occurred with ASF at
   postop 10 years. Although shorter segments could be fused by ASF, there
   was no significant difference in the incidence of DDs. Pulmonary
   function test results improved in the P group and were restored in the A
   group during the perioperative period.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a syndrome characterized by complex
   neurological symptoms resulting from demyelinating lesions in the
   central nervous system. We report a child with a relapse of MS whose
   only presenting symptom was severe abdominal pain. Dysfunctional
   intestinal mobility was assessed by abdominal computed tomography.
   Findings resembled paralytic ileus resulting from peritonitis. However,
   the patient demonstrated no other symptoms of peritonitis. A T2-weighted
   magnetic resonance image revealed a new demyelinating lesion localized
   to thoracic segments T4-T12. The lesion presumably affected autonomic
   efferents involved in intestinal mobility. Treatment with a pulse of
   methylprednisolone reduced both abdominal pain and lesion size. To our
   knowledge, this is the first reported case of a pediatric MS patient
   with a demyelinating lesion associated with an autonomic symptom of
   altered intestinal mobility in the absence of neurological symptoms.
   This atypical presentation of MS highlights the need for physicians'
   vigilance when treating this patient population. (C) 2015 The Japanese

Abstract = {{Bee product mugwort is identified as being at the origin of allergic
   accidents but the biological potency of Artemisia contained in bee
   pollen is not well known. In this experiment, Artemisia mass was
   identified in bee pollen mass and after having calculated the proportion

   reactivity to Artemisia was assessed by measuring wheal diameters (W)
   from skin prick tests using three serial dilutions of bee pollen on 11
   allergic patients to Artemisia, in order to calculate the relationship
   between Artemisia mass (Mass (artemisia)) in bee pollen and skin
   reactivity.
   The dose- response power regression curve (W (artemisia)) = 3.328 (Mass
   (artemisia))(0.297) (R2 = 0.9947) and the linear function Log(10) (W
   (artemisia)) = 0.297 (Log(10) (Mass (artemisia)) + 0.520 (R = 0.9974))
   were established using a bee pollen sample with 0.246 mg of Artemisia
   pollen per mg. Mugwort allergens seem to be little or not altered by bee
   secretions and bee pollen retains its allergenic capacity.

Abstract = {{This study identifies factors that affect the adoption behavior for
   residential Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems,
   including a spatial and temporal contagion effect, house
   characteristics, and other economic and contextual factors. The study
   draws on a dataset of house sale records in the greater Chicago area,
   spanning 1992- 2004. First-differenced models and restricting the sample
   to new construction allow separate identification of adoption
   determinants for homeowners and for developers, respectively. We show
   that attributes of the building stock and demographics influence
   adoption decisions of both homeowners and developers. This includes a
   strong influence of square footage, a modest spatial clustering effect
   for existing homes, a consistent deterrent effect of higher property tax
   rates, and a positive influence of neighborhood education levels.
   Adoption decisions for existing homeowners appear to be driven by
   different factors than sellers of newly constructed homes. Adoption
   coincided with multistory homes for developers, and neighbor adoption
   rates predicted adoption by existing homeowners but not developers. The
   results highlight the need for more research into the social context of
   energy efficiency investment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Aims and methods Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has previously
   been linked to glioma invasion and progression. To determine whether EMT
   regulators, Twist and Zeb1, had clinical significance in astrocytic
   gliomas, the association of Twist and Zeb1 with clinicopathological and
   molecular factors was studied in 269 astrocytoma samples.
   Results Twist and Zeb1 were widely expressed in astrocytic gliomas, but
   the expression of the former did not correlate with that of the latter.
   Stronger Twist expression levels were associated with higher WHO grades
   (p=0.001), whereas Zeb1 did not correlate with WHO grades. We found no
   association between Twist and proliferation activity (Ki67/MIB-1), p53
   status, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification or neural
   cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) expression. There was no significant
   difference in Twist or Zeb1 expression when primary and secondary
   gliomas were analysed. Tumours with high Twist expression were IDH1
   negative (p=0.009). High hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha expression
   correlated significantly with positive Twist expression (p<0.001),
   whereas it was not associated with Zeb1 expression. Zeb1 expression did
   not correlate with proliferation, EGFR or IDH1. Nevertheless, we did
   find a correlation between high Zeb1 expression and low p53 expression
   levels (p=0.027). Positive NCAM expression was significantly associated
   with Zeb1 positivity (p=0.022). Zeb1 had no association with patient
   survival, whereas positive Twist expression predicted poor survival for
   patients in both univariate (p<0.001) and multivariable analyses
   (p=0.027).
   Conclusions EMT regulators, Twist and Zeb1, are common features of
   infiltrating astrocytomas, and Twist is upregulated in glioblastomas in
   particular. Twist may be a novel marker for poor prognosis in glioma
   patients.}},

Title = {{Developing graduate student competency in providing culturally sensitive
   end of life care in critical care environments - A pilot study of a
   teaching innovation}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN CRITICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Australia's immigration policy has generated a rich diverse
   cultural community of staff and patients in critical care environments.
   Many different cultural perspectives inform individual actions in the
   context of critical care, including the highly sensitive area of end of
   life care, with nurses feeling poorly prepared to provide culturally
   sensitive end of life care.
   Purpose: This article describes and evaluates the effectiveness of an
   educational innovation designed to develop graduate-level critical care
   nurses' capacity for effective interpersonal communication, as members
   of a multi-disciplinary team in providing culturally sensitive
   end-of-life care.
   Methods: A mixed method pilot study was conducted using a curriculum
   innovation intervention informed by The Excellence in Cultural
   Experiential Learning and Leadership Program (EXCELL)(,)1 which is a
   higher education intervention which was applied to develop the nurses'
   intercultural communication skills. 12 graduate nursing students
   studying critical care nursing participated in the study. 42\% (n = 5)
   of the participants were from an international background. Information
   about students' cultural learning was recorded before and after the
   intervention, using a cultural learning development scale. Student
   discussions of end of life care were recorded at Week 2 and 14 of the
   curriculum. The quantitative data was analysed using descriptive
   statistical analysis and qualitative data was thematically analysed.
   Results: Students demonstrated an increase in cultural learning in a
   range of areas in the pre-post surveys including understandings of
   cultural diversity, interpersonal skills, cross cultural interactions
   and participating in multicultural groups. Thematic analysis of the end
   of life discussions revealed an increase in the levels of nurse
   confidence in approaching end of life care in critical care
   environments.
   Conclusion: The EXCELL program provides an effective and supportive
   educational framework to increase graduate nurses' cultural learning
   development and competence to manage culturally complex clinical issues
   such as end of life care, and is recommended as a framework for health
   care students to learn the skills required to provide culturally
   competent care in a range of culturally complex health care settings.

Abstract = {{Sedimentary rocks with sealing potential can cap a reservoir by impeding
   the upward movement of hydrocarbons. An effective seal should have three
   qualifying factors of geometry, integrity, and capacity. Mapping seismic
   horizons and faults across the area of study reveals much about the
   geometry and integrity of the sealing unit. Capacity, however, depends
   on capillary pressure measurements of core and cuttings samples.
   Modeling capacity of seals away from and between wells has traditionally
   involved simple gridding techniques or association with most likely
   geologic or seismic facies. We have developed a different approach in
   using seismic data and applying it to the evaluation of sealing
   potential. Shales are the most common seals in petroleum systems.
   Seismically, well-developed shale units that have undergone compaction
   are likely to be anisotropic and are typical vertical transverse
   isotropic media. Seismic data with suitable acquisition parameters were
   processed to extract. and Thomsen's parameters of weak seismic
   anisotropy, tied to the vertical seismic profile data at wells. The
   spatial distribution of epsilon has shown a good correlation with
   capillary measurements of well samples. Hence, 3D modeling of epsilon
   was used as a weight factor to guide the capillary pressure (P-c) values
   away from the wells. Capillary pressure values were then mapped on the
   fault planes to high grade the analysis of sandshale juxtaposition. Our
   results helped to explain the distribution of successful wells and dry
   holes within the study area.}},

Abstract = {{A thermogravimetric analysis technique coupled to an evolved gas
   analysis, namely the thermal desorption/gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry method (TGA-TD/GC-MS) was developed, to identify and
   quantify condensable volatile compounds produced during the pyrolysis of
   lignocellulose. Four lignocellulose samples of different origins (i.e.,
   pine, bamboo, corn cob and corn stover) were pyrolysed using a TGA
   system. Condensable volatiles released during pyrolysis were captured
   onto thermal desorption tubes and subsequently identified and quantified
   using a TD/GC-MS method. Chemical composition of condensable volatiles
   was statistically correlated with the original lignocellulose
   composition, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). A total of 15-19
   wt\% (dry weight) of biomass pyrolysis products were quantified by the
   method, with an average Relative Standard Deviation on the high
   concentration condensable volatiles yield of 6.4\%, a significant
   improvement to what has been reported in literature. The first two
   principal components accounted for 89.4\% of the variance in the data
   and showed clear correlations between evolved condensable volatile
   compounds and compositional differences among the four biomass samples.
   The origin of most lignin-derived compounds could be determined, due to
   the limitation of secondary reactions under slow pyrolysis. The yield of
   levoglucosan and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural were consistent with the
   initial content of C-6 sugars in the feedstock, but also negatively
   correlated with the ash content. The quantification of acetic acid, the
   highest yielding condensable volatile product, can be used as an
   indicator of the number of acetyl groups in biomass. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Purpose: Eye and hand motor dysfunction may be present early in the
   disease course of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), and can
   affect the results on visual and written cognitive tests. We aimed to
   test for differences in saccadic initiation time (SI time) between RRMS
   patients and healthy controls, and whether SI time and hand motor speed
   interacted with the written version of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test
   (wSDMT).
   Methods: Patients with RRMS (N=44, age 35.1 +/- 73 years), time since
   diagnosis <3 years and matched controls (N=41, age 33.2 +/- 6.8 years)
   were examined with ophthalmological, neurological and neuropsychological
   tests, as well as structural MRI (white matter lesion load (WMLL) and
   brainstem lesions), visual evoked potentials (VEP) and eye-tracker
   examinations of saccades.
   Results: SI time was longer in RRMS than controls (p <0.05). SI time was
   not related to the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), WMLL or
   to the presence of brainstem lesions. 9 hole peg test (9HP) correlated
   significantly with WMLL (r=0.58, p <0.01). Both SI time and 9HP
   correlated negatively with the results of wSDMT (r=032, p <0.05, r=0.47,
   p <0.01), but none correlated with the results of PASAT.
   Conclusions: RRMS patients have an increased SI time compared to
   controls. Cognitive tests results, exemplified by the wSDMT, may be
   confounded by eye and hand motor function. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{AimsTo determine whether changes in questionnaire scores on symptoms and
   condition-specific quality of life reflect clinically relevant
   improvements in women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI).
   MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed questionnaires collected during a
   randomized controlled trial in women with SUI, that received pelvic
   floor muscle training (PFMT) in two different formats. We included 218
   women that answered validated self-assessment questionnaires at baseline
   and at a 4-month follow-up. We registered changes on two questionnaires,
   the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular
   Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF) and the Lower
   Urinary Tract Symptoms Quality of Life (ICIQ-LUTSqol). We compared these
   score changes to responses from the Patient Global Impression of
   Improvement (PGI-I) questionnaire. Differences were analyzed with the
   Spearman rho and one-way-ANOVA. The minimum important difference (MID)
   was the mean change in score for women that experienced a small
   improvement.
   ResultsThe PGI-I correlated significantly to both the ICIQ-UI SF
   (r=0.547, P<0.0001) and ICIQ-LUTSqol (r=0.520, P<0.0001). Thus, larger
   reductions in symptoms or quality of life scores were associated with
   greater impressions of improvement. The changes in ICIQ-UI SF and
   ICIQ-LUTSqol scores were significant across all PGI-I groups from no
   change to very much improved (P<0.05). The MIDs were 2.52 (SD 2.56) for
   ICIQ-UI SF and 3.71 (SD 4.95) for ICIQ-LUTSqol.
   ConclusionsThe change in ICIQ-UI SF and ICIQ-LUTSqol scores after PFMT
   reflected clinically relevant improvements in women with SUI. The MIDs
   established for this population may facilitate future research,
   treatment evaluations, and comparisons between studies. Neurourol.

Abstract = {{Optimizing the concentration of host borate glass system to achieve a
   superior thermal and structural stability is challenging for sundry
   applications. A series of lithium strontium borate (LSBO) glasses with
   composition of (85 - x) H3BO3 - 15Li(2)CO(3) - xSrCO(3), where x = 5,
   7.5, 10, 12.5 and 15 mol\% are prepared via melt quenching technique.
   Synthesized glasses are thoroughly characterized using XRD, FOR, DTA,
   FESEM, PL, and UV-vis-NIR measurements to determine the influence of
   strontium (Sr2+) ion concentration on thermal, physical, and structural
   properties of the glasses. XRD pattern confirms the amorphous nature of
   all samples. The FESEM images verify their homogeneous and transmitting
   surface morphology. Physical properties are determined in terms of glass
   density, molar volume, molar refractivity, polaron radius, inter-nuclear
   distance, field-strength, and ion concentration. Glass density is found
   to increase from 2.53 to 2.95 g/cm(3) with increasing Sr2+ ion contents.
   FTIR spectra exhibit the presence of two fundamental peaks in the range
   of 700-1070 cm(-1) corresponding to the trigonal and tetrahedral
   stretching vibrations of BO3 and BO4 units. These peaks show a shift
   with the increase of modifier concentration. DTA results display peaks
   for glass transition, crystallization and melting at 500, 600 and 900
   degrees C, respectively. Prepared samples are highly stable with Hurby
   parameter similar to 0.5. The direct, indirect band gap and Urbach
   energy calculated from the absorption edge of UV-vis-NIR spectra lie
   within 3.4-3.8 eV and 3.84-3.93 eV, 3.84-3.25 eV, respectively. The
   observed increase in refractive index from 2.17-2.19 is ascribed to the
   conversion of BO4 into BO3 units. Room temperature PL spectra under 430
   nm excitations display two peaks centered at 482 and 526 nm accompanied
   by slight peak shift towards the lower wavelength due to the formation
   of new complexes in the glass network. Results are analyzed via
   different mechanism and compared. Excellent features of the results
   nominate these compositions potential for solid state lasers, photonic
   devices, and optical fibers applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Nosocomial fungal infections are gaining increased attention from
   infectiologists. An adequate investigation into the levels of airborne
   Aspergillus and other fungal spores in hospital settings, under normal
   conditions, is largely unknown. We monitored airborne spore
   contamination in a Swiss hospital building in order to establish a
   seasonally-dependent base-line level. Air was sampled using an impaction
   technique, twice weekly, at six different locations over one year.
   Specimens were seeded in duplicate on Sabouraud agar plates. Grown
   colonies were identified to genus levels. The airborne Aspergillus spore
   concentration was constantly low throughout the whole year, at a median
   level of 2 spores/m(3) (inter-quartile range = IQR 1-4), and displayed
   no seasonal dependency. The median concentration of other fungal spores
   was higher and showed a distinct seasonal variability with the ambient
   temperature change during the different seasons: 82 spores/m(3) (IQR
   26-126) in summer and 9 spores/m(3) (IQR 6-15) in winter. The spore
   concentration varied considerably between the six sampling sites in the
   building (10 to 26 spores/m(3)). This variability may explain the
   variability of study results in the literature.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{300}},
Pages = {{710-731}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{We present an efficient parallelized multidomain algorithm for solving
   the 3D Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical geometries. The numerical
   method is based on fourth-order compact schemes in the two
   non-homogeneous directions and Fourier series expansion in the azimuthal
   direction. The temporal scheme is a second-order semi-implicit
   projection scheme leading to the solution of five Helmholtz/Poisson
   equations. To handle the singularity appearing at the axis in
   cylindrical coordinates, while being able to have a thinner or
   conversely a coarser mesh in this zone, parity conditions are imposed at
   r = 0 for each flow variable and azimuthal Fourier mode. To simulate
   flows in irregularly shaped cylindrical geometries and benefit from a
   hybrid OpenMP/MPI parallelization, an accurate perfectly free-divergence
   multidomain method based on the influence matrix technique is proposed.
   First, the accuracy of the present solver is checked by comparison with
   analytical solutions and the scalability is then evaluated. Simulations
   using the present code are then compared to reliable experimental and
   numerical results of the literature showing good quantitative agreements
   in the cases of the axisymmetric and 3D unsteady vortex breakdowns in a
   cylinder and turbulent pipe flow. Finally to show the capability of the
   algorithm to deal with more complex flows relevant of turbomachineries,
   the turbulent flow inside a simplified stage of High-Pressure compressor
   is considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Antioxidant properties of the aqueous extracts of hulled barley (Hordeum
   vulgare L.) that had been roasted at 210 degrees C for 20 min were
   determined in bulk oil and oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions. Bulk oils were
   heated at 60, 100, and 180 degrees C, and O/W emulsions were oxidized
   under riboflavin photosensitization. The content of phenolic compounds
   was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, and in vitro
   antioxidant assays were also conducted. The major phenolics contained in
   the aqueous extract of roasted hulled barley (AERB) were p-coumaric,
   ferulic, protocatechuic, chlorogenic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, and vanillic
   acids. Depending on the concentration and oxidation temperature, AERB
   had antioxidant or prooxidant properties in bulk oil. At 60 degrees C,
   AERB at a concentration of 0.5\% acted as a prooxidant, whereas at 1.0\%
   it acted as an antioxidant. At 100 degrees C, AERB acted as an
   antioxidant irrespective of concentration. In 180 degrees C conditions,
   0.5\% AERB acted as a prooxidant, whereas other concentrations of AERB

Volume = {{96}},

Pages = {{1226-1243}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: I hypothesize that individuals with depression lack the
   motivation and physical capacity required to participate in politics due
   to somatic problems and feelings of hopelessness and apathy.
   Furthermore, I hypothesize that depression in adolescence can have
   negative downstream consequences for participation in young adulthood.
   Method: Using the 1998 General Social Survey and the National
   Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I employ logistic regression
   and mediation analysis to test the relationship between depression and
   voting as well as adolescent depression and political participation.
   Results: The results show that both depression and adolescent depression
   reduce the probability of political participation. The effect of
   adolescent depression on political participation is mediated by
   educational attainment and partisan affiliation. Conclusion: Depression
   reduces participation and merits further attention as a political
   phenomenon. The possibility of depression as a disability is discussed,
   including potential efforts to boost participation among this group.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Determining whether liquid water exists on the Martian surface is
   central to understanding the hydrologic cycle and potential for extant
   life on Mars. Recurring slope lineae, narrow streaks of low reflectance
   compared to the surrounding terrain, appear and grow incrementally in
   the downslope direction during warm seasons when temperatures reach
   about 250-300 K, a pattern consistent with the transient flow of a
   volatile species(1-3). Brine flows (or seeps) have been proposed to
   explain the formation of recurring slope lineae(1-3), yet no direct
   evidence for either liquid water or hydrated salts has been found(4).
   Here we analyse spectral data from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging
   Spectrometer for Mars instrument onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
   from four different locations where recurring slope lineae are present.
   We find evidence for hydrated salts at all four locations in the seasons
   when recurring slope lineae are most extensive, which suggests that the
   source of hydration is recurring slope lineae activity. The hydrated
   salts most consistent with the spectral absorption features we detect
   are magnesium perchlorate, magnesium chlorate and sodium perchlorate.
   Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that recurring slope lineae
   form as a result of contemporary water activity on Mars.}},

Title = {{Allosteric role of the amino-terminal A/B domain on corticosteroid

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STEROID BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{154}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We studied the role of the A/B domain at the amino terminus of gar
   (Atractosterus tropicus) and human glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) on
   transcriptional activation by various glucocorticoids. In transient
   transfection assays, dexamethasone {[}DEX] and cortisol had a lower
   half-maximal response (EC50) for transcriptional activation of full
   length gar GR than of human GR. Both GRs had similar responses to
   corticosterone, while 11-deoxycortisol had a lower EC50 for gar GR than
   for human GR. In contrast, constructs of gar GR and human GR consisting
   of their hinge (D domain), ligand binding domain (LBD) (E domain) fused
   to a GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) had a higher EC50 (weaker response)
   for all glucocorticoids. To study the role of the A/B domain, which
   contains an intrinsically disordered region, we investigated steroid
   activation of chimeric gar GR and human GR, in which their A/B domains
   were exchanged. Replacement of human A/B domains with the gar A/B
   domains yielded a chimeric GR with a lower EC50 for DEX and cortisol,
   while the EC50 increased for these steroids for the human A/B-gar C/E
   chimera, indicating that gar A/B domains contributes to the lower EC50
   of gar GR for glucocorticoids. Our data suggests that allosteric
   signaling between the A/B domains and LBD influences transcriptional
   activation of human and gar GR by different steroids, and this
   allosteric mechanism evolved over 400 million years before gar and
   mammals separated from a common ancestor. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{With the coalescing of the European countries, among many others,
   official initiatives have been launched to propose minimum requirements
   for Otolaryngology, Head and Neck surgery (ORL) specialty training by
   creating an European log book. This study was initiated to assess and
   compare the acquisition of basic medical key diagnostic and surgical
   skills by residents and recent ORL specialists in France (FRA) and
   Germany (GER) and to determine whether gender-specific differences
   exist. For this, an anonymous questionnaire with questions to basic
   medical, diagnostic and surgical procedures specific to ORL was
   developed. 120 FRA and 125 GER questionnaires were returned from
   participants with a median training experience of 4 years. The female to
   male ratio was 1.3:1 and 78 \% of respondents were residents and 22 \%
   recent specialists. Concerning diagnostic procedures, there was no
   significant overall difference. Germans performed better in basic
   medical skills, while study participants from FRA had performed surgical
   procedures significantly more often in a more independent manner than
   German respondents in the areas of otology, rhinology and head and neck.
   Only in septoplasty, as part of rhinology, the Germans had a light
   advantage compared to the French. No difference was found for trauma
   surgery. No gender-specific difference became apparent. Taken together,
   in FRA, ORL training is far more surgically orientated than in GER. It
   remains unclear at what time, the Germans may catch up with their
   skills. Initiatives should be taken in GER to secure an adequate
   acquisition of surgical skill and experience to maintain a high level of
   ORL-specific competence.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Atherosclerotic plaque thrombogenicity is a critical factor
   that affects thrombus formation and the onset of acute myocardial
   infarction (AMI). The aim of this study was to identify the vascular
   factors involved in thrombus formation and AMI onset.
   Methods and Results: Culprit lesions in 40 coronary arteries with
   thrombi at autopsy after lethal AMI and non-cardiac death (asymptomatic
   plaque disruption) were analyzed on histology. Thrombus size, ratio of
   thrombus to lumen area, length of plaque disruption, and immunopositive
   areas for tissue factor (TF) and hexokinase (HK)-II were significantly
   larger in coronary arteries with AMI than with asymptomatic plaque
   disruption. The size of coronary thrombus positively correlated with the
   length of plaque disruption (r=0.80) and with immunopositive areas for
   TF (r=0.38) and HK-II (r=0.40). Because both M1 and M2 macrophages
   express TF and HK-II in symptomatic plaques, we assessed TF and HK-II
   expression in M1- and M2-polarized macrophages. The expression of TF was
   increased and that of HK-II was decreased in M2-, compared with
   M1-polarized THP-1 macrophages. Inhibiting glycolysis enhanced TF
   expression in the macrophages partly via hypoxia inducible factor-1
   alpha.
   Conclusions: The degree of plaque disruption and expression of TF and
   HK-II appear to be important vascular factors for AMI onset, and
   polarized macrophages make a distinct contribution to thrombogenicity

Abstract = {{Background/purpose: Treatment options for irresectable locoregional
   recurrent breast cancer in previously irradiated area are limited.
   Hyperthermia, elevating tumor temperature to 40-45 degrees C, sensitizes
   radio-and-chemotherapy. Four hundred and fourteen patients treated with
   reirradiation + hyperthermia (reRT + HT) in the AMC((n=301)) and the
   BVI(n=113), from 1982 to 2005 were retrospectively analyzed for
   treatment response, locoregional control (LC) and prognostic factors for
   LC and toxicity.
   Patients/methods: All patients received previous irradiation (median 50
   Gy). reRT consisted of 8 x 4 Gy-2/week (AMC) or 12 x 3 Gy-4/week (BVI).
   Hyperthermia was added once (AMC)/twice (BVI) a week.
   Results: Overall clinical response rate was 86\%. The 3-year LC rate was
   25\%. The number of recurrence episodes, distant metastases (DM), tumor
   site, tumor size, time to recurrence and treatment year were significant
   for LC. Acute >= grade 3 toxicity occurred in 24\% of patients.
   Actuarial late >= grade 3 toxicity was 23\% at 3-years. In multivariable
   analysis reRT fraction dose was significantly related to late >= grade 3
   toxicity.
   Conclusion: reRT + HT is an effective curative and palliative treatment
   option for patients with irresectable locoregional recurrent breast
   cancer in previously irradiated area. Early referral, treatment of chest
   wall recurrences <= 5 cm in the absence of distant metastases, provided
   the highest local control rates. The cumulative effects of past and
   present treatments should be accounted for by adjusting treatment
   protocol to minimize toxicity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Aiming to design Tc-99m complexes for probing nitric oxide synthase
   (NOS) by SPECT, we synthesized conjugates (L4-L6) comprising a
   NOS-recognizing moiety connected to a diamino-propionic acid (dap)
   chelating unit. The conjugates led to complexes of the type
   fac-{[}M(CO)(3)(K-3- L)] (M = Re/Tc-99m; Re4/Tc4: L = L4; Re5/Tc5: L =
   L5; Re6/Tc6: L = L6). Enzymatic studies showed that L4 and L5, but not
   L6, gave complexes (Re4 and Re5) that are less potent than the
   conjugates. To rationalize these results, we performed docking and
   molecular dynamics simulations. The high affinity of L4 and L5 is due to
   the strong interactions between the dap chelator and polar residues of
   the binding cavity. These interactions are hampered by metallation
   resulting in complexes with lower affinity. The higher potency of Re5
   compared to Re4 was assigned to the increased bulkiness of Re5 and the
   presence of additional anchoring groups that better fit the active site
   and provide more extensive contacts. In turn, Re6 is too bulky and its
   organometallic tail is oriented toward the peripheral pocket of iNOS,
   leading to loss of contacts and a lower affinity. These results were
   compared with our previous results obtained with analogue complexes
   stabilized by a pyrazolyl-diamine chelating unit.}},

Abstract = {{Externally applied direct current (DC) electric fields have been
   examined as a means of controllable organization of carbon structures
   (one-dimensional multi-walled carbon nanotubes of three sizes, quasi
   two-dimensional exfoliated graphene platelets, and three-dimensional
   bulk graphite) suspended in a high dielectric strength (i.e., highly
   resistive) solvent (perfluorocarbon FC-40). The net particle charge of
   the carbon structures in FC-40 was negligible. This eliminates
   non-dielectrophoretic (DEP) kinetic motions and allows for examination
   of isolated DEP forces on the assembly process. At a sufficiently high
   DC field strength and carbon structure concentration, DEP directed
   assembly and subsequent formation of electrically conductive networks
   were observed. The influences of particle size, aspect ratio,
   concentration, and structure on the assembly and electrical conduction
   in this system were investigated. Threshold voltage, an operationally
   defined measure of the applied voltage where current flow first
   occurred, was used as a characteristic measure of the assembly process.
   Consistent with charge percolation theory, the threshold voltage was
   found to be inversely related to the particle concentration and directly
   proportional to particle size as measured by light scattering.
   Accordingly, we developed an agglomeration model that accounts for the
   influence of particle size on the threshold voltage. Published by

Abstract = {{Ikaros, a zinc finger transcription factor, is an important regulator of
   the hematopoietic system. Several studies have suggested the role of
   Ikaros in the development, maturation, activation and differentiation of
   lymphocytes. To elucidate this mechanism, it is important to understand
   how this transcription factor works in the dichotomy of the
   hematopoietic system, a topic that remains uncertain. Herein, we
   investigated the role of Ikaros in the control of the lymphomyeloid
   phenotype of B-1 lymphocytes. We found that Ikaros, as well as its
   target genes, are expressed in B-1 cells,. Moreover, Ikaros positively
   regulates the expression of Flt3, Gfi and Il7r, while it down-regulates
   PU.1. During the induction of differentiation of B-1 cells toward
   phagocytes, Ikaros transcription was reduced. Taken together, these data
   pointed to the relevance of Ikaros in the maintenance of the promiscuous
   gene profile of B-1 cells. It could be suggested that Ikaros functions
   as a guardian of B-1 lymphoid pattern, and that its absence directs the
   differentiation of B-1 cells into phagocytes. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Title = {{Local and Regional Mass Transfer During Thrusting, Veining, and
   Boudinage in the Genesis of the Giant Shale-Hosted Paracatu Gold
   Deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil}},

Abstract = {{Multiscale structural and geochemical studies have been applied to
   understand the genesis of the Paracatu deposit in Brazil, a
   shallow-dipping, bulk-tonnage, vein-style low-grade Au(-Ag-Pb-Zn)
   orebody hosted in similar to 1000 Ma black phyllites of the Paracatu
   Formation, associated with intense shearing accompanying thrusting
   during the similar to 680 Ma Brasiliano orogeny. Massive to laminated
   quartz-sulfide-carbonate veins and associated alteration and Au
   mineralization formed early in the deformation history, and these veins
   were boudinaged during subsequent progressive increase in shear strain.
   Geochemical profiles across the ore allow recognition of a relatively
   homogeneous protolith at 100-m scales with respect to Ti, Al, Zr, V, and
   rare earth elements, including a footwall with protolith attributes
   similar to those of the ore. Oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur isotopes do
   not reveal a distinctive external fluid source; rather, they reflect
   fluid-rock equilibration with the host phyllites during greenschist
   facies regional metamorphism. Detailed geochemical sampling around a
   prominent population of smaller boudinaged veins shows that Si, Ca, and
   Sr were removed and Al, K, and Ti were residually concentrated during
   formation of synboudinage dark selvages. This process of mass transfer
   occurred at scales more local than the processes responsible for ore
   genesis.
   Despite the local processes of chemical equilibration and
   redistribution, many of the main ore components appear externally
   derived at scales broader than the orebody. Gold, As, Ag, Sb, Bi and, to
   some extent, Pb and Zn show a strong spatial and statistical correlation
   with boudinaged quartz-sulfide +/- carbonate veins, and these are
   surrounded by a broader (10-50-m vertical scale) halo of enriched K, Ba,
   and volatiles (loss on ignition), with depleted Na and Sr. The majority
   of gold is present as inclusions in pyrite and arsenopyrite within and
   immediately surrounding the veins, and gold-bearing pyrite shows mineral
   chemistry consistent with a hydro thermal origin. The main population of
   large veins locally preserve preboudinage, complex internal vein
   textures, including sulfide-rich wall-rock laminae similar to laminated
   fault-fill veins in many orogenic-style vein deposits. These larger
   veins contain most of the gold in the Paracatu resource. Metals were
   most likely sourced distal to the Paracatu Formation and were
   precipitated in sheeted shear or tensile veins during the early stages
   of the Brasiliano thrusting. The oblate strain recorded by the
   boudinaged, mineralized veins is anomalous and distinctive to Paracatu
   at km scales, even though the thrusting is regional. Although the
   orebody may have been physically dislocated by thrusting from the place
   where the early veins formed, the anomalous strains recorded suggest a
   perturbation in the footwall to the regional thrust or, perhaps, a
   spatially restricted competency contrast within the stratigraphy, which
   contributed to the localization of the present mineralization during the
   thrusting.}},

Abstract = {{Unexpected severe cholestasis is part of the presentation in some
   neonates with hemolytic anemia but is usually self-resolving. Here we
   report the case of a neonate with pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) who
   presented severe hemolytic anemia at birth, characterized by a rapidly
   progressive and severe cholestasis with normal g-glutamyl transpeptidase
   level associated with hepatic failure. After an extensive investigation
   to rule out contributing conditions explaining the severity of this
   patient's clinical presentation, PKD has remained the sole identified
   etiology. The patient abruptly died of sepsis at 3 months of age before
   a planned splenectomy and ongoing evaluation for liver transplantation.
   To the best of our knowledge, only a few similar cases of severe
   neonatal presentation of PKD complicated with severe hepatic failure and
   cholestasis have been reported.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aim: Drug adherence determines a patient's quality of
   life and delays the development of complications. The study assessed
   perceived family support and other factors that determine medication
   adherence among hypertensive patients in a tertiary hospital. Materials
   and Methods: Descriptive cross-sectional study. Consenting adult
   patients on antihypertensive attending the Medical Outpatient Clinic of
   Federal Medical Centre Owo, Ondo State, Nigeria. Results: Four hundred
   and twenty patients were studied. The mean age of the patients was 60.6
   +/- 11.7 years (range 21-85 years). There were 206 (49\%) males and 214
   (51\%) females. Most respondents were Yoruba (86.2\%), married (76.7\%),
   and had primary education (27.6\%). Most (61\%) were adherent to
   antihypertensive therapy. Common reasons for poor adherence include
   belief of cure (43\%), high cost of treatment (33\%), and the
   experiencing of side effects (27\%). Patients with good family support
   had better adherence compared to those with poor family support (P <
   0.05). Conclusion: Poor family support and other factors were identified
   as causes of poor adherence among these hypertensive patients.
   Strategies targeting these factors will improve drug adherence, thereby
   preventing poor treatment outcomes among these patients.}},

Abstract = {{Trithorax group (TrxG) and Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are two
   mutually antagonistic chromatin modifying complexes, however, how they
   together mediate transcriptional counter-regulation remains unknown.
   Genome-wide analysis revealed that binding of Ezh2 and menin, central
   members of the PcG and TrxG complexes, respectively, were reciprocally
   correlated. Moreover, we identified a developmental change in the
   positioning of Ezh2 and menin in differentiated T lymphocytes compared
   to embryonic stem cells. Ezh2-binding upstream and menin-binding
   downstream of the transcription start site was frequently found at genes
   with higher transcriptional levels, and Ezh2-binding downstream and
   menin-binding upstream was found at genes with lower expression in T
   lymphocytes. Interestingly, of the Ezh2 and menin cooccupied genes,
   those exhibiting occupancy at the same position displayed greatly
   enhanced sensitivity to loss of Ezh2. Finally, we also found that
   different combinations of Ezh2 and menin occupancy were associated with
   expression of specific functional gene groups important for T cell
   development. Therefore, spatial cooperative gene regulation by the PcG
   and TrxG complexes may represent a novel mechanism regulating the
   transcriptional identity of differentiated cells.}},

   complex 2}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{T-cell development is accompanied by epigenetic changes that ensure the
   silencing of stem cell-related genes and the activation of
   lymphocyte-specific programmes. How transcription factors influence
   these changes remains unclear. We show that the Ikaros transcription
   factor forms a complex with Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in
   CD4(-) CD8(-) thymocytes and allows its binding to more than 500
   developmentally regulated loci, including those normally activated in
   haematopoietic stem cells and others induced by the Notch pathway. Loss
   of Ikaros in CD4(-) CD8(-) cells leads to reduced histone H3 lysine 27
   trimethylation and ectopic gene expression. Furthermore, Ikaros binding
   triggers PRC2 recruitment and Ikaros interacts with PRC2 independently
   of the nucleosome remodelling and deacetylation complex. Our results
   identify Ikaros as a fundamental regulator of PRC2 function in
   developing T cells.}},

Title = {{Body size affects individual winter foraging strategies of thick-billed
   murres in the Bering Sea}},

Volume = {{84}},

Abstract = {{Foraging and migration often require different energetic and movement
   strategies. Though not readily apparent, constraints during one phase
   might influence the foraging strategies observed in another. For marine
   birds that fly and dive, body size constraints likely present a
   trade-off between foraging ability and migration as smaller bodies
   reduce flight costs, whereas larger bodies are advantageous for diving
   deeper. This study examines individual wintering strategies of deep
   diving thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) breeding at three colonies in
   the south-eastern Bering Sea: St Paul, St George and Bogoslof. These
   colonies, arranged north to south, are located such that breeding birds
   forage in a gradient from shelf to deep-water habitats. We used
   geolocation time-depth recorders and stable isotopes from feathers to
   determine differences in foraging behaviour and diet of murres during
   three non-breeding periods, 2008-2011. Body size was quantified by a
   principal component analysis (wing, culmen, head+bill and tarsus
   length). A hierarchical cluster analysis identified winter foraging
   strategies based on individual movement, diving behaviour and diet
   (inferred from stable isotopes). Structural body size differed by
   breeding island. Larger birds from St Paul had higher wing loading than
   smaller birds from St George. Larger birds, mainly from St Paul, dove to
   deeper depths, spent more time in the Bering Sea, and likely consumed
   higher trophic-level prey in late winter. Three winter foraging
   strategies were identified. The main strategy, employed by small birds
   from all three breeding colonies in the first 2years, was characterized
   by high residency areas in the North Pacific south of the Aleutians and
   nocturnal diving. In contrast, 31\% of birds from St Paul remained in
   the Bering Sea and foraged mainly during the day, apparently feeding on
   higher trophic-level prey. Throat feather stable isotopes indicated that
   individuals exhibited flexibility in the use of this colony-specific
   foraging strategy. The third strategy only occurred in 2010/2011, when
   birds dove more and deeper, suggesting limited prey resources. Foraging
   strategies partitioned with respect to annual differences, presumably in
   response to shifts in distribution of prey, and were linked to body
   size. The presence of a colony-specific wintering strategy suggests the
   potential for overwinter survival differences between these populations.}},

Abstract = {{Most individuals with an isolated posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)
   injury do not complain of disability even if posterior instability is
   objectively revealed by a static physical examination, such as the
   posterior drawer test. This suggests it is insufficient to only evaluate
   posterior instability under static conditions. Therefore, we have
   investigated the effect of isolated PCL injury on the detailed
   kinematics of the knee in a dynamic environment such as during gait.
   Eight unilateral PCL-deficient males and eight healthy control
   volunteers participated in this study. Isolated PCL injury was diagnosed
   by clinical examination. Stress X-ray imaging showed an average
   side-to-side difference of 12.7 +/- A 3.5 mm. Knee kinematics including
   anteroposterior tibial displacement were analysed during walking using
   the point cluster technique.
   Posterior tibial displacement from initial contact was significantly
   smaller during 9-22 \% of the gait cycle by an average of 0.4 cm in the
   PCL group, compared to controls. In the PCL-deficient knee, the external
   rotational angle increased by an average of 3.3A degrees at the loading
   response during 3-11 \% of the gait cycle and the varus angle from
   initial contact increased by an average of 2.0A degrees during 28-52 \%
   of the gait cycle, compared to controls.
   Dynamic changes in the rotation and posterior translation patterns were
   seen after isolated PCL injury, suggesting the kinematics of
   PCL-deficient knees might be different to normal knees. These factors
   may contribute to long-term osteoarthritic change. Consequently, when
   choosing conservative treatment for PCL injury, these changes should be
   considered to prevent osteoarthritic change.

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine the effect of intravitreal bevacizumab on
   retrobulbar blood flow of patients with diabetic macular edema.
   Methods: Peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, resistance, and
   pulsatility indices of central retinal artery (CRA), nasal posterior
   ciliary artery (NPCA), temporal posterior ciliary artery (TPCA), and
   ophthalmic artery (OA) were assessed by color Doppler ultrasonography in

   Results: At day 1 after the injection, peak systolic and end diastolic
   velocities of the CRA and NPCA in the injected eyes and peak systolic
   velocity of NPCA in the uninjected eyes decreased significantly (p<0.05,
   p = 0.025, respectively). Peak systolic and end diastolic velocities
   were not significantly different in the injected and uninjected eyes at
   day 7 after the injection (p>0.05). In the injected eyes, there was no

Journal = {{SYSTEMS \& CONTROL LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{84-94}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A novel approach to the problem of partial state estimation of nonlinear
   systems is proposed. The main idea is to translate the state estimation
   problem into one of estimation of constant, unknown parameters related
   to the systems initial conditions. The class of systems for which the
   method is applicable is identified via two assumptions related to the
   transformability of the system into a suitable cascaded form and our
   ability to estimate the unknown parameters. The first condition involves
   the solvability of a partial differential equation while the second one
   requires some persistency of excitation-like conditions. The proposed
   observer is shown to be applicable to position estimation of a class of
   electromechanical systems, for the reconstruction of the state of power
   converters and for speed observation of a class of mechanical systems.

Abstract = {{Viruses package their genome in a robust protein coat to protect it

   uncoating, the virus is progressively weakened during entry into cells.
   At the end of the uncoating process the genome separates, becomes
   transcriptionally active, and initiates the production of progeny. Here,
   we triggered the disruption of single human adenovirus capsids with
   atomic force microscopy and followed genome exposure by single-molecule
   fluorescence microscopy. This method allowed the comparison of immature
   (noninfectious) and mature (infectious) adenovirus particles. We
   observed two condensation states of the fluorescently labeled genome, a
   feature of the virus that may be related to infectivity. Beyond tracking
   the unpacking of virus genomes, this approach may find application in
   testing the cargo release of bioinspired delivery vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{Phage shock protein A (PspA) belongs to the highy conserved PspA/IM30
   family and is a key component of the stress inducible Psp system in
   Escherichia coli. One of its central roles is the regulatory interaction
   with the transcriptional activator of this system, the sigma(54)
   enhancer-binding protein PspF, a member of the AAA+ protein family. The
   PspA/F regulatory system has been intensively studied and serves as a
   paradigm for AAA+ enzyme regulation by trans-acting factors. However,
   the molecular mechanism of how exactly PspA controls the activity of
   PspF and hence sigma(54)-dependent expression of the psp genes is still
   unclear. To approach this question, we identified the minimal
   PspF-interacting domain of PspA, solved its structure, determined its
   affinity to PspF and the dissociation kinetics, identified residues that
   are potentially important for PspF regulation and analyzed effects of
   their mutation on PspFin vivo and in vitro. Our data indicate that
   several characteristics of AAA+ regulation in the PspA<bold>F complex
   resemble those of the AAA</bold>+ unfoldase ClpB, with both proteins
   being regulated by a structurally highly conserved coiled-coil domain.
   The convergent evolution of both regulatory domains points to a general
   mechanism to control AAA+ activity for divergent physiologic tasks via
   coiled-coil domains.}},

Abstract = {{In the decades around Australian Federation in 1901, a number of Pacific
   Islanders gained prominence in aquatic sport on the beaches and in the
   pools of Sydney in particular. Two swimmers, brothers Alick and Edward
   (Ted) Wickham from the Solomon Islands, were especially prominerit. This
   article examines racial constructions of these athletes by the
   Australian press. Given the existence of well-entrenched negative racial
   stereotypes about Pacific Islanders, and legislative manifestations of
   the White Australia policy that sought to deport and exclude Islanders,
   racially negative portrayals of the Wickhams might have been expected in
   the press. Instead, newspapers constructed these men in largely positive
   terms, idealising the supposedly natural ability of Islanders in water
   and reifying an aquatic Nimble Savage stereotype. While largely
   contained to a few individuals, this nonetheless powerful press
   construction presented an alternative perspective to the prevailing
   negative stereotypes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a methodology that allows high-resolution traffic
   and emissions models, known as microscopic simulation models, to be
   efficiently used to address transportation optimization problems that
   account for complex environmental metrics. The methodology consists of a
   metamodel simulation-based optimization (SO) approach. The metamodel
   combines traffic and emissions information from high-resolution
   microscopic simulators with information from lower-resolution analytical
   macroscopic models.
   This paper formulates and uses an analytical and differentiable
   macroscopic approximation of the non-differentiable simulation-based
   microscopic emissions model. A differentiable macroscopic traffic model
   is also used. This paper shows that the analytical structural
   information provided by macroscopic analytical emissions models can
   contribute, despite their lower-resolution, to enhance the computational
   efficiency of algorithms that embed higher-resolution inefficient
   emissions models. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient,
   i.e., it can identify points with improved performance within few
   simulation runs. More generally, the results of this paper highlight the
   added value of embedding analytical structural information within SO
   algorithms to address complex SO problems.
   A traffic signal control case study is carried out. The proposed
   metamodel identifies signal plans that improve travel time and various
   emissions metrics. We present the corresponding monetary savings that
   can be achieved.
   This optimization framework enables practitioners to use high-resolution
   microscopic traffic and emissions models to systematically design
   transportation schemes that account directly, in the design process, for
   environmental metrics. Hence, the use of such high-resolution models is
   no longer limited to the environmental evaluation of a small set of
   predetermined schemes. The tight computational budgets used in this
   paper show that such complex problems can be addressed in a
   computationally efficient manner. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   similar size dependence to the reported scaled planar Tr. In addition,
   RTN after hot-carrier injection (HCI) and negative bias stress (NBS) is

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach to solve the unit commitment problem
   using a newly developed Multi-agent Evolutionary Programming
   incorporating Priority List optimisation technique (MAEP-PL). The
   objective of this study is to search for generation scheduling such that
   the total operating cost can be minimised when subjected to a variety of
   constraints, while at the same time reducing its computational time. The
   proposed technique assimilates the concepts of Priority Listing (PL),
   Multi-agent System (MAS) and Evolutionary Programming (EP) as its basis.
   In the proposed technique, deterministic PL technique is applied to
   produce a population of initial solutions. The search process is refined
   using heuristic EP-based algorithm with multi-agent approach to produce
   the final solution. The developed technique is tested on ten generating
   units test system for a 24-h scheduling period, and the results are
   compared with the standard Evolutionary Programming (EP), Evolutionary
   Programming with Priority Listing (EP-PL) and Multi-agent Evolutionary
   Programming (MAEP) optimisation techniques. From the obtained results
   and the comparative studies, it was found that the proposed MAEP-PL
   optimisation technique is able to solve the unit commitment problem
   where the total daily generation cost is effectively minimised and the
   computation time is reduced as compared to other techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The treatment protocol form defines all health care and treatments that
   are free of charge for patients living with a long-term disease in
   France. It is designed to facilitate the medical care of these patients.
   The way in which it is written impact on access and adequacy of health
   care. AIDES, a French HIV/AIDS/Hepatitis association, reported
   disparities and shortcomings in the use of this protocol. A survey was
   conducted among people attending this association in order to
   objectively demonstrate field observations. This article presents the
   results of this investigation designed to determine the level of
   knowledge of the people living with HIV and/or hepatitis in contact with
   the association regarding the use of this protocol. 224 people completed
   the questionnaire. The results confirm field observations: the
   appropriation of the treatment protocol by patients who participated in
   this survey remains limited, even within a study population in contact
   with a patient association. These findings raise the question of the
   effectiveness of the communication between health care
   practitioners/caregivers and patients concerning the use of this tool.
   More widely, the protocol drafting process needs to be reviewed: what
   are the respective places and roles for health stakeholders? What form
   of coordination between the patient, the general practitioner and the
   Health Insurance is required to establish an appropriate and
   appropriable treatment protocol?}},

Abstract = {{Advanced sensing techniques are key technologies required for the smart

   distributed linear current sensing, with small size, low price, and
   excellent performances. In this paper, MTJ Wheatstone bridge sensors
   were fabricated, attaining a typical sensitivity of 4.94 mV/V/Oe with an
   offset of -2.84 mV/V. A contactless current sensor based on the MTJ
   sensor was designed and realized, achieving a sensitivity of 7.75 mV/A
   and an offset of -8.68 mV. We can adjust the sensitivity and the linear
   range of the sensor by changing the gap of the magnetic core, and make
   the sensor much less susceptible to electrical wire's location and
   orientation. This paper provides a practical current sensing technique
   for smart grid applications.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background It is not known whether common carotid intima media thickness
   (CIMT) can serve as a surrogate marker of cardiovascular risk among
   black Africans. Therefore, we examined whether CIMT differed
   significantly among individuals with distinct cardiovascular phenotype
   and correlated significantly with traditional cardiovascular risk
   factors in a black African population.
   Methods CIMT was measured in 456 subjects with three distinct
   cardiovascular phenotypes - 175 consecutive Nigerian African stroke
   patients, 161 hypertensive patients without stroke and 120 normotensive
   non-smoking adults. For each pair of cardiovascular phenotypes,
   c-statistics were obtained for CIMT and traditional vascular risk
   factors (including age, gender, weight, waist circumference, smoking,
   alcohol, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, fasting plasma glucose,
   fasting total cholesterol). Pearson's correlation coefficients were
   calculated to quantify bivariate relationships.
   Findings Bilaterally, CIMT was significantly different among the three
   cardiovascular phenotypes (right: p<0.001, F=33.8; left: p<0.001,
   F=48.6). CIMT had a higher c-statistic for differentiating stroke versus
   normotension (c=0.78 right; 0.82 left, p<0.001) and hypertension versus
   normotension (c=0.65 right; 0.71 left, p<0.001) than several traditional
   vascular risk factors. Bilaterally, combining all subjects, CIMT was the
   only factor that correlated significantly (right: 0.12r0.41,
   0.018p<0.0001; left: 0.18r0.41, 0.005p<0.0001) to all the traditional
   cardiovascular risk factors assessed.
   Conclusion Our findings support CIMT as a significant indicator of both
   cardiovascular risk and phenotype among adult black Africans. However,
   specific thresholds need to be defined based on prospective studies.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes a set of real-time interactive experiments that
   address system identification and model reference adaptive control
   (MRAC) techniques. In constructing laboratory experiments that
   contribute to efficient teaching, experimental design and instructional
   strategy are crucial, but a process for doing this has yet to be
   defined. This paper is an attempt towards filling this gap. Its
   contributions are: 1) to describe a sample set of experiments for both
   senior undergraduate-and graduate-level students, to strengthen their
   understanding of system identification and control; 2) to help
   instructors wishing to set up a laboratory with an interactive learning
   strategy; and 3) to propose a set of assessment criteria for engineering
   accreditation in system identification and control laboratories. A
   benefit of this paper for engineering educators is that it provides a
   roadmap for transferring complex theory problems into prototypes in the
   laboratory. Furthermore, the instructional strategies proposed can
   easily be adapted to other engineering courses.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study tested the milk flow rates and variability in flow
   of currently available nipples used for bottle-feeding infants who are
   hospitalized.
   Method: Clinicians in 3 countries were surveyed regarding nipples
   available to them for feeding infants who are hospitalized. Twenty-nine
   nipple types were identified, and 10 nipples of each type were tested by
   measuring the amount of infant formula expressed in 1 min using a breast
   pump. Mean milk flow rate (mL/min) and coefficient of variation were
   used to compare nipples within brand and within category (i.e., Slow,
   Standard, Premature).
   Results: Flow rates varied widely between nipples, ranging from 2.10
   mL/min for the Enfamil Cross-Cut to 85.34 mL/min for the Dr. Brown's
   Y-Cut Standard Neck. Variability of flow rates among nipples of the same
   type ranged from a coefficient of variation of 0.05 for Dr. Brown's
   Level 1 Standard-and Wide-Neck to 0.42 for the Enfamil CrossCut. Mean
   coefficient of variation by brand ranged from 0.08 for Dr. Brown's to
   0.36 for Bionix.
   Conclusions: Milk flow is an easily manipulated variable that may
   contribute to the degree of physiologic instability experienced by
   infants who are medically fragile during oral feeding. This study
   provides clinicians with information to guide appropriate selection of
   bottle nipples for feeding infants who are hospitalized.}},

Abstract = {{Verbs in San Pedro Amuzgo, an Oto-Manguean language of Mexico, often
   have two different stems in the paradigm, one used with singular
   subjects and the other with plural subjects. This split motivated by
   number is typologically interesting due to its rarity, since number
   splits are commonly along the S/O vs. A distinction, not the S/A vs. O
   distinction. Apart from at stem level, the split is also manifested in
   the incompletive of an inflectional class of verbs. At stem level the
   plural stem is derived in a variety of unproductive ways, making the
   relation between singular and plural stems, synchronically, one of
   suppletion. In this article, we study the distribution and the
   morphological properties of this split in depth, using a sample of
   almost 600 fully inflected verbs from a large database compiled by
   native linguist Fermin Tapia and now publicly accessible on the Surrey
   Morphology Group's website. We also place it in a typological context,
   relating it to other systems we have observed.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical resistance, , and thermal expansion coefficient, , of
   nickel and ARMCO iron have been simultaneously measured over a wide
   temperature range from (300 to 1100) K. The well-known standard
   four-probe potentiometric method was used for measurements of the
   electrical resistance. The thermal expansion coefficient was measured
   using the quartz dilatometer technique. Both techniques were combined in
   the same apparatus for simultaneous measurements of the electrical
   resistance and TEC for the same specimen. The combined expanded
   uncertainty of the electrical resistance and thermal expansion
   coefficient measurements at the 95 \% confidence level with a coverage
   factor of is estimated to be 0.5 \% and (1.5 to 4.0) \%, respectively.
   The distinct scattering contribution (phonon , magnetic , and residual )
   terms were separated and extracted from the measured total resistivity.
   The physical nature and details of the temperature dependence of the
   electrical resistance of solid materials and correct estimations of the
   contributions of various scattering mechanisms to the measured total
   resistivity were discussed in terms of the anharmonic effect. We
   experimentally found simple, universal, physically based, semiempirical
   linear correlations between the kinetic coefficient (electrical
   resistance) and a thermodynamic (equilibrium) property, the thermal
   expansion coefficient, of solid materials. The developed, physically
   based, correlation model has been successfully applied for nanoscale
   materials (ferromagnetic nickel nanowire). A new s-d-exchange
   interaction energy determination technique has been proposed.}},

   randomized controlled trial}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{44-52}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{There is a paucity of evidence on the heterogeneous impacts of financial
   incentives on weight loss. Between March 2010 and January 2012, in a
   randomized controlled trial, we assigned 700 obese persons to three
   experimental arms. We test whether particular subgroups react
   differently to financial incentives for weight loss. Two treatment
   groups obtained a cash reward ((sic)150 and (sic)300 with 237 and 229
   participants, respectively) for achieving an individually-assigned
   target weight within four months; the control group (234 participants)
   was not incentivized. Participants and administrators were not blinded
   to the intervention. We find that monetary rewards effectively induced
   obese individuals to reduce weight across all subgroups. However, there
   is no evidence for treatment-effect heterogeneity for those groups that
   were incentivized. Among those who were in the (sic)300 group,
   statistically significant and large weight losses were observed for
   women, singles, and those who are not working (all above 4 kg in four
   months). In addition, the magnitude of the reward matters only for women
   and migrants. The effectiveness of financial incentives to reduce weight
   nevertheless raises sensitive ethical issues that should be taken into
   consideration by policymakers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Fine-grained sedimentary deposits on planetary surfaces require
   quantitative assessment of mineral abundances in order to better
   understand the environments in which they formed. One way that planetary
   surface mineralogy is commonly assessed is through thermal emission
   (similar to 6-50 mu m) spectroscopy. To that end, we characterized the
   TIR spectral properties of compacted, very fine-grained mineral mixtures
   of oligoclase, augite, calcite, montmorillonite, and gypsum. Nonnegative
   linear least squares minimization (NNLS) is used to assess the linearity
   of spectral combination. A partial least squares (PLS) method is also
   applied to emission spectra of fine-grained synthetic mixtures and
   natural mudstones to assess its applicability to fine-grained rocks. The
   NNLS modeled abundances for all five minerals investigated are within
   similar to 10\% of the known abundances for 39\% of the mixtures,
   showing the relationships between known and modeled abundance follow
   nonlinear curves. The poor performance of NNLS is due to photon
   transmission through small grains over portions of the wavelength range
   andmultiple reflections in the volume. The PLSmethod was able to
   accurately recover the known abundances (to within similar to 10\%) for
   78-90\% of synthetic mixtures and for 85\% of the mudstone samples
   chosen for this study. The excellent agreement between known and modeled
   abundances is likely due to high absorption coefficients over portions
   of the thermal infrared (TIR) spectral range, and thus, combinations are
   linear over portions of the range. PLS can be used to recover abundances
   from very fine-grained rocks from TIR measurements and could potentially
   be applied to landed or orbital TIR observations.}},

Abstract = {{CouR from Rhodopseudomonas palustris is a member of the MarR
   transcriptional regulator family. It regulates the expression of CouA
   and CouB, enzymes that are involved in the degradation of p-coumarate.
   In vivo, CouR binds to a DNA fragment containing the couAB promoter and
   suppresses the expression of CouA and CouB, while binding of
   p-coumaroyl-CoA attenuates its affinity towards DNA and activates the
   expression of CouA and CouB. Here, the crystallization and X-ray
   diffraction analyses of CouR alone and in complex with p-coumaroyl-CoA
   are reported. Apo and ligand-complexed CouR crystals diffracted to 2.5
   and 3.3 angstrom resolution, respectively. The crystals of apo CouR
   belonged to space group P22(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 62.78,
   b = 76.15, c = 87.38 angstrom, whereas the crystals of the CouR-ligand
   complex belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters
   a = 61.37, b = 69.82, c = 70.32 angstrom. The crystals were predicted to
   contain two CouR molecules or CouR-ligand complexes per asymmetric unit.}},

Abstract = {{The operational monitoring of radiation conditions in different orbits
   in near-Earth space is crucial for ensuring the radiation safety of
   space flights. The intensity of ionizing radiation fluxes in near-Earth
   space varies within several orders of magnitude. Therefore, existing
   averaged empirical models cannot always be used to estimate specific
   radiation conditions in orbits. The forecast of solar cosmic rays is
   even less reliable. This paper presents a version of the global system
   of radiation monitoring in near-Earth space based on the system of
   multiple small satellites. The considered system of satellites with
   identical radiometric equipment will provide operational information on
   the fluxes of electrons and protons of Earth radiation belts and solar
   cosmic rays, which will make it possible to create 3D pictures of the
   distribution of particle fluxes in real time.}},

Title = {{Labile substrate availability controls temperature sensitivity of
   organic carbon decomposition at different soil depths}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{85-98}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) is intrinsically
   sensitive to temperature. However, the degree to which the temperature
   sensitivity of SOC decomposition (as often measured in Q(10) value)
   varies with soil depth and labile substrate availability remain unclear.
   This study explores (1) how the Q(10) of SOC decomposition changes with
   increasing soil depth, and (2) how increasing labile substrate
   availability affects the Q(10) at different soil depths. We measured
   soil CO2 production at four temperatures (6, 14, 22 and 30 A degrees C)
   using an infrared CO2 analyzer. Treatments included four soil depths
   (0-20, 20-40, 40-60 and 60-80 cm), four sites (farm, redwood forest,
   ungrazed and grazed grassland), and two levels of labile substrate
   availability (ambient and saturated by adding glucose solution). We
   found that Q(10) values at ambient substrate availability decreased with
   increasing soil depth, from 2.0-2.4 in 0-20 cm to 1.5-1.8 in 60-80 cm.
   Moreover, saturated labile substrate availability led to higher Q(10) in
   most soil layers, and the increase in Q(10) due to labile substrate
   addition was larger in subsurface soils (20-80 cm) than in surface soils
   (0-20 cm). Further analysis showed that microbial biomass carbon (MBC)
   and SOC best explained the variation in Q(10) at ambient substrate
   availability across ecosystems and depths (R-2 = 0.37, P < 0.001), and
   MBC best explained the variation in the change of Q(10) between control
   and glucose addition treatment (R-2 = 0.14, P = 0.003). Overall, these
   results indicate that labile substrate limitation of the temperature
   sensitivity of SOC decomposition, as previously shown in surface soils,
   is even stronger for subsoils. Understanding processes controlling the
   labile substrate availability (e.g., with rising atmospheric CO2
   concentration and land use change) should advance our prediction of the
   fate of subsoil SOC in a warmer world.}},

Abstract = {{Smoking cessation is one of the most powerful preventive interventions
   available to primary care providers. Rates of tobacco treatment delivery
   in primary care settings, however, remain sub-optimal. This paper
   reports on rationale, design, and protocol for a matched-paired,
   cluster-randomized controlled trial to compare the incremental
   effectiveness of performance coaching on physician delivery of smoking
   cessation assistance when delivered as part of a practice-level
   intervention for smoking cessation (the Ottawa Model for Smoking
   Cessation; OMSC). Outcome measures included frequency of provider
   smoking cessation treatment delivery, patient quit attempts, and 7-day
   point prevalence abstinence measured at 6 months, and changes in
   provider attitudes and beliefs related to smoking cessation treatment
   delivery. Primary care clinics were randomly assigned, using a matched
   paired design, to one of two treatment conditions: OMSC Group or OMSC +
   Performance Coaching Group. All practices were supported with
   implementing the OMSC. Half of the practices also received a 1.5 hour,
   skills-based, coaching session to address barriers encountered in the
   delivery of smoking cessation treatments and individualized performance
   feedback reports. All providers, and a cross sectional sample of
   patients from their practices, were surveyed before and after the
   implementation of the intervention. Multi-level modeling was used to
   compare intervention groups. If shown to be effective, the study will
   lead to an improved understanding of how to best assist clinicians to
   enhance the delivery of smoking cessation practice and will provide
   evidence to guide the design of smoking cessation interventions in
   primary care. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:

Abstract = {{We develop Bayesian non-parametric models for spatially indexed data of
   mixed type. Our work is motivated by challenges that occur in
   environmental epidemiology, where the usual presence of several
   confounding variables that exhibit complex interactions and high
   correlations makes it difficult to estimate and understand the effects
   of risk factors on health outcomes of interest. The modelling approach
   that we adopt assumes that responses and confounding variables are
   manifestations of continuous latent variables and uses multivariate
   Gaussian distributions to model these jointly. Responses and confounding
   variables are not treated equally as relevant parameters of the
   distributions of the responses only are modelled in terms of explanatory
   variables or risk factors. Spatial dependence is introduced by allowing
   the weights of the non-parametric process priors to be location
   specific, obtained as probit transformations of Gaussian Markov random
   fields. Confounding variables and spatial configuration have a similar
   role in the model, in that they influence, along with the responses,
   only the allocation probabilities of the areas into the mixture
   components, thereby allowing for flexible adjustment of the effects of
   observed confounders, while allowing for the possibility of residual
   spatial structure, possibly occurring because of unmeasured or
   undiscovered spatially varying factors. Aspects of the model are
   illustrated in simulation studies and an application to a real data set.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) often
   report poor sleep, increased daytime sleepiness, and fatigue. The
   purpose of this study was to identify respiratory patterns over the
   spectrum of disease severity in children with CF. The overall hypothesis
   for the current study is that children with CF compared with snoring
   control subjects demonstrate gas exchange abnormalities and increased
   respiratory loads during sleep that are not reported or recognized by
   conventional polysomnography (PSG).
   METHODS: Analysis of breathing patterns and gas exchange on PSG was
   performed in children with CF and healthy controls matched by age and
   BMI. For all CF and control subjects, the indication for PSG was
   evaluation for obstructive sleep apnea based on a history of snoring.
   RESULTS: Children with CF, compared with age-and BMI-matched snoring
   controls, demonstrated lower oxyhemoglobin saturation (95\% +/- 1.6\% vs
   98\% +/- 0.6\%, P = .005), higher respiratory rate (19.5 +/- 4.9 vs 16.5
   +/- 1.2 breaths per minute, P = .03), and a higher proportion of
   inspiratory flow limitation (44.1\% +/- 24.7\% vs 12.1\% +/- 13.5\%, P =
   .007) during non-rapid eye movement sleep. The respiratory disturbance
   index did not differ between CF and snoring control groups (1.5 +/- 2.7
   vs 0.6 +/- 0.6 events per hour, P = .11).
   CONCLUSIONS: Children with CF exhibited abnormalities in gas exchange
   and increased respiratory load during sleep compared with normal age-and
   BMI-matched snoring controls. Because these abnormalities were
   independent of weight and lung function, sleep state may serve as an
   opportunity for early detection of breathing abnormalities and possibly
   CF lung disease progression.}},

Title = {{Modeling weakly-ionized plasmas in magnetic field: A new
   computationally-efficient approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{300}},
Pages = {{779-799}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Despite its success at simulating accurately both non-neutral and
   quasi-neutral weakly-ionized plasmas, the drift-diffusion model has been
   observed to be a particularly stiff set of equations. Recently, it was
   demonstrated that the stiffness of the system could be relieved by
   rewriting the equations such that the potential is obtained from Ohm's
   law rather than Gauss's law while adding some source terms to the ion
   transport equation to ensure that Gauss's law is satisfied in
   non-neutral regions. Although the latter was applicable to
   multicomponent and multidimensional plasmas, it could not be used for
   plasmas in which the magnetic field was significant. This paper hence
   proposes a new computationally-efficient set of electron and ion
   transport equations that can be used not only for a plasma with multiple
   types of positive and negative ions, but also for a plasma in magnetic
   field. Because the proposed set of equations is obtained from the same
   physical model as the conventional drift-diffusion equations without
   introducing new assumptions or simplifications, it results in the same
   exact solution when the grid is refined sufficiently while being more
   computationally efficient: not only is the proposed approach
   considerably less stiff and hence requires fewer iterations to reach
   convergence but it yields a converged solution that exhibits a
   significantly higher resolution. The combined faster convergence and
   higher resolution is shown to result in a hundredfold increase in
   computational efficiency for some typical steady and unsteady plasma
   problems including non-neutral cathode and anode sheaths as well as
   quasi-neutral regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Grounding systems (GSs) must be tested periodically in order to maintain
   the touch voltage (TV) and step voltage (SV) below a safe value in all
   of the zones of the installation. Measurements of the ground resistance
   and of the TV and SV are typically done by the fall-of-potential (FoP)
   method, locating the auxiliary current electrode at remote distance to
   test the effective behavior of the GS. In urban areas, it could be very
   complicated or impossible to install the auxiliary current electrode as
   required, not having area around with sufficient accessibility. At this
   aim, this paper describes a methodology of using multiple current
   electrodes at short distances, modifying the classic FoP practice, so
   that the measurements of TV and SV are always conservative. The adequacy
   of a GS is verified if the values of the TV and SV, tested inside and in
   the vicinity of the GS, are below the permissible limits, regardless if
   they are true or conservatively increased. Thus, the measured TV and SV
   by the suggested method, always conservative, allow verifying the
   adequacy of GSs, in the cases where it is impossible to locate the
   remote auxiliary electrode.}},

Abstract = {{A narrow-width power-invariant inductive power transfer system (IPTS)
   along the driving direction is newly proposed in this paper. The
   conventional I-type power supply rail for on-line electric vehicles
   (OLEVs) has a very narrow power supply rail with 10-cm width and exposes
   pedestrians to a very low electromagnetic field due to its alternatively
   arranged magnetic poles along the driving direction of electric
   vehicles; however, it has a major drawback: Sinusoidal variation of the
   induced pick-up voltage depending on pick-up positions on the power
   supply rail along driving direction. To overcome this disadvantage, a
   dq-power supply rail fed by two high-frequency ac currents of the
   d-phase and q-phase is introduced in this paper. The d-phase and q-phase
   magnetic poles are alternatively arranged in a line; hence, the induced
   voltage of a pickup becomes spatially uniform. The power invariant
   characteristic of the proposed IPTS for OLEV has been verified by
   analysis, simulations, and experiments. A practical winding method is
   suggested as well.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Purpose: We compared the costal cartilage and rib length
   between prepubertal patients with symmetric pectus excavatum and age-
   and sex-matched controls without anterior chest wall depression to
   evaluate if rib overgrowth is a contributing factor for pectus excavatum
   Methods: The sample included 18 prepubertal patients < 10 years old with
   symmetric pectus excavatum and 18 age-and sex-matched controls without
   chest wall deformity. The full lengths of the fourth to sixth ribs and
   costal cartilage were measured using three-dimensional volume-rendered
   computed tomography and curved multiplanar reformatting techniques. The
   rib and costal cartilage lengths, total combined rib and costal
   cartilage length, and costal index ({[}length of cartilage/length of
   rib] x 100 {[}\%]) at the fourth to sixth levels were compared between
   the groups.
   Results: The rib lengths in the patient group were significantly longer
   than in the control group for the 6th right rib and 4th, 5th, and 6th
   left ribs. The costal cartilage lengths and costal indices were not
   different between two groups.
   Conclusions: In patients with symmetric pectus excavatum aged < 10 years
   old, several of the ribs were longer than those of controls, suggesting
   that abnormal rib overgrowth may be a contributing factor responsible
   for pectus excavatum rather than cartilage overgrowth. (c) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an effective framework for sports scene
   classification by using a Hybrid Bags-of-Feature model. The
   Bag-of-Feature (BoF) model is a methodology which represents an image
   based on the histogram of visual codewords. With its successful
   performance, the BoF model has been widely exploited in computer vision
   such as scene classification and object recognition. Unlike traditional
   BoF models which resort to a single feature descriptor such as SIFT and
   thus exploit a single codebook, the proposed Hybrid BoF model employs
   two different types of codebooks; SIFT feature and modified LBP feature.
   The LBP descriptor is capable of capturing micro patterns of the image,
   hence it is suitable for texture classification. In contrast, Gradient
   based feature descriptors such as SIFT have been proven to be effective
   for object recognition. More specifically, foreground objects (or
   regions containing distinct silhouettes) are encoded based on the SIFT

Abstract = {{Red blood cells (RBCs) from the cord blood of newborn infants have
   distinctive functions in fetal and infant development. To systematically
   investigate the biophysical characteristics of individual cord RBCs in
   newborn infants, a comparative study was performed on RBCs from the cord
   blood of newborn infants and from adult mothers or nonpregnant women
   using optical holographic microtomography. Optical measurements of the
   distributions of the three-dimensional refractive indices and the
   dynamic membrane fluctuations of individual RBCs were used to
   investigate the morphological, biochemical, and mechanical properties of
   cord, maternal, and adult RBCs at the individual cell level. The volume
   and surface area of the cord RBCs were significantly larger than those
   of the RBCs from nonpregnant women, and the cord RBCs had more flattened
   shapes than that of the RBCs in adults. In addition, the hemoglobin (Hb)
   content in the cord RBCs from newborns was significantly higher. The Hb
   concentration in the cord RBCs was higher than that in the nonpregnant
   women or maternal RBCs, but they were within the physiological range of
   adults. Interestingly, the amplitudes of the dynamic membrane
   fluctuations in cord RBCs were comparable to those in nonpregnant women
   and maternal RBCs, suggesting that the deformability of cord RBCs is
   similar to that of healthy RBCs in adults. (C) 2015 Society of

Abstract = {{The conductive polymer composites have attracted considerable attention
   in the field of industry due to their electrical properties. To
   understand electrical properties of the composites, their volume
   specific resistance was measured. Electrical conductivity results showed
   percolation phenomena. Percolation theories are frequently applied to
   describe the insulator-to-conductor transitions in the composites
   composed of conductive filler and insulating matrix. It was found that
   percolation threshold strongly depends on the aspect ratio of filler
   particles. The critical concentration of percolation formed is defined
   as the percolation threshold. The purpose of this study was to examine
   electrical properties of the resins filled with zinc. The sample was
   prepared using vehicle such as epoxy resin replenished with zinc powder,
   and the evaluation on their practical use was performed in order to
   apply them to electric and electronic industry as well as general field.
   The volume specific resistance of epoxy resin composites was
   8.8x10(6)similar to 4.4x10(3) Omega.cm when using zinc powder. Weight
   loss of the conductive composites took place at 400 similar to 470

Abstract = {{There is an increasing concern about transient errors in deep submicron
   processor architectures. Software-only error detection approaches that
   exploit program invariants for silent error detection incur large
   execution overheads and are unreliable as state can be corrupted after
   invariant checkpoints. In this article, we explore the use of
   configurable hardware structures for the continuous evaluation of
   high-level program invariants at the assembly level. We evaluate the
   resource requirements and performance of the proposed
   predicate-evaluation hardware structures when integrated with a 32-bit
   MIPS soft core on a contemporary reconfigurable hardware device. The
   results, for a small set of kernel codes, reveal that these hardware
   structures require a very small number of hardware resources with
   negligible impact on the processor core that they are integrated in.
   Moreover, the amount of resources is fairly insensitive to the
   complexity of the invariants, thus making the proposed structures an
   attractive alternative to software-only predicate checking.}},

Abstract = {{Interpersonal attraction may be shaped by (a) one's psychological
   distance from a target (the subjective experience that a target is close
   to or far from the self) and (b) the perceived standing of a target on a
   trait relative to the self (as better or worse than the self). We
   propose that when evaluating a psychologically distant target,
   individuals may rely on abstract schemas (e.g., the desirability of a
   partner's traits) and prefer targets who possess more (vs. less)
   desirable qualities than themselves. However, when evaluating
   psychologically near targets, concrete contextual details of the
   environment (e.g., how a target's behavior affects self-evaluations in
   the moment) may determine individuals' attraction toward targets. Six
   studies revealed that when evaluating psychologically distant targets,
   men showed greater attraction toward women who displayed more (vs. less)
   intelligence than themselves. In contrast, when targets were
   psychologically near, men showed less attraction toward women who
   outsmarted them.}},

Abstract = {{BCS1L gene encodes mitochondrial protein and is a member of conserved
   AAA protein family. This gene is involved in the incorporation of Rieske
   FeS and Qcr10p into complex III of respiratory chain. In our previous
   study, AluYRa2-derived alternative transcript in rhesus monkey genome
   was identified. However, this transcript has not been reported in human
   genome. In present study, we conducted evolutionary analysis of
   AluYRa2-exonized transcript with various primate genomic DNAs and cDNAs
   from humans, rhesus monkeys, and crabeating monkeys. Remarkably, our
   results show that AluYRa2 element has only been integrated into genomes
   of Macaca species. This Macaca lineage-specific integration of AluYRa2
   element led to exonization event in the first intron region of BCS1L
   gene by producing a conserved 3' splice site. Intriguingly, in rhesus
   and crabeating monkeys, more diverse transcript variants by alternative
   splicing (AS) events, including exon skipping and different 5' splice
   sites from humans, were identified. Alignment of amino acid sequences
   revealed that AluYRa2-exonized transcript has short N-terminal peptides.
   Therefore, AS events play a major role in the generation of various
   transcripts and proteins during primate evolution. In particular,
   lineage-specific integration of Alu elements and species-specific
   Alu-derived exonization events could be important sources of gene
   diversification in primates.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the entry zone of iliac screw fixation to maintain proper
   entry width and screw length.
   Computed tomography images of pelvic bones from 90 human cadavers were
   reconstructed into 3-dimensional models. In each model, a sectional
   image crossing the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) and anterior
   inferior iliac spine (AIIS) and consecutive sectional images up to 20 mm
   superiorly and inferiorly from the PSIS with 1-mm intervals aiming the
   AIIS were obtained. One virtual iliac screw with 10-mm diameter was
   introduced onto the PSIS at the middle and at the lateral and medial 1/4
   points on the prominence of the posterior iliac spine. The entry width
   of the bony prominence and the corresponding maximal screw length
   available were evaluated for each entry point.
   The entry width was smallest on the inferior 20 mm (4.7 +/- A 3.0 mm)
   and gradually increased up to the superior 10 mm (19.1 +/- A 3.9 mm)
   sectional images. The maximal screw length was smallest on the superior
   20 mm (76.7 +/- A 39.7 mm) and gradually increased down to the inferior
   10 mm (112.3 +/- A 15.1 mm) sectional images. The maximal screw lengths
   were significantly greatest at the most medial point and smallest at the
   most lateral point on the superior 20- and 10-mm sectional images and at
   the PSIS.
   The iliac screw fixation entry zone to maintain proper screw length and
   entry width is outlined from 20 mm superiorly to 10 mm inferiorly from
   the PSIS and is located more medially from the prominence of the
   posterior iliac spine.}},

   functionalization. In addition, isothermal rheology measurements
   revealed that the DGEBF/dodecyl amine-functionalized MWCNT (D-MWCNT)
   composite had a longer gel time and higher activation energy of
   cross-linking than the DGEBF/acid-treated MWCNT (A-MWCNT) composite. The
   fracture toughness of the former was also significantly higher than that
   of the latter; this resulted from the relatively high dispersion
   stability of the D-MWCNTs in the epoxy matrix, owing to the presence of
   alkyl groups on the D-MWCNT surface. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 55:2676-2682,

Abstract = {{Objective: The nutritional status of patients with amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis (ALS) has been shown to be associated with mortality. However,
   there have not been, to our knowledge, any studies on the association
   between nutritional status and disease severity. The present study
   investigated the hypothesis that nutritional status was negatively
   associated with disease severity using the ALS functional rating scale
   (ALSFRS-R).
   Methods: One hundred ninety-three Korean ALS patients were divided into
   tertiles based on their ALSFRS-R score. Dietary intake was measured
   using 24 h recall and nutritional status was determined by body mass
   index (BMI) and geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI).
   Results: BMI and GNRI were significantly lower in patients in the lowest
   tertile of ALSFRS-R. BMI and GNRI also correlated with ALSFRS-R score,
   bulbar score, albumin levels, total lymphocyte count, and total daily
   energy expenditure. Intakes of energy and most nutrients were
   significantly lower in patients in the lowest tertiles of ALSFRS-R, but
   significances disappeared after adjusting for energy intake. Intakes of
   vegetables, grains, seasonings, and oils were also significantly lower
   in patients in the lowest tertile of ALSFRS-R. In addition, patients in
   the lowest tertile of ALSFRS-R were significantly younger at disease
   onset, had a longer duration of ALS, less regular exercise, and less sun
   exposure.
   Conclusion: Nutritional status, as assessed by BMI and GNRI, was
   negatively associated with disease severity using ALSFRS-R. The present
   study suggested that intake of nutrients decreases with disease
   progression in ALS patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveTo detail the disconnect between the quantified efficacy of the
   mood stabilizer lamotrigine in its registration controlled trials and
   its later judged clinical effectiveness and consider some determinants
   of disconnects between some efficacy trial findings and real-world'
   clinical effectiveness judgments.
   MethodPublished articles considering lamotrigine as a treatment for the
   bipolar I or II disorders were selected for review. While randomized
   controlled trials were weighted, we also consider open trials and
   effectiveness observations from clinician researchers and demonstrate
   that lamotrigine has been quite variably judged over time.
   ResultsWe suggest that the early trials evaluating lamotrigine for acute
   bipolar disorder depression focused on a suboptimal clinical target, and
   in so doing, ensured less lamotrigine efficacy compared with trials of
   bipolar disorder preventative treatment. Moreover, a number of
   additional methodological limitations compromised analyses. We also
   detail variable reporting of actual study results. The initial sharp
   disconnect (between efficacy and effectiveness judgments) has narrowed
   as lamotrigine has been evaluated and progressively taken up as a
   maintenance mood stabilizer.
   ConclusionThe lamotrigine disconnect story provides a number of salutary
   lessons that are salient to evaluating the effectiveness and ecological
   niche of any psychotropic medication. The lamotrigine story presented
   here argues strongly for the wisdom of encouraging an iterative process
   between efficacy studies and clinical observation.}},

   the process of origination and growth of individual carbon
   nanostructures, the authors conducted experiments not only on
   nanopowders, but also on separated clusters. Experiments were conducted
   at different temperatures (200-700 degrees C) and pressures (100-400
   mbar) to determine optimum conditions and the lower temperature boundary
   for carbon-nanostructure synthesis. The experiments have shown that the
   lower boundary of synthesis for nanopowders is a temperature of 325
   degrees C. For the separated powders, as for the nanopowders, stable
   growth of carbon nanostructures was observed at 350 degrees C, but at
   pressures lower than 300 mbar. Unlike the carbon nanostructures produced
   on nanopowders, carbon nanostructures on separated powders exhibit a
   strong dependence of their origination and growth on temperature and
   pressure. Results of the Raman spectroscopy and of the x-ray structural
   analysis have shown that carbon nanostructures grown at 325 degrees C
   and 300 mbar have the highest purity.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Nalbuphine is a synthetic mixed agonist-antagonist opioid,
   which produces k receptor mediated analgesia to control mild to moderate
   pain without producing mu receptor mediated side effects when used
   intrathecally (IT) with bupivacaine.
   Aim: To evaluate the onset, quality and duration of sensory, motor
   blockade, post-operative analgesia, and it's side effects if any when
   nalbuphine is added as an adjuvant for spinal anesthesia in the
   abdominal hysterectomies.
   Methodology: 60 patients of ASA Grades I and II in the age group of
   30-60 years were randomly allocated to one of the two groups. Group B (n
   = 30) received 0.5\% hyperbaric bupivacaine \{3cc (15 mg) + 0.5 ml
   sterile water\} IT; Group N (n = 30) received 0.5\% hyperbaric
   bupivacaine \{3cc (15 mg) + 0.5 ml (1 mg) nalbuphine\} IT. Observations:
   The characteristics of onset of sensory and motor blockade, duration of
   effective analgesia (visual analog scale {[}VAS] score), perioperative
   hemodynamics, respiratory parameters, and side effects were recorded,
   tabulated, and statistically analyzed.
   Results: The onset of sensory and motor blockade was faster in Group N.
   The two segment regression time was significantly prolonged in Group N
   compared to Group B. The total duration of effective analgesia (time
   from IT drug injection to the point of time when VAS = 4) was also
   significantly prolonged in Group N compared to Group B. The hemodynamic,
   respiratory parameters and intraoperative complications were comparable
   in both the groups.
   Conclusion: IT nalbuphine improved the quality of intraoperative and
   post-operative analgesia with minimal side effects.}},

   regularisation with accuracy estimates, such as repeat tests for the

   examined: a continuous approximation of the distribution using Laguerre
   polynomials, and using finely spaced discrete components. It is shown
   that for data generated with a known floatability distribution, the
   distribution can be recovered. For experimental data from the literature
   both methods give similar floatability distributions. The accuracy of
   the calculated floatability distributions is estimated. Repeat data is
   important in determining the regularisation parameter and thus insuring
   the data is not over fitted or over smoothed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Introduction: The paraquat is a liquid herbicide associated with both
   accidental and intentional ingestion, leading to severe and often fatal
   toxicity.
   Aim: The present study is to evaluate the role of liver function tests
   and lactate levels in predicting the outcome of acute paraquat
   poisoning.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 30 patients with acute paraquat
   poisoning admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) were included in the
   study. The paraquat poisoning was confirmed by urine dithionite test.
   Initial clinical parameters such as vital signs, age, amount of paraquat
   consumption, respiratory rate, serum creatinine, bilirubin, alanine
   transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and lactate levels
   were obtained at the time of admission to ICU. Depending on the outcome
   after paraquat poisoning the patients were categorized as survivors and
   non-survivors, the trend in the clinical parameters was assessed to
   observe the severity.
   Results: The overall mortality rate was 66.6\% (20/30) during 3 days
   follow-up, on the 1st day of admission serum bilirubin, AST, ALT, and
   lactate levels were statistically significantly high in non-survivors
   when compared with survivors.
   Conclusion: The 1st day of admission serum bilirubin, AST, ALT, and
   lactate levels are very much elevated and are useful in predicting the
   outcome of paraquat poisoning.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for the automated processing of surface
   electromyography (SEMG) signals, particularly suited for the detection
   of muscle activation timing. The method has an intermediate level of
   complexity between simpler (but less performing) and more complex (but
   in general slower) methods, and is successfully used in the development
   of biomedical devices for rehabilitation carried out by our group. The
   method proposed here is based on a statistical approach for threshold
   computation that is implemented without the need of maximum voluntary
   contraction or relaxed state, usually required to overcome the
   difficulty in obtaining the threshold value. The method is compared with
   10 popular automated standard methods using different types of simulated
   signals that approximate the behavior of real SEMG signals. Both the
   number of activations detected and the onset time measured are analyzed.
   The algorithm is then applied to real SEMG signals acquired from healthy
   subjects. The results are finally compared with the literature values.
   The results show that the proposed algorithm is the best performing
   method when both the number of activations and the activation timing are
   considered. In real applications, the algorithm gives the results
   compatible with the well-agreed literature data.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To assess the feasibility of using mobile communication
   technology in completing a 30-day follow-up of surgical site infection
   (SSI). Subjects and Methods: SSIs are infections occurring up to 30 days
   after an operative procedure. This prospective exploratory study was
   conducted in a cohort of patients who were admitted and operated on in
   the general surgery wards of a rural hospital in India from October 2010
   to June 2011. At the time of discharge, all patients were requested to
   follow-up in the surgical outpatient clinic at 30 days after surgery. If
   this was not done, a mobile phone-based surveillance was done to
   complete the follow-up. Results: The mean age of the 536 operated-on
   patients was 40 years (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 38-41 years).
   The mean duration of hospital stay was 10.7 days (95\% CI, 9.9-11.6
   days). Most (81\%) operated-on patients were from rural areas, and 397
   (75\%) were male. Among the operated-on patients the ownership of mobile
   phones was 75\% (95\% CI, 73-78\%). The remaining 25\% of patients (n =
   133) used a shared mobile phone. For 380 patients (74.5\%) the follow-up
   was completed by mobile phones. The SSI rate at follow-up was 6.3\%
   (n=34). In 10 patients, an SSI was detected over the mobile phone.
   Conclusions: Mobile communication technology is feasible to be used in
   rural settings to complete case follow-up for SSIs.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS A-SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Thin membranes are prone to wrinkling under various loading, geometric
   and boundary conditions, affecting their functionality. We consider a
   hyperelastic cylindrical membrane with non-uniform thickness pressurized
   by internal gas or fluid. When pre-stretched and inflated, the wrinkles
   are generated in a certain portion of the membrane depending on the
   loading medium and boundary conditions. The wrinkling is determined
   through a criterion based on kinematic conditions obtained from
   non-negativity of Cauchy principal stresses. The equilibrium solution of
   a wrinkled membrane is obtained by a specified combination of standard
   and relaxed strain energy function. The governing equations are
   discretized by a finite difference approach and a Newton-Raphson method
   is used to obtain the solution. An interesting relationship between
   stretch induced softening/stiffening with the wrinkling phenomenon has
   been discovered. The effects of pre-stretch, inflating medium, thickness
   variations and boundary conditions on the wrinkling patterns are clearly
   delineated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

   microparticles had tamarind gum sodium alginate (1:3) ratio and showed
   entrapment efficiency 94.969\% and mucoadhesion strength 94.646\% with
   desirability of 0.961. Suppositories loaded with microparticles were
   developed by fusion method using poloxamer 407 and poloxamer 188 in
   combination as suppository base. Kinetic analysis of the release data of
   microparticle-loaded suppositories showed time-independent release of
   drug. Higher values of `n' (>0.89) represent Super Case II-type drug
   release. The pharmacokinetics of flutamide from flutamide tamarind
   alginate microparticle-loaded suppository were compared with oral

   modules}},
Journal = {{OPEN BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Morphological evolution is driven both by coding sequence variation and
   by changes in regulatory sequences. However, how cis-regulatory modules
   (CRMs) evolve to generate entirely novel expression domains is largely
   unknown. Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of a lens
   enhancer located within a CRM that not only predates the lens, a
   vertebrate innovation, but bilaterian animals in general. Alignments of
   orthologous sequences from different deuterostomes sub-divide the CRM
   into a deeply conserved core and a more divergent flanking region. We
   demonstrate that all deuterostome flanking regions, including
   invertebrate sequences, activate gene expression in the zebrafish lens
   through the same ancient cluster of activator sites. However, levels of
   gene expression vary between species due to the presence of repressor
   motifs in flanking region and core. These repressor motifs are
   responsible for the relatively weak enhancer activity of tetrapod
   flanking regions. Ray-finned fish, however, have gained two additional
   lineage-specific activator motifs which in combination with the ancient
   cluster of activators and the core constitute a potent lens enhancer.
   The exploitation and modification of existing regulatory potential in
   flanking regions but not in the highly conserved core might represent a
   more general model for the emergence of novel regulatory functions in
   complex CRMs.}},

Abstract = {{Let K be a (commutative) field, and U and V be finite-dimensional vector
   spaces over K. Let S be a linear subspace of the space L(U, V) of all
   linear operators from U to V. A map F : S -> V is called
   range-compatible when F(s) is an element of Im s for all s is an element
   of S. Obvious examples of such maps are the evaluation maps s bar right
   arrow s(x), with x is an element of U.
   In this article, we classify all the range-compatible group
   homomorphisms on S provided that codim(L(U,V)) S <= 2 dim V - 3, unless
   K has cardinality 2 and codim(L(U,V)) S = 2 dim V - 3. Under those
   assumptions, it is shown that the linear range-compatible maps are the
   evaluation maps, and the above upper-bound on the codimension of S is
   optimal for this result to hold.
   As an application, we obtain new sufficient conditions for the algebraic
   reflexivity of an operator space and, with the above conditions on the
   codimension of S, we give an explicit description of the
   range-restricting and range-preserving homomorphisms on S. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a crucial diagnostic tool.
   However, the ideal method to assess competency in ECG interpretation

   participants were enrolled {[}32 (43\%) Primary Care Physicians, 24
   (32\%) Hospital Medical Staff and 19 (25\%) Nurse Practitioners].
   Nineteen ECGs with 4 possible answers were interpreted. Out of 1425
   possible decisions 1054 (73.9\%) responses were made. Only 570/1425
   (40\%) of the responses were correct. Diagnostic accuracy varied (0\% to
   78\%, mean 42\% +/- 21\%) across the entire cohort. Participation was
   high, (median 83\%, IQR 50\%-100\%). Hospital Medical Staff had
   significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than nurse practitioners (50
   +/- 20\% vs. 38 +/- 19\%, p = 0.04) and Primary Care Physicians (50 +/-
   20\% vs. 40 +/- 21\%, p = 0.07) although not significant. Interactive

Abstract = {{The results of an experimental study of heat transfer in the liquid
   films flowing down a vertical cylinder with different types of surface
   structuring are presented. The methods of heat transfer enhancement and
   critical heat flux increase using horizontal ribbing, rhomb-shaped
   notches and mesh surface coating at the wave-laminar film flow were
   investigated. The mixture of refrigerants R114 and R21 was used as a
   working liquid; initial concentration of volatile component R114 in the
   mixture was varied from 0\% to 19\%. It is found out that a change in
   the character of the wave film flow on the surface with horizontal
   ribbing at film Reynolds numbers Re > 400 leads to heat transfer
   intensification at evaporation compared with the smooth and rhomb-shaped
   surfaces. At evaporation and development of nucleate boiling, the heat
   transfer coefficient on the surface with mesh coating is higher than for
   the smooth and textured surfaces. At nucleate boiling there is no effect
   of surface texture on heat transfer. The influence of the initial
   composition of a binary mixture of refrigerants with close saturation
   temperatures on the heat transfer coefficient at evaporation and boiling
   is insignificant. The development of crisis phenomena over the studied
   structured surfaces is determined by the regularities of dry spot
   formation, specific to evaporation of the wave liquid film. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Tropical forests of Central and South America represent hotspots of
   biological diversity. Tree squirrels of the tribe Sciurini are an
   excellent model system for the study of tropical biodiversity as these
   squirrels disperse exceptional distances, and after colonizing the
   tropics of the Central and South America, they have diversified rapidly.
   Here, we compare signals from DNA sequences with morphological signals
   using pictures of skulls and computational simulations. Phylogenetic
   analyses reveal step-wise geographic divergence across the Northern
   Hemisphere. In Central and South America, tree squirrels form two
   separate clades, which split from a common ancestor. Simulations of
   ancestral distributions show western Amazonia as the epicenter of
   speciation in South America. This finding suggests that wet tropical
   forests on the foothills of Andes possibly served as refugia of squirrel
   diversification during Pleistocene climatic oscillations. Comparison of
   phylogeny and morphology reveals one major discrepancy: Microsciurus
   species are a single clade morphologically but are polyphyletic
   genetically. Modeling of morphology-diet relationships shows that the
   only group of species with a direct link between skull shape and diet
   are the bark-gleaning insectivorous species of Microsciurus. This
   finding suggests that the current designation of Microsciurus as a genus
   is based on convergent ecologically driven changes in morphology.}},

Abstract = {{STUDY QUESTION: Can ovarian stimulation with low dose hMG improve the
   implantation rate (IR) per frozen-thawed embryo transferred (FET) when
   compared with natural cycle in an FET programme in women with a regular
   ovulatory cycle?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: Both IR and live birth rate (LBR) per FET were similar
   in the group with mild ovarian stimulation and the natural cycle group.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Different cycle regimens for endometrial
   preparation are used prior to FET: spontaneous ovulatory cycles, cycles
   with artificial endometrial preparation using estrogen and progesterone
   hormones, and cycles stimulated with gonadotrophins or clomiphene
   citrate. At present, it is not clear which regimen results in the
   highest IR or LBR. More specifically, there are no RCTs in ovulatory
   women comparing reproductive outcome after FET during a natural cycle
   and during a hormonally stimulated cycle.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A total of 410 women scheduled for FET
   during 579 cycles (December 2003-September 2013) were enrolled in an
   open-label RCT to natural cycle (NC FET group, n = 291) or to a cycle
   hormonally stimulated with s.c. gonadotrophins (hMG FET group, 37.5-75
   IU per day, n = 288). A total of 672 embryos were transferred during 434
   cycles (332 embryos and 213 cycles in the NC FET group; 340 embryos and
   221 cycles in the hMG FET group). Assuming a = 0.05 and 80\% power, it
   was calculated that 219 frozen-thawed embryos were required for transfer
   in each group to demonstrate a difference of 10\% in IR.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women were eligible according
   to the following inclusion criteria: regular ovulatory cycle, female age
   >= 21 years and <= 45 years, informed consent. FET cycles with
   preimplantation genetic screening were excluded. The primary outcome was
   IR per embryo transferred. Secondary outcomes included IR with fetal
   heart beat (FHB), LBR per embryo transferred and endometrial thickness
   on the day of hCG administration. Statistical analysis was by intention
   to treat and controlled for the presence of multiple measures, as
   eligible women could be randomized in more than one cycle. Chi-square
   and independent t-test were used to compare categorical and continuous
   variables. The relative risk (RR) was estimated using a Poisson model
   with log link. Hierarchical models with random intercepts for patient
   and cycle were considered to account for clustering of cycles within
   patients and of embryos within cycles.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The primary outcome, IR per embryo
   transferred, was not statistically different between the NCFET group
   (41/332 (12.35\%)) and in the hMG FET group (55/340 (16.18\%)) (RR 1.3
   (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-2.0), P = 0.19). Similarly, the
   secondary outcome, IR with FHB per embryo transferred, was 34/332
   (10.24\%) in the NC FET group and 48/340 (14.12\%) in the hMG FET group
   (RR 1.4 (95\% CI 0.9-2.1), P = 0.15). The LBR per embryo transferred was
   32/332 (9.64\%) in the NC FET group and 45/340 (13.24\%) in the hMG FET
   group (RR 1.4 (95\% CI 0.9-2.2), P = 0.17). Endometrial thickness was
   also similar in both groups {[}8.9 (95\% CI 8.7-9.1) in the NCFET group
   and 8.9 (95\% CI 8.7-9.1) in the hMG FET group]. The duration of the
   follicular phase was significantly shorter (P < 0.001) in the hMG FET
   group {[}13.7 days (95\% CI 13.2-14.2)] than in the NC FET group {[}15.4
   days (95\% CI 14.8-15.9)].
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Randomization of cycles instead of
   patients; open-label design; relatively long period of recruitment.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our observation that the IR per
   embryo transferred is not significantly increased after FET during
   natural or gonadotrophin stimulated cycle, suggests that the effect of
   mild hormonal stimulation with gonadotrophins is smaller than what was
   considered clinically relevant with respect to reproductive outcome
   after FET. These data suggest that endometrial receptivity is not
   relevantly improved, but also not impaired after hormonal stimulation
   with gonadotrophins. Since FET during a natural cycle is cheaper and
   more patient-friendly, we recommend this regimen as the treatment of
   choice for women with regular cycles undergoing FET.}},

Abstract = {{Two composites of phosphorus nanoparticles encapsulated in graphene
   scrolls (P-G) and phosphorus nanoparticles loaded on planar graphene
   sheets (P/G) were successfully prepared and applied as anodes for
   sodium-ion batteries. Phosphorus nanoparticles (ca. 100-150nm) were
   firstly obtained from commercial red phosphorus by using a simple
   flotation method. P-G composites with different phosphorus contents
   (38.6, 52.2, and 62.1\%) were synthesized through a quick-freezing
   process. In addition, the P/G composite with a phosphorus content of
   50.8\% was prepared for comparison purposes. As a result, the P-G
   composites showed a better performance than the P/G composite. Moreover,
   the P-G composite with a phosphorus content of 52.2\% showed the best
   performance, delivering a capacity of 2355mAhg(-1) in the second cycle
   and 2172mAhg(-1) after 150 cycles at 250mAg(-1) (with a capacity
   retention of 92.3\%).}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this study, heavy metals contamination in surface sediments of
   northwest Persian Gulf was investigated and a new index was formulated
   for assessing severity of heavy metal pollution in aquatic environments.
   The surface sediment samples were collected from 45 stations. The
   concentrations of 8 metals (Fe, Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni, Pb, Cd and V) were
   analyzed. According to the results of potential ecological risk index
   (RI), pollution load index (PLI) and modified degree of contamination
   (mCD), based on the average shale, considerable and intense pollution of
   heavy metals in sediments of study area was not observed. Based on the
   sediments quality guidelines the concentration of Ni at whole study area
   has frequently adverse biological effect on aquatic organisms. The mean
   effects range-median quotient indicated that surface sediments in the
   vicinity of petrochemical zone and Bahrekan pier with 49\% probability
   of toxicity can be risky for the biota. The Consequence of the cluster
   analysis and principal component analysis/factor analysis indicated that
   Fe, Cu, Zn and Cr are mainly originated from natural sources and Ni, Pb,
   Cd and V are mostly derived from anthropogenic sources. Results of
   introduced index in this research (Contamination Severity Index)
   demonstrated that pollution of heavy metals in sediments at several
   sites is very intense. Assessment of results illustrated that proposed
   index is more reliable and logical compared with other investigated
   indices for evaluating heavy metals pollution in sediments of aquatic
   environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We studied conditional self-discrimination (CSD) in rats and compared
   the neuronal cytoarchitecture of untrained animals and rats that were
   trained in self-discrimination. For this purpose, we used thirty
   10-week-old male rats were randomized into three groups: one control
   group and two conditioning groups: a comparison group (associative
   learning) and an experimental group (self-discrimination). At the end of
   the conditioning process, the experimental group managed to discriminate
   their own state of thirst. After the conditioning process, dendritic
   morphological changes in the pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex
   and CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus were evaluated using Golgi-Cox
   stain method and then analyzed by the Sholl method. Differences were
   found in total dendritic length and spine density. Animals trained in
   self-discrimination showed an increase in the dendritic length and the
   number of dendritic spines of neurons of the prefrontal cortex and CA1
   region of the dorsal hippocampus. Our data suggest that conditional
   self-discrimination improves the connectivity of the prefrontal cortex
   and dorsal CA1, which has implications for memory and learning
   processes. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We propose to represent a time-of-flight (TOF) camera by the map of
   ``internal radial. distances{''} (IRD), associating an intrinsic
   distance to each pixel, as an alternative for the classic pinhole model.
   This representation is more general than the perspective model and
   appears to be a natural concept for 3D reconstruction and other
   applications of TOF cameras. In this new framework, calibrating a ToF
   camera comes down to the determination of this IRD map. We show how this
   can be accomplished by images of flat surfaces, without performing any
   feature detection. We prove deterministic calibration formulas, using
   one or more plane images. We also offer a numerical optimization method
   that in principle needs only one image of a flat surface. This paper has
   been recommended for acceptance by Peter Sturm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Background. Islet transplantation is a successful beta-cell replacement
   therapy for selected patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Although
   high rates of early insulin independence are achieved routinely,
   long-term function wanes over time. Intraportal transplantation is
   associated with procedural risks, requires multiple donors, and does not
   afford routine biopsy. Stem cell technologies may require potential for
   retrievability, and graft removal by hepatectomy is impractical. There
   is a clear clinical need for an alternative, optimized transplantation
   site. The subcutaneous space is a potential substitute, but
   transplantation of islets into this site has routinely failed to reverse
   diabetes. However, an implanted device, which becomes prevascularized
   before transplantation, may alter this equation. Methods. Syngeneic
   mouse islets were transplanted subcutaneously within Sernova Corp's Cell
   Pouch (CP). All recipients were preimplanted with CPs 4 weeks before
   diabetes induction and transplantation. After transplantation,
   recipients were monitored for glycemic control and glucose tolerance.
   Results. Mouse islets transplanted into the CP routinely restored
   glycemic control with modest delay and responded well to glucose
   challenge, comparable to renal subcapsular islet grafts, despite a
   marginal islet dose, and normoglycemia was maintained until graft
   explantation. In contrast, islets transplanted subcutaneously alone
   failed to engraft. Islets within CPs stained positively for insulin,
   glucagon, and microvessels. Conclusions. The CP is biocompatible, forms
   an environment suitable for islet engraftment, and offers a potential
   alternative to the intraportal site for islet and future stem cell
   therapies.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the behavior of a strongly magnetized electron gas whose
   dominant pressure is exerted along the applied field, and extends along
   it as a one dimensional system. We suggest a model for maintaining the
   magnetic field selfconsistently, and for it we conjecture a partial
   bosonization of the electron gas, described by a charged vector boson
   field which experiences condensation, leading to a ferromagnetic
   behavior. Our aim is to suggest a possible quantum relativistic
   self-magnetized jet model. High frequency photons will be deviated also
   along paths parallel to the external field. Any addition of energy to
   the electron system, would contribute mainly to increase the kinetic
   energy along the magnetic field axis, an the jet may grow in this way
   for long times. ((c) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)}},

Abstract = {{Background: Academic Involvement Questionnaire, Expectations version
   (CIA-A), assesses the expectations of involvement in studies. It is a
   relevant predictor of student success. However, the evidence of its
   validity and reliability in Chile is low, and in the case of Medical
   students, there is no evidence at all. Aim: To evaluate the factorial
   structure and internal consistency of the CIA-A in Chilean Medical
   school freshmen. Material and Methods: The survey was applied to 340
   Medicine freshmen, chosen by non-probability quota sampling. They
   answered a back-translated version of CIA-A from Portuguese to Spanish,
   plus a sociodemographic questionnaire. For psychometric analysis of the
   CIA-A, an exploratory factor analysis was carried on, the reliability of
   the factors was calculated, a descriptive analysis was conducted and
   their correlation was assessed. Results: Five factors were identified:
   vocational, institutional and social involvement, use of resources and
   student participation. Their reliabilities ranged between Cronbach's
   alpha values of 0.71 to 0.87. Factors also showed statistically
   significant correlations between each other. Conclusions: Identified
   factor structure is theoretically consistent with the structure of
   original version. It just disagrees in one factor. In addition, the
   factors' internal consistency were adequate for using them in research.
   This supports the construct validity and reliability of the CIA-A to
   assess involvement expectations in medical school freshmen.}},

Title = {{Disentangling the excitation conditions of the dense gas in M17 SW}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{583}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Context. Stars are formed in dense molecular clouds. These dense clouds
   experience radiative feedback from UV photons, and X-ray from stars,
   embedded prestellar cores, young stellar objects (YSOs), and ultra
   compact H II regions. This radiative feedback affects the chemistry and
   thermodynamics of the gas.
   Aims. We aim to probe the chemical and energetic conditions created by
   radiative feedback through observations of multiple CO, HCN, and HCO+
   transitions. We measure the spatial distribution and excitation of the
   dense gas (n(H-2) > 10(4) cm(-3)) in the core region of M17 SW and aim
   to investigate the influence of UV radiation fields.
   Methods. We used the dual band receiver GREAT on board the SOFIA
   airborne telescope to obtain a 5.'7 x 3.'7 map of the J = 16 -> 15, J =
   12 -> 11, and J = 11 -> 10 transitions of (CO)-C-12 in M17 SW. We
   compare these maps with corresponding APEX and IRAM 30m telescope data
   for low-and mid-J CO, HCN, and HCO+ emission lines, including maps of
   the HCN J = 8 -> 7 and HCO+ J = 9 -> 8 transitions. The excitation
   conditions of (CO)-C-12, HCO+, and HCN are estimated with a two-phase
   non-LTE radiative transfer model of the line spectral energy
   distributions (LSEDs) at four selected positions. The energy balance at
   these positions is also studied.
   Results. We obtained extensive LSEDs for the CO, HCN, and HCO+ molecules
   toward M17 SW. These LSEDs can be fit simultaneously using the same
   density and temperature in the two-phase models and to the spectra of
   all three molecules over a similar to 12 square arc minute size region
   of M17 SW. Temperatures of up to 240 K are found toward the position of
   the peak emission of the (CO)-C-12 J = 16 -> 15 line. High densities of
   10(6) cm(-3) were found at the position of the peak HCN J = 8 -> 7
   emission.
   Conclusions. We found HCO+/HCN line ratios larger than unity, which can
   be explained by a lower excitation temperature of the higher-J HCN
   lines. The LSED shape, particularly the high-J tail of the CO lines
   observed with SOFIA/GREAT, is distinctive for the underlying excitation
   conditions. The cloudlets associated with the cold component of the
   models are magnetically subcritical and supervirial at most of the
   selected positions. The warm cloudlets instead are all supercritical and
   also supervirial. The critical magnetic field criterion implies that the
   cold cloudlets at two positions are partially controlled by processes
   that create and dissipate internal motions. Supersonic but sub-Alfvenic
   velocities in the cold component at most selected positions indicate
   that internal motions are likely magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves.
   Magnetic pressure dominates thermal pressure in both gas components at
   all selected positions, assuming random orientation of the magnetic
   field. The magnetic pressure of a constant magnetic field throughout all
   the gas phases can support the total internal pressure of the cold
   components, but cannot support the internal pressure of the warm
   components. If the magnetic field scales as B proportional to n(2/3),
   then the evolution of the cold cloudlets at two selected positions, and
   the warm cloudlets at all selected positions, is determined by ambipolar
   diffusion.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{269-278}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Cyclic voltammetry is modeled using a probabilistic cellular automata
   (CA). The system is built up by simple evolution rules representing
   diffusion and electrochemical reactions. A connection between the CA
   model and electrochemistry is established using the electric charge of
   each cell and the chemical species that it represents. We studied two
   different kinetic regimes of electronic transfer at the electrode, which
   could be described by the Nernst and Butler-Volmer theories. In the
   evolution rules, we define probabilities that are directly related to
   the properties of the system and are described in terms of the electric
   potential. CA features are thus associated to macroscopic quantities and
   simulations are compared with experimental data from literature and
   validated with simulations using the standard finite element models
   (FEM). This work consolidates CA modeling as a quantitative approach for
   this domain of application and shows the capabilities of relatively
   cheap graphical processor units (GPU) on standard desktop workstation to
   model 3D complex systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Factors in the middle age that are associated with the risk for
   development of diastolic dysfunction in long term are not fully
   established. The Oulu Project Elucidating Risk of Atherosclerosis OPERA
   study randomly selected middle-aged subjects with hypertension and age-
   and gender-matched control subjects (n = 1,045, age 51 +/- 6 years, men
   49.8\%). Alter >20 years of follow-up, majority of the subjects still
   alive were available for reexaminations (n = 600). After excluding the
   subjects with mitral regurgitation, left ventricular ejection fraction
   <50\%, and those from whom echocardiographic septal E/E' could not be
   reliably measured, the present analysis included 460 subjects. E/E' was
   divided into 3 subgroups (subgroup 1: E/E' <= 8, subgroup 2: 8 < E/E' <
   15, subgroup 3: E/E' >= 15), subgroup 3 suggesting a significant
   diastolic dysfunction. Several baseline variables were associated with
   diastolic dysfunction: greater age (p = 0.001), female gender (p =
   0.001), shorter height (p < 0.001), larger body mass index (p = 0.008),
   greater systolic blood pressure (p = 0.001), greater pulse pressure (p
   <0.001), lower barorefiex sensitivity (p = 0.007), lower estimated
   glomerular filtration rate (p = 0.02), greater atrial natriuretic
   peptide (p = 0.001), greater fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.001), more
   common occurrence of diabetes (p = 0.011), and more common usage of
   antihypertensive medication (p = 0.001). After adjustments in the
   multivariate model, only systolic blood pressure (p = 0.001), shorter
   height (p = 0.002), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (p = 0.006)
   retained a significant association with the risk of developing diastolic
   dysfunction. In conclusion, greater systolic blood pressure, short
   height, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate of the
   middle-aged subjects were the main determinants of development of
   diastolic dysfunction during a 20-year follow-up. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{ObjectivePersistent pain in the face, mouth, and jaws is a common
   presentation to dental and medical services. The aetiology remains
   unclear, but a growing evidence base recognizes the effectiveness of
   psychological rather than biomedical interventions. To understand how
   this approach might be implemented into clinical practice, knowledge is
   needed of patients' and clinicians' experience of chronic orofacial pain
   (COFP). The aim of this study was to explore the experience and
   understanding of COFP by patients and primary and secondary care medical
   and dental practitioners.
   DesignQualitative interview study.
   MethodsAudio-recorded semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample
   of 12 dentists, 11 general practitioners, and seven patients were
   thematically analysed.
   ResultsClinicians and patients recognized the role that psychological
   factors could play in the development and maintenance of COFP, yet
   management and self-management strategies were largely limited to
   biomedical interventions. Achieving a diagnosis proved problematic but
   largely functional for both parties. GPs and dentists viewed COFP as a
   non-dental problem and felt inadequately equipped to manage the
   condition. GPs, unlike dentists, felt obligated to support patients
   using techniques for managing patients with other long-term conditions.
   Frustration at the current inadequacy of COFP management often led to
   conflict with (or disengagement from) the clinician-patient
   relationship.
   ConclusionsCurrent management of COFP is ineffective and unsatisfactory
   for patients and practitioners, which impacts on their relationship.
   Fundamental barriers to accessing and implementing psychological
   interventions for COFP arise from ineffective communication between
   physicians and patients, and between medical and dental practitioners.}},

Abstract = {{Bioretention systems fundamentally lack the ability to effectively
   reduce total nitrogen concentrations from urban stormwater. Column tests
   were conducted to simulate a bioretention anoxic zone and evaluate the
   effects of stormwater retention time, limestone addition, and woodchip
   species, size, and mass percentage on the bioretention denitrification
   process. Denitrification of an artificial stormwater was demonstrated
   and appeared to follow first-order kinetics. A 0.8-day average retention
   time showed the highest nitrate removal percentage of 82.4 +/- 0.4\%.
   Willow Oak and Red Maple woodchips resulted in the highest total
   nitrogen removal efficiencies at 61.9 +/- 0.8\% and 61.8\%,
   respectively; Wild Cherry, Virginia Pine, and American Beech were less
   effective. Smaller woodchips and higher woodchip mass percentage
   corresponded to greater nitrate removal efficiencies, but also higher
   organic nitrogen leaching. Media containing 4.5\% 5-mm Willow Oak
   woodchips by mass represented optimum conditions. Adding limestone to
   raise the pH did not increase denitrification rates. Installing a first
   flush bioretention denitrification zone may represent a way to
   incorporate the longer retention times needed for denitrification. (C)

Title = {{Two-dimensional particle shape analysis from chord measurements to
   increase accuracy of particle shape determination}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{284}},
Pages = {{25-31}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Some in-process two-dimensional particle sizing methods can provide
   on-line information about the chord length distribution of a population
   of particles. The objective of this study is to use the chord
   measurement not only for the size determination but also for the
   determination of the particle shape. Main results are the
   non-dimensional aspect ratio or the roundness of the particle. The
   elongation values can be calculated by three non-dimensional parameters
   which are derived from the mean, mode or maximal chord length of the
   number and area based chord distributions. The application of these
   shape parameters is limited to narrow particle size and shape
   distributions. The application is demonstrated for coating of elliptical
   seed particles and spherical pellets (Cellets 1000). An optical probe
   system (IPP 70, Parsum GmbH, Germany) was used for the measurement of
   chord lengths during the coating processes. Results of an image analysis
   were in a good correlation with the results of the chord measurements.
   The advantage is the simultaneous use of the measured chord lengths for
   the characterization of the particle size and also the particle shape
   without any need for additional measurement equipment. Another advantage
   is the in-line determination of the particle shape without taking a
   powder sample. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rice (Oryza sativa L.) as a model and crop plant with a sequenced genome
   offers an outstanding experimental system for discovering and
   functionally analyzing the major cell cycle control elements in a cereal
   species. In this study, we identified the core cell cycle genes in the
   rice genome through a hidden Markov model search and multiple alignments
   supported with the use of short protein sequence probes. In total we
   present 55 rice putative cell cycle genes with locus identity,
   chromosomal location, approximate chromosome position and EST accession
   number. These cell cycle genes include nine cyclin dependent-kinase
   (CDK) genes, 27 cyclin genes, one CKS gene, two RBR genes, nine
   E2F/DP/DEL genes, six KRP genes, and one WEE gene. We also provide
   characteristic protein sequence signatures encoded by CDK and cyclin
   gene variants. Promoter analysis by the FootPrinter program discovered
   several motifs in the regulatory region of the core cell cycle genes. As
   a first step towards functional characterization we performed transcript
   analysis by RT-PCR to determine gene specific variation in transcript
   levels along the rice leaves. The meristematic zone of the leaves where
   cells are actively dividing was identified based on kinematic analysis
   and flow cytometry. As expected, expression of the majority of cell
   cycle genes was exclusively associated with the meristematic region.
   However genes such as different D-type cyclins, DEL1, KRP1/3, and RBR2
   were also expressed in leaf segments representing the transition zone in
   which cells start differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Advancements and debacles have characterized hemophilia treatment over
   the past 50 years. The 1970s saw the availability of plasma-derived
   concentrates making prophylaxis and home therapy possible. This
   optimistic perception changed extremely in the early 1980s, when most
   people with hemophilia were infected with HIV and hepatitis viruses.
   Then, also in the 1980s, the rapid progress in molecular biology led to
   the development of recombinant therapeutic products. This important
   advancement was a huge technological leap fresh off from the earlier
   1980s disaster. Now in the 21st century, the newer bioengineering drugs
   open a new hopeful phase for the management of hemophilia. The current
   efforts are concentrated on producing novel coagulation factors with
   prolonged bioavailability, increased potency, and resistance to
   inactivation and potentially reduced immunogenicity; this phase of
   evolution is improving very quickly. 2014 is the year of marketing
   approval by the Food and Drug Administration of the first bioengineered
   FVIII and FIX long-acting drugs, using Fc-fusion strategy. This
   represents the first significant advance in the hemophilia therapy that
   dramatically transforms patient management by substantially reducing the
   frequency of injections, improving compliance, and simplifying
   prophylaxis and, in turn, refining the quality of life of hemophilia
   patients, offering them a nearly normal life expectancy, particularly to
   newborns with hemophilia B.}},

Abstract = {{Older patients with burn injury have a greater likelihood for discharge
   to nursing facilities. Recent research indicates that older patients
   discharged to nursing facilities are two to three times as likely to die
   within a 3-year period relative to those discharged to home. In light of
   these poor long-term outcomes, we conducted this study to identify
   predictors for discharge to independent vs nonindependent living status
   in older patients hospitalized for burns. We retrospectively reviewed
   all older adults (age 55 years) who were prospectively enrolled in a
   longitudinal multicenter study of outcomes from 1993 to 2011. Patient,
   injury, and treatment outcomes data were analyzed. Recognizing that
   transfer to inpatient rehabilitation may have impacted final hospital
   discharge disposition: we assessed the likelihood of inpatient
   rehabilitation stay, based on identified predictors of inpatient
   rehabilitation. We subsequently performed a logistic regression analysis
   on the clustered, propensity-matched cohort to assess associations of
   burn and injury characteristics on the primary outcome of final
   discharge status. A total of 591 patients aged 55 years were treated and
   discharged alive from three participating U.S. burn centers during the
   study period. Mean burn size was 14.8\% (SD 11.2\%) and mean age was
   66.7 years (SD 9.3 years). Ninety-three patients had an inpatient
   rehabilitation stay before discharge (15.7\%). Significant factors
   predictive of inpatient rehabilitation included a burn >20\% TBSA,
   mechanical ventilation, older age, range of motion deficits at acute
   care discharge, and study site. These factors were included in the
   propensity model. Four hundred seventy-one patients (80\%) were
   discharged to independent living status. By matched propensity analysis,
   older age was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of
   discharge to nonindependent living (P < .01 in both the 65-74 age group
   and the oldest age group when compared with the 55-64 age group).
   Comorbidity (P < .01) and history of alcohol abuse (P < 0.01) were also
   predictive patient factors. Furthermore, clinical practice variations
   among the three study sites also constituted a significant factor in
   discharge disposition (both P < .01 when compared with the index study
   site). Older age remains an important risk factor for discharge to
   nonindependent living status, even after accounting for inpatient
   rehabilitation stay. This analysis, however, reveals significant
   variations in discharge disposition practices among the three
   participating study sites. We believe that these variations among burn
   centers need to be elucidated to better understand discharge disposition
   status in older patients with burns.}},

Title = {{DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS OF ELEMENTAL DATA TO DIFFERENTIATE FORMATIONS OF
   LIKE FACIES VERTICALLY ACROSS AN UNCONFORMITY AND LATERALLY ACROSS A
   PALEOTOPOGRAPHIC DIVIDE}},

Abstract = {{Distinguishing different lithostratigraphic formations that are in
   contact with each other can be problematic when they are of like facies,
   appearance, and provenance. For example, formations of like facies that
   are vertically separated by a subtle unconformable surface are difficult
   to distinguish, especially if multiple candidate surfaces exist.
   Similarly, time-equivalent formations of like facies that were separated
   into distinct subbasins by a topographic divide may also be challenging
   to distinguish. In this study, formations of this nature were
   discriminated using statistical discriminant analysis of X-ray
   fluorescence (XRF) elemental data that included both mobile and immobile
   elements. This discrimination has important consequences for
   stratigraphic analysis. For example, accurate placement of an
   unconformable surface within a stratal succession is important because
   it affects the interpreted thickness of units and sequences in contact
   with that surface. Unit thickness influences the interpretation of basin
   subsidence and its timing, depositional style of basin fill,
   paleotopography, and diagenesis.
   When developing discriminant models, data must be collected from outcrop
   or well cores where formations bounding the unconformity or topographic
   divide are known. The models next establish and high-grade key elemental
   differences between the known formations. The models can then be used to
   classify samples from unknown formations to one of the known formations.
   In our study, samples from three lithostratigraphic formations were used
   to build two models: one grouped by facies trends, and one grouped by
   geographic location or tectonic feature. Results demonstrate that
   discriminant analysis of elemental XRF data can be used to distinguish
   these formations both vertically and laterally. Our models relied on
   both mobile and immobile elements to make the discrimination, implying
   that as long as sandstone formations of similar provenance have
   experienced different diagenetic histories (i.e., cements and alteration
   products) they can be distinguished in the rock record.
   This study applied the methodology of discriminant function analysis to
   identify the J-1 unconformity on Utah's Colorado Plateau. The J-1
   unconformity is a regional unconformity that separates the Early and
   Middle Jurassic. Three formations of similar facies, appearance, and
   provenance are all in contact with this unconformity. The Early Jurassic
   Navajo Sandstone underlies the Middle Jurassic Page Sandstone in the
   eastern part of the study area, and the Middle Jurassic Temple Cap
   Formation in the western part of the study area. In much of the central
   part of the study area the stratigraphic position of the J-1
   unconformity is unknown and the overlying formation is less well
   established. The J-1 unconformity appears to have been a baffle or
   barrier to fluid flow in much of this area. Also, paleotopography on the
   Navajo Sandstone appears to have separated the overlying formations into
   two subbasins. Thus, all three formations had different diagenetic
   histories that facilitated the discriminant modeling. The methods used
   in this study can be applied to similar sedimentary packages that were
   likewise partitioned vertically by fluid-flow divides such as
   unconformities and hiatuses, or laterally by topographic, hydrodynamic,
   structural divides, or lateral facies changes.}},

Abstract = {{Physical and psychological stress have been shown to modulate multiple
   aspects of gastrointestinal (GI) physiology, but its molecular basis
   remains elusive. We therefore characterized the stress-induced metabolic
   phenotype (metabotype) in soldiers during high-intensity combat training
   and correlated the metabotype with changes in GI symptoms and
   permeability. In a prospective, longitudinal study, urinary metabotyping
   was conducted on 38 male healthy soldiers during combat training and a
   rest period using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The urinary
   metabotype during combat training was clearly distinct from the rest
   period (partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) Q(2) =
   0.581), confirming the presence of a unique stress-induced metabotype.
   Differential metabolites related to combat stress were further
   uncovered, including elevated pyroglutamate and fructose, and reduced
   gut microbial metabolites, namely, hippurate and m-hydroxyphenylacetate
   (p < 0.05). The extent of pyroglutamate upregulation exhibited a
   positive correlation with an increase in IBS-SSS in soldiers during
   combat training (r = 0.5, p < 0.05). Additionally, the rise in fructose
   levels was positively correlated with an increase in intestinal
   permeability (r = 0.6, p < 0.005). In summary, protracted and mixed
   psychological and physical combat-training stress yielded unique
   metabolic changes that corresponded with the incidence and severity of
   GI symptoms and alteration in intestinal permeability. Our study
   provided novel molecular insights into stress-induced GI perturbations,
   which could be exploited for future biomarker research or development of
   therapeutic strategies.}},

Title = {{Thrombin decreases expression of the glutamate transporter GLAST and

Abstract = {{Astrocyte glutamate transporters GLAST and GLT1 play a key role in
   regulating neuronal excitation and their levels are altered in patients
   with epilepsy, and after traumatic brain injury. The mechanisms which
   regulate their expression are not well understood. We tested the
   hypothesis that exposure of astrocytes to high levels of thrombin, as
   may occur after a compromise of the blood-brain barrier, would reduce
   astrocyte glutamate transporter levels. In isolated rat cortical
   astrocytes we examined the effects of thrombin on the expression and
   function of glutamate transporters, and the signaling pathways involved
   in these responses by using Western blotting and selective inhibitors.
   Thrombin induced a selective decrease in the expression of GLAST but not
   GLT1, with a corresponding decrease in the capacity of astrocytes to
   take up glutamate. Activation of the thrombin receptor PAR-1 with an
   activating peptide induced a similar decrease in the expression of GLAST
   and compromise of glutamate uptake. The downregulation of GLAST induced
   by thrombin was mediated by the mitogen activated protein kinases p38
   MAPK, ERK and JNK, but inhibition of these kinases did not prevent the
   decrease in glutamate uptake induced by thrombin. In contrast,
   inhibition of the Rho kinase pathway using the specific inhibitor,
   Y27632, suppressed both the decrease in the expression of GLAST and the
   decrease in glutamate uptake induced by thrombin. In hippocampal
   astrocyte cultures, thrombin caused a decrease in both GLAST and GLT1.
   In tissue resected from brains of children with intractable epilepsy, we
   found a decrease in the integrity of the blood-brain barrier along with
   a reduction in immunoreactivity for both transporters which was
   associated with an increase in cleaved thrombin and reactive
   astrogliosis. The in vitro results suggest a specific mechanism by which
   thrombin may lead to a compromise of astrocyte function and enhanced
   synaptic excitability after the blood-brain barrier is compromised. The
   human in vivo results provide indirect support evidence linking the
   compromise of the blood-brain barrier to thrombin-induced reduction in
   glutamate transporter expression and an increase in neuronal excitation.

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Sierra Leone is one of three countries recently affected
   by Ebola. In debates surrounding the circumstances that contributed to
   the initial failure to contain the outbreak, the word `trust' is often
   used: In December 2014, WHO director Margret Chan used `lack of trust in
   governments'; The Lancet's Editor-in-Chief, wrote how Ebola has exposed
   the `...breakdown of trust between communities and their governments.'
   This article explores the lack of trust in public healthcare providers
   in Sierra Leone, predating the Ebola outbreak, apparently linked to
   widespread petty corruption in primary healthcare facilities. It
   compares four NGO-supported accountability interventions targeting
   Sierra Leone's primary health sector.
   Methods: Field research was conducted in Kailahun, Kono and Tonkolili
   Districts, based on interviews with health workers and focus group
   discussions with primary healthcare users.
   Results: Field research showed that in most clinics, women and children
   entitled to free care routinely paid for health services.
   Conclusions: A lack of accountability in Sierra Leone's health sector
   appears pervasive at all levels. Petty corruption is rife. Understaffing
   leads to charging for free care in order to pay clinic-based
   `volunteers' who function as vaccinators, health workers and birth
   attendants. Accountability interventions were found to have little
   impact on healthworker (mis)behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Background. No prospective trials have specifically addressed the
   efficacy and safety of panitumumab in elderly patients with metastatic
   colorectal cancer (CRC). We aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety
   of single agent panitumumab in ``frail{''} elderly patients diagnosed
   with metastatic RAS and BRAF wildtype CRC.
   Materials and Methods. Forty elderly patients (aged \$75 years) with
   metastatic RAS-BRAF wild-type CRC received off-label prescriptions of
   single-agent panitumumab at seven Italian institutions. Treatment was
   administered as first line in patients with absolute contraindication to
   any chemotherapy or as second-line treatment after failure of a
   fluoropyrimidine-based treatment, in the presence of contraindication to
   irinotecan. The outcome measures included objective response rate (ORR),
   as well as progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR),
   overall survival (OS), and safety.
   Results. The median PFS and OS were 6.4 months (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 4.9-8 months) and 14.3 months (95\% CI: 10.9-17.7 months),
   respectively. ORR was 32.5\%, and DCR was 72.5\%. Dose reductions
   related to adverse events (AEs) were reported in 9 (23\%) patients, but
   no permanent treatment discontinuation caused by was reported. The most
   frequent grade 3 AE was skin rash, with an incidence of 20\%.
   Conclusion. Panitumumab is effective and well-tolerated in frail elderly
   patients with RAS-BRAF wild-type metastatic CRC and deemed unfit for
   chemotherapy. A randomized study is needed to confirm these data.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop and test an automated algorithm to classify
   different types of tissue in dedicated breast CT images.
   Methods: Images of a single breast of five different patients were
   acquired with a dedicated breast CT clinical prototype. The breast CT
   images were processed by a multiscale bilateral filter to reduce noise
   while keeping edge information and were corrected to overcome cupping
   artifacts. As skin and glandular tissue have similar CT values on breast
   CT images, morphologic processing is used to identify the skin based on
   its position information. A support vector machine (SVM) is trained and
   the resulting model used to create a pixelwise classification map of fat
   and glandular tissue. By combining the results of the skin mask with the
   SVM results, the breast tissue is classified as skin, fat, and glandular
   tissue. This map is then used to identify markers for a minimum spanning
   forest that is grown to segment the image using spatial and intensity
   information. To evaluate the authors' classification method, they use
   DICE overlap ratios to compare the results of the automated
   classification to those obtained by manual segmentation on five patient
   images.
   Results: Comparison between the automatic and the manual segmentation
   shows that the minimum spanning forest based classification method was
   able to successfully classify dedicated breast CT image with average
   DICE ratios of 96.9\%, 89.8\%, and 89.5\% for fat, glandular, and skin
   tissue, respectively.
   Conclusions: A 2D minimum spanning forest based classification method
   was proposed and evaluated for classifying the fat, skin, and glandular
   tissue in dedicated breast CT images. The classification method can be
   used for dense breast tissue quantification, radiation dose assessment,
   and other applications in breast imaging. (C) 2015 American Association

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work was to elucidate the molecular interactions
   leading to monoclonal antibody self-association and precipitation and
   utilize biophysical measurements to predict solubility behavior at high
   protein concentration. Two monoclonal antibodies (mAb-G and mAb-R)
   binding to overlapping epitopes were investigated. Precipitation of
   mAb-G solutions was most prominent at high ionic strength conditions and
   demonstrated strong dependence on ionic strength, as well as slight
   dependence on solution pH. At similar conditions no precipitation was
   observed for mAb-R solutions. Intermolecular interactions (interaction
   parameter, k(D)) related well with high concentration solubility
   behavior of both antibodies. Upon increasing buffer ionic strength,
   interactions of mAb-R tended to weaken, while those of mAb-G became more
   attractive. To investigate the role of amino acid sequence on
   precipitation behavior, mutants were designed by substituting the CDR of
   mAb-R into the mAb-G framework (GM-1) or deleting two hydrophobic
   residues in the CDR of mAb-G (GM-2). No precipitation was observed at
   high ionic strength for either mutant. The molecular interactions of
   mutants were similar in magnitude to those of mAb-R. The results suggest
   that presence of hydrophobic groups in the CDR of mAb-G may be
   responsible for compromising its solubility at high ionic strength
   conditions since deleting these residues mitigated the solubility issue.}},

   Pack-Year Smokers: Implications for Screening}},
Journal = {{JNCI-JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{107}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Based on current recommendations, 30+ pack-years of smoking
   are required for eligibility for low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer
   screening; former smokers must have quit within 15 years. We
   investigated whether current smokers with 20 to 29 pack-years have
   similar lung cancer risks as eligible former smokers and also whether
   they have a different demographic profile.
   Methods: The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening
   Trial (PLCO) was a randomly assigned screening trial of subjects age 55
   to 74 years with chest radiographs (CXR) used for lung cancer. Subjects
   completed a baseline questionnaire containing smoking history questions.
   Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age and sex, were utilized
   to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for various smoking history groups.
   Next, we utilized the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which
   inquired about smoking history and race/ethnicity, to analyze the
   demographic profiles of various high-risk smoking history categories.
   All statistical tests were two-sided.
   Results: The PLCO cohort included 18 114 former and 12 243 current
   LDCT-eligible smokers, plus 2283 20- to 29-pack-year current smokers.
   The hazard ratio for 20-to 29-pack-year current smokers compared with
   eligible (30+ pack-year) former smokers was 1.07 (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] = 0.75 to 1.5). Based on the NHIS, 10 million persons in
   the United States are currently LDCT eligible; an additional 1.6 million
   (16\%, 95\% CI = 13.6\% to 19.0\%) are 20-to 29-pack-year current
   smokers. The percentage increase in eligibles if 20-to 29-pack-year
   current smokers were included was substantially greater for women than
   men (22.2\%, 95\% CI = 17.9\% to 26.7\%; vs 12.2\%, 95\% CI = 9.3\% to
   15.3\%, P < .001) and for minorities than non-Hispanic whites (30.0\%,
   95\% CI = 24.2\% to 36.0\%; vs 14.1\%, 95\% CI = 11.1\% to 17.0\%, P <
   .001).
   Conclusion: The potential benefits and harms of recommending LDCT
   screening for 20 to 29-pack-year current smokers should be assessed.}},

Abstract = {{Background and rationale. Epidemics of hepatitis B and C are a public
   health burden, and their prevalence in Brazil varies among regions. We
   determined the prevalence of hepatitis markers in an urban university
   population in order to support the development of a comprehensive
   program for HBV immunization and HBV/HCV diagnosis. Students, employees,
   and visitors (n = 2,936, 31 years IQR 24.5-50, female = 69.0\% and
   81.1\% with at least 12 years of education) were enrolled from May to
   November 2013. Antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen
   (anti-HBs), against hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), and hepatitis B
   surface antigen (HBsAg) were detected with enzyme immunoassays and
   anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) antibodies with a chemiluminescence
   immunoassay. The results were confirmed with polymerase chain reaction
   for HCV and nucleic acid amplification test for hepatitis B virus (HBV).
   Results. The overall prevalence of markers among the participants was
   0.136\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.003-0.270) for HBsAg, 6.44\%
   (95\% CI: 5.55-7.33\%) for anti-HBc, 50.8\% (95\% CI: 48.9-52.7\%) for
   anti-HBs > 10 mIU/mL, and 0.44\% (95\% CI: 0.20-0.68) for anti-HCV.
   Almost 30.4\% had anti-HBs titers > 100 mIU/mL. Participants with a
   detectable HCV viral load (n = 9) were infected with genotype la.
   Conclusions. In an urban university population, in which 80\% of
   participants had > 11 years of education, prevalence increased with age,
   and self-declared ethnicity for anti-HBc and with age, marital status
   and professional activity for anti-HCV antibodies. A periodical offer of
   HCV rapid testing should be implemented, and HBsAg rapid testing should
   be offered to individuals above 20 years of age.}},

Abstract = {{Antithrombin III (ATIII) deficiency offers unique challenges to the
   anaesthetist in the perioperative setting due to the inherent
   thrombophilia, the anticoagulant therapies instituted and replacement of
   the deficient intrinsic natural anticoagulant. A particular challenge is
   the use of intrathecal anaesthesia, which requires a safe level of
   coagulation at the time of subarachnoid puncture. We describe the use of
   intrathecal anaesthesia on two occasions in a patient with ATIII
   deficiency who received human-derived ATIII concentrate as part of a
   perioperative anticoagulant regimen. The patient sustained no thrombotic
   or bleeding events. Our experience suggests that ATIII deficiency does
   not preclude the use of regional anaesthetic techniques so long as there
   is timely referral to a multidisciplinary perioperative service for
   anticoagulant management and that ATIII concentrate is used to ensure
   safe levels of ATIII throughout the perioperative period.}},

Abstract = {{Calabrian Provola cheese, an Italian typical dairy product, is commonly
   sold unwrapped with an expiry date of 45 d. The influence of different
   packagings and subsequent storage at 4 and 7 degrees C on maintaining
   cheese quality and prolonging its shelf life was evaluated. The
   following packaging systems were used: Polyamide/Polyethylene pouch
   under vacuum; Polyethylene/Polyethylene terephthalate lid over a
   Polyethylene/Ethylene vinyl alcohol/Polyvinyl Chloride + Polyvinyl
   alcohol thermoformed tray; Polyethylene/Ethylene vinyl
   alcohol/Polyamide/Polyethylene pouch. Concerning the two last systems,
   cheeses were packaged in a modified atmosphere (70:30 N-2:CO2). All
   studied packaging prolonged Calabrian Provola cheese shelf life to 65 d.
   In particular, the packaging in modified atmosphere with
   Polyethylene/Ethylene vinyl alcohol/Polyamide/Polyethylene pouch
   preserved Provola cheeses best, not only showing a decrease of the
   original total microbial count but also showing the lowest peroxide
   value and hardness at both temperatures of storage. The results of this
   study will help local Italian firms to expand their business in more
   distant markets.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Acute bacterial cellulitis of the leg (erysipelas) is a
   common problem involving considerable morbidity in dermatology practice
   in Africa. Previous studies conducted in Europe and North Africa have
   highlighted lymphoedema and toe-web intertrigo as independent factors
   associated with leg erysipelas. The aim of this case-control study was
   to identify risk factors associated with leg erysipelas in sub-Saharan
   Africa, within a different socio-economic and culture context.
   Patients and methods. We conducted a prospective case-control study in
   hospital dermatology departments in 8 sub-Saharan African countries over
   a 12-month period (October 2013 to September 2014). Each case of acute
   leg cellulitis was matched with 2 controls for age ( 5 years) and sex.
   We analysed the general and local factors.
   Results. During the study period, 364 cases (223 female, 141 male) were
   matched with 728 controls. The mean age was 42.15 +/- 15.15 years for
   patients and 42.11 +/- 36 years for controls. Multivariate analysis
   showed the following to be independent risk factors associated with leg
   erysipelas in our study: obesity (odds ratio {[}OR] = 2.82; 95\%
   confidence interval: 2.11-3.76), lymphoedema (OR= 3.87, 95\%Cl:
   2.17-6.89), voluntary cosmetic depigmentation (OR = 4.29, 95\%Cl:
   2.35-7.83), neglected traumatic wound (OR= 37.2, 95\%Cl: 24.9-57.72) and
   toe-web intertrigo (OR= 37.86, 95\%Cl: 22.27-64.5).
   Conclusion. The results of this study confirms the major role of local
   risk factors (toe-web intertrigo, tymphoedema) previously identified in
   other geographical settings. However, the originality of our study
   consists of the identification of voluntary cosmetic depigmentation as a
   risk factor for leg erysipelas in sub-Saharan Africa. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Context. - Emm1-type group A Streptococcus (GAS), or Streptococcus
   pyogenes, is mostly responsible for invasive infections such as
   necrotizing fasciitis (NF) and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome
   (STSS). The recommended treatment of severe invasive GAS infections is a
   combination of clindamycin and penicillin. Until 2012, almost all emm1
   isolates were susceptible to clindamycin.
   Objectives. - We aimed to identify the phenotypic and genotypic
   characteristics of emm1 GAS clone resistant to clindamycin.
   Methods. - GAS strains were characterized by emm sequence typing,
   detection of genes encoding pyrogenic exotoxins or superantigens.
   Cluster analysis was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
   (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Antibiotic susceptibility
   was assessed using disk diffusion and resistance genes were detected by
   PCR.
   Results. - A total of 1321 GAS invasive isolates were analyzed between
   January 2011 and December 2012. The overall number of invasive isolates
   resistant to clindamycin was 52 (3.9\%); seven of them were emm1
   isolates. All isolates had the same genomic markers: macrolide
   resistance due to the presence of the erm(B) gene, emm subtype 1.0, the
   same toxin or superantigen profile, PFGE pattern and sequence type.
   Conclusion. - This is the first description of highly virulent GAS emm1
   isolates resistant to clindamycin in France. This article strengthens
   the need for monitoring the epidemiology of invasive GAS strains as they
   could lead to changes in treatment guidelines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson

   flexible work schedule is negatively correlated with the choice of using
   a car during metro closures. Finally, the overall performance of the

Abstract = {{Objectives. To detail the development of ester-free thiol-ene dental
   resins with enhanced mechanical performance, limited potential for water
   uptake/leachables/degradation and low polymerization shrinkage stress.
   Methods. Thiol-terminated oligomers were prepared via a thiol-Michael
   reaction and a bulky tetra-allyl monomer containing urethane linkages
   was synthesized. The experimental oligomers and/or monomers were
   photopolymerized using visible light activation. Several thiol-ene
   formulations were investigated and their performance ranked by
   comparisons of the thermo-mechanical properties, polymerization
   shrinkage stress, water sorption/solubility, and reactivity with respect
   to a control comprising a conventional BisGMA/TEGDMA dental resin.
   Results. The ester-free thiol-ene formulations had significantly lower
   viscosities, water sorption and solubility than the BisGMA/TEGDMA
   control. Depending on the resin, the limiting functional conversions
   were equivalent to or greater than that of BisGMA/TEGDMA. At comparable
   conversions, lower shrinkage stress values were achieved by the
   thiol-ene systems. The polymerization shrinkage stress was dramatically
   reduced when the tetra-allyl monomer was used as the ene in ester-free
   thiol-ene mixtures. Although exhibiting lower Young's modulus, flexural
   strength, and glass transition temperatures, the toughness values
   associated with thiol-ene resins were greater than that of the
   BisGMA/TEGDMA control. In addition, the thiol-ene polymerization
   resulted in highly uniform polymer networks as indicated by the narrow
   tan delta peak widths.
   Significance. Employing the developed thiol-ene resins in dental
   composites will reduce shrinkage stress and moisture absorption and form
   tougher materials. Furthermore, their low viscosities are expected to
   enable higher loadings of functionalized micro/nano-scale filler
   particles relevant for practical dental systems. (C) 2015 Academy of

Title = {{Provision of intrauterine contraception in association with first
   trimester induced abortion reduces the need of repeat abortion:
   first-year results of a randomized controlled trial}},

Abstract = {{STUDY QUESTION: Can the need of subsequent abortion be reduced by
   providing intrauterine contraception as a part of the abortion service?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: Provision of intrauterine devices (IUDs) in association
   with first trimester abortion more than halved the incidence of repeat
   abortion during the first year of follow-up.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Following abortion, the incidence of subsequent
   abortion is high, up to 30-40\%. In cohort studies, intrauterine
   contraception has reduced the need of repeat abortion by 60-70\%.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A randomized controlled trial. The main
   outcome measure was the incidence of subsequent induced abortions during
   the follow-up. Altogether 751 women seeking first trimester induced
   abortion were recruited and randomized into two groups. Randomization
   was accomplished by computer-assisted permuted-block randomization with
   random block sizes of four to six. The investigators did not participate
   in randomization, which was done before commencing the study. The
   participants were recruited between 18 October 2010 and 21 January 2013.
   PARTICIPANTS, SETTINGS, METHODS: The inclusion criteria were age >= 18
   years, duration of pregnancy <= 12 weeks, accepting intrauterine
   contraception, residence in Helsinki and signing the informed consent
   form. Women with contraindications to intrauterine contraception, such
   as uterine anomaly, acute genital infection or pap-smear change
   requiring surgical treatment were ineligible to participate.
   This study was conducted in collaboration between the Department of
   Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki
   University Hospital, and Centralized family planning of the City of
   Helsinki.
   The intervention group (n = 375) was provided with intrauterine
   contraception (either the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system
   or copper-releasing intrauterine device) immediately following surgical
   abortion (18.1\%) or at a follow-up 2-4 weeks after medical abortion
   (81.9\%). Women in the control group were prescribed oral contraceptives
   and advised to contact their primary healthcare unit for a follow-up
   visit and further contraceptive services according to national
   guidelines. The women were followed-up to 28 February 2014 by using the
   Finnish National Abortion Registry, Helsinki University Hospital
   electronic database and clinical follow-up visit at 1 year.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The median age of the whole study
   group was 27 years and 44\% had a history of induced abortion(s). During
   the follow-up year the number of women requesting subsequent abortion
   was significantly lower in the intervention than in the control group
   (9/375 {[}2.4\%] versus 20/373 {[}5.4\%], difference -3.0 {[}95\% CI
   -6.0 to -0.2] percentage points, P = 0.038, according to
   intention-to-treat analysis and 5/346 {[}1.4\%] versus 20/357 {[}5.6\%],
   difference -4.2(-7.2 to -1.4) percentage points, P = 0.003, according
   toper-protocol analysis, respectively). Provision of intrauterine
   contraception was safe with rate of infection and expulsion similar to
   those reported previously.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The powercalculation was calculated
   for a 5-year follow-up. However, significant differences between the two
   groups were already seen after 1 year. The present study was performed
   in a single clinic, where, similar to 15\% of all abortions in Finland
   are performed.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In order to decrease the need of
   subsequent abortions, IUDs should be provided at the time of abortion.}},

Abstract = {{mRNA reprogramming results in the generation of genetically stable
   induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells while avoiding the risks of genomic
   integration. Previously published mRNA reprogramming protocols have
   proven to be inconsistent and time-consuming and mainly restricted to
   fibroblasts, thereby demonstrating the need for a simple but
   reproducible protocol applicable to various cell types. So far there
   have been no published reports using mRNA to reprogram any cell type
   derived from human blood. Nonmodified synthetic mRNAs are immunogenic
   and activate cellular defense mechanisms, which can lead to cell death
   and inhibit mRNA translation upon repetitive transfection. Hence, to
   overcome RNA-related toxicity we combined nonmodified reprogramming
   mRNAs (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, cMYC, NANOG, and LIN28 {[}OSKMNL]) with immune
   evasion mRNAs (E3, K3, and B18R {[}EKB]) from vaccinia virus.
   Additionally, we included mature, double-stranded microRNAs (miRNAs)
   from the 302/367 cluster, which are known to enhance the reprogramming
   process, to develop a robust reprogramming protocol for the generation
   of stable iPS cell lines from both human fibroblasts and human
   blood-outgrowth endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Our novel
   combination of RNAs enables the cell to tolerate repetitive
   transfections for the generation of stable iPS cell colonies from human
   fibroblasts within 11 days while requiring only four transfections.
   Moreover, our method resulted in the first known mRNA-vectored
   reprogramming of human blood-derived EPCs within 10 days while requiring
   only eight daily transfections.}},

Abstract = {{Since OSIRIS started acquiring high-resolution observations of the
   surface of the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, over one
   hundred meter-sized bright spots have been identified in numerous types
   of geomorphologic regions, but mostly located in areas receiving low
   insolation. The bright spots are either clustered, in debris fields
   close to decameter-high cliffs, or isolated without structural relation
   to the surrounding terrain. They can be up to ten times brighter than
   the average surface of the comet at visible wavelengths and display a
   significantly bluer spectrum. They do not exhibit significant changes
   over a period of a few weeks. All these observations are consistent with
   exposure of water ice at the surface of boulders produced by dislocation
   of the weakly consolidated layers that cover large areas of the nucleus.
   Laboratory experiments show that under simulated comet surface
   conditions, analog samples acquire a vertical stratification with an
   uppermost porous mantle of refractory dust overlaying a layer of hard
   ice formed by recondensation or sintering under the insulating dust
   mantle. The evolution of the visible spectrophotometric properties of
   samples during sublimation is consistent with the contrasts of
   brightness and color seen at the surface of the nucleus. Clustered
   bright spots are formed by the collapse of overhangs that is triggered
   by mass wasting of deeper layers. Isolated spots might be the result of
   the emission of boulders at low velocity that are redepositioned in
   other regions.}},

Abstract = {{Gap surface plasmon (GSP) based metasurfaces, consisting of a
   subwavelength thin dielectric spacer sandwiched between a metal film and
   an array of metal nanobricks, have in recent years attracted
   considerable attention due to the ease of fabrication and the
   possibility to control both the phase and amplitude of the reflected
   light. In this work, we numerically investigate the influence of metal
   properties on the performance of GSP-based metasurfaces, considering in
   detail (at the wavelength lambda = 800 nm) the typical plasmonic metal -
   gold, the alternative plasmonic material titanium nitride, and the ideal
   metal (i.e., perfect electric conductor). We demonstrate that the
   plasmonic properties of non-ideal metals, in addition to the possibility
   to engineer the amplitude of the reflected light, also lead to a wider
   range of reflection phase control for relatively small unit cell sizes
   of similar to lambda/3 as compared to the metasurfaces using the ideal
   metal. Moreover, titanium nitride is found to represent a viable
   alternative (to gold) material that promises less stringent requirements
   when designing amplitude and phase-gradient GSP-based metasurfaces. (C)

Title = {{Assessing the bioavailability of L-lysine sulfate compared to L-lysine
   HCl in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)}},
Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{448}},
Pages = {{327-333}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{A growth trial was conducted to determine relative bioavailability
   between two commercially available sources of supplemental lysine in
   rainbow trout. A basal diet, which was formulated to be deficient in
   lysine while meeting all other known nutritional requirements for
   rainbow trout was supplemented with increasing levels (0.1, 0.2, 0.4 \&
   0.6\%) of L-lysine on an equimolar basis from one of two supplemental
   lysine sources; L-lysine sulfate (Bio-lys) or L-lysine HCl. Diets were
   fed in triplicate to groups of rainbow trout (IBW = 25 +/- 0.6 g) for 12
   weeks using a pair-feeding protocol. Fish which received diets
   containing supplemental lysine from either source exhibited improved
   weight gain (p < 0.05), growth rate (p < 0.05), retained nitrogen (p <
   0.05), retained nitrogen efficiency (p < 0.05) and feed efficiency (p <
   0.01) compared to fish which received the unsupplemented basal diet.
   Similarly increasing levels of lysine supplementation from either source
   resulted in improved performance of all aforementioned parameters with
   performance plateauing as total lysine content of diets approached
   recommended lysine requirements for rainbow trout. Performance
   parameters specifically, weight gain (g/fish), growth rate (TGC \%) and
   carcass retained nitrogen (g/fish), were regressed against dietary
   supplemental lysine inclusion and relative bioavailability compared
   between sources of synthetic lysine using a linear slope-ratio assay.
   Based on the performance criterion measured no statistical differences
   (p > 0.05) in bioavailability were observed between these two sources.
   Therefore, based on equimolar levels of L-lysine supplementation these
   two sources of supplemental lysine are equally available to rainbow
   trout.
   Statement of relevance: The authors of this manuscript believe that
   there is a gap in the literature concerning the relative bioavailability
   between two prevalent sources of lysine to commercially relevant
   aquaculture species. Common plant protein ingredients, in particular
   cereal grain by-products, contain low levels of lysine. In order to
   formulate economical feeds, feed formulators supplement these primarily
   plant protein diets with supplemental sources of lysine in order to
   create economical diets while meeting all nutritional requirements of
   the animal. As the sources of lysine tested in this study, L-lysine HCl
   and L-lysine sulfate, are both used in the formulation of aqua feeds the
   relative ability of these two sources to meet the lysine requirement of
   rainbow trout (a major species cultured in Canada) will allow for feed
   formulators to use economic feed ingredients, while being confident the
   source of supplemental lysine they are using (either L-lysine HCl or
   L-lysine sulfate) will be used equally well to meet the fishes' lysine
   requirement. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this prospective, observational study was to determine the
   accuracy of a real-time continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) in
   children with septic shock. Subjects and Methods: Children aged 30 days
   to 18 years admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with septic
   shock were included. A real-time CGMS sensor was used to obtain
   interstitial glucose readings. CGMS readings were compared statistically
   with simultaneous laboratory blood glucose (BG). Results: Nineteen
   children were included, and 235 pairs of BG-CGMS readings were obtained.
   BG and CGMS had a correlation coefficient of 0.61 (P < 0.001) and a
   median relative absolute difference of 17.29\%. On Clarke's error grid
   analysis, 222 ( 94.5\%) readings were in the clinically acceptable zones
   (A and B). When BG was < 70, 70-180, and > 180 mg/dL, 44\%, 100\%, and
   76.9\% readings were in zones A and B, respectively (P < 0.001). The
   accuracy of CGMS was not affected by the presence of edema, acidosis,
   vasopressors, steroids, or renal replacement therapy. On receiver
   operating characteristics curve analysis, a CGMS reading < 97 mg/dL
   predicted hypoglycemia (sensitivity 85.2\%, specificity 75\%, area under
   the curve {[}AUC] =0.85). A reading > 141 mg/dL predicted hyperglycemia
   (sensitivity 84.6\%, specificity 89.6\%, AUC =0.87). Conclusion: CGMS
   provides a fairly, accurate estimate of BG in children with septic
   shock. It is unaffected by a variety of clinical variables. The accuracy
   over extremes of blood sugar may be a concern. We recommend larger
   studies to evaluate its use for the early detection of hypoglycemia and
   hyperglycemia.}},

   indigenous population and immigrants, approaching health holistically;
   the physical, mental and emotional status of the individual works as a
   whole, the elements interacting with each other in dynamic interaction
   with the natural and social environment. METHOD The participants
   included 303 Greeks (58.3\%), 114 immigrants from Albania (21.9\%) and
   103 returnees from the former Soviet Union (19.8\%). They had an age
   range of 16-64 years, mean 36.3 years, and 257 (49.4\%) were male, and
   263 (50.6\%) female. Their perception of their general health was
   elicited with the SF-36 questionnaire which assesses the level of
   physical and mental health. The WHO Quality of Life Questionnaire was
   used to assess physical, psychological-emotional, interpersonal and
   social well-being. RESULTS The returnees from the Soviet Union recorded
   lower scores on the scales measuring physical role (i.e., greater
   fatigue and tiredness), and vitality and energy. Low scores for physical
   and social well-being were associated with tiredness and fatigue, but

   these results using an alternative measure of humanization. In both
   Experiments 2 and 3 sequential meditational analysis revealed that
   counter-stereotypes produced feelings of surprise which, in turn,
   elicited a cognitive process of expectancy violation which resulted in
   attenuated stereotyped emotions and an enhanced use of uniquely human
   characteristics to describe the outgroup. The findings extend research
   supporting the usefulness of counter-stereotype exposure for reducing
   prejudice and highlight its positive impact on intergroup emotions. (C)

Abstract = {{Here we show that by using a combined experimental and theoretical
   approach it is possible to separate the contributions to the interaction
   strength between epitaxial graphene and transition metal surfaces
   arising from the geometrical and chemical properties of the supporting
   surfaces. This has been achieved by performing photoelectron
   measurements and numerical simulations of the C1s core level spectral
   distribution for a large number of graphene-metal systems, which have
   been obtained by systematic intercalation of different metals (Co, Rh,
   Ir and Ru) at the graphene-Ir(111) and graphene-Ru(0001) interfaces. We
   demonstrate that the chemical species of the substrate's topmost layer
   plays a major role in determining the coupling between graphene and its
   substrate. Moreover, we show that both the experimental and the
   theoretical C1s spectral centres of mass are in linear relationship with
   the d-band centre of the transition metal substrate, which is considered
   a reliable descriptor of the graphene-substrate interaction strength.
   Our results provide a simple method to determine and tailor the
   properties of graphene-metal contacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Currently, there is a worldwide decline in the participation of women in
   the information technology (IT) profession and education. This article
   continues the existing discourse on women in IT by discussing the South
   African domestic and IT work environments. The aim is to understand
   whether South African women experience similar levels of career problems
   in the IT industry as their international counterparts. Using critical
   interpretive analysis, we used the experiences of 48 women working in
   the private sector IT firms to investigate not only what attracts women
   in South Africa to the IT industry but also what discourages them from
   following a career in this field. The data were collected by means of an
   anonymous online questionnaire consisting of open-and close-ended
   questions. This study provides an insight into the impact of domestic
   influences on women in the IT industry in South Africa. It also
   contributes to communities, such as, feminists, academia, practitioners,
   or governments, in the creation of an emancipation theory or a series of
   interventions to improve the situation for women in the South African IT

Journal = {{LEGAL MEDICINE}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Establishing the postmortem interval is a very complex problem in
   Forensic Science despite the existence of several macro- and microscopic
   methods. In the case of ocular methods, most are based on an evaluation
   of the biochemical components of the vitreous humour 24-36 h after
   death, but, to our knowledge, there are no studies on the relationship
   between lens and the postmortem interval. Since the lens is protected
   between the vitreous humour and the aqueous humour inside the eyeball,
   postmortem changes are assumed to start later in the lens. To evaluate
   the usefulness of using the lens to establish the postmortem interval,
   we examined 80 rabbit lens enucleated 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after death,
   assessing changes in sphericity and absorbance at different wavelengths
   and any histological alterations. Both sphericity and absorbance were
   seen to decrease to a statistically significant extent, and there was a
   gradual loss of structure and organisation of the lens components as a
   function of the postmortem interval. Modifications in the lens were seen
   to be useful for determining the postmortem interval between 24 and 96h.

Title = {{Examination of the Early Diagnostic Applicability of Active Dynamic
   Thermography for Burn Wound Depth Assessment and Concept Analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BURN CARE \& RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{626-635}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite advances in perfusion imaging, burn wound imaging technology
   continues to lag behind that of other fields. Quantification of blood
   flow is able to predict time for healing, but clear assessment of burn
   depth is still questionable. Active dynamic thermography (ADT) is a
   noncontact imaging modality capable of distinguishing tissue of
   different thermal conductivities. Utilizing the abnormal heat transfer
   properties of the burn zones, we examined whether ADT was useful in the
   determination of burn depth in a model of early burn wound evaluation.
   Duroc pigs (castrated male; n = 3) were anesthetized, and two burns were
   created with an aluminum billet at 3 and 12 seconds. These contact times
   resulted in superficial partial and deep partial thickness burn wounds,
   respectively. ADT and laser Doppler imaging (LDI) imaging were performed
   every 30 minutes postburn for a total of five imaging sessions ending
   150 minutes postburn. For ADT, imaging excitation was performed for
   42-120 seconds with dual quartz-infrared lamps, and subsequent infrared
   image capture was performed for 300 seconds. MATLAB-assisted image
   analysis was performed to determine burn zone region of interest thermal
   relaxation and characteristic patterns. LDI was performed with a moorLDI
   system, and biopsies were captured for histology following the
   150-minute imaging session. Both ADT and LDI imaging modalities are able
   to detect different physical properties at 30, 60, 90 120, and 150
   minutes postburn with statistical significance (P < 0.05). Resultant ADT
   cooling curves characterize greater differences with greater stimulation
   and a potentially more identifiable differential cooling characteristic.
   Histological analysis confirmed burn depth. This preliminary work
   confirms that ADT can measure burn depth and is deserving of further
   research either as a stand-alone imaging technology or in combination
   with a device to assess perfusion.}},

   during three consecutive lactations (from 2008 to 2010). All milking
   animals belonged to the same flock and were kept under identical
   experimental conditions. During the milking period (from weaning of kids
   at the age of 45 +/- 5 days till the drying off) regular monthly milk
   yield recordings were conducted (AT method). During mean lactation
   length of 249.5 days German fawn goats produced 646.7 kg of milk
   containing on average 3.41 \% of milk fat and 3.10 \% of protein.
   Significant differences were found in the mean daily and lactation milk
   yield, and in milk fat content between different years of research, with
   the lowest milk yield determined in the year with the lowest total
   quantity of precipitation (2009). Also a progressive increase (P<0.001)
   of the mean lactation milk yield from the first (375.71 kg) to the
   fourth lactation (786.55 kg) was observed, and a similar trend was found
   for the produced quantity of milk fat and protein during the milking
   period. The mean litter size of German fawn goats was 1.85 kids, while
   the goats with the two or more kids in the litter produced more milk,
   milk fat and protein than those with one kid (P>0.05). The mean birth
   weight of German fawn kids (3.77 kg) was positively correlated (P<0.01)
   with the total quantity of milk produced and the quantity of fat and
   proteins produced and, as expected, negatively correlated with the
   number of kids in the litter (P<0.001).}},

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{485-517}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The probabilistic characterization of the relationship between two or
   more random variables calls for a notion of dependence. Dependence
   modeling leads to mathematical and statistical challenges, and recent
   developments in extremal dependence concepts have drawn a lot of
   attention to probability and its applications in several disciplines.
   The aim of this paper is to review various concepts of extremal positive
   and negative dependence, including several recently established results,
   reconstruct their history, link them to probabilistic optimization
   problems, and provide a list of open questions in this area. While the
   concept of extremal positive dependence is agreed upon for random
   vectors of arbitrary dimensions, various notions of extremal negative
   dependence arise when more than two random variables are involved. We
   review existing popular concepts of extremal negative dependence given
   in literature and introduce a novel notion, which in a general sense
   includes the existing ones as particular cases. Even if much of the
   literature on dependence is focused on positive dependence, we show that
   negative dependence plays an equally important role in the solution of
   many optimization problems. While the most popular tool used nowadays to
   model dependence is that of a copula function, in this paper we use the
   equivalent concept of a set of rearrangements. This is not only for
   historical reasons. Rearrangement functions describe the relationship
   between random variables in a completely deterministic way, allow a
   deeper understanding of dependence itself, and have several advantages
   on the approximation of solutions in a broad class of optimization
   problems.}},

   five-membered chelate rings with bite angles of 71.37(9)A degrees,
   72.7(2)A degrees and 70.7(3)A degrees for the bipy, phen and Me(2)phen

   a soft-tissue mass in the cricopharyngeal region with involvement of
   posterior wall of the laryngeal framework. The endoscopic biopsy was
   suggestive of biphasic synovial sarcoma, which was confirmed by
   immunohistochemistry. The patient underwent surgery followed by
   radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite multimodality, management patient
   developed lung metastasis, and survived for 10 months only. There are no

Abstract = {{Bacgraund/Aim. Most often injuries of brachial plexus and its branches
   disable the injured from using their arms and/or hands. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the etiology and mechanisms of median and ulnar
   forearm nerves injuries. Methods. This retrospective cohort study
   included 99 patients surgically treated in the Clinic of Neurosurgery,
   Clinical Center of Serbia, from January 1st, 2000 to December 31st,
   2010. All data are obtained from the patients' histories. Results. The
   majority of the injured patients were male, 81 (81.8\%), while only 18
   (18.2\%) were females, both mainly with nerve injuries of the distal
   forearm 75 (75.6\%). Two injury mechanisms were present, transection in
   85 patients and traction and contusion in 14 of the patients. The most
   frequent etiological factor of nerve injuries was cutting, in 61 of the
   patients. Nerve injuries are often associated with other injuries. In
   the studied patients there were 22 vascular injuries, 33 muscle and
   tendon injuries and 20 bone fractures. Conclusion. The majority of those
   patients with peripheral nerve injuries are represented in the working
   age population, which is a major socioeconomic problem. In our study 66
   out of 99 patients were between 17 and 40 years old, in the most
   productive age. The fact that the majority of patients had nerve
   injuries of the distal forearm and that they are operated within the
   first 6 months after injury, promises them good functional prognosis.}},

   population}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},

Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{193-200}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Fetal exposure to five parabens was investigated due to their
   endocrine-disrupting potential and possible impact on fetal development.
   Body burdens occurring from real-world exposures were determined
   typically as total concentrations after conjugate hydrolysis in 181
   maternal urine and 38 umbilical cord blood plasma samples from a
   multiethnic cohort of 185 predominantly-black, pregnant women recruited
   in Brooklyn, New York between 2007/9. For 33 participants, both sample
   types (maternal urine and cord blood) were available. Methyl(MePB),
   ethyl- (EtPB), propyl- (PrPB), butyl- (BuPB), and benzylparaben (BePB)
   were detected in 100, 73.5, 100,663 and 0.0\% of the urine samples at
   median concentrations of 279, 1.44, 75.3, 039, and <0.02 mu g/L,
   respectively. Median concentrations of MePB and PrPB were, respectively
   4.4- and 8.7-fold higher compared to those reported previously for the
   general U.S. population (NHANES, 2005/6). Listed in the order above, the
   five parabens were detected in 97.4, 94.7, 47.4, 47.4, and 44.7\% of
   cord blood plasma samples at median total concentrations of 25.0, 0.36,
   <0.27, <0.09, and <0.10 mu g/L, respectively. Free MePB, EtPB, and PrPB
   were detected in a subset of cord blood plasma samples at, respectively,
   3.9, 71.7, and 6.4\% of their total concentrations, whereas free BuPB
   and BePB were not detected. Literature data and those reported here show
   the urban community studied here to rank highest in the world for MePB
   and PrPB exposure in pregnant women, whereas it ranks among the lowest
   for EtPB and BuPB. This study is the first to report the occurrence of
   parabens in human umbilical cord blood. Maternal exposure to parabens is
   widespread, and substantial differences were found to exist between
   communities and countries both in the spectrum and degree of paraben
   exposures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the first paper of this series we have shown for hydrophilic coated
   Au nanoparticles that capillary electrophoresis in combination with
   Taylor dispersion analysis in fused silica capillaries with an inner
   diameter of 75 mu m allows for the unbiased precise determination of the
   number-weighted mean hydrodynamic diameter, the zeta potential and the
   effective charge number, although mobility corrected double layer
   polarization has to be taken into account.
   In this second paper we investigate whether the modified approximate
   analytic expression developed by Ohshima (2001) permits the calculation
   of calibration lines and the concomitant conversion of electropherograms
   into number-weighted particle radius distributions. We show that with
   the method developed size distributions are obtained which are
   independent of the measurement conditions. These size distributions are
   much narrower than those obtained via dynamic light scattering and data
   evaluation by the CONTIN algorithm. Capillary electrophoresis together
   with the proposed data evaluation method reveals that the analyzed
   nanoparticle populations have very narrow size distributions with a
   width of 2-4 nm. The hydrodynamic radius distributions of the coated NPs
   are only slightly broader than the solid particle radius distribution of
   the Au-NP cores. The presence of monomodal/bimodal size distributions is
   confirmed by asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Oil sludge (OS) containing a lot of CaCO3 is a large quantity waste
   product in the production of oil. OS was used as a material to
   synthesize the ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA)/OS/ammonium polyphosphate
   (APP) composites. The synergistic flame retardant effects between OS and
   APP in EVA composites were studied using limiting oxygen index (LOI),
   cone calorimeter test (CCT), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), smoke
   density test (SDT), and thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared
   spectrometry. The results showed that the addition of a given amount of
   APP apparently increased the LOI value. The CCT data indicated that heat
   release rates (HRR) of EVA/OS/APP composites decreased greatly in
   comparison with that of EVA and EVA/OS composites. The morphology and
   structures of residues investigated by SEM gave positive evidence that
   char layers formed from the EVA/OS/APP composites were more compact than
   that from the EVA/OS composites. The SDT results showed that APP was
   helpful to smoke suppression. The TG-FTIR is used to characterize the
   thermal degradation mechanism of samples and the volatilized products
   formed on the thermal degradation. (c) 2015 American Institute of

Abstract = {{cis-Epoxysuccinate hydrolase (CESH) is efficient in catalyzing
   conversion of cis-epoxysuccinate into L-(+)-tartaric acid, and the
   enzyme has been successfully applied in industry. However, low
   thermostability limits its use in large-scale applications. To improve
   the stability of CESH, we conducted directed evolution and used
   strategies belonging to semi-rational redesign. Mutant 1X-1 (Q122R) was
   harvested from directed evolution. Its half-life at 50 degrees C
   (t(1/2), (50 degrees c)) increased from 8.5 min to 31.6 min, and the
   T-50(15) (temperature at which the activity of enzyme decreased by 50\%
   in 15 min) increased from 44.0 degrees C to 49.5 degrees C.
   Substitutions F26V and I83R predicted by multiple sequence alignments
   were introduced into mutant 1X-1, and the t(1/2,50 degrees C) and
   T-50(15) of mutant 3X (Q122R, F26V and I83R) increased to 170.8 min and
   55.4 degrees C. Simulated mutation based on in silico structural
   modelling was used in constructing mutant 5X (Q122R, F26V, I83R, D8K and
   S9OR), for which the t(1/2,50 degrees C) and T-50(15) increased to 237.1
   min and 62.4 degrees C, respectively. Site-saturated mutagenesis was
   employed on amino acid residues Asp-8, Phe-26, Ile-83, Ser-90, and
   Gln-122 to maximize the thermostability of mutant 5X. Mutant 5X-1
   (Q122R, F26W, I83R, D8K and S9OR) was isolated; its t(1/2),(50 degrees
   C) increased to 293.2 min, 34.5-fold that of the wild-type enzyme and
   the T-50(15) increased to 64.8 degrees C. Moreover, the effective
   working ranges of pH of mutant 5X-1 extended to 5.0-10.0 from 8.0-9.0

Abstract = {{The effects of texture and grain size on the magnetic flux density and
   core loss (50-20 kHz) of 0.23 mm thick cold-rolled high silicon steel
   sheets are investigated by means of electron back-scattered diffraction
   (EBSD), loss separation, and anisotropy parameter (epsilon) calculation.
   A model of the hysteresis loss coefficient k(h) considering average
   grain size and e is established. The magnetic flux density at 800 A/m
   (B-8) is closely related to the volume fraction of eta-fiber-oriented
   grains, while the magnetic flux density at 5000 A/m (B-50) is closely
   related to the volume fractions of gamma- and lambda-fiber-oriented
   grains in high silicon steel. The hysteresis loss of high silicon steel
   can be greatly reduced by increasing the grain size and optimizing the
   texture of the sheets. Although increases in frequencies decrease the
   effect of texture On core loss, the effect cannot be ignored. As
   annealing temperature and time increase, the relative difference in core
   loss between the rolling direction (RD) and the transverse direction
   (TD) is maintained at higher frequencies because of increases in grain
   size, decreases in gamma texture, and maintenance of a strong eta
   texture. Texture and grain size jointly affect the high-frequency core
   loss of high silicon steel. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fourteen metal/metalloid elements and sixteen polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) within biochars were quantified to investigate how
   heat treatment temperatures (HTTs) and feedstocks affect their
   concentration and composition. Concentrations and composition of
   metals/metalloids were strongly dependent upon feedstocks rather than
   HTTs. HTTs significantly affected concentrations and composition of
   PAHs. The highest concentration of PAHs was observed for plant
   residue-derived biochars (PLABs) produced at 450 degrees C and the
   opposite result was for animal waste-derived bichars. High mineral
   content was responsible for depolymerization of organic matter (OM),
   which facilitated high production of PAHs. High HTTs pyrolysis or
   combustion PAHs (COMB) of PLABs possibly blocks their micropores derived
   from other components within OM and leads to a decline of CO2-surface
   areas (CO2-SAs). Concentration of Sigma COMB or individual PAH was
   affected by biochar properties, including composition and contents of
   functional groups, ash content, and CO2-SAs. PLABs produced at 600
   degrees C were recommended for low toxicity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this study, methane/air combustion in a two-zone catalytic alumina
   pileup-pellets burner with equivalence ratios varying from 0.55 to 0.70
   was researched. The catalytic alumina pileup-pellets were designed by
   directly depositing perovskite LaMn0.4Co0.6O3 on inert alumina
   pileup-pellets supports. Flame stability limits, pressure drops, flame
   temperatures, flue gas temperatures, and pollutants emissions of both
   catalytic and inert burners with different pellet diameters were
   investigated. The flame stability limits expanded as equivalence ratio
   or pellet diameter increased. The flame stability limits were also
   increased by depositing the perovskite catalyst. The pressure drops of
   catalytic burners were lower than those inert burners in both reaction
   and cold flows. More uniform axial temperature distributions were
   obtained for catalytic burners than for inert burners. Flame
   temperatures and flue gas temperatures were significantly reduced for
   catalytic burners compared with inert burners, as were pollutants
   emissions for unburned hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and
   nitrogen oxides (NOX). The HC emissions reduced as either pellet
   diameter or inlet velocity increased. The HC emissions of catalytic
   burners (less than 550 ppm) were significantly lower than those inert
   burners (ranging from 900 to 2750 ppm). The CO emissions of catalytic
   burners reduced significantly at lower velocities (S < 35 cm/s) and were
   almost unchanged at a level below 50 ppm, at higher velocities (S > 35
   cm/s). The CO emissions of catalytic burners were sensitive to changes
   in pellet diameters at lower velocities (S < 20 cm/s). The NOX emissions
   of catalytic burners (less than 2 ppm) were significantly lower than
   those inert burners (ranging from 4 to 13 ppm). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Background. Children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease (CKD)
   suffer from fewer classical risk factors than adults (e.g. age, smoking
   and diabetes) but a similar burden of uremia-associated risk factors.
   Studies investigating long-term survival of patients with childhood
   onset CKD have shown a high mortality, particularly from cardiovascular
   disease (CVD).
   Objectives. Review of the current evidence for cardiovascular
   comorbidity of children, adolescents and young adults with CKD.
   Material and Methods. This article presents the results of a selective
   literature search of the PubMed database.
   Results and conclusion. Children and adolescents with CKD as a rule have
   no symptoms of CVD. Studies of surrogate end points with sensitive
   non-invasive methods have shown that starting from CKD stage II, the
   majority of young patients have characteristic changes resembling
   calcifying arteriopathy. Cross-sectional studies could show an increase
   of local (carotid artery) and systemic vascular stiffness, asmeasured by
   the pulsewave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AI) and an increase
   in intima media thickness (carotid artery and femoral artery) as well as
   calcification of coronary arteries and heart valves. Cardiac findings
   included left ventricular hypertrophy, frequent systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, regional abnormalities of cardiac wallmotion and, in some
   instances, myocardial stunning. A current multicenter observational
   study, the 4C study, is being carried out to characterize the
   prevalence, extent and progression of cardiovascular comorbidity in
   children with CKD stages III-V and analyze associations with progression
   of CKD.}},

Abstract = {{We performed a retrospective cohort study between 2002 and 2014 to
   compare liver transplantation outcomes between recipients of grafts from
   donors older than and younger than the age of 80 years. Numerical
   variables were compared with the Student t test when their distribution
   was normal and the Mann-Whitney test when it was not, whereas
   categorical variables were compared with Pearson chi-squared test or
   Fisher test, as appropriate; P < .05 was considered significant. The
   study included 312 patients with organs from donors younger than 80
   years of age and 17 with organs from older donors. The 2 recipient
   groups did not significantly differ in weight, height, gender, body mass
   index (BMI), CHILD or MELD score, intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital
   stay, need for intraoperative hemoderivatives, postreperfusion syndrome,
   biliary or vascular complications, ischemic cholangiopathy, number of
   repeat surgeries, graft rejection, retransplantation, or survival at 6
   months. Although earlier studies considered livers from elderly donors
   to be suboptimal, our results support the proposition that octogenarian
   donors can be an excellent source of liver grafts.}},

Abstract = {{Prolactin is a recognized platelet co-stimulator due to enhancement of
   ADP-induced platelet aggregation, and hence participates in the
   atherosclerotic process. Studies had shown that human adipose tissue
   produces PRL as well as expresses the PRL receptor (PRLR), which
   highlights a previously unappreciated action of PRL as a cytokine
   involved in adipose tissue function. The aim of our study was to asses
   whether prolactin level is associated with the presence of
   cardiovascular risk in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
   and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). This case-control study
   was conducted on 89 adult males (ages 40-60 years) divided into four
   groups: 25 diabetics with AMI patients (group 1), 24 non-diabetics with
   AMI patients (group 2), 20 diabetics but not known to have AMI (group
   3), and 20 healthy controls (group 4), in whom serum prolactin was
   determined using commercially available ELISA kits. Prolactin levels
   increased along with increased serum troponin; group 1 had the highest
   level of serum prolactin (10.6 +/- 6 ng/ml) in comparison to groups 2
   (8.8 +/- 4 ng/ml), 3 (6.9 +/- 2 ng/ml), and 4 (5 +/- 2 ng/ml). According
   to the cutoff of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve,
   prolactin is considered better positive than negative marker in cases of
   AMI. Hyperprolactinemia may be associated with increased risk of
   atherosclerotic process and hence occurrence of AMI, as one of the
   serious macrovascular complications in diabetics. Elevated prolactin
   levels detected in diabetics having AMI supports the recent trend of
   using dopamine agonists, e.g., bromocriptine in treatment of type 2 DM
   especially those who had a prior ischemic event. Also, increased
   prolactin being associated with increased troponin level in AMI patients
   may be considered a prognostic factor correlated with the extent of
   myocardial damage.}},

Abstract = {{Black rice was characterized by dark purple pericarp and much lower
   yield than that of white rice varieties. We investigated the factors
   responsible for the lower yields of black rice by conducting crosses of
   rice with purple pericarp mutant and white pericarp cultivars. The seed
   weight of black rice was lower than that of brown or white rice progeny
   within the crosses. The F-2 segregants showed increased anthocyanin
   deposition with simultaneous reduction of chlorophyll in the seed
   pericarp. These results revealed that an unknown metabolic alteration
   exists in the chlorophyll synthesis due to the high level of
   cyanindin-3-0-glucoside deposition in the purple pericarp rice,
   indicating that anthocyanin deposition in the pericarp of black rice
   hindered the photosynthetic rate, leading to low yield. These findings
   suggest that the low yield of black rice is closely related to
   physiological factors other than the genetic yield traits.}},

Abstract = {{The present work is dedicated to the assessment of the cold thermal
   strain of human beings working within freezing chambers. To obtain the
   present results, both field measurements and a numerical procedure based
   on a modified version of the Stolwijk thermoregulation model were used.
   Eighteen freezing chambers were considered. A wide range of physical
   parameters of the cold stores, the workers clothing insulation, and the
   working and recovering periods were observed. The combination of these
   environmental and individual parameters lead to different levels of
   thermal stress, which were grouped under three categories. Some good
   practices were observed in the field evaluations, namely situations with
   appropriate level of clothing protection and limited duration of
   exposure to cold avoiding unacceptable level of hypothermia. However,
   the clothing ensembles normally used by the workers do not provide the
   minimum required insulation, which suggests the possibility of the whole
   body cooling for levels higher than admissible. The numerical
   predictions corroborate the main conclusions of the field survey. The
   results obtained with both methodologies clearly show that, for the low
   temperature of the freezing chambers, the clothing insulation is
   insufficient, the exposure periods are too long, and the recovering
   periods are inadequate. Thus, high levels of physiological strain can
   indeed be reached by human beings under such working environments.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a transportation problem arising in public bicycle sharing
   systems: To avoid rental stations to run entirely empty or full, a fleet
   of vehicles continuously performs tours moving bikes among stations. In
   the static problem variant considered in this paper, we are given
   initial and target fill levels for all stations, and the goal is
   primarily to find vehicle tours including corresponding loading
   instructions in order to minimize the deviations from the target fill
   levels. As secondary objectives we are further interested in minimizing
   the tours' total duration and the overall number of loading actions. For
   this purpose we first propose a fast greedy construction heuristic and
   extend it to a PILOT method that evaluates each candidate station
   considered for addition to the current partial tour in a refined way by
   looking forward via a recursive call. Next we describe a Variable
   Neighborhood Descent (VND) that exploits a set of specifically designed
   neighborhood structures in a deterministic way to locally improve the
   solutions. While the VND is processing the search space of candidate
   routes to determine the stops for vehicles at unbalanced rental
   stations, the number of bikes to be loaded or unloaded at each stop is
   derived by an efficient method. Four alternatives are considered for
   this embedded procedure based on a greedy heuristic, two variants of
   maximum flow calculations, and linear programming. Last but not least,
   we investigate a general Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and variants
   of a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) for further
   diversification and extended runs. Rigorous experiments using benchmark
   instances derived from a real-world scenario in Vienna with up to 700
   stations document the performance of the suggested approaches and
   individual pros and cons. While the VNS yields the best results on
   instances of moderate size, a PILOT/GRASP hybrid turns out to be
   superior on very large instances. If solutions are required in short
   time, the construction heuristic or PILOT method optionally followed by
   VND still yield reasonable results.}},

Abstract = {{Zerumbone, a natural cyclic sesquiterpene, is known to exhibit selective
   toxicity toward various cancer cells. Sustained efforts to explore the
   potential of new agents for effective therapy are critical in the
   context of development of drug resistance especially in cancers like
   chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The present study evaluated the
   effect of zerumbone on CML-K562 cells. The cell viability of
   zerumbone-treated K562 cells was detected by MTT assay, and
   morphological changes were observed by light microscopy and scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM). Staining with Hoechst 33258, acridine
   orange/ethidium bromide, and AnnexinV-FITC were used to detect
   apoptosis. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca2+, and
   changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were measured using
   Dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), Fluo-3AM, and
   Rhodamine-123, respectively. Western blot analysis was carried out to
   detect key proteins involved in apoptosis. Zerumbone inhibited K562 cell
   proliferation with an IC50 value of 3.5 mu g/mL and colony formation
   capability (P < 0.001). Interestingly, zerumbone did not affect the
   growth of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (hPBLs). Distinct
   morphological changes observed by light microscopy and fluorescent
   staining with Hoechst-33258, AO/EtBr, annexin V-FITC, and cytotoxicity
   evaluation by comet assay indicated induction of DNA damage and
   apoptosis. This was further confirmed by demonstration of pro-caspase-3,
   -9 activation and Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage on western
   blots. Apoptosis induction was found to be mitochondria mediated,
   involving increased free intracellular Ca2+, ROS, and upregulation of
   soluble histone H2AX. Our results suggest that zerumbone holds promise
   as a potential candidate drug for CML.}},

Abstract = {{Background Although systemic endothelial function is unimpaired in
   migraine, it is unknown whether cerebral endothelial function impairment
   exists in migraineurs.
   Materials and methods We conducted a prospective study to assess
   endothelial function in migraineurs (n=45) and healthy volunteers
   (n=44). Cerebral endothelial function was assessed by Breath Holding
   Index (BHI) on transcranial Doppler in bilateral middle cerebral artery
   (MCA at 30-60 mm), posterior cerebral artery (PCA at 60-80 mm) and
   basilar artery (BA at 80-120 mm) using bilateral monitoring probes fixed
   on headband. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was used as
   measure of systemic endothelial function.
   Results There was no difference in baseline mean velocities of MCA, PCA,
   BA among migraineurs and controls. Mean BHI was significantly lower in
   PCA (p<0.001) and BA (p<0.001) in patients with migraine with no
   difference in MCA (p=0.909, 0.450). Cerebral endothelial dysfunction
   (BHI<1.15) was present in 62.2\% of migraineurs in the right PCA
   (p<0.001), 57.8\% in left PCA (p<0.001) and 77.8\% in BA (BHI<0.83,
   p<0.001). There was no difference in BHI among migraineurs without and
   with aura (n=15). Cerebral and systemic endothelial function had no
   correlation in migraineurs. Increasing BMI was identified as a predictor
   of impaired BHI in the BA in migraineurs (p=0.020). Age, sex, presence
   of aura, lateralisation of headache, headache frequency, time to last
   attack and impaired FMD were not associated with impaired PCA and BA BHI
   in migraineurs.
   Conclusions Migraineurs may have isolated cerebral endothelial
   dysfunction restricted to the posterior circulation in the absence of
   systemic endothelial dysfunction.}},

Title = {{Framework for Modeling Urban Restoration Resilience Time in the
   Aftermath of an Extreme Event}},
Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The impacts of extreme events continue long after the emergency response
   has terminated. Effective reconstruction of supply-chain strategic
   infrastructure (SCSI) elements is essential for postevent recovery and
   the reconnectivity of a region with the outside. This study uses an
   interdisciplinary approach to develop a comprehensive framework to model
   resilience time. The framework is tested by comparing resilience time
   results for a simulated EF-5 tornado with ground truth data from the
   tornado that devastated Joplin, Missouri, on May 22, 2011. Data for the
   simulated tornado were derived for Overland Park, Johnson County,
   Kansas, in the greater Kansas City, Missouri, area. Given the simulated
   tornado, a combinatorial graph considering the damages in terms of
   interconnectivity between different SCSI elements is derived.
   Reconstruction in the aftermath of the simulated tornado is optimized
   using the proposed framework to promote a rapid recovery of the SCSI.
   This research shows promising results when compared with the independent
   quantifiable data obtained from Joplin, Missouri, returning a resilience
   time of 22 days compared with 25 days reported by city and state
   officials (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Madder has been used as a textile dye and pigment in works of art since
   antiquity. Madder dyes from different botanical species are
   characterized by different series of anthraquinone derivatives. The
   occurrence of one or more of these compounds in various relative amounts
   may provide a useful indication of the plant species used to obtain the
   dye. In this work, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was
   applied to the analysis of textile fibers dyed with madder from two
   different botanical species, Oldenlandia umbellata L. and Rubia
   tinctorum L. The resulting SERS spectra were interpreted in light of the
   actual composition of the madder dyes as determined by high-performance
   liquid chromatography. Interestingly, the SERS spectra were found to
   exhibit very distinctive spectral features depending on the different
   anthraquinone derivatives present in the dyes. In particular, the SERS
   spectrumof O. umbellata L. was found to match the spectrum of alizarin,
   while the SERS spectrum of R. tinctorum L. was surprisingly dominated by
   signals due to the less studied anthraquinone compound pseudopurpurin.
   With this study, we demonstrate that SERS spectra may offer valuable
   information regarding the major coloring constituents present in
   different madder species. Moreover, our work shows that not only can
   SERS be used successfully to differentiate among closely related
   anthraquinone derivatives, but also that this technique is particularly
   suitable for the detection of pseudopurpurin, leading to the
   identification of this compound in a number of works of art. Copyright

Abstract = {{The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) consists of empirical mode
   decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert spectral analysis. EMD has been
   successfully applied for identification of mode shapes of structures
   based on input-output approaches. This paper aims to extend application
   of EMD for output-only identification of mode shapes of linear
   structures. In this regard, a new simple and efficient method based on
   band-pass filtering and EMD is proposed. Having rather accurate
   estimates of modal frequencies from measured responses, the proposed
   method is capable to extract the corresponding mode shapes. In order to
   evaluate the accuracy and performance of the proposed identification
   method, two case studies are considered. In the first case, the
   performance of the method is validated through the analysis of simulated
   responses obtained from an analytical structural model with known
   dynamical properties. The low-amplitude responses recorded from the UCLA
   Factor Building during the 2004 Parkfield earthquake are used in the
   second case to identify the first three mode shapes of the building in
   three different directions. The results demonstrate the remarkable
   ability of the proposed method in correct estimation of mode shapes of
   the linear structures based on rather accurate modal frequencies.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{279}},
Pages = {{681-688}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The short-term effect of several aromatic compounds (o-cresol,
   p-nitrophenol, o-chlorophenol and quinoline) was evaluated over granular
   anammox sludge cultivated over 2 years in a Sequencing Batch Reactor
   (SBR). The anammox granular sludge had an average size of 1.0 +/- 0.2 mm
   and was enriched in Brocadia sp. Specific Anammox Activity (SAA) batch
   tests with this granular biomass were carried out in the presence of
   o-cresol, p-nitrophenol, o-chlorophenol, quinoline and their mixtures.
   The anammox biomass was never exposed to the tested aromatic compounds,
   prior to the SAA tests. The concentration and the mixture of aromatic
   compounds had a strong effect over the loss of the anammox activity. The
   higher the concentrations of the aromatic compounds, the higher the
   reduction of the SAA. Quinoline and p-nitrophenol have a lower negative
   effect compared to o-cresol and o-chlorophenol. The Luong inhibition
   model seems to adjust better the inhibition of anammox biomass by the
   tested aromatic compounds. Depending on the aromatic compound, toxic or
   inhibitory effect was measured. o-Cresol and o-chlorophenol caused a
   toxic effect whereas p-nitrophenol and quinoline produced an inhibitory
   effect. In general, synergistic effects were observed when mixtures of
   aromatic compounds were studied. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{CpOsm is an antifungal osmotin/thaumatin-like protein purified from the
   latex of Calotropis procera. The protein is relatively thermostable and
   retains its antifungal activity over a wide pH range; therefore, it may
   be useful in the development of new antifungal drugs or transgenic crops
   with enhanced resistance to phytopathogenic fungi. To gain further
   insight into the mechanism of action of CpOsm, its three-dimensional
   structure was determined, and the effects of the protein on Fusarium
   solani spores were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The
   atomic structure of CpOsm was solved at a resolution of 1.61 angstrom,
   and it contained 205 amino acid residues and 192 water molecules, with a
   final R-factor of 18.12\% and an R-free of 21.59\%. The CpOsm structure
   belongs to the thaumatin superfamily fold and is characterized by three
   domains stabilized by eight disulfide bonds and a prominent charged
   cleft, which runs the length of the front side of the molecule.
   Similarly to other antifungal thaumatin-like proteins, the cleft of
   CpOsm is predominantly acidic. AFM images of F. solani spores treated
   with CpOsm resulted in striking morphological changes being induced by
   the protein. Spores treated with CpOsm were wrinkled, and the volume of
   these cells was reduced by approximately 80\%. Treated cells were
   covered by a shell of CpOsm molecules, and the leakage of cytoplasmic
   content from these cells was also observed. Based on the structural
   features of CpOsm and the effects that the protein produces on F. solani
   spores, a possible mechanism of action is suggested and discussed. (C)

   Delayed-Onset Disease}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Diffuse lamellar keratitis is a fairly uncommon complication
   of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) that usually occurs within 1
   week of surgery. It is described as an inflammatory reaction in the
   lamellar interface characterized by a diffuse, white granular lamellar
   keratitis. Progression of the keratitis can result in scarring and
   significant visual loss. We report a case of bilateral diffuse lamellar
   keratitis (DLK) of delayed onset and look at confocal microscopic
   features of corneal interface.
   Case report: A 35-year-old male patient was referred with visual
   concerns and red eye. The patient had undergone LASIK procedure for high
   myopia 3 months previously. A detailed examination revealed a clinical
   presentation of DLK. A thorough account of the past revealed no
   pertinent medical history or risk factors for delayed-onset DLK after
   LASIK. The patient was put on topical antibiotics (ofloxacin, Exocin 3
   mg/mL) and topical steroids (prednisolone acetate 1\%, Pred Forte).
   Because of poor response to treatment, an interface washout was carried
   out and treatment with Pred Forte was continued. This helped in
   resolution of the condition in both eyes with residual faint, diffuse,
   corneal haze. Confocal microscopy was carried out before and after
   interface washout to assess features of DLK at cellular level after a
   delayed onset.
   Conclusions: The presence of inflammatory cells along with interface
   debris was noted in our case, which is unusual in stage 3 DLK with a
   delayed presentation as reported in literature. Although it is difficult
   to confirm without histology the type of inflammatory response seen, it
   is advocated that delayed presentation should also be treated quite
   intensively with steroids and any progression should be dealt with
   lifting up of the flaps to carry out interface washout.}},

Abstract = {{The study was carried out to evaluate the effect of organic and
   inorganic mineral supplementation to groundnut haulm (GNH) based
   complete diets on mineral release by in sacco method. A basal complete
   diet was prepared with GNH and concentrate mixture (8\% maize, 10\%
   soybean meal, 21.5\% deoiled rice bran and 0.5\% salt) in 60:40 ratio.
   The basal diet was treated as control (T-1) and 3 more diets were
   prepared by supplementing basal diet with commercial mineral mixture
   (T-2), inorganic mineral supplements (T-3) and organic mineral
   supplements (T-4). The commercial mineral mixture was added at the rate
   of 1.5\% in T-2 diet by adjusting the deoiled rice bran to 20\%. The
   inorganic mineral supplements were added at the rate of 26.4g (8.3g
   ZnSO4, 4.0g CuSO4 and 14.0 g MnSO4) in the T3 diet. The organic mineral
   supplements were added at the rate of 72g (12g Zn-P, 10 g Cu-P and 50g
   Mn-P) in the T4 diet. The in sacco mineral release of Cu, Mn and Zn from
   experimental diets showed that the disappearance \% was higher in
   commercial mineral mixture supplemented diet followed by organic mineral
   supplemented diet, and then inorganic mineral supplemented diet. The in
   sacco copper, manganese and zinc release from feed ingredients revealed
   that copper disappearance (\%) was higher in all the feed ingredients
   followed by Mn and Zn. The NDF degradability also increased with
   increase in incubation time. A correlation was drawn between in sacco
   mineral release and NDF degradability of the treatment diets.
   Significant positive correlation was observed between the NDF
   degradability and mineral release in the rumen. It can be concluded that
   the organic mineral supplements were better bioavailable than the
   inorganic mineral supplements.}},

Abstract = {{The technique of femtosecond laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy
   (FLIBS) was employed to investigate seven explosive molecules of
   nitropyrazole in three different atmospheres: ambient air, nitrogen, and
   argon. The FLIBS data illustrated the presence of molecular emissions of
   cyanide (CN) violet bands, diatomic carbon (C-2) Swan bands, and atomic
   emission lines of C, H, O, and N. To understand the plasma dynamics, the
   decay times of molecular and atomic emissions were determined from
   time-resolved spectral data obtained in three atmospheres: air, argon,
   and nitrogen. The CN decay time was observed to be longest in air,
   compared to nitrogen and argon atmospheres, for the molecules pyrazole
   (PY) and 4-nitropyrazole (4-NPY). In the case of C-2 emission, the decay
   time was observed to be the longest in argon, compared to the air and
   nitrogen environments, for the molecules PY, 4-NPY, and
   1-methyl-3,4,5-trinitropyrazole. The intensities of the CN, C-2, C, H,
   O, and N emission lines and various molecular/atomic intensity ratios
   such as CN/C-2, CNsum/C-2(sum), CN/C, CNsum/C, C-2/C, C-2(sum)/C, (C-2 +
   C)/CN, (C-2(sum) + C)/CNsum, O/H, O/N, and N/H were also deduced from
   the LIBS spectra obtained in argon atmosphere. A correlation between the
   observed decay times and molecular emission intensities with respect to
   the number of nitro groups, the atmospheric nitrogen content, and the
   oxygen balance of the molecules was investigated. The relationship among
   the LIBS signal intensity, the molecular/atomic intensity ratios, and
   the oxygen balance of these organic explosives was also explored.}},

Abstract = {{The metastases sites of advanced breast cancer contain vast majority of
   tissues and organs, which most common are bones, lungs, liver, brain and
   distant lymph nodes. We report a woman with unusual extensive
   subcutaneous metastases of breast cancer in her abdomen, back and back
   of the neck. The patient was diagnosed with invasive ductal breast
   cancer and had been treated 4 months earlier with modified radical
   mastectomy and three cycles of chemotherapy. Later she presented
   painless multiple small tubercules on the abdomen wall, back and back of
   the neck. She sought treatment in our department to perform a 18FDG
   PET-CT scan, confirming the multiple subcutaneous tubercules.
   Histopathological studies supported that the tubercules were rare
   subcutaneous metastatic of breast origin. The patient underwent another
   two cycles of chemotherapy and evaluation of curative effect was
   stability.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the mode of action of phyllanthus niruri (P. niruri) as a
   prophylactic hepatoprotective agent against paracetamol (PCM) induced
   liver toxicity in albino rats. Five groups of six animals in each group
   of wistar rats with a weight of 180-210 gms were the experimental
   material. Group I - Served as normal control, administered sodium CMC
   for all the eight days. Group II rats were treated only with PCM at a
   dose of 2.5 gm/kg on 8th day. Group III animals were administered
   silymarin at a dose of 50 mg/kg for 8days and PCM at a dose of 2.5 gm/kg
   on 8th day, while group IV is the treated group which was given P.
   niruri aqueous extract at a dose of 200mg/kg followed by PCM of 2.5
   gm/kg on 8th day. Group V rats were administered with P. niruri at a
   dose of 400mg/kg for 8days and PCM at a dose of 2.5 gm/kg on 8th day.
   Biochemical, hisological and immunohistological (IHC) examinations were
   performed. Histopathological picture is in line with the biochemical
   parameters and IHC study revealed that P. NIRURI acts by preventing the
   increase in NKT cells subsequently blocking FASL, by antiapoptotic and
   by increasing regeneration. Phyllanthus niruri aqueous extract at a dose
   of 400 mg/kg was more effective than at 200mg and silymarin 100mg.}},

Abstract = {{Natural cell membranes can directionally and selectively regulate the
   ion transport, which is critical for the functioning of living cells.
   Here, we report on the fabrication of an artificial membrane based on an
   asymmetric nanoparticle superlattice bilayered nanosheet, which exhibits
   similar ion transport characteristics. The superlattice nanosheets were
   fabricated via a drying-mediated self-assembly of polystyrene-capped
   gold nanoparticles at the liquid air interface. By adopting a
   layer-by-layer assembly process, an asymmetric nanomembrane could be
   obtained consisting of two nanosheets with different nanoparticle size.
   The resulting nanomembranes exhibit an asymmetric ion transport
   behavior, and diode-like current voltage curves were observed. The
   asymmetric ion transport is attributed to the cone-like nanochannels
   formed within the membranes, upon which a simulation map was established
   to illustrate the relationship between the channel structure and the
   ionic selectivity, in consistency with our experimental results. Our
   superlattice nanosheet-based design presents a promising strategy for
   the fabrication of next-generation smart nanomembranes for rationally
   and selectively regulating the ion transport even at a large ion flux,
   with potential applications in a wide range of fields, including
   biosensor devices, energy conversion, biophotonics, and bioelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{Although store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) has been implicated in
   several neurological disorders, the exact mechanism for its role in
   traumatic brain injury (TBI) has not been elucidated. In this study, we
   found that TBI upregulated the expression of a calcium sensor protein
   called stromal interactive molecule 2 (STIM2); however, the levels of
   its homologue, STIM1, were unaffected. Both STIM1 and STIM2 are crucial
   components of SOCE, both in vivo and in vitro. Using shRNA, we
   discovered that downregulation of STIM2, but not STIM1, significantly
   improved neuronal survival in both an in vitro and in vivo model of TBI,
   decreasing neuronal apoptosis, and preserving neurological function.
   This neuroprotection was associated with alleviating TBI-induced calcium
   overload and preserving mitochondrial function. Additionally,
   downregulation of STIM2 not only inhibited Ca2+ release from the
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but also reduced SOCE-mediated Ca2+ influx,
   decreased mitochondrial Ca2+, restored mitochondrial morphology and
   improved mitochondrial function, including MMP maintenance, ROS
   production and ATP synthesis. These results indicate that inhibition of
   STIM2 can protect neurons from TEI by inhibiting calcium overload and
   preserving mitochondrial function. This suggests that STIM2 might be an
   effective interventional target for TBI. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Acrylamide/2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate hydrogels were prepared by
   simultaneous radiation-induced cross-linking copolymerization of
   acrylamide (AAm), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and water mixtures

   spectroscopy. Dynamic and equilibrium swelling of hydrogels in water and
   in buffer solutions were investigated. They were sensitive to pH and
   temperature. Swelling was non-Fickean and increased with increasing the
   acrylamide content. Temperature dependence of the equilibrium water
   uptake of copolymers exhibited a discontinuity around 35 degrees C
   resulting from the weakening of the hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl
   groups of HEMA and the amide groups of AAm. The thermodynamic and
   network parameters derived from swelling and mechanical measurements are
   compared and discussed. They exhibit a strong dependence on the AAm
   content in the hydrogel. These hydrogels can be considered for
   applications in fields requiring environmentally responsive hydrogels

Abstract = {{We present results obtained from a set of cosmological hydrodynamic
   simulations of galaxy clusters, aimed at comparing predictions with
   observational data on the diversity between cool-core (CC) and
   non-cool-core (NCC) clusters. Our simulations include the effects of
   stellar and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback and are based on an
   improved version of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-3,
   which ameliorates gas mixing and better captures gas-dynamical
   instabilities by including a suitable artificial thermal diffusion. In
   this Letter, we focus our analysis on the entropy profiles, the primary
   diagnostic we used to classify the degree of cool-coreness of clusters,
   and the iron profiles. In keeping with observations, our simulated
   clusters display a variety of behaviors in entropy profiles: they range
   from steadily decreasing profiles at small radii, characteristic of CC
   systems, to nearly flat core isentropic profiles, characteristic of NCC
   systems. Using observational criteria to distinguish between the two
   classes of objects, we find that they occur in similar proportions in
   both simulations and observations. Furthermore, we also find that
   simulated CC clusters have profiles of iron abundance that are steeper
   than those of NCC clusters, which is also in agreement with
   observational results. We show that the capability of our simulations to
   generate a realistic CC structure in the cluster population is due to
   AGN feedback and artificial thermal diffusion: their combined action
   allows us to naturally distribute the energy extracted from
   super-massive black holes and to compensate for the radiative losses of
   low-entropy gas with short cooling time residing in the cluster core.}},

   Materials and methods: Interventions were performed on ambulatory and
   hospitalized patients at two vein centres, a university dermatology
   department (EVLA) and a specialized vein clinic (HLS). Four hundred
   patients suffering from GSV incompetence were assigned to EVLA or HLS of
   the GSV. One hundred and eighty five and 161 patients (=limbs),
   respectively, were treated per protocol. Main outcome measures were
   clinically recurrent varicose veins after surgery (REVAS classification,
   primary study objective), Duplex detected saphenofemoral recurrence,
   clinical venous severity scoring (Homburg Varicose Vein Severity Score),
   quality of life (Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire 2), side
   effects, and patient satisfaction 5 years after treatment.
   Results: Two hundred and eighty one legs (81\% of the study population)
   were evaluated with a median follow up of 60.4 (EVLA) and 60.7 months
   (HLS). Overall, REVAS was similarly observed in both groups: 45\% (EVLA)
   and 54\% (HLS), p = .152. Patients of the EVLA group showed
   significantly more clinical recurrences in the operated region (REVAS:
   same site): 18\% vs. 5\%, p = .002. In contrast, more different site
   recurrences were observed in the HLS group: 50\% vs. 31\%, p = .002.
   Duplex detected saphenofemoral refluxes occurred more frequently after
   EVLA: 28\% vs. 5\%, p < .001. Both treatments improved disease severity
   and quality of life without any difference.
   Conclusions: EVLA and HLS are comparably effective concerning overall
   REVAS, improvement of disease severity, and quality of life. In terms of
   same site clinical recurrence and saphenofemoral refluxes, HLS is
   superior to EVLA 5 years after treatment. Clinical trial registration:

Abstract = {{Expeditious evidence-basedmanagement of lower extremity vascular injury
   is essential to reduce morbidity. Advances in management, largely due to
   military conflicts, continue to improve outcomes and limb salvage.
   Diagnosis via an accurate physical examand adjuncts such as arterial
   pressure index or computed tomography angiography allow for rapid
   management. Expedited restoration of flow to major vessels, temporary
   intravascular shunting in the damage control setting or to restore
   perfusion before fixation of skeletal injuries, and early fasciotomy
   remain fundamentals of treatment. While endovascular management has
   increased significantly in highly selected populations, there are no
   prospective randomized controlled trials on its use in lower extremity
   vascular injury and it remains an experimental, off-label approach
   without any long-term outcomes data. Knowledge of various complications,
   including those requiring early return to the operating room, are
   critical to ensure satisfactory outcome.}},

Abstract = {{A Summary: Modeling of dynamical systems using ordinary differential
   equations is a popular approach in the field of systems biology. Two of
   the most critical steps in this approach are to construct dynamical
   models of biochemical reaction networks for large datasets and complex
   experimental conditions and to perform efficient and reliable parameter
   estimation for model fitting. We present a modeling environment for
   MATLAB that pioneers these challenges. The numerically expensive parts
   of the calculations such as the solving of the differential equations
   and of the associated sensitivity system are parallelized and
   automatically compiled into efficient C code. A variety of parameter
   estimation algorithms as well as frequentist and Bayesian methods for
   uncertainty analysis have been implemented and used on a range of
   applications that lead to publications.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated how six- to eight-year-old children interpret
   ambiguous provocation from their siblings. In particular, we examined
   how children's attributions of their siblings' intent (1) differed from
   those for their peers, (2) varied as a function of the structural
   features of the sibling relationship, and (3) were associated with the
   affective qualities of the sibling relationship. A total of 121 children
   were presented with ambiguous provocation scenarios in which three
   groups of agemates were described as the perpetrators of harm (siblings,
   friends, and disliked peers). Scenarios were designed to assess
   children's attributions of hostile, instrumental, and accidental intent.
   Children attributed more hostile intent to disliked peers than to
   siblings and less hostile intent to friends than to siblings. Accidental
   and instrumental intent attributions were equally likely for friends and
   siblings but less common for disliked peers. Children attributed more
   hostile intent to older siblings, and more instrumental intent to
   laterborn siblings who were chronologically younger. Children's
   attributions of siblings' intent were related to both parents' and
   children's reports of the affective features of siblings' interactions.
   Results provide new insight into how children's construals of others'
   actions are grounded in the unique features of their relationships with
   particular interaction partners.}},

Abstract = {{Background: After pneumonectomy, the development of a new lung cancer or
   a recurrence in the residual lung is a challenge. Surgery often is
   considered contraindicated. The goal of our study is to assess the
   morbidity and mortality of lung resection on a single lung.
   Methods: All patients who underwent lung resection after pneumonectomy
   from January 1996 through December 2012 were reviewed.
   Results: There were 12 patients (10 men and 2 women). Mean age was 71
   years (range, 54-81 years). Mean preoperative FEV1 was 1470 ml (52\%)
   and preoperative FVC 2153 ml (61,5\%). Subsequent pulmonary resection
   was performed after a median follow-up of 34,5 months. Wedge resection
   was performed in all patients. Diagnosis was pulmonary mestastatic lung
   cancer in 2 patients, metachronous lung cancer in 6, metastatic
   extrathoracic cancer in 3 and benign nodule in one. Complications
   occurred in 4 patients (33,4\%) while operative mortality was nil.
   Conclusions: Lung resection on a single lung is a safe procedure
   associated with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Careful patient
   selection is very important. (C) 2014 AEC. Published by Elsevier Espana,

Abstract = {{Peptide conjugates containing somatostatin (SST) cyclic analogs as a
   targeting moiety are able to deliver chemotherapeutic agents
   specifically to cancer cells expressing SST receptors (SSTRs), and hence
   increasing their local efficacy while limiting the peripheral toxicity.
   Here, we report on the synthesis and biochemical characterization of new
   SSTR-specific anticancer peptide conjugates, with different anticancer
   payloads acting through different oncogenic mechanisms to evaluate their
   biological activities and to provide a comparative study of their drug
   release profiles. The SSTR2-specific backbone cyclic peptide 3207-86 was
   chosen for the synthesis of a variety of novel anticancer drug
   conjugates with a broad drug release capabilities. The N-terminus of
   3207-86 was equipped with GABA to generate free amino group available
   for the conjugation of chlorambucil, Camptothecin (CPT), Combretastatin
   4A, ABT-751, and Amonafide through the formation of various
   biodegradable bonds. The chemo- and biostability/drug release of all the
   synthetic compounds was investigated at various pHs and in the presence
   of mouse liver homogenate, respectively. Their selective cytotoxic
   effect was evaluated on several human cancer cell lines that overexpress
   SSTR2. Compared with the free drugs, our peptide-drug conjugates
   exhibited considerable cytotoxic effect on cancer cell lines versus low
   SSTR2-expressed human embryonic kidney cells. Functional versatility of
   the conjugates was reflected in the variability of their drug release
   profiles, whereas the conserved sequence of a selective binding to the
   SSTR2 likely preserved their binding to the receptor and consequently
   their favorable toxicity toward targeted cancer cells. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{Previous research on attitudes toward robots has emphasized the aspect
   of cultural differences regarding the acceptance of social robots in
   everyday life. Existing work has also focused on the importance of
   various other factors (e.g., demographic variables, interest in science
   and technology, prior robot experience) that predict robot acceptance.
   Specific robot types like service or healthcare robots have also been
   investigated. Nevertheless, more research is needed to substantiate the
   empirical evidence on the role of culture, robot type, and other
   predictors when researching attitudes toward robots. We did so by
   conducting a survey on attitudes toward education robots in the German
   context. Besides, in the present research, we investigated predictors of
   attitudes toward education robots. Contrary to previous findings, our
   results suggest that German respondents have neutral attitudes toward
   education robots. However, our data support the notion of relative
   reluctance to engage in learning processes that include robots.
   Regarding demographic variables and personality dispositions, our
   results show that gender, age, need for cognition , and technology
   commitment significantly predicted people's attitudes. Concerning
   potential areas of application, respondents could picture using
   education robots in domains related to science, technology, engineering,
   and mathematics and rejected education robots in fields of arts and
   social sciences.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To estimate the incidence of local complications associated
   with peripheral catheters and identify risk factors for the development
   of most common complications.
   Methods: This prospective cohort study included 92 adult inpatients at
   clinical and surgical units who had peripheral catheterization. By daily
   observance of the catheters we determined time of permanence and local
   complications due to the use of a complete safety catheter. All actions
   began after training of nursing teams. Statistical tests used were the
   Fisher exact test, G test (Williams), chi-square, Mann-Whitney U test,
   and relative risk.
   Results: Local complications occurred in 56.2\% of cases. Time of
   catheter permanence over 72 hours increased the risk for phlebitis
   development in 2.34\% of cases (RR; p=0.0483; CI {[}0.91; 6.07]).
   Conclusion: Incidence of local complications was high. Phlebitis was the
   predominant complication and the time of catheter permanence over 72
   hours was a considered risk factor for this complication.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this work was the determination of the linkage between land
   use and mobility of potentially toxic elements in soil. A total of 193
   soil samples taken from the surface soils of Hungary were used in the
   analysis. Based on the investigated properties {[}pH, soil organic
   matter (SOM), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and clay], the forest soils
   were acidic with higher DOC concentration while arable soils were
   neutral with higher clay content. Three element fractions, the pseudo
   total (HNO3 + H2O2-soluble), plant-available (NH4-acetate +
   EDTA-soluble) and mobile (1 M NH4NO3-soluble) were used for the
   investigation. Total Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn and plant-available Cu, Mn and Ni
   concentrations were higher in arable soils, but the mobile
   concentrations of each element were higher in forest soils, probably due
   to the lower pH and CEC, and higher DOC concentration. The element
   mobility was calculated with two ratios {[}mobile/total] and
   {[}mobile/(plant-available - mobile)]. The chosen soil properties
   explained only a small part of the variability in the mobility. In most
   cases, the R (2) values of the regression equations were below 0.5. The
   mobility of elements investigated in forest soils was multiple of that
   in arable soils. For each investigated element, the regression equations
   were different in arable and forest soils. In forest soils, the mobility
   of Cd could be characterised by pH alone. DOC had an effect primarily on
   Cu mobility. The influence of the solid phase on element mobility could
   be attributed to SOM in forest soils and clay content in arable soils.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{To reduce the rate of collision accidents between mobile cranes and
   immobile obstacles in construction sites during lift operations, this
   paper develops a real-time automated anticollision system that can warn
   crane operators about potential collisions and automatically implement
   collision-avoidance strategies. This system does not require additional
   devices and can be installed in existing crane controllers. Before the
   lift operation, the location and shape data of all immobile objects in
   the work area are collected by a boom head and stored in track-sector
   database of the system based on the position parameters of the boom
   head. During the operation of the lift, the proposed system calculates a
   three-dimensional safe zone for the crane, including boom, cable, and
   lift object based on the object data in real time, and the movement and
   position of the crane including boom, cable, and lift object are
   consistently monitored and predicted in real time through weighted
   linear-regression models. If the predicted position of the crane is
   reaching the boundary of the precalculated safety operation zone, three
   different levels of decelerations and an emergency stop will be
   automatically executed in order, according to the distance between crane
   and the obstacles, by the lifting controller to prevent the crane from
   potential collisions with immobile obstacles. A tentative application of
   this real-time anticollision system at real construction sites has
   demonstrated its ability to prevent collisions between cranes and
   immobile obstacles in work zones during lift operations. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Background-MICRORNAS (miRNAs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) serve a
   significant role in the pathogenesis of a variety of cardiovascular
   diseases. The transcriptional regulation of miRNAs is poorly understood
   in cardiac hypertrophy. We investigated whether the expression of
   miR-133a is epigenetically regulated by class I and IIb HDACs during
   hypertrophic remodeling.
   Methods and Results-Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was performed
   in CD1 mice to induce pressure overload hypertrophy. Mice were treated
   with class I and IIb HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) via drinking water for 2 and
   4 weeks post TAC. miRNA expression was determined by real-time
   polymerase chain reaction. Echocardiography was performed at baseline
   and post TAC end points for structural and functional assessment.
   Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to identify HDACs and
   transcription factors associated with miR-133a promoter. miR-133a
   expression was downregulated by 0.7- and 0.5-fold at 2 and 4 weeks post
   TAC, respectively, when compared with vehicle control (P<0.05). HDAC
   inhibition prevented this significant decrease 2 weeks post TAC and
   maintained miR-133a expression near vehicle control levels, which
   coincided with (1) a decrease in connective tissue growth factor
   expression, (2) a reduction in cardiac fibrosis and left atrium diameter
   (marker of end-diastolic pressure), suggesting an improvement in
   diastolic function. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that
   HDAC1 and HDAC2 are present on the miR-133a enhancer regions.
   Conclusions-The results reveal that HDACs play a role in the regulation
   of pressure overload-induced miR-133a downregulation. This work is the
   first to provide insight into an epigenetic-miRNA regulatory pathway in
   pressure overload-induced cardiac fibrosis.}},

Abstract = {{We consider two non-degenerate potentials for the quiver arising from
   the once-punctured torus, which are a natural choice to study and

   rise to an infinite dimensional Jacobian algebra. In this paper we
   determine the graph of strongly reduced components for both Jacobian
   algebras. Our main result is that the graph is connected in both cases.
   Plamondon parametrised the strongly reduced components for
   finite-dimensional algebras using generic g-vectors. We prove that the
   generic g-vectors of indecomposable strongly reduced components of the
   finite-dimensional Jacobian algebra are precisely the universal
   geometric coefficients for the once-punctured torus, which were

   Cohort Study}},

Abstract = {{Preoperative depressive symptoms have been shown in some but not all
   studies to be associated with poor self-reported pain and function
   outcomes. In addition, depressive symptoms after surgery have been shown
   to improve relative to preoperative levels.
   We hypothesized that (1) preoperative depressive symptoms would predict
   postoperative pain; (2) depressive symptoms would decrease after
   surgery; and (3) preoperative depressive symptoms would increase as the
   scheduled surgery date approached.
   Data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative, a National Institutes of
   Health-funded prospective multiyear cohort study, were used in this
   retrospective analysis. Persons from four communities were eligible if
   they had radiographic knee osteoarthritis or were at risk for developing
   knee osteoarthritis based on occupational, medical history, or body
   weight risk factors. A total of 4796 persons participated and rates of
   followup were 80\% or greater over the course of the study. Participants
   completed a validated depressive symptom scale and the Knee Injury and
   Osteoarthritis Outcome Scale pain scale each year for 3 years before and
   3 years after TKA. Latent growth curve modeling was used to model
   intercepts and slopes of pre- and postoperative depression and pain.
   Preoperative trajectories and intercepts were then used to predict
   postoperative pain and depressive symptoms adjusting for confounding
   variables.
   After adjustment for potential confounding, we found no evidence that
   preoperative depressive symptoms predicted postoperative pain with
   function (estimate, 0.1; 95\% confidence interval, -0.31 to 0.50; p =
   0.64) or that depressive symptoms were reduced after surgery (z = 0.06,
   p = 0.80). We also found no evidence to indicate that preoperative
   depressive symptoms increased as the date of surgery approached (linear
   slope = 0.28, SE = 0.19, p = 0.15).
   Preoperative and postoperative depressive symptoms in patients before
   and after TKA did not appreciably change over a 6-year perioperative
   period. Patient depressive symptoms were not reduced after surgery and
   did not appear to be related to less pain postoperatively. Our findings
   of no association between preoperative depressive symptom severity and
   postoperative pain and no reduction in postoperative depressive symptoms
   run counter to other available evidence, potentially attributable, in
   part, to a data collection process that occurred outside of orthopaedic
   surgeons' offices. Future research is needed to more fully explore the
   potential role of social desirability, the concept that patients respond
   in a way that they think the researcher or clinician wants them to
   respond in lieu of responding in a way that truly reflects the patient's
   status. Social desirability may influence a TKA patient's pain and
   function outcome assessment.

Title = {{A Patient Portal With Electronic Messaging: Controlled Before-and-After
   Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patients' access to their medical records, along with
   electronic messaging, offers an efficient means of information
   transition between patients and their caregivers. Easier access to
   information and interaction with health care professionals may reduce
   use of other services while increasing patients' activation in the
   management of their own health. Patient portals may therefore have a
   favorable impact on the cost-effectiveness of care.
   Objective: The aim was to assess the benefits and risks of providing
   electronic messaging services to patients with chronic conditions. Using
   cost-effectiveness analysis, the outcomes and costs of providing access
   to an electronic patient portal were evaluated in a real-life treatment
   process in primary care.
   Methods: A total of 876 chronically ill patients from public primary
   care were allocated to either an intervention group receiving immediate
   access to a patient portal that included their medical records, care
   plan, and secure messaging with a care team, or to a control group
   receiving standard care. Incremental direct heath care costs, health
   status based on the Short-Form Health Survey, version 2 (SF-36v2), and
   patient activation based on the short form of the Patient Activation
   Measure (PAM13) were compared to standard care in a 6-month follow-up.
   Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated using a sample of
   80 patients in the intervention group and 57 patients in the control
   group; thus, a total of 137 patients were included in the final
   analysis. Propensity-score matching was used to assess the sensitivity
   of the results to the possible attrition bias.
   Results: Patient activation improved more in the intervention group but
   the effect was not statistically significant. The effect on cost of care
   was ambiguous; costs decreased by an average of (sic)91 in the
   unadjusted model, but increased by (sic)48 in the adjusted model. Due to
   the controversial results on cost, the unadjusted analysis showed an
   89\% probability of cost-effectiveness with no willingness to pay for
   increased patient activation, whereas in the adjusted sample, the
   probability of the portal being more cost-effective than care as usual
   exceeded 50\% probability at a willingness to pay (sic)700 per
   clinically significant increase in patient activation score. There was
   no marked short-term impact on health status based on the SF-36v2
   measure.
   Conclusions: Offering the possibility to substitute health care visits
   with less costly contacts using self-management tools did not seem to
   compromise the health status or treatment of chronic care patients.
   Patient activation increased, and this could be achieved with moderate
   costs in a short-term experiment. In the long term, increased activation
   is proposed to lead to better health outcomes and eventually cut down
   resource use. Future studies should assess the long-term effects of
   patient portals on patients' health status and cost of care.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the effects of bounded rationality in mechanism
   design problems. We model bounded rationality by assuming that in the
   presence of an incentive compatible mechanism, players behave as if
   their types were in a delta-neighborhood of their true types. In our
   results, we explore what are the effects of such bounded rationality in
   the outcomes of the mechanism design problem. To such end, we
   characterize the social choice functions that are robust to the
   3-perturbations in the sense that the designers' loss is at most of
   order delta(k) for a certain k. A notable finding is that in
   quasi-linear utilitarian environments the designer's loss is of order of
   delta(2). We illustrate the applicability of our results by means of

Abstract = {{The physiological condition of jack mackerel {[}18.3 +/- A 1.2 cm fork
   length (FL), n = 24] was simultaneously monitored using
   electrocardiography (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) techniques during
   swimming exercise in a flume tank at different temperatures of 10, 15
   and 22 C-A degrees. To monitor the effect of temperature on the
   threshold level of the maximum sustainable speed, EMG demonstrated that
   the initiation of ordinary muscle activity at the lowest temperature (10
   C-A degrees) occurred at swimming speeds of 3.2-3.5 FL/s, which was
   slower than the activation speeds at 15 and 22 C-A degrees of 4.0-5.4
   FL/s. Ordinary muscle became active with increasing swimming speed which
   subsequently resulted in the frequency, amplitude and duration of burst
   discharge. ECG and EMG monitoring showed that the heart rate started to
   increase at the sustained speed level before the threshold and markedly
   increased up to the maximum level of heart rate at the higher speed. The
   index of ordinary muscle power output at the lowest temperature of 10
   C-A degrees was lower than at higher temperatures of 15 and 22 C-A
   degrees. The heart rate increased with the increasing power output of
   ordinary muscle for all temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-annual and multi-fleet version of a generalized depletion model
   is developed and applied to the Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus
   commerson) stock in Saudi waters of the Arabian Gulf under data-limited
   conditions. The fishing operational data are the official monthly
   records of estimated catch biomass and exact nominal effort of two
   artisanal fleets from 1995 to 2012. To transform catch in biomass to
   catch in numbers, a monthly trend in mean weight is estimated from
   biological compositional data from 2002, 2013 and used to produce
   predictions of mean weight for every month between 1995 and 2012.
   Estimates of natural mortality and initial abundance, thirty six
   fleet-specific abundance parameters, and six fleet-specific fishing
   operational parameters, are obtained by maximum likelihood. Thirty six
   additional timing parameters are fixed by graphical display of catch
   spikes, a convenient statistic defined here, and by maximum likelihood.
   The reconstructed history of the stock shows that the catch varies in
   direct relation to the magnitude of recruitment pulses, while nominal
   effort has been stable. The annual exploitation rate was estimated at
   approximately 10\%, which implies that fishing is occurring at
   sustainable levels, although these results are conditional on a
   well-behaved mean monthly weight in the catch and simplified statistical
   models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{144-150}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Transmission network expansion planning involves various types of static
   and dynamic analyses. The complexity and increasingly difficult
   operating conditions of power systems raise the importance of dynamic
   analyses on the expansion planning stage. Primary studies in the field
   of dynamic analyses include rotor angle stability, voltage ride-through
   and frequency stability analyses. This paper presents four methods of
   rotor angle small signal stability assessment, which can be used in
   transmission network expansion planning. For each of these methods, the
   requirements for the calculation model and computational accuracy are
   discussed, among other aspects. Practical considerations related to the
   use of particular methods in planning analyses are presented.
   Theoretical considerations are illustrated with the results of stability
   assessment of a multi-machine test system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{SAT Modulo Theories (SMT) is the problem of determining the
   satisfiability of a formula in which constraints, drawn from a given
   constraint theory T, are composed with logical connectives. The DPLL(T)
   approach to SMT has risen to prominence as a technique for solving these
   quantifier-free problems. The key idea in DPLL(T) is to couple unit
   propagation in the propositional part of the problem with theory
   propagation in the constraint component. In this paper it is
   demonstrated how reification provides a natural way for orchestrating
   this in the setting of logic programming. This allows an elegant
   implementation of DPLL(T) solvers in Prolog. The work is motivated by a
   problem in reverse engineering, that of type recovery from binaries. The
   solution to this problem requires an SMT solver where the theory is that
   of rational-tree constraints, a theory not supported in off-the-shelf
   SMT solvers, but realised as unification in Prolog systems. The approach
   is also illustrated with SMT solvers for linear constraints and integer
   difference constraints. The rational-tree solver is benchmarked against
   a number of type recovery problems, and compared against a lazy-basic
   SMT solver built on PicoSAT, while the integer difference logic solver
   is benchmarked against CVC3 and CVC4, both of which are implemented in
   C++. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Solid organ transplant recipients, who are medically immunosuppressed to
   prevent graft rejection, have increased melanoma risk, but risk factors
   and outcomes are incompletely documented. We evaluated melanoma
   incidence among 139,991 non-Hispanic white transplants using linked US
   transplant-cancer registry data (1987-2010). We used standardized
   incidence ratios (SIRs) to compare incidence with the general population
   and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) from multivariable Poisson models to
   assess risk factors. Separately, we compared post-melanoma survival
   among transplant recipients (n=182) and non-recipients (n=131,358) using
   multivariable Cox models. Among transplant recipients, risk of invasive
   melanoma (n=519) was elevated (SIR= 2.20, 95\% Cl 2.01-2.39), especially
   for regional stage tumors (SIR= 4.11, 95\% Cl 3.27-5.09). Risk of
   localized tumors was stable over time after transplantation but higher
   with azathioprine maintenance therapy (IRR= 1.35, 95\% Cl 1.03-1.77).
   Risk of regional/distant stage tumors peaked within 4 years following
   transplantation and increased with polyclonal antibody induction therapy
   (IRR=1.65, 95\% Cl 1.02-2.67). Melanoma-specific mortality was higher
   among transplant recipients than non-recipients (hazard ratio 2.98, 95\%
   CI 2.26-3.93). Melanoma exhibits increased incidence and aggressive
   behavior under transplant-related immunosuppression. Some localized
   melanomas may result from azathioprine, which acts synergistically with
   UV radiation, whereas T-cell depleting induction therapies may promote
   late-stage tumors. Our findings support sun safety practices and skin
   screening for transplant recipients.}},

Abstract = {{Acute hyperkalemia with electrocardiogram (EKG) changes can be a
   life-threatening situation. Despite a large body of literature, the
   complex pathophysiology of hyperkalemia is not fully described or even
   explained at the molecular level in many textbooks. In this review, we
   specifically integrated a large body of clinical and experimental works
   describing how hyperkalemia impacts differently the cellular membrane
   potential in heart and muscle tissues. Integrating this knowledge
   appears relevant to the understanding of peculiar hyperkalemia-induced
   EKG changes that clinicians should be aware of. We discuss how some
   specific therapeutics (sodium salt infusion, in particular) might be
   reappraised in today's practice. We also challenge the clinical
   relevance of isolated biological hyperkalemia. From a pathophysiological
   standpoint, we believe that hyperkalemia should be treated in regard to
   a specific clinical context more than based on potassium levels alone.
   This approach should be debated, especially in chronic renal failure
   patients. Clinical situations such as hyperkalemia occurring in patients
   with pacemaker devices, and hyperkalemia in preoperative settings are
   also discussed here.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) availability declines during ecosystem development due in
   part to chemical transformations of P in the soil. Here we report
   changes in soil P pools and the oxygen isotopic signature of inorganic
   phosphate (delta O-18(p)) in these pools over a 6500-year soil coastal
   dune chronosequence in a temperate humid environment. Total P declined
   from 384 to 129 mg P kg(-1) during the first few hundred years of
   pedogenesis, due mainly to the depletion of primary mineral Pin the
   HCl-extractable pool. The delta O-18(p) of HCl-extractable inorganic P
   initially reflected the signature of the parent material, but shifted
   over time towards (but not reaching) isotopic equilibrium. In contrast,
   delta O-18(p) signatures of inorganic P extracted in water and NaHCO3
   (approximately 9 and 39 mg P kg(-1), respectively) were variable but
   consistent with isotopic equilibrium with soil water. In the
   NaOH-extractable P pool, which doubled from 63 to 128 mg P kg(-1) in the
   early stages of pedogenesis and then gradually declined, the delta
   O-18(p) of the extracted inorganic P changed from equilibrium values
   early in the chronosequence to more depleted signatures in older soils,
   indicating greater rates of hydrolysis of labile organic P compounds
   such as DNA and increase involvement in P cycling as overall P
   availability declines through the sequence. In summary, this application
   of delta O-18(p) to a long-term soil chronosequence provides novel
   insight into P dynamics, indicating the importance of efficient
   recycling through tight uptake and mineralization in maintaining a
   stable bioavailable P pool during long-term ecosystem development. (C)

Abstract = {{This introduction addresses a number of approaches to the emerging field
   of the study of conspiracy theories and new and alternative religions.
   Scholars can examine how certain religious groups have been the subject
   of conspiracy narratives created by the wider culture, and how
   conspiracy narratives are mobilized within religious groups such as Aum
   Shinrikyo, Scientology or others. Moreover, we can fruitfully examine
   secular conspiracy theories through ideas typically applied to
   religions, such as theodicy, millenarianism, and esoteric claims to
   higher knowledge. Most studies assume that conspiracy theories indicate
   pathology paranoia or simply stupidity. Increasingly however, scholars
   have begun to interpret the term ``conspiracy theory{''} as operating
   polemically to stigmatize certain beliefs and ideas. The field therefore
   offers a microcosm of broader trends in the interplay of knowledge and
   power. The study of both new and emergent religions and conspiracy
   theories comes of age only when we cease to think of them as necessarily
   deviant and irrational.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concentrates on the stable distributions which have maximum
   skewness to the left. The exponentials of such stable distributions are
   called finite moment log-stable distributions. They have the property
   that all moments are finite, and are of interest in financial options
   pricing as an alternative to log-normal distributions. Computation of
   density and distribution functions has been made faster by using
   interpolation formulae in two variables and made less error-prone by
   using computational objects to represent the distributions and
   performing computational procedures on those objects. Some computations
   using finite moment log-stable distributions for options pricing are
   illustrated. The most important qualitative difference from the
   Black-Scholes log-normal model for options pricing is that the
   log-stable model suggests that dynamic hedging will reduce portfolio
   risk by a much smaller amount than is suggested by the log-normal model.
   This suggests that finite moment log-stable distributions could be used
   to provide conservative assessments of portfolio risk.}},

Abstract = {{The use of lagoons with floating aquatic plants for the treatment of a
   polluted urban river with recovery of Pistia stratiotes biomass was
   investigated. A first group of experiments was performed during spring,
   comparing three different media: synthetic wastewater (SWW), water from
   the Sordo River (WSR), and WSR amended with fertilizer (WSR+F). The
   second and third experiments were performed during summer and winter,
   respectively, using only WSR. During spring, the productivity in WSR and
   WSR+F was similar between them and significantly higher compared to the
   one observed in the SWW: 0.949 versus 0.379 g dry weight (dw) m(-2)
   day(-1), respectively. During summer, the productivity in the WSR was
   similar to the one observed in spring but significantly different to the
   one registered in winter: 0.946 versus 0.347 g dw m(-2) day(-1). During
   spring and summer, the uptake rate of ammonium nitrogen was
   significantly higher compared to the one registered for nitrate,
   although in winter there were no differences between such rates. For
   phosphates, the removal percentage was similar in spring and winter
   (96.25 and 99.1\%, respectively). It was concluded that this system
   serves a dual purpose, treating water from a polluted river effectively
   and producing high biomass yield during spring and summer.}},

Abstract = {{Enterovirus (EV) infection is common in infants, but the information
   with regard to the molecular epidemiology and the associations between
   types and clinical variables is very scarce. This study includes 195
   children < 3 months old with fever, attended from March 2010 to December
   2012 in an emergency department of a tertiary paediatric hospital in
   whom EV infection was confirmed by real-time PCR in blood and/or
   cerebrospinal fluid. Clinical and epidemiological data was prospectively
   collected. In 152 (77.9 \%) patients, EVs could be typed. The most
   common type was Echovirus-5 (E5; 32, 21.1 \%), followed by Echovirus-11
   (E11; 18, 11.8 \%), Echovirus-21 and Echovirus-25 (E21, E25; 11 each
   one, 7.2 \%) and Coxsackievirus-B4 (CVB4; 6, 6.6 \%). The majority of
   types appeared in spring, but E5 and E25 were found mainly during summer
   (p < 0.01). E21 was associated with high-grade fever (p < 0.01); E5 with
   exanthema (p = 0.03) and CVB4 tended to cause meningitis more often than
   the other types (p = 0.07).
   Conclusion: The most common EV types were Echovirus-5 and Echovirus-11.
   Some significant associations between types and epidemiologic and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{385-399}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Irruputuncu is an active volcano located in northern Chile within
   the Central Andean Volcanic Zone (CAVZ) and that has produced andesitic
   to trachy-andesitic magmas over the last similar to 258 +/- 49 ka. We
   report petrographical and geochemical data, new geochronological ages
   and for the first time a detailed geological map representing the
   eruptive products generated by the Irruputuncu volcano. The detailed
   study on the volcanic products allows us to establish a temporal
   evolution of the edifice. We propose that the Irruputuncu volcanic
   history can be divided in two stages, both dominated by effusive
   activity: Irruputuncu I and II. The oldest identified products that mark
   the beginning of Irruputuncu I are small-volume pyroclastic flow
   deposits generated during an explosive phase that may have been
   triggered by magma injection as suggested by mingling features in the
   clasts. This event was followed by generation of large lava flows and
   the edifice grew until destabilization of its SW flank through the
   generation of a debris avalanche, which ended Irruputuncu I. New
   effusive activity generated lavas flows to the NW at the beginning of
   Irruputuncu II. In the meantime, lava domes that grew in the summit were
   destabilized, as shown by two well-preserved block-and-ash flow
   deposits. The first phase of dome collapse, in particular, generated
   highly mobile pyroclastic flows that propagated up to similar to 8 km
   from their source on gentle slopes as low as 11 degrees in distal areas.
   The actual activity is characterized by deposition of sulfur and
   permanent gas emissions, producing a gas plume that reaches 200 m above
   the crater. The maximum volume of this volcanic system is of similar to
   4 km(3), being one of the smallest active volcano of Central Andes. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: Clear anterior rhinorrhea is commonly observed in older
   adults and is widely known as ``senile rhinorrhea.{''} Although
   appreciated in the literature, no studies support that clear rhinorrhea
   increases with age. Our goal was to determine the prevalence of clear
   rhinorrhea in adults and the variation between young and old.
   Additionally, we sought to determine if clear rhinorrhea was bothersome
   enough for patients to seek treatment.
   Methods: A questionnaire was randomly distributed to 158 adults, 76
   young adults on the University of Pittsburgh Undergraduate campus, and
   82 older adults at Longwood Retirement Community in 2011.
   Results: Older subjects reported more drip and an increase in rhinorrhea
   over time regardless of gender (p < 0.05). Participants wanting to seek
   treatment reported drip occurred more often, that they used more
   tissues, and were more bothered by drip compared to those not wanting
   treatment (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Clear, anterior rhinorrhea affects older adults regardless
   of gender significantly more often and more severely than young adults
   (p < 0.05). The more frequent and bothersome the nasal drip, the more
   likely individuals would elect treatment. (C) 2015 ARS-AAOA, LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of established associations between alcohol problems and
   intimate partner violence (IPV), the current study investigated whether
   jealousy has positive and negative dimensions, and whether they
   differentially moderate the association between problem drinking and IPV
   perpetration in heavy-drinking college students (N = 448). Factor
   analyses suggested positive and negative dimensions of jealousy. Whereas
   negative jealousy was conceptualized by the traditional definition of
   jealousy, positive jealousy reflected relationship commitment and
   emotional distress upon considering one's partner becoming romantically
   involved with another person. Results supported hypotheses such that
   positive and negative jealousy dimensions moderated the drinking
   problems-IPV link in opposite directions: Drinking problems were
   associated with increased perpetration among individuals higher in
   negative and lower in positive jealousy. Results provide support for the
   notion that jealousy is not universally negative and highlight the
   importance of different types of jealousy in understanding the
   association between alcohol problems and IPV perpetration.}},

Abstract = {{The environmental bioavailability of copper was determined using a

   surrogate and two microalgae species (Scenedesmus acutus and
   Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata). Several experimental conditions were
   studied: pH, the presence of organic matter, inorganic anions, and
   concomitant cations. The results indicated a strong relationship between
   the response given by the HFSLM and the microalgae species with free
   copper concentrations measured by an ion selective electrode (ISE), in
   accordance with the free-ion activity model (FIAM). A significant
   positive correlation was evident when comparing the bioavailability
   results measured by the HFSLM and the S. acutus microalga species,
   showing that the synthetic device may emulate biological uptake and,
   consequently, be used as a chemical test for bioavailability
   measurements using this alga as a biological reference. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The exoskeletons of pancrustaceans, as typified by decapod crustaceans
   and insects, demonstrate a high degree of similarity with respect to
   histology, ultrastructure, function, and composition. The cuticular
   envelope in insects and the outer epicuticle in crustaceans both serve
   as the primary barrier to permeability of the exoskeleton, preventing
   loss of water and ions to the external medium. Prior to and following
   ecdysis, there is a sequence of expression and synthesis of different
   proteins by the cuticular epithelium for incorporation into the
   pre-exuvial and post-exuvial procuticle of insects and the exocuticle
   and endocuticle of crustaceans. Both exhibit regional differences in
   cuticular composition, e.g., the articular (intersegmental) membranes of
   insects and the arthrodial (joint) membranes of crustaceans. The primary
   difference between these cuticles is the ability to mineralize.
   Crustaceans' cuticles express a unique suite of proteins that provide
   for the nucleation and deposition of calcium carbonate. Orthologs of
   genes discussed in the present review were mined from a recently
   completed cuticular transcriptome of the crayfish, Cherax
   quadricarinatus, providing new insights into the nature of these
   proteins.}},

Abstract = {{IT HAS BEEN accepted for many years that, unlike their silver
   counterparts, pewter chalices and patens found in priestly burials
   continued largely unchanged in form throughout the medieval period; this
   means that the presence of a pewter chalice or paten does not in itself
   currently offer any reliable dating of a related burial beyond a broad
   13th-16th-century timeframe. Pewter chalices and patens recovered from
   25 burials within York Minster between 1966 and 1973 are thought to
   represent the largest collection found within one church in England, and
   initial assessment of this collection and its related excavation data
   indicated that it offered the possibility of providing findspots for
   some of the vessels from recorded burials or dated archaeological
   sequences, and thus to provide more examples of tightly drawn dating. In
   the event, it has been possible to assign a single chalice and paten set
   to a recorded individual, and to provide others with periods within
   which, or after which, burial occurred. Scrutiny of the objects also
   resulted in the identification of two distinct forms of paten, one of
   which was shown in seven instances to bear incised motifs which had not
   been noted or commented upon previously.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study about electrical performance of ceramic and
   polymeric insulators bio-contaminated with alga Chlorella vulgaris. The
   performed tests involve ANSI 55-2 and ANSI 52-1 ceramic insulators and
   ANSI DS-15 polymeric insulators, all of them used in distribution
   systems of Colombia. Biological contamination of insulators is realized
   using a controlled environment chamber that adjusts the temperature,
   humidity and light radiation. The laboratory tests include measurements
   of flashover voltages and leakage currents and they were performed to
   determine how insulators are affected by biological contamination. After
   a series of laboratory tests, it was concluded that the presence of
   Chlorella vulgaris on the contaminated ceramic insulators reduces the
   wet flashover voltage up to 12\% and increases their leakage currents up
   to 80\%. On the other hand, for polymeric insulators the effect of algae
   growth on flashover voltages was not to strong, although the leakage
   currents increase up to 60\%.}},

Abstract = {{Extraembryonic tissues, in particular, umbilical cord stroma are
   promising sources of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells for
   regenerative medicine. In recent years, methods for isolation of
   mesenchymal stromal cells from different compartments of the umbilical

   explants have been proposed. Here we propose a protocol of isolation of
   multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells from the whole umbilical cord that
   combines the advantages of each approach and ensures sufficient cell
   yield for further experimental and clinical applications. A combination
   of short-term incubation of tissue fragments on cold collagenase
   solution followed by their culturing in the form of explants
   significantly increased the yield of cells with high proliferative
   activity, typical pluripotent mesenchymal stromal cell phenotype, and
   preserved differentiation capacity.}},

   polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were
   employed to characterize the electrochemical behavior of plasma sprayed
   yttrium oxide stabilized zirconium oxide (YsZ) coated CoCrMo alloy in
   Ringer solution. Surface characterization before and after
   electrochemical testing was performed used scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM). YsZ-coated showed higher zero corrosion potential (ZCP) and lower
   corrosion current density (i(corr)) compared with the CoCrMo substrate.
   The electrochemical properties of the coated CoCrMo sample at the open
   circuit potential at different immersion time in Ringer solution were

Abstract = {{The overall heat transfer through an active hydrothermal sulfide
   edifice, in particular the North Tower of Grotto, has been estimated at
   80 MW or greater based on the following in situ measurements and
   assumptions: (1) The heat transfer by diffuse flow is estimated at
   33-380 MW based on extrapolating the acoustically mapped area to all
   sides of the North Tower ({''}visible{''} area=30 m(2); extrapolated
   area= 100 m(2)) and using the range of available spot measurements of
   temperature (6-23 degrees C) and vertical velocity (0.07-0.28 m/s). The
   lower number (33 MW) is more likely, but there is insufficient knowledge
   of the temporal and spatial variability of diffuse flow to be certain.
   (2) The heat transfer by focused flow is estimated at 30-70 MW based on
   summing the estimated individual rates of heat transfer for 4 out of 7
   documented black smokers and flanges. (3) Conductive heat transfer out
   of the mound is unknown, but is likely to be much less than the
   advective heat transfer. Additionally, the plume transport of heat is
   estimated at 20-40 MW based on the direct measurement of temperature
   within the plume (at 5-25 m above the top of the edifice). Despite
   uncertainties, the lower estimate of plume versus smoker heat transfer
   suggests that heat transfer is dominantly by diffuse flow. Furthermore,
   not all plumes from individual smokers may merge even for so small an
   area as the North Tower of Grotto. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The purpose of surgical literature is to publish the latest study
   results and to provide continuing medical education to readers. For
   optimal allocation of resources, institutional subscribers, professional
   societies and scientific publishers require structured data on reading
   and subscription preferences of potential readers of surgical
   literature.
   To obtain representative data on the preferences of German general and
   visceral surgeons regarding reading of and subscription to scientific
   journals.
   All members of the German Society for General and Visceral Surgery
   (DGAV) were invited to participate in a web-based survey. Questions were
   asked on the affiliation and position of the member, individual journal
   subscriptions, institutional access to scientific journals, preferences
   regarding electronic or print articles and special subscriptions for
   society members. Answers were descriptively analyzed.
   A total of 630 out of 4091 (15 \%) members participated in the survey
   and 73 \% of the respondents had at least 1 individual subscription to a
   scientific journal. The most frequently subscribed journal was Der
   Chirurg (47 \% of respondents). The institutional access to journals was
   deemed insufficient by 48 \% of respondents, predominantly in primary
   care hospitals and outpatient clinics. Almost half of the respondents
   gave sufficient importance to reading printed versions of articles for
   which they would pay extra fees. A group subscription for society
   members was perceived as advantageous as long as no relevant extra costs
   were incurred.
   This structured survey among members of the DGAV provides data on
   preferences regarding reading of and subscription to scientific
   journals. Individual subscriptions to journals are still common,
   possibly due to suboptimal institutional access particularly at smaller
   non-academic institutions. In an age of online publications it seems
   surprising that many respondents place a high value on printed versions.
   The results are relevant for potential institutional subscribers,
   professional societies and scientific publishers.}},

Abstract = {{The key questions addressed here were: the structure elucidation and the
   investigation of the adsorption space and framework expansion effect of
   a Cu(II) hexacyanoferrate (III) polymorph (labeled Cu-PBA-I). The
   structural analysis was performed with a broad set of characterization
   methods. Additionally, a low and high pressure carbon dioxide adsorption
   investigation was performed, assuming, to comprehend the adsorption
   experiments, that the adsorbent plus the adsorbed phase were a solid
   solution. We concluded: that the Cu-PBA-I presented the following
   composition, K1/4Cu(II){[}Fe(III)(CN)(6)](3/4)circle(1/4)nH(2)O,
   exhibited an antiferromagnetic behavior and displayed a thermally stable
   I4m2 space group lattice in the degassed state. Moreover, the low
   pressure adsorption study allowed the calculation of the micropore
   volume, W=0.09 cm(3)/g and the isosteric heat of adsorption, q(iso)=19
   kJ/mol; further, the high pressure adsorption data revealed an extremely
   high adsorption capacity owing to a framework expansion effect. Finally,
   the DRIFTS spectrum of adsorbed CO2 displayed peaks corresponding to
   carbon dioxide physically adsorbed and interacting with electron
   accepting Lewis acid sites. Hence, was produced an excellent adsorbent
   which combine porosity and anti-ferromagnetism, antagonist properties
   rarely found together. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic study of the growth process of LaMnO3 (LMO) thin films, by
   pulsed laser deposition, on top of SrTiO3 substrates under different
   oxygen partial pressures (PO is reported. It is found that the
   accommodation of the orthorhombic LMO phase onto the cubic STO
   structure, i.e., the amount of structural strain, is controlled by the
   background oxygen pressure. We demonstrate that magnetic behavior can be
   continuously tuned from robust ferromagnetic (FM) ordering to an
   antiferromagnet. These results strongly point to a strain-induced
   selective orbital occupancy as the origin of the observed FM behavior,
   in agreement with recent theoretical calculations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the stratigraphic and geographic distribution of
   coal composition in main Late Permian coal measures in the Bowen Basin,
   using coal electrofacies as a proxy for inertinite maceral group
   content. Data for this research were derived from some 26 wells in the
   northern part of the Bowen Basin. A companion paper (Roslin and Esterle,
   2015, in review) introduced the methodology, which is based on
   electrofacies analysis and uses high-resolution wireline data (including
   microresistivity from Compact Micro-Image (CMI) tool and Photoelectric
   Factor (PEF) data in addition to conventional gamma ray, density and
   laterolog resistivity) to obtain coal electrofacies. Validation of the
   methodology was performed by comparison of the weighted average
   proportion of coal electrofacies to the weighted average proportion of
   the corresponding coal lithotypes obtained from millimetre scale logging
   and to the percentage gathered from maceral content analysis. The
   weighted average proportion of the interpreted dull inertinite-rich coal
   electrofacies (independent of rank and heat effects) was then analysed
   to determine their stratigraphic and geographic distribution.
   From the base upward, the main Late Permian coal bearing units are the
   Moranbah Coal Measure (MCM), Fort Cooper Coal Measure (FCCM), and Rangal
   Coal Measure (RCM) and their stratigraphic equivalents across the basin.
   The proportion of inertinite-rich dull coal electrofacies increases
   upwards in the RCM, with some thick and merged seams showing distinctive
   electrofacies signatures. Within the study area, the coal measures and
   individual seams split from north to south, reflecting increased
   subsidence and sediment influx into basin depocentres. As the seams
   split, the proportion of inertinite-rich dull coal electrofacies
   decreases in the tested sample set. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A novel design for continuous flow sonocrystallization of adipic acid in
   a capillary device is presented and investigated experimentally and
   numerically. The effect of supersaturation and ultrasound power is
   studied. To elucidate the relationship between crystallization and
   cavitation, sonochemiluminescence and sonoemulsification experiments are
   performed, and numerical investigation of the wave propagation in
   aqueous solution is used to predict the probability of cavitation.
   Crystal size distribution at different operating conditions is obtained
   by laser diffraction. Narrow size distributions, small mean size of
   crystals (ca. 15 mu m), and high crystal production rate are achieved
   when applying ultrasound. In addition, numerical simulations of pressure
   distribution show that high pressure amplitudes are obtainable near the
   vicinity of the sonoprobe tip. Using a cavitation threshold formulation,
   the distance from the tip where transient cavitation takes place is
   quantified. The results are in agreement with the experimental findings,
   in which by increasing the distance between capillary and sonoprobe,
   emulsification, sonochemiluminescence, and nucleation decrease. It is
   concluded that transient significant mechanism for enhancing nucleation

Title = {{`Seeing red' in national parks: How visitors' values affect perceptions
   and park experiences}},
Journal = {{GEOFORUM}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{41-52}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{People's reasons for visiting national parks have been well researched.
   So too have their park activities and how diverse activities potentially
   affect visitors' park experiences (e.g. perceptions of overcrowding).
   Far less research has examined how park users' environmental values
   might affect their perceptions of other users and the appropriateness of
   different activities a potential source of conflict. Relationships
   between personal environmental values and environmental and social
   perceptions are complex and interactive in the context of park
   visitation. Visitors' encounters with other users can powerfully affect
   their experience and enjoyment of parks, in turn reflecting such factors
   as values-related expectations and judgments in the context of national
   parks. Personal and social values may also play an important role in
   influencing whether different activities are perceived as `out of place'
   in the context of national park place meaning, yet the conceptualization
   of values within geographic literature on parks remains comparatively
   weak.
   This paper utilizes a definition of values, derived from a concise
   review of the geography and social psychology literatures, to explain
   the results of survey research we undertook within national parks in
   Queensland, Australia. We use a `values-behavior hierarchy' conceptual
   framework to consider how the personal environmental values of a sample
   of park visitors (n = 404) potentially affected patterns of park
   visitation, user activities, and user conflicts. Findings suggest that
   visitors' environmental values shaped how they perceived other park
   users and the appropriateness of their activities. This has
   international implications for geographic research and other disciplines
   and professions involved in national park visitation, park use, and
   human impacts, on and of these powerful places. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Filled chocolates are particularly susceptible to quality loss due to
   oil migration. Since the fillings are often softer than the chocolate
   coatings, the filling lipids can function as an activator for diffusion
   processes with the formation of fat bloom as a consequence. Filling
   lipids can merge with chocolate during production or storage. However,
   in most studies concerning crystallization or migration cocoa butter and
   hazelnut oil were analyzed, investigations on chocolate are rare. To
   cover a broad variety of fillings, dark chocolate was blended with
   hazelnut oil, butterfat, and coconut oil and crystallization was
   analyzed. All investigated lipids reduced the solid fat content to the
   same extend. However, crystallization behavior of the blended samples
   differed. Hazelnut oil accelerated crystallization rate and did not
   affect crystallization time, while butterfat reduced crystallization
   rate and time. The effect of coconut oil addition was in between those
   of hazelnut oil and butterfat. Nucleation and crystal growth rate, which
   affect the crystallization speed, have been shown to be affected by the
   type of filling lipid. Additionally, there is evidence that crystal
   transformation during crystallization is also affected by filling
   lipids.
   Practical applications: Based on the results of this study,
   manufacturers of filled chocolate products may adapt their processing
   parameters such as temperature and retention time in the cooling tunnel
   accordingly. The analytical methods may be used to control the
   production of confectionery and to determine filling fat concentrations
   in the chocolate shells of freshly produced pralines. As different
   filling lipids in small contents cause similar softening of chocolate
   shells, the solid fat content (SFC) of chocolate is an appropriate
   method to control filling lipid migration into chocolate.}},

Abstract = {{A fast algorithm for the evaluation of the double-bounce (DB)
   contributions to the physical optics scattering integrals, over a range
   of aspect angles and frequencies, is presented. The work extends the
   preceding far-field algorithm, to encompass three-dimensional and
   near-field scenarios. The algorithm relies on multilevel sampling and
   interpolation of phase- and amplitude-compensated contributions of
   subdomain pairs. A particular design of the phase- and
   amplitude-compensation functions and sampling grids, tailored to the DB
   near-field case, is presented. The improved performance and error
   controllability are demonstrated via representative examples.}},

Abstract = {{The main aim of this investigation was to improve the retarding effect

   encapsulation of hydrogen peroxide in cationic liposomes as an
   alternative to sodium silicate. The results obtained indicate that
   cationic liposomes can totally replace sodium silicate, and the
   retarding effect of liposomes and cationic liposomes on hydrogen
   peroxide decomposition was more effective than that of sodium silicate
   in the bleaching bath of cotton fibers. The optimum bleaching effect was
   achieved at pH 9 and 85 degrees C when cationic liposomes were used as
   oxidant stabilizer. Compared with liposomes and sodium silicate,
   cationic liposomes have better retarding effect on hydrogen peroxide
   decomposition and better whiteness improving effect on cotton fibers
   bleaching. The results indicated the potential of cationic liposomes as
   a novel stabilizer for bleaching applications.}},

Abstract = {{Antisense oligonucleotides have been used to target regulatory proteins
   in both in vivo and in vitro models of prostate cancer. Our previous
   studies showed that oligonucleotide-treated LNCaP prostate cancer cells
   compensate for diminished expression of B-cell chronic lymphocytic
   leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2), an apoptosis inhibitor, by suppressing the
   expression of caspase-3 (an apoptosis promoter) while enhancing that of
   serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT1) (another apoptosis inhibitor). In
   addition, we found an enhanced expression of the androgen receptor (AR),
   its p300 and interleukin-6 (IL6) co-activators, polymerase transcription
   mediator (MED12), and growthregulating signal transducer (STAT3). The
   net result was an altered pattern of gene expression often associated
   with more aggressive and proliferative tumors. To further evaluate
   adaptive compensatory mechanisms related to tumor resistance, aggression
   and proliferation, herein we evaluated the level of expression of a
   proliferation antigen (KI-67) and mitosis-regulating cyclins (B1 and
   D1). Compared to the relative levels of compensation detailed above, we
   found the expression of KI-67 to be statistically the most enhanced
   non-targeted protein yet identified in compensation for suppression of
   BCL2. Expression of cyclin D1 was also significantly enhanced, although
   to a much lesser extent. As a result, we propose that
   oligonucleotide-mediated treatment could be more effective when directed
   towards KI-67 and BCL2. This could be accomplished by dual monospecific
   targeting KI-67 and BCL2, or with a bispecific (or proposed
   multispecific) oligonucleotide simultaneously targeting both.}},

   (PBHDM) model for dairy systems}},

Abstract = {{Modelling pasture-based systems is a challenge for modellers worldwide.
   However, models can play a vital role as grazing management tools and
   help the decision making process at farm level. The objective of this
   paper is to describe and evaluate the pasture-based herd dynamic milk
   (PBHDM) model. The PBHDM model comprises the herd dynamic milk (HDM)
   model and integrates it with a grazing management and a paddock
   sub-model. Animal intake at grazing is dependent on the animal
   characteristics but also on grass availability and quality. It also
   depends on the interactions between the animal and the grass during the
   defoliation process. Management of grass on farm can be regulated
   through different rules during the grazing season including the decision
   to cut some paddocks in the case of a grass surplus and to allocate
   supplementation in the case of a grass deficit. The PBHDM was evaluated
   by comparing model outputs with two grazing systems one in France and
   one in Ireland. For both farms the grazing season is longer than 7
   months. Model outputs that were compared to the actual experimental data
   included milk production, pre- and post-grazing height and feed
   supplementation levels. These outputs were all compared on a weekly
   basis while paddock residence time and total grass harvested as
   conserved grass silage was evaluated over the grazing season as a whole.
   The model was capable of reproducing the two grazing systems with
   acceptable accuracy. It simulated the pre- and post-grazing height with
   a maximal difference between the actual and the simulated average height
   through the year of 0.4 cm. The model has a tendency to slightly
   over-estimate the milk production especially in autumn. However in
   general the model is relatively accurate with a root mean square error
   less than 20\% for the simulated farms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Background and objective: High levels of daily physical activity have
   been shown to be linked to decreased functional impairment in peripheral
   artery disease (PAD) patients and positively related to the ankle
   brachial index (ABI) in subjects without PAD. The aim of this study was
   to examine the relationship between leisure time physical activity
   (LTPA) and the ABI in a general population.
   Material and method: Baseline data from the ARTPER study cohort
   corresponding to 2,840 subjects > 49 years from Barcelona were analyzed.
   The LTPA variable was obtained through the validated Spanish short
   version of the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire.
   ABI <0.9 was taken to indicate PAD. Multivariate logistic regression
   analysis was performed to evaluate the independent association between
   LTPA and PAD.
   Results: Subjects with more LTPA were younger, female, less smokers, and
   suffered fewer PAD. Total activity, measured in metabolic energy
   turnover (MET) and the LTPA hours, was significantly higher in subjects
   without PAD (P < .001). There was an inverse relationship between LTPA
   and the risk of suffering PAD (odds ratio 0.56, 95\% confidence interval
   0.38-0.81 for those who expended 2,700 METs or more in 14 days)
   adjusting for confounding factors.
   Conclusions: In our study, LTPA was positively related to the ABI, with
   those with PAD being the ones with less LTPA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Espana,

Abstract = {{Probabilistic harmonic load flow (HLF) is currently enjoying renewed
   popularity. This is not surprising since in the near future, thousands
   of photovoltaic (PV) systems will be integrated into distribution
   systems. However, as yet, there is no model capable of explaining PV
   harmonic current behaviour in probabilistic HLF studies. To fill this
   gap, the harmonic modelling of PV systems proposed in this paper has
   three key points. First, it provides an effective model of the
   relationship between PV harmonic current emission and background
   harmonic voltages. Second, it statistically characterises PV harmonic
   currents (relative magnitude and phase angle) at different
   fundamental-frequency current output intervals using historical
   time-series data. In this statistical characterisation, the first fifth
   moments of each PV harmonic current are used to accurately approximate
   the raw probability density function (PDF) by means of the Legendre
   series. Finally, the third key point of this harmonic modelling is a
   method capable of determining the distribution functions of PV harmonic
   currents (absolute magnitude and phase angle), based on the statistical
   characterisation and a fundamental-frequency probabilistic PV model. The
   numerical results obtained confirm the effectiveness of this PV model.

Abstract = {{Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates typically consist

   these same surfaces can be used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio
   obtained in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy of aqueous solutions.
   In this case, the SERS substrates not only lower breakdown thresholds
   and lead to more efficient plasma initiation but also provide an
   appropriately wettable surface for the deposition of the liquid. We
   refer to this technique as surface-enhanced laser-induced breakdown

Abstract = {{Although the phenomenon of adhesion in geckos has been intensively
   studied for over 200 years, our understanding of how the morphological
   apparatus associated with this arose is less clear. Indeed, whether or
   not all of the intricate morphological hierarchy that is implicated in
   the attachment and removal of the adhesive setae originated at the same
   time is unknown. To explore whether setae may have arisen prior to the
   other parts of this structural hierarchy, we undertook morphological
   observations of Gonatodes, an ancestrally padless, sphaerodatyline genus
   known to exhibit the expression of incipient subdigital pads in some
   species. Focusing on this geographically and morphologically
   well-circumscribed genus, for which intraspecific relationships are
   adequately known and ecology is quite well documented, allowed us to
   deduce trends in digit proportions, shape, scalation, and skeletal
   structure, and associate these with the micro-ornamentation of the
   subdigital surfaces. Our findings indicate that in Gonatodes, setae
   capable of inducing adhesion are present without the modifications of
   the digital musculotendinous, circulatory and skeletal systems that are
   generally considered to be necessary for the operation of a functional
   adhesive apparatus. The acquisition of these latter characteristics
   (independently in many lineages of gekkotans, and incipiently so in
   Anolis) may have been preceded by a suite of modifications of the digits
   that enhanced static clinging in relation to sit-and-wait predation and
   the ability to take refuge on surfaces unavailable to other taxa. These
   possibilities await further testing. J. Morphol. 276:1311-1332, 2015.

Abstract = {{Portal vein occlusion (PVO) is used to increase inadequate future liver
   remnant volume (FLRV). Impaired liver regeneration has been reported in
   aged animals. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of patient
   age on hepatic regeneration.
   Sixty patients aged a parts per thousand yen70 years were matched 1:1
   with 60 patients aged < 70 years. Matching criteria were sex, diabetes,
   cirrhosis, pre-PVO chemotherapy and bevacizumab administration, and
   jaundice.
   The median ages in the older and younger groups were 76 (range 70-83)
   years and 59 (range 20-69) years, respectively (p < 0.001). Median FLRV
   following PVO (33.1 +/- A 6.8 vs. 31.9 +/- A 6.0 \%) and volumetric
   increase (0.52 +/- A 0.35 vs. 0.49 +/- A 0.34) were similar in the two
   groups. Of the older and younger patients, 10 \% and 1.7 \%,
   respectively, did not undergo liver surgery after PVO (p = 0.051).
   Mortality (5.5 vs. 6.7 \%) and major morbidity (25.9.8 vs. 22 \%) rates
   were similar. Liver failure rate was higher in older patients (35.1 vs.
   16.9 \%, p < 0.026), mainly due to Grade A liver failure (20.3 vs. 8.4
   \%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that age a parts per
   thousand yen 70 years {[}odds ratio (OR) 3.03; 95 \% confidence interval
   (CI) 1.18-7.78; p = 0.020] and biliary cancer diagnosis (OR 4.69; 95 \%
   CI 1.81-12.09; p = 0.001) were independent risk factors for
   postoperative liver failure.
   Liver regeneration after PVO is not impaired by age. Nevertheless, liver
   resection in elderly patients is performed less often after PVO and
   carries a higher risk of liver failure.}},

Abstract = {{To elaborate a complete model of the Earth system, it is necessary to
   include the model of dynamics of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets into
   the General Circulation Model (GCM). The problem is that spatial and
   temporal scales of ice sheet dynamics, on one hand, and the dynamics of
   atmosphere and the ocean, on the other hand, differ considerably. In
   order to unite them in one model, implementation of one or another
   downscaling procedure is required. For this purpose we elaborated an
   energy-and water balance model of the Greenland ice sheet (EWBM-G)
   serving as a buffer between the GCM INMCM and the ice sheet model.
   EWBM-G describes heat and water vapor diffusion in a limited domain with
   the boundary conditions transferred from the INMCM. This paper describes
   the model and set-up of the numerical experiments aiming at calculation
   surface air temperature and annual precipitation amount in Greenland in
   accordance with the simulated pre-industrial climate. The results of

Abstract = {{Objective: A recent investigation has documented an increased risk of
   aneurysm-related complications after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)
   of familial abdominal aortic aneurysms (fAAAs). We hypothesized that
   fAAA patients are not at increased risk for complications following open
   AAA repair or EVAR when compared with sporadic abdominal aortic aneurysm
   (spAAA) patients. To this end, we performed a single institution
   retrospective review.
   Methods: Epidemiologic data were collected through the electronic
   medical record. Family history data were obtained from a questionnaire
   administered at the initial vascular surgery consultation. Major adverse
   events were defined as myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, renal
   failure, bowel ischemia, limb ischemia, multisystem organ failure,
   intracranial hemorrhage, paraplegia, hemorrhage, or death. Endoleaks
   were classified in accordance with the standardized reporting practices
   of the Society for Vascular Surgery. AAA-related complications were
   defined as the need for a secondary intervention due to endoleak, limb
   ischemia, or postimplantation rupture.
   Results: A total of 392 patients with complete clinical data underwent
   elective AAA repair from 2004 to 2014. Of these 392 patients, 89 (23\%)
   were classified as fAAA patients and 303 (77\%) were classified as spAAA
   patients. With the exception of increased rates of chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (P =.0009) and pack-years smoked (P =.03) in spAAA
   patients, demographics did not differ. Sixty-two percent (n =55) of fAAA
   patients and 68\% (n =205) of spAAA patients underwent EVAR (P =.30).
   fAAA patients did not incur any significant difference in major adverse
   events following open AAA repair (fAAA, 9\% vs spAAA, 11\%; P=. 75).
   Additionally, fAAA patients did not incur any significant difference in
   major adverse events following EVAR (fAAA, 4\% vs spAAA, 5\%; P =.70).
   Patients with fAAA did have a significantly increased rate of endoleak
   (fAAA, 24\% vs spAAA, 12\%; P =.03) and secondary intervention following
   EVAR (fAAA, 21\% vs spAAA, 12\%; P =.04).
   Conclusions: The current study shows that patients with fAAA do not have
   increased perioperative morbidity following open or endovascular AAA
   repair. However, patients with fAAA do have an increased risk of
   endoleak and secondary intervention following EVAR. These findings
   suggest that EVAR and open AAA repair are both safe and effective for
   fAAA patients. The increased rate of endoleak and secondary intervention
   in patients with fAAA suggests that this subpopulation may benefit from
   closer post-EVAR surveillance or open surgical repair in good risk
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{The Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter method is a tool to improve air
   quality management, since it determines meteorological effects on air
   quality concentrations and separates out those effects in order to
   examine underlying trends. Air quality in Portugal is exceeding the
   legislated particulate matter (PM10), nitrogen oxides (NO2) and ozone
   (O-3) levels; accordingly, measures to reduce pollutant emissions have
   been designed. The primary objective of this work is to investigate the
   influence of meteorology on O-3, NO2 and PM10 levels and the long-term
   air quality trends. Air quality and meteorological datasets were
   explored for the period 2002-2012 through the decomposition of
   time-series using the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter. To determine the
   best meteorological predictors for the air quality data, a stepwise
   regression analysis of the filtered time-series was applied. The KZ
   filter application revealed that the short-term component has the
   highest contribution to the total variance of the original air quality
   data (approximate to 64\%-PM10; approximate to 52\%-O-3; approximate to
   54\%-NO2) followed by the seasonal component. The long-term component
   exhibits the influence of the emission control regulations implemented
   in each study region. The statistical analysis of the air quality and
   the meteorological data indicated that O-3 has a statistically
   significant relationship with temperature in most of the components. The
   results also indicate that emission control strategies are primary
   regulators for NO2 and PM10 levels. Therefore, to establish an accurate
   strategy to improve air quality further, it will be essential to include
   meteorological effects. This study highlights that the KZ filter is a
   useful tool to support the design and implementation of adequate air
   quality strategies and for the investigation of the interactions between
   the emissions, the meteorological conditions and the air quality levels,
   to improve air quality management in these two urban areas. Copyright

Abstract = {{Decision makers often face complicated decision problems with intangible
   and conflicting criteria. Numerous multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM)
   methods have been proposed to handle the measurement of the priorities
   of conflicting tangible/intangible criteria and in turn use them to
   choose the best alternative for a decision. However, the presence of
   many MCDM methods bewilders users. The existence of these methods
   becomes a decision problem in itself, and decision makers may be
   uncertain about which one to use. Thus the comparative analysis and
   evaluation of various MCDM methods has come under scrutiny by both
   researchers and practitioners in order to discover if there are logical,
   mathematical, social or practical reasons why one method is better than
   another. Criteria for their evaluation are the first important issue
   that needs to be resolved. In this paper, 16 criteria are introduced
   that may be used to judge and evaluate various MCDM methods. The
   criteria proposed and some guidelines for their evaluation are given to
   help readers evaluate these MCDM methods.}},

Abstract = {{Neoliberal economic and social policies during the last 65 years have
   placed a premium on continuous economic growth. Concern among ecological
   economists and other critics that economic growth results in loss of
   natural capital and ecosystem services led to introduction of the
   concept of ``uneconomic growth,{''} defined as ``growth of the macro
   economy that costs us more than it is worth{''} (Daly and Farley,
   Ecological economics principles and applications. Washington: Island
   Press; 2004). This paper proposes the concept of ``unjust uneconomic
   growth{''} to pinpoint the additional costs of policies that promote
   uneconomic growth to the neglect of other considerations and uses the
   case of Newfoundland and Labrador fisheries policies since 1992 to
   document it. Newfoundland and Labrador fisheries experienced uneconomic
   growth in the 1980s leading to the collapse of ground fish stocks. The
   policies enacted since 1993 based on economic growth goals have failed
   to solve the ecological-social crisis and entailed additional costs to
   small-scale fisheries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To investigate the effect of various dilutions of antibiotic
   medicaments used in endodontic regeneration on the survival of human
   dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and to determine their antibacterial
   effect against established Enterococcus faecalis biofilm.
   Materials and methods The cytotoxic and antibacterial effects of
   different triple (TAP) and double antibiotic paste (DAP) dilutions
   (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 10 mg/ml) were tested against Enterococcus
   faecalis established biofilm and DPSC. Established bacterial biofilm
   were exposed to antibiotic dilutions for 3 days. Then, biofilms were
   collected, spiral plated, and the numbers of bacterial colony forming
   units (CFU/ml) were determined. For the cytotoxic effect, lactate
   dehydrogenase activity assays (LDH) and cell viability assays (WST-1)
   were used to measure the percentage of DPSC cytotoxicity after 3-day
   treatment with the same antibiotic dilutions. A general linear mixed
   model was used for statistical analyses (alpha = 0.05).
   Results All antibiotic dilutions significantly decreased the bacterial
   CFU/ml. For WST-1 assays, all antibiotic dilutions except 0.125 mg/ml
   significantly reduced the viability of DPSC. For LDH assays, the three
   lowest tested concentrations of DAP (0.5, 0.25, 0.125 mg/ml) and the two
   lowest concentrations of TAP (0.25 and 0.125 mg/ml) were non-toxic to
   DPSC.
   Conclusions All tested dilutions had an antibacterial effect against E.
   faecalis. However, 0.125 mg/ml of DAP and TAP showed a significant
   antibacterial effect with no cytotoxic effects on DPSCs.}},

   of jacketing with Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) towards
   improvement in strength, ductility and other dynamic properties, four
   scaled down (1:4) LSC circular bridge pier models were first
   strengthened with CFRP wraps and then subjected to Quasi-Static Cyclic
   Load Tests (QSCLT) and Free Vibration Tests (FVT). The bridge pier
   models were later analyzed using finite element software i.e.
   Seismostruct and the results were compared with the experimentally
   tested results in terms of energy dissipation capacity of retrofitted
   bridge piers. The external confinement by CFRP's enhanced their energy
   dissipation capabilities and hence strength and ductility of the
   reinforced concrete piers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Underground coal mining induces de-stressing and fracturing of strata
   above and below the targeted seams. This creates a gas-emission zone,
   which contains gas-bearing coal seams and strata in the roof and floor
   of the mined (working) seam. In longwall mining, most of the gas
   released from the emission zone escapes into the coal face and the goaf
   (caved-in area) behind the coal face, where it presents a safety issue.
   Depending on the extent and shape of the emission zone, various gas
   drainage strategies could be applied to maximise capture of the gas from
   the emitting seams. We developed and trialled a new method to identify
   the gas emission zone in the underburden of an underground mine in the
   Sydney Basin, Australia. In this operation, all coal seams are located
   below the major targeted seam for mining. By measuring the isotopic and
   molecular composition of gas desorbed from coal cores from exploration
   drilling and gas collected from the goaf, we identified the source of
   gas and quantified the limit of the emission zone in the underburden of
   the working coal seam. This has allowed drainage to be focused and
   limited to the required depth. Our study will assist others to plan the
   required depth of gas drainage drilling below the floor of mined seams.

Abstract = {{A linear dependency of zero shear, constant shear-rate and constant
   shear-stress viscosities with temperature and hole fraction
   ({''}thermo-occupancy{''} function) was derived for
   poly-acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), polypropylene (PP) and
   polystyrene (PS). The relation of viscosity parameters, such as
   transmission coefficient and a measure of activation energy coefficient,
   with shear-rate and shear-stress was also investigated and some
   conclusions on the differences for the studied polymers were discussed.
   In particular, it was found that, for all materials, the derivative of
   logarithm of viscosities at zero shear, constant shear-rate and constant
   shear-stress decreases with decreasing rate with the hole fraction.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{247-257}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The energy dissipation potential of a metallic damper largely depends on
   the hysteretic response achieved due to the inelastic deformation of
   plates under either axial or flexural or shear loading. In this study, a
   passive energy dissipation device consisting of a series of steel plates
   capable of yielding in both flexure and shear has been experimentally
   investigated under cyclic loading. Two end plates of X-configuration are
   allowed to yield under flexural action, whereas a rectangular web plate
   of the device is allowed to dissipate energy through shear yielding.
   Three shear-and-flexural yielding damping (SAFYD) devices are studied by
   varying the size of both flexure and shear plates. The main parameters
   investigated are load-carrying capacity, hysteretic response, energy
   dissipation, equivalent viscous damping, and ductility. A finite element
   analysis has been carried out to predict the ultimate resistance and
   hysteretic response of the test specimen. The predicted results matched
   reasonably well with the test results. Finally, a design procedure has
   been proposed to proportion the flexure and shear plates of SAFYD
   devices for a given lateral load demand. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Traditional cheeses manufactured from goat's milk in Algeria suffers
   from poor microbial quality, impairing both safety and shelf-life.
   Lactic acid bacteria may not only improve cheese quality, but also offer
   an alternative bioprotective approach to methods such as heating or
   addition of conventional perspectives. In this context, Lactococcus
   lactis ssp. lactis KJ660075 strain was studied. The bacterium had shown
   a remarkable antibacterial inhibition almost against several food borne
   pathogens and spoilage bacteria, but not against Lactobacillus
   plantarum. This antibacterial activity was attributed to proteinaceous
   molecule as its activity was lost with protease treatment. The
   anti-Staphylococcus aureus activity of the isolate was confirmed by
   co-culturing in ultrahigh temperature treated goat's milk (reduction of
   4 log cfu ml(-1)). Futhermore, the strain exhibited a good acidification
   kinetics, caseinolytic and lipolytic activities and moderate autolysis.
   Free amino acid analysis of model cheese manufactured with KJ660075
   revealed the presence of compounds with organoleptic and health
   qualities.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Cover crops can increase soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage and
   reduce the potential for N leaching under agronomic crops, but little is
   known about their effect under bioenergy crops whose aboveground biomass
   is removed either for biofuel production or for livestock feed. The
   objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of cover crops on soil
   organic C (SOC), total N (STN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), and nitrate-N
   (NO3-N) contents at the 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in) depth under bioenergy
   sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) crops from 2010 to 2013 in the
   southeastern United States. Treatments were two sorghum species (forage
   sorghum {[}Sorghum vulgare Pers.] and sweet sorghum) as the main plot
   and four cover crops as the split-plot treatments arranged in a
   randomized complete block with three replications. Cover crop treatments
   were legume (hairy vetch {[}Vicia villosa Roth]), nonlegume (rye
   {[}Secale cereal L.]), biculture of legume and nonlegume (hairy
   vetch/rye), and no cover crop (control). At 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in),
   SOC was greater with hairy vetch/rye than the control under forage
   sorghum. At 0 to 5 and 5 to 15 cm (0 to 2 and 2 to 6 in), STN was
   greater with hairy vetch and hairy vetch/rye than rye under forage
   sorghum and greater with hairy vetch/rye than the control under sweet
   sorghum. At 5 to 15 cm, NO3-N was greater with hairy vetch/rye than rye
   in 2011, but was greater with rye and hairy vetch than hairy vetch/rye
   in 2012. At all depths, NH4-N was greater under forage than sweet
   sorghum in 2012. Regardless of treatments, SOC and STN increased, but
   NH4-N and NO3-N varied from 2010 to 2013. Although soil available N
   varied with cover crops, sorghum types, and climatic conditions from
   year to year, hairy vetch/rye can conserve and/or increase soil C and N
   storage compared with vetch or rye alone, or the control under bioenergy
   sorghum in the southeastern United States. The results can be used to
   claim C credit, increase N cycling, and improve soil and environmental
   quality under bioenergy sorghum in the regions with similar soil and
   climatic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Gastric cancer can be classified into three subgroups according to
   pattern of tumor infiltration into the surrounding tissue: INFa
   (expanding growth and a distinct border with the surrounding tissue),
   INFc (infiltrating growth and an indistinct border with the surrounding
   tissue), and INFb (in-between a and c). How the tumor infiltration
   pattern (INF) relates to prognosis and type of recurrence in advanced
   gastric cancer has not been sufficiently explored. We examined 805
   consecutive advanced gastric adenocarcinoma patients who underwent
   curative gastrectomy at our institution between 1980 and 2005. Poor
   differentiation, serosal invasion, and lymph node metastasis were
   significantly more frequent in patients with INFc tumors than in those
   with INFa/b tumors. For patients with a T2 or T3 tumor, there was no
   significant difference in prognosis between those with INFa/b and with
   INFc. However, for patients with a T4a or T4b tumor, the prognosis of
   those with INFc was significantly worse than that of those with INFa/b.
   In multivariate analysis, INF was an independent prognostic indicator in
   T4a but not T2, T3, and T4b. Furthermore, the prognosis of T4 patients
   with INFc tumors was significantly worse than that of those with INFa/b,
   especially in node-negative but not in node-positive cases. In patients
   with a T4a or T4b tumor, peritoneal recurrence was significantly more
   frequent for those with INFc than for those with INFa/b. Our data
   indicate that INF is useful to predict the prognosis and recurrence
   pattern in T4a node-negative gastric cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated serum uric acid (SUA) level is known to be a prognostic factor

   pathogenesis of the relation between SUA level and coronary plaque

   to investigate the relation between SUA level and plaque composition of
   nonculprit lesions in patients with ACS. A total of 81 patients with ACS
   who underwent intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided percutaneous
   coronary intervention were included. They were classified into 3 groups
   according to tertiles of SUA level. Using integrated backscatter (IB)
   -IVUS system, tissue components were classified into 4 categories:
   calcium deposits, dense fibrosis, fibrosis, and lipid. Tertiles of SUA
   level were as follows: low tertile <5.0 mg/dl; intermediate tertile 5.0
   to 6.4 mg/dl; and high tertile >6.4 mg/dl. There was a trend toward

   +/- 9.1\% vs 49.7 +/- 10.9\% vs 51.1 +/- 9.3\%, p = 0.001) and less
   fibrous components (36.8 +/- 7.8\% vs 44.3 +/- 7.8\% vs 43.2 +/- 6.7\%,
   p < 0.001) in the high than in the low and intermediate tertile groups.
   Multivariate analysis showed high SUA as an independent predictor of
   increasing lipid volume. In conclusion, elevated SUA level is associated
   with greater lipid content of coronary plaque in patients with ACS than
   in patients with normal levels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) is increasingly becoming a
   topical issue for business research and practice. However, there is a
   dearth internationally of empirical research that has investigated the
   factors propelling companies to integrate or inhibiting them from
   integrating sustainability principles in their supply chain management
   (SCM). Therefore, this study examines the motivators for and barriers to
   SSCM adoption in the New Zealand business context and aims to contribute
   to an improved understanding of the motivators of and barriers to SSCM
   implementation. To this end, an exploratory case study was conducted and
   senior managers of four large New Zealand based companies were
   interviewed. The results reveal that sustainability values of top
   management, a desire to reduce risk and stakeholder management are
   salient motivators for SSCM adoption. Conversely, a lack of supplier
   awareness, negative perceptions and inadequate government support are
   identified as barriers to SSCM implementation. Copyright (c) 2015 John

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were
   developed for Plasmopara obducens, the causal agent of the newly
   emergent downy mildew disease of Impatiens walleriana.
   Methods and Results: A 202-Mb draft genome assembly was generated from
   P. obducens using Illumina technology and mined to identify 13,483 SSR
   motifs. Primers were synthesized for 62 marker candidates, of which 37
   generated reliable PCR products. Testing of the 37 markers using 96 P.
   obducens samples showed 96\% of the markers were polymorphic, with 2-6
   alleles observed. Observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from
   0.000-0.892 and 0.023-0.746, respectively. Just 17 markers were
   sufficient to identify all multilocus genotypes.
   Conclusions: These are the first SSR markers available for this
   pathogen, and one of the first molecular resources. These markers will
   be useful in assessing variation in pathogen populations and determining
   the factors contributing to the emergence of destructive impatiens downy
   mildew disease.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a worldwide health public problem,
   affecting over 123 million people. HCV infected individuals should have
   access to dental services, even those who are liver transplant
   candidates or who are undergoing medical treatment. It is also important
   that they are pleased with the service offered. Objective: Characterize
   the patients infected by HCV and verify their satisfaction with dental
   care in comparison to non infected individuals. Methods: A
   cross-sectional survey was carried out on 170 individuals, divided into
   two groups, HCV infected group (85 individuals) and non-infected group
   (85 individuals). Participants answered a questionnaire about their
   demographic data, risk factors, accessibility and satisfaction with
   dental service. Results: HCV infected group had lower education level,
   having only 30.6\% finished pre-school. Considering sexual orientation,
   70.6\% of HCV infected group was heterosexual and 92.9\% had one regular
   sexual partner. Sixty-five HCV infected individuals (77.4\%) and 72
   non-infected (85.7\%) reported not using condoms during sexual
   intercourse. Forty-two percent of HCV infected group and 61.2\% of
   non-infected group were satisfied with dental service. At multivariate
   analysis, education level was risk variable. Conclusion: Education level
   was a risk factor to HCV infection and HCV infected patients showed
   lower frequency of satisfaction with dental services.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Describing the factors associated with direct oral
   anticoagulants (DOA) prescription in patients with atrial fibrillation
   (AF). Method. This study was performed in Toulouse on a cohort of
   patients received in rhythmology consultation, treated with vitamin K
   antagonists (VKA) or DOA for AF. A multivariate model was performed
   using logistic regression to describe the factors associated with DOA
   prescription and secondly, those associated with discontinuation of the
   anticoagulant. Results. Among the 140 patients included, 96 (66\%) were
   treated with VKA and 48 (34\%) with DOA. Recent AF diagnosis (OR 7.52,
   95\% CI {[}2.41;23.29], p = 0.001), previous exposure to VKA (OR 17.11,
   95\% CI {[}4.48;60.91], p<0.001), and no current exposure to
   anti-platelet agents (APA) (OR 7.69, 95\% CI {[}1.22; 50.001, p = 0.030)

   anticoagulant (n=24) was associated to DOA intake (OR 2.71, 95\% CI
   {[}1.21; 6.08], p = 0.016). Discussion. DOA are less prescribed than VKA
   in patients treated with APA. DOA switch to VKA was not systematic in
   patients diagnosed for a long time. However, international normalized
   ratio (INR) values were stable in most of patients treated with VKA at
   the switching to DOA. A more powerful study would confirm the factors
   associated with DOA prescription.}},

Abstract = {{Polarization switching (PS) in 1550-nm VCSELs under single and double

   Speed operation enhancement is observed for ``reverse{''} PS under
   double polarized optical injection. Also, the minimum injection power
   requirements for both ``normal{''} and ``reverse{''} PS have been
   analyzed showing significant differences for the two investigated cases.
   Furthermore, we have also investigated numerically the influence of
   important system parameters, such as the normalized bias current, the
   injection field strength, and the linewidth enhancement factor in the
   optimal operation conditions for both types of PS. Overall good
   agreement between theory and experiments is found.}},

Volume = {{782}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We present new experiments to measure the rate of entrainment of ambient
   fluid into a high Reynolds number, axisymmetric, turbulent gravity
   current. The current is produced by the rapid release of a finite volume
   of aqueous salt solution from a lock of length r(0) into a diverging
   channel, r > 0, of angle 9.5 degrees, filled with a finite depth, H, of
   fresh water. Using light attenuation we measure the evolving density of
   the flow, and using dye studies we illustrate the process of mixing
   between the current and ambient fluid. After an initial adjustment, a
   circulation develops in the head of the flow: current fluid reaches the
   nose of the flow, rises up and moves backwards relative to the nose. We
   find that, owing to the mixing, the volume of the current increases as V
   similar to 0.2r(n)(7/4)r(0)(1/4)H while the maximum depth of the head
   decreases as h(n) similar to 0.5H(r(0)/r(n))(1/4), where r(n) is the
   location of the front of the current. Combining these results, we
   estimate that the recirculating current fluid mixes with a fraction E =
   0.33 +/- 0.09 of the ambient fluid that is directly ahead of the current
   and displaced upwards by it. Some of the mixed fluid supplies the tail
   of the flow, while the remainder recirculates into the head, which
   becomes progressively more dilute. In accord with Huppert \& Simpson (J.
   Fluid Mech., vol. 99, 1980, pp. 785-799), we find that the position of
   the front increases with time as r(n) approximate to (1.28 +/-
   0.05)B(1/4)t(1/2), where B is the total buoyancy of the flow. We also
   find that the maximum value of the vertical integral of the buoyancy
   (0), decreases with the position of the nose according to the relation
   ((g') over barh)(n) approximate to (0.89 +/- 0.12)Br-n(-2), consistent
   with a Froude number 0.86 +/- 0.07. We compare our measurements with a
   new idealised self-similar solution of the depth-averaged equations that
   accounts for the mixing at the nose, the vertical shear in the velocity
   and the lateral stratification of the buoyancy within the current.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: This study aimed to assess whether prospectively screening
   parents for psychological vulnerability would enable beneficial
   targeting of a subsequent follow-up clinic.
   Design and Setting: Parents of children consecutively admitted to a PICU
   were assessed for risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder at
   discharge using the Posttraumatic Adjustment Scale.
   Interventions: High-risk parents were then randomized to the
   intervention (follow-up clinic, 2 mo after discharge) or control
   condition.
   Measurements and Main Results: All parents completed Impact of Event
   Scale-Revised and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at 6 months. Of
   the 209 parents of 145 children recruited to the study, 78 (37\%) were
   identified, on the basis of their Posttraumatic Adjustment Scale score
   at baseline, as being at risk of developing posttraumatic stress
   disorder, and randomized to the control or intervention condition.
   Follow-up data were provided by 157 of 209 parents (75\%). Logistic
   regression analyses controlling for parent gender and child length of
   stay showed that high-risk control parents (n = 32) were significantly
   more likely to score above the clinical cutoff for all three
   psychological outcomes than parents deemed low risk at baseline (n = 89)
   (posttraumatic stress: odds ratio = 3.39; 95\% CI, 1.28-8.92; p = 0.014;
   anxiety: odds ratio = 6.34; 95\% CI, 2.55-15.76; p < 0.001; depression:
   odds ratio = 4.13; 95\% CI, 1.47-11.61; p = 0.007). Only 14 of 38 (37\%)
   high-risk intervention parents attended the follow-up clinic appointment
   they were offered. At follow-up, there were no statistically significant
   differences between the intervention and control groups, but there were
   small effect sizes in favor of the intervention for anxiety scores
   (Cohen d = 0.209) and depression scores (Cohen d = 0.254)
   Conclusions: Screening parents for psychological vulnerability using
   measures such as the Posttraumatic Adjustment Scale may enable more
   efficient targeting of support. However, further research is needed on
   how best to provide effective follow-up intervention for families.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity prevalence is increasing. The management of this condition
   requires a detailed analysis of the global risk factors in order to

   Self-reported dietary and anthropometrical data from the Spanish
   participants in the Food4Me study, were used in a multidimensional
   exploratory analysis to define specific dietary profiles. Two opposing
   factors were obtained according to food groups' intake: Factor 1
   characterised by a more frequent consumption of traditionally considered
   unhealthy foods; and Factor 2, where the consumption of Mediterranean
   diet foods was prevalent. Factor 1 showed a direct relationship with BMI
   ( = 0.226; r(2) = 0.259; p < 0.001), while the association with Factor 2
   was inverse ( = -0.037; r(2) = 0.230; p = 0.348). A total of four
   categories were defined (Prudent, Healthy, Western, and Compensatory)
   through classification of the sample in higher or lower adherence to
   each factor and combining the possibilities. Western and Compensatory
   dietary patterns, which were characterized by high-density foods
   consumption, showed positive associations with overweight prevalence.
   Further analysis showed that prevention of overweight must focus on
   limiting the intake of known deleterious foods rather than exclusively
   enhance healthy products.}},

   muds ``maturation{''}}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CLAY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Therapeutic muds are used in the treatment of illnesses of the locomotor
   apparatus, including osteoarthritis and rheumatologic diseases. The
   mechanisms of action of this therapy are a matter of discussion, mainly
   for the different traditions of pelotherapy centers. Heat plays a
   fundamental role in the beneficial effects of thermal mud therapy
   together with the possible transfer across the skin barrier of chemical
   elements presented in the mud. Preparation procedures of therapeutic
   muds have been orally transmitted since ancient times, being accepted
   that muds require a ``maturation{''} process to achieve the desired
   therapeutic results. Pharmaceutical research of maturation is crucial to
   ascertain the possible changes induced by this operation in the
   properties of muds. In particular, it is necessary to verify the changes
   associated with physical and/or chemical therapeutic mechanisms that
   sustain the traditional use of maturation in the preparation of
   therapeutic muds. Two clay samples were used to prepare thermal muds
   with mineral medicinal water from the thermal spring of Graena (Cortes y
   Graena, Granada, Spain). Muds were matured for three months and
   characterized over time for those properties considered relevant in view
   of their topical administration (rheological properties and particle
   size distribution) and possible mechanisms of action (composition, pH,
   cation exchange capacity, thermal properties and amount of cations
   released). Maturation of the studied therapeutic muds did not induce
   alteration of clay minerals, even if a decrease in amplitude of particle
   size distribution, changes in pH and disappearance of thixotropic
   behavior were observed. Maturation increased the release of cations from
   therapeutic muds but did not improve their thermal properties. In the
   studied case, thermophysical activity did not require maturation.
   Conversely, maturation increased the amount of cations released from the
   muds, appearing as a beneficial process for possible chemical
   therapeutic effects associated with the ionic content of these systems.
   Maturation could therefore explain the differential chemical effects
   associated with the use of therapeutic muds compared to other
   thermotherapeutic agents. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dihydroxyacetone (DHA) kinase from Citrobacter freundii provides an easy
   entry for the preparation of DHA phosphate; a very important C3 building
   block in nature. To modify the phosphoryl donor specificity of this
   enzyme from ATP to inorganic polyphosphate (poly-P); a directed
   evolution program has been initiated. In the first cycle of evolution,
   the native enzyme was subjected to one round of error-prone PCR (EP-PCR)
   followed directly (without selection) by a round of DNA shuffling.
   Although the wild-type DHAK did not show activity with poly-P, after
   screening, sixteen mutant clones showed an activity with poly-phosphate
   as phosphoryl donor statistically significant. The most active mutant
   presented a single mutation (Glu526Lys) located in a flexible loop near
   of the active center. Interestingly, our theoretical studies, based on
   molecular dynamics simulations and hybrid Quantum Mechanics/Molecular
   Mechanics (QM/MM) optimizations, suggest that this mutation has an
   effect on the binding of the poly-P favoring a more adequate position in
   the active center for the reaction to take place.}},

Abstract = {{The PDS1000-He biolistic gun was used to bombard plasmid DNA harbouring
   gus and nptII genes into tender young leaves of in vitro grown shoots of
   Camellia sinensis (tea). Out of a total of 500 bombarded leaves, 217
   (43.4 \%) showed callusing after 5 weeks on selection medium containing
   1.71 A mu M kanamycin. Only 15 of these regenerated into indirect shoot
   buds. Only 7 out of 15 putative transformants showed the expected 400 bp
   signal with gus gene specific primers during PCR analysis. On the other
   hand, all the 15 putative transformants tested positive with nptII gene
   specific primers. In Southern hybridization with nptII specific gene
   probe, all the six randomly selected PCR positive plants showed stable
   integration of nptII gene. Both the transgenic and not-bombarded control
   plants showed phenotypic similarity under polyhouse conditions. Although
   their growth parameters were significantly at par, significantly lesser
   shoot height was recorded in transgenic plants. The reproductive
   behavior of the transgenics was also depressed. Thus, floral bud and
   flower abscission, fruit drop as well as empty seed production was
   higher in the transgenics as compared to control. Viability and
   germination of transgenic seeds was also significantly lower than
   control. Survival of the transgenic seedlings was also negligible (about
   3 \%). Hence, the chances of germ-line transmission of the transgenes
   were remarkably reduced in case of gus-transgenics. Tea being a
   vegetatively propagated plant, the method described in the present paper
   is an important approach for developing transgenics of elite tea plants
   from leaf explants.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To understand the competition between and among tobacco
   companies and health groups that led to graphical health warning labels
   (GHWL) on all tobacco products in India.
   Methods Analysis of internal tobacco industry documents in the Legacy
   Tobacco Document Library, documents obtained through India's Right to
   Information Act, and news reports.
   Results Implementation of GHWLs in India reflects a complex interplay
   between the government and the cigarette and bidi industries, who have
   shared as well as conflicting interests. Joint lobbying by
   national-level tobacco companies (that are foreign subsidiaries of
   multinationals) and local producers of other forms of tobacco blocked
   GHWLs for decades and delayed the implementation of effective GHWLs
   after they were mandated in 2007. Tobacco control activists used public
   interest lawsuits and the Right to Information Act to win government
   implementation of GHWLs on cigarette, bidi and smokeless tobacco packs
   in May 2009 and rotating GHWLs in December 2011.
   Conclusions GHWLs in India illustrate how the presence of bidis and
   cigarettes in the same market creates a complex regulatory environment.
   The government imposing tobacco control on multinational cigarette
   companies led to the enforcement of regulation on local forms of
   tobacco. As other developing countries with high rates of alternate
   forms of tobacco use establish and enforce GHWL laws, the tobacco
   control advocacy community can use pressure on the multinational
   cigarette industry as an indirect tool to force implementation of
   regulations on other forms of tobacco.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, fuel quality biodiesels produced from waste frying oil

   petroleum-based diesel fuel (PBDF) in a direct injection (DI) diesel
   engine running at 600 Nm and three different engine speeds (1100, 1400
   and 1700 rpm). The results showed that the brake specific fuel
   consumptions (BSFC) of ester fuels were higher than those of
   petrodiesel. The BSFC of ethyl ester biodiesel was slightly lower as
   compared with methyl ester biodiesel. The thermal efficiencies of the
   ester fuels were higher than those of PBDF. Ethyl ester biodiesel had
   slightly better thermal efficiency than methyl ester biodiesel. In
   comparison to PBDF, ester fuels emitted less CO and THC emissions but
   they caused to produce more NOx. CO2 emissions were very close to each
   other. In general, ethyl ester biodiesel released relatively less
   emissions than methyl ester biodiesel. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We aimed to characterize genotype-phenotype correlations and establish
   baseline clinical data for peripheral neuropathies caused by mutations
   in the myelin protein zero (MPZ) gene. MPZ mutations are the second
   leading cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1. Recent research
   makes clinical trials for patients with MPZ mutations a realistic
   possibility. However, the clinical severity varies with different
   mutations and natural history data on progression is sparse. We present
   cross-sectional data to begin to define the phenotypic spectrum and
   clinical baseline of patients with these mutations. A cohort of patients
   with MPZ gene mutations was identified in 13 centres of the Inherited
   Neuropathies Consortium - Rare Disease Clinical Research Consortium
   (INC-RDCRC) between 2009 and 2012 and at Wayne State University between
   1996 and 2009. Patient phenotypes were quantified by the
   Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease neuropathy score version 1 or 2 and the
   Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease paediatric scale outcome instruments.
   Genetic testing was performed in all patients and/or in first-or
   second-degree relatives to document mutation in MPZ gene indicating
   diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1B. There were 103
   patients from 71 families with 47 different MPZ mutations with a mean
   age of 40 years (range 3-84 years). Patients and mutations were
   separated into infantile, childhood and adult-onset groups. The
   infantile onset group had higher Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease neuropathy
   score version 1 or 2 and slower nerve conductions than the other groups,
   and severity increased with age. Twenty-three patients had no family
   history of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Sixty-one patients wore
   foot/ankle orthoses, 19 required walking assistance or support, and 10
   required wheelchairs. There was hearing loss in 21 and scoliosis in 17.
   Forty-two patients did not begin walking until after 15 months of age.
   Half of the infantile onset patients then required ambulation aids or
   wheelchairs for ambulation. Our results demonstrate that virtually all
   MPZ mutations are associated with specific phenotypes. Early onset
   (infantile and childhood) phenotypes likely represent developmentally
   impaired myelination, whereas the adult-onset phenotype reflects axonal
   degeneration without antecedent demyelination. Data from this cohort of
   patients will provide the baseline data necessary for clinical trials of
   patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease caused by MPZ gene mutations.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the contribution of flap thickness and ablation
   depth to the percentage of tissue altered (PTA) (flap thickness plus
   ablation depth divided by central corneal thickness) in determining the
   risk for ectasia after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).
   SETTING: University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Cleveland Clinic,
   Cleveland, Ohio, and Emory Vision at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia,
   USA.
   DESIGN: Retrospective comparative study.
   METHODS: The study included 1 group of eyes with bilateral normal
   preoperative topography that developed ectasia after LASIK (ectasia
   group) and 2 control groups of eyes that did not develop ectasia after
   LASIK, 1 with 40\% or more of tissue altered (high-PTA group) and 1 with
   flaps 120 mu m or thicker (thick-flap group).
   RESULTS: The 29 eyes (16 patients) in the ectasia group had thicker
   flaps (146 mu m) than the 24 eyes (20 patients) in the high-PTA group
   (118 mu m) and derived a higher portion of PTA from flap thickness. The
   ectasia group had a higher PTA (45\%) than the 100 eyes (50 patients) in
   the thick-flap group (34\%) and greater ablation depths (94 mu m versus
   43 mu m) and derived a higher portion of the PTA from ablation depth.
   CONCLUSIONS: Flap thickness had more impact than ablation depth;
   however, thicker flaps were insufficient to create ectasia unless
   coupled with greater ablation depths and thus a high PTA. This
   percentage was a more significant factor than the variables it
   comprised. (C) 2015 ASCRS and ESCRS}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{The Reef Ridge deposit is a typical supergene ``nonsulfide{''} zinc
   mineralization, located in the Yukon-Koyukuk region of west-central
   Alaska (USA). It is hosted in sedimentary rocks of the Farewell terrane,
   a continental fragment sandwiched between the Siberian and Laurentian
   cratons during the early Paleozoic. The mineralization occurs in
   Lower-Middle Devonian shallow-water dolomite of a Paleozoic carbonate
   platform succession belonging to the Nixon Fork tectonic unit. The
   mineralization consists of oxidized minerals associated with minor
   remaining sulfides (pyrite/ marcasite and sphalerite). In the oxidation
   zone, smithsonite is the predominant mineral, mixed with Fe(hydr)oxides
   (goethite and hematite).
   A complete petrographic and mineralogical study was performed. Samples
   were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma-mass
   spectrometry and emission spectrometry, energy dispersive scanning
   electron microscopy, and QEMSCAN (R)-(quantitative evaluation of
   minerals by scanning electron microscopy). The most abundant mineral in
   the nonsulfide ore is smithsonite. Similar to other nonsulfide Zn
   deposits worldwide, the first generation of smithsonite has replaced
   both primary sphalerite and the host carbonates. A second smithsonite
   generation precipitated as cement in vugs, cavities, and fractures.
   Minor-zinc amounts also occur in the Fe-(hydr)oxides-, and zinc traces
   have been identified in clay minerals.
   The carbon and oxygen isotope values of smithsonite at Reef Ridge vary
   from -0.7 to 2.1 parts per thousand relative to Vienna Peedee belemnite
   (VPDB) and 19.1 parts per thousand to 21.9 parts per thousand relative
   to Vienna-standard mean ocean water (VSMOW). The delta C-13 values are
   similar to those of the host rock, suggesting that the predominant
   carbon source for smithsonite was the host carbonates, with only a
   limited contribution from organic carbon. The oxygen isotope ratios of
   Reef Ridge smithsonite are more depleted in O-18 compared to supergene
   nonsulfides from other parts of the world formed under warm-humid,
   temperate, or semiarid climates. The oxygen isotope fractionation
   between water and smithsonite, which relates the delta O-18 value of the
   mineralizing solution, the formation temperature of smithsonite, and its
   delta O-18 composition, indicates that the delta O-18 composition of
   Reef Ridge smithsonite is related to very low formation temperatures
   (similar to 10 degrees C), and strong depletion in O-18 of the
   precipitating waters.
   The delta O-18 smithsonite composition, the strong O-18 depletion, and
   the relationship of the formation of the Reef Ridge nonsulfide deposit
   with the development of the Sleetmute upland surface (which started in
   the Late Tertiary and continues to the present) indicate that the
   formation of the Reef Ridge nonsulfide deposit is probably related to
   cold/humid weathering episodes during a period comprised between Late
   Tertiary and Holocene.
   The ``traditional{''} interpretation on the genesis of Zn nonsulfide
   deposits in warm-humid, temperate, or semiarid conditions should be
   questioned where other climate zones are indicated.}},

   Objective: to evaluate the accuracy of anthropometric indicators for the
   location of abdominal fat in determining visceral adiposity.
   Subjects/Methods: cross-sectional study conducted among patients
   attending outpatient, of both sexes, aged over 20 years. Evaluated:
   Waist Circumference (WC), Waist-Hip Ratio (WHIR), waist-to- stature
   ratio (CER), conicity index (CI); Sagittal Abdominal Diameter (DAS);
   Coronal Diameter (DC); Mass Index (BMI), percentage of body fat (\% BF);
   Visceral Adiposity (AV/AS) predicted by the formula, fasting glucose,
   total cholesterol (TC), Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), high density
   lipoprotein (HDL), Very Low Density lipoprotein (VLDL) and Triglycerides
   (TG).
   Results: 129 patients were included, mean age 51, 06 + 14.02 years and a
   higher prevalence of adults (72,9\%) and female (75,2\%). CC 102,9 (+
   10,82), CI 2,08 (+ 0,13), and the AV/AS 1,03 (+ 0,16), showed high
   values with statistical significance among men, p<0.001. The same
   occurred with the CT (212,41 + 46,4), HDL (50,15 + 13,24) and LDL
   (135,62 + 40,16) among women, p<0.05. The CC, RCE, DAS and DC showed an
   inverse and significant correlation with the AV/AS: r = -0,364; -0,457;
   -0,403; -0,296; -0,475; respectively, p<0.001. However, best explained
   the variance in visceral obesity were the DC (R-2 = 0.77), CQ (R-2 =

Abstract = {{Secondary crash (SC) occurrences are non-recurrent in nature and lead to
   significant increase in traffic delay and reduced safety. National,
   state, and local agencies are investing substantial amount of resources
   to identify and mitigate secondary crashes in order to reduce
   congestion, related fatalities, injuries, and property damages. Though a
   relatively small portion of all crashes are secondary, their
   identification along with the primary contributing factors is
   imperative. The objective of this study is to develop a procedure to
   identify SCs using a static and a dynamic approach in a large-scale
   multimodal transportation networks. The static approach is based on
   pre-specified spatiotemporal thresholds while the dynamic approach is
   based on shockwave principles. A Secondary Crash Identification
   Algorithm (SCIA) was developed to identify SCs on networks. SCIA was
   applied on freeways using both the static and the dynamic approach while
   only static approach was used for arterials due to lack of disaggregated
   traffic flow data and signal-timing information. SCIA was validated by
   comparison to observed data with acceptable results from the regression
   analysis. SCIA was applied in the State of Tennessee and results showed
   that the dynamic approach can identify SCs with better accuracy and

Title = {{Lupus anticoagulant acquired hypoprothrombinemia syndrome in childhood:
   two distinct patterns and review of the literature}},

Abstract = {{IntroductionLupus anticoagulant associated with acquired prothrombin
   deficiency also known as lupus anticoagulant hypoprothrombinemia
   syndrome' (LAHS) is an entity that is well described in adults and is
   usually associated with autoimmune conditions (LAHS-AI). However, in
   children, LAHS has unique features that are distinct from the adult
   type.
   AimsWe report two paediatric cases of LAHS, describe their distinct
   patterns and review the paediatric literature on LAHS.
   MethodsCase studies on two patients with LAHS were reviewed, details on
   their presentation, work up and management were extracted. A Medline
   search was conducted on LAHS in children between 1960 and 2014; Articles
   in languages other than English were excluded.
   ResultsThe case studies highlight the differences in the two patterns of
   childhood LAHS. Additionally the review of the literature reveals that
   there are 15 case reports and 5 case series that report 25 children with
   LAHS-AI, 9 case reports and 6 case series report 26 children of LAHS
   associated with viral infections (LAHS-VI). At presentation, all
   patients with LAHS-AI had positive laboratory tests for autoimmune
   diseases, most commonly for systemic lupus erythematosus while these
   tests were negative in LAHS-VI. All patients with LAHS-AI had a
   protracted course and needed prolonged treatment with immune-suppressive
   therapy while patients with LAHS-VI resolved spontaneously or needed
   short-term immune-modulating therapy.
   ConclusionIn childhood, two distinct patterns of LAHS are observed,
   either associated with infection or autoimmune disease. Initial
   diagnostic investigations are critical to differentiating these two
   patterns as the prognosis and outcome for each is distinct.}},

Title = {{The Process of Macroprudential Oversight in Europe}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL POLICY}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{389-407}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The 2007-2008 financial crisis has paved the way for the use of
   macroprudential policies in supervising the financial system as a whole.
   This article views macroprudential oversight in Europe as a process, a
   sequence of activities with the ultimate aim of safeguarding financial
   stability. To conceptualize a process in this context, we introduce the
   notion of a public collaborative process (PCP). PCPs involve multiple
   organizations with a common objective, where a number of dispersed
   organizations cooperate under various unstructured forms and take a
   collaborative approach to reaching the final goal. We argue that PCPs
   can and should essentially be managed using the tools and practices
   common for business processes. To this end, we conduct an assessment of
   process readiness for macroprudential oversight in Europe. Based upon
   interviews with key European policy makers and supervisors, we provide
   an analysis model to assess the maturity of five process enablers for
   macroprudential oversight. With the results of our analysis, we give
   clear recommendations on the areas that need further attention when
   macroprudential oversight is being developed, in addition to providing a
   general purpose framework for monitoring the impact of improvement
   efforts.}},

Pages = {{37-42}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Muscle and bone are two intimately connected tissues. A coordinated
   interplay between these tissues at mechanical levels is required for
   their development, function and ageing. Evidence is emerging that
   several genes and molecular pathways exert a pleiotropic effect on both
   muscle and bone. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are secreted signal
   factors belonging to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta)
   superfamily. BMPs have an essential role during bone and cartilage
   formation and maintenance. Recently, we and others have demonstrated
   that the BMP pathway also has a role in controlling adult skeletal
   muscle mass. Thus, BMPs become crucial regulators of both bone and
   muscle formation and homeostasis. In this review we will discuss the
   signalling downstream BMP and its role in muscle-bone interaction. This
   article is part of a Special Issue entitled ``Muscle Bone
   Interactions{''}. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The rotational dynamics of a satellite moving over a circular orbit
   under an effect of gravitational and aerodynamic torques is
   investigated. A method is proposed for determining all equilibrium
   positions (equilibrium orientations) of a satellite in an orbital
   coordinate system with given values of an aerodynamic torque vector and
   principal central moments of inertia; the conditions of their existence
   are obtained, depending on four dimensionless parameters of the problem.
   Bifurcation values of parameters are found for which the number of
   equilibrium orientations changes. The numerical analysis of the
   evolution of regions of existence of various numbers of equilibrium
   orientations in the space of dimensionless parameters is carried out.
   The relationship between the obtained regions of existence and the
   regions of existence of equilibrium orientations of an axisymmetric
   satellite is considered. It is shown that the number of equilibrium
   positions of a satellite does not exceed 24 and cannot be less than 8,
   in the general case.}},
