   be transferred from prison to hospital under section 48 of the Mental
   Health Act 1983. During the last decade there has been a dramatic

Abstract = {{The study of the evolution of pH, EC, and macronutrients N, P, K, Ca, Mg

   paper. We have employed bell pepper (Cv. Orlando Fl)on perlite as
   substrate. It is carried out the comparative study between the nutritive
   and drainage (totals and suction probes) solutions during the
   cultivation cycle, Decreasing of pH in the nutritive solution is mainly
   a consequence of the HNO3 apportations and to the acid character of some
   apported ions of the same (H2PO4-, Mg2+ y NH4+). The EC reaches the
   higest values in the final stage for the drainage solution as a result
   to the growing accumulation of ions (NO3-, Ca2+ and Mg2+) in the
   substrate. We found an excess in N and Ca apportations, in relations
   with the plant uptake, giving this high accumulations of these nutrients
   in the drainage solutions. Phosphorus and potassium are incorporated in
   equilibrated quantities, and the K/Ca relation, near 1 could be
   interpreted as a loss of part of the incorporated Ca for its competition
   with K.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to study how chemical composition of the
   flours, physical properties of doughs? and the processing conditions
   during baking were related to variability in the bread loaf
   characteristics using partial least squares regression analyses. Sifted
   flours From eight wheats were characterised and physical properties of
   doughs were measured. Bread loaves were baked using a small-scale,
   hearth loaf baking procedure with variable mixing and fermentation
   conditions. The chemical composition of flour samples and the physical
   properties of the doughs contributed more to the explanation of the
   variability in the bread loaf properties than did the baking process.
   The HMW-GS and the protein content explained much of the variation along
   the first two PLS-factors. Dough resistance to extension and Mixogram
   peak height correlated strongly with loaf height and the height/width
   along the first PLS-factor, whereas the dough extensibility correlated
   negatively. The total flour lipid content and some of the fatty acids of
   the total lipid fraction also varied along the first PLS-factor. The
   fibre components of the flours and the composition of the NSP fraction
   were mostly expressed along PLS-factor 2 and the subsequent PLS-factors,

   amplification of adding angiotensin II receptor blockade in resistant

Abstract = {{Objective: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have
   beneficial effects on arterial compliance and distensibility and
   favourably modify the arterial pressure waveform in hypertensive
   patients, The objective of our study was to explore the possible effects
   of adding an ATII AT(1) receptor antagonist to an ACE inhibitor on
   augmentation pressure, a measure of arterial stiffness, and pulse
   pressure amplification in patients with poorly controlled essential
   hypertension,
   Design and methods: We studied a group of 18 patients with poorly
   controlled hypertension, despite at least three antihypertensive drugs
   including an ACE inhibitor, before, at 2 h and 2 weeks following the
   administration of 80 mg of valsartan, an ATII AT(1) receptor antagonist.
   Haemodynamic responses were measured by cuff sphygmomanometry, arterial
   pulse-wave analysis and the pulse pressure gradient was calculated as
   the difference between the brachial pulse pressure (cuff
   sphygmomanometry) and derived aortic pulse pressure (arterial pulse wave
   analysis),
   Results: Blood pressure decreased significantly (P < 0.001) and the
   effect was more pronounced on central (aortic) pulse pressure than
   peripheral (brachial) pulse pressure. The pulse pressure amplification
   increased significantly (from 8 +/- 3 at baseline vs 12 +/- 7 at 2 h to
   14 +/- 5 mm Hg at 2 weeks, P < 0.01) and the augmentation pressure
   decreased from a baseline value of 21 +/- 8 to 11 +/- 7 at 2 h and 10
   +/- 5 at 2 weeks, (P < 0.01) following valsartan.
   Conclusion: The results of our study show that in a group of poorly
   controlled hypertensives, combining an ATII AT(1) receptor blocker to an
   ACE inhibitor induced a significant fall in blood pressure, The decrease
   in blood pressure was accompanied by a decrease in augmentation pressure
   in the ascending aorta with a greater decrease in the central pulse
   pressure than in the peripheral, favourably increasing pulse pressure
   amplification between central and peripheral arteries. This effect on
   arterial stiffness and amplification suggests that combined angiotensin
   II blockade by adding an AT(1) receptor blocker to an ACE inhibitor may
   have more beneficial effects on the blood pressure curve than simple
   blood pressure reduction.}},

   operations, he continued to experience severe pain and disability. In
   order to facilitate pain-free active and passive physiotherapy, we
   performed an axillary brachial plexus block. After insertion of a
   brachial plexus catheter via the axilla, analgesia was continued for a
   period of one week using a 3 ml.hr(-1) background infusion of
   ropivacaine 0.2\% with the facility for additional patient-controlled I
   mi boluses, Both active and passive physiotherapy was carried out daily
   for the entire week.
   Conclusion: This technique was successful with no major complications

Abstract = {{Magnetic anisotropy was induced in amorphous Fe80B20 and Co75Si15B10
   thin films by growing them on bowed substrates. On releasing the
   substrates from the substrate holders, a tensile stress was developed
   within the samples which induced a magnetoelastic anisotropy and
   modified the domain structure. As a result of it, a magnetic easy axis
   parallel to the direction of the stress was developed in positive
   magnetostrictive FeB sample whereas in negative magnetostrictive CoSiB
   sample the induced easy axis was perpendicular to the direction of
   developed stress. To produce magnetic multilayers with crossed
   anisotropy, FeB/CoSiB bilayers and FeB/Cu/CoSiB trilayers were grown on
   bowed substrates. The magnetic layers in FeB/CoSiB were found to be
   coupled which was reduced by depositing a Cu layer between them in
   FeB/Cu/CoSiB trilayer.}},

Abstract = {{Statement of the problem. Objective long-term clinical data are
   necessary to assess the performance of modern posterior composites as
   direct rind indirect restorations.
   Purpose. This prospective, long-term clinical trial evaluated direct and
   indirect composite restorations For clinical acceptability as posterior
   restoratives in single or multisurface cavities and provided a survey on
   the 3-year results.
   Material and methods. Under the supervision of an experienced dentist, 9
   dental students placed 88 composite restorations (Tetric, blend-a-lux,
   Pertac-Hybrid Unifil), 43 direct composite restorations, and 45 indirect
   inlays. Clinical evaluation was performed at baseline and in yearly
   intervals after placement by 2 other experienced dentists, using
   modified USPHS criteria. A third Follow-up of 60 restorations took place
   within 33 to 36 months after placement.
   Results. A total of 93\% of indirect and 87\% of direct restorations
   were assessed to be clinically excellent or acceptable. During the third
   year, 1 direct restoration in a molar failed because of margin opening.
   Indirect inlays exhibited a significantly better anatomic form of the
   surface than direct composite restorations. Premolars revealed a
   significantly better marginal integrity and anatomic form of the surface
   than molars. Restorations in molars exhibited a significantly higher
   failure rate compared with premolars.
   Conclusion. Posterior composite restorations provided a satisfactory
   clinical performance: over a 3-year period, even if placed hy relatively
   inexperienced but supervised students.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the role of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor

   we infected G-CSF knock out (G-CSF-/-) mice with Mycobacterium avium.
   Infection was not exacerbated in G-CSF-/- mice despite a deficiency in
   the total bone marrow cells, colony-forming haemopoietic cells,
   granulocytes and monocyte precursors in the bone marrow. Peritoneal
   cells from G-CSF-/- produced less nitric oxide (NO) upon culture in
   vitro with antigen than did wild-type (WT) cells. Unexpectedly, T cells
   from infected G-CSF-/- mice were able to produce significantly more
   interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) than the wild type (WT) controls. T cells
   from G-CSF-/- mice still produced more IFN-gamma even when in vitro NO
   production was inhibited, while enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT)
   assays showed more IFN-gamma-producing cells in the G-CSF-/- mice. This
   was confirmed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICCS), which showed
   that there were more IFN-gamma producing T cells in vivo in the G-CSF-/-
   than the WT controls following M. avium infection. It is possible that a
   deficit of NO in vivo allows T cells to develop a higher
   IFN-gamma-producing phenotype. Thus we show a novel relationship between
   G-CSF and IFN-gamma production by T cells revealed in this chronic
   bacterial infection model.}},

   Description of the coating formation is based on the evolution of

   electrolyte. The characterisation of hydroxyapatite films is of special
   importance since the bioactive properties related to HAP have been
   directly identified with its specific composition (Ca/P ratio) and
   crystalline structure. This characterisation has been traditionally
   fulfilled by the use of XRD, FTIR and SEM. Results of a further
   characterisation of the coatings by TEM and SFM, additional to the
   analysis by XRD, FTIR and SEM, are presented. Interpretation and
   comparison of our results with those obtained by other electrodeposition

Abstract = {{Elevated circulating levels of an endogenous ouabain (EO) have been
   associated with essential hypertension. To investigate
   structure-activity relationships relevant to blood pressure, we infused
   either ouabain, ouabagenin, digoxin or digitoxin at 30 mu g/kg/day in
   normal Sprague Dawley rats. After five weeks, the ouabain and ouabagenin
   infused rats were hypertensive, whereas blood pressures declined below
   their vehicle controls in rats infused with digoxin or digitoxin. In a
   second study, mean blood pressures were 118.5 +/- 1.7 mmHg in rats
   infused with ouabain (15 mu g/kg/day) on day 35 vs. 98,3 +/- 1.8 and
   100.3 +/- 1.1 mmHg in the digoxin (30 mu g/kg/day) and vehicle infused
   groups (both p < 0.005 vs. ouabain), respectively. Plasma and kidney
   levels of ouabain immunoreactivity were increased 4-8 fold in ouabain
   infused rats while blood pressure and plasma levels of ouabain returned
   to normal one week following discontinuation of the steroid infusion. In
   rats with ouabain-dependent hypertension, secondary infusions of digoxin
   or digitoxin (30 mu g/kg/day) normalized blood pressure even though
   circulating ouabain remained elevated. In digoxin infused rats, neither
   blood pressure nor kidney digoxin immunoreactivity was raised whereas
   plasma digoxin was increased, Collectively, the results show that the
   hemodynamic effects of these sodium pump inhibitors differ dramatically
   during prolonged administration and that tissue rather than circulating
   levels of these agents appear to better explain their effects on blood
   pressure. These studies suggest that sodium pump inhibition is not the
   exclusive mediator of the hemodynamic effects of these cardiac
   glycosides and demonstrate the presence of structure-specific mechanisms
   that regulate their tissue levels and effects on long-term blood

Abstract = {{Objective. Little is known about the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
   on cell-mediated immunity in patients with advanced cervical cancers.
   Patients and methods. We have studied 24 patients with advanced cervical
   cancer submitted to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT) using cia-platinum
   (100 mg/m(2)/cycle) and bleomycin (30 mg/cycle). The cell-mediated
   immunity parameters available before and after CT were NK cells,
   CD4(+)/CD28 and CD8(+)/CD28 T-lymphocyte numbers, PBMC cytotoxicity, and
   modification of this parameter with ``in vitro{''} addition of IL-12,
   Results. The number of NK cells was higher before CT (P < 0.008) in 13
   patients who presented a good clinical response to treatment, compared
   to 11 patients with a poor clinical response. In addition, PBMC
   cytotoxicity (P < 0.001), CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocyte values (P <
   0.0047), and CD8(+)/CD28(+) cells were also higher in the group with a
   good response compared with the group with a poor response. Addition of
   IL-12 to the medium increased the lytic capacity of PBMC after CT only
   in the group with a good clinical response (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions. NK cell numbers, CD8(+) T-cell levels, and CD8(+)/ CD28(+)
   cell levels can be used as prognostic factors before CT. Our results
   suggest that patients with a poor response have lower lytic activity per
   NK cell and are refractory to IL-12 stimulation, probably as a result of
   the reduced expression of IL-12 receptors or of an intracellular defect
   in the mechanism of transduction. These observations also provide
   support for human clinical trials of IL-12 and neoadjuvant CT in
   patients with cervical cancer. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional analytical solution describing forced harmonic
   vibrations of prestressed laminated plates is found for the case of a
   hinged support. The solution is based on the analytical separation of
   variables. It is assumed that the prestressed state is homogeneous,
   subcritical, linear, and momentless and that the vibration amplitudes
   are small. A solution based on a model with a polynomial approximation
   of the required displacement functions across the plate thickness is
   also considered. These functions are found on the front surfaces of the
   structure. This allows us to solve the problem both in the continuous
   and discrete structural approaches. In the continuous structural
   approach, the order of the resolving system of equations is independent
   of the number of layers. In the discrete structural approach, for rigid
   contact of layers with similar boundary conditions at the plate end
   face, an algorithm can be introduced which reduces significantly the
   number of operations required for realization of the model proposed. In
   the numerical examples presented, both rigid and sliding contacts of
   layers and various prestressed conditions are considered. Both
   approaches give results that agree well.}},

Abstract = {{We have calculated the nonlinear susceptibility for the optical
   second-harmonic generation (SHG) from a bundle of aligned single-walled
   carbon nanotubes (SWCNs) of the `zig-zag' type subjected to a constant
   electric field Eo, parallel to their axis. The breakdown of inversion
   symmetry caused by the electric field is accompanied by the occurrence
   of the parity-forbidden two-photon transitions between the valence- and
   conduction-band edges. As a result, the third-order
   nonlinear-susceptibiliry chi((3)) spectrum for SHG clearly demonstrates
   two peaks strongly distinguished on intensity: one is the two-photon
   resonance exactly at the pump photon energy (h) over bar omega equal to
   one half of the band gap Delta(g); the other - small peak - sits at (h)
   over bar omega = Delta(g), which corresponds to the one-photon interband
   transitions. It is found that the intensity of both peaks grows sharply
   with an increase of the SWCN radius. The susceptibility chi(3) relevant
   to the effect of nonlinear optical rectification in SWCNs has also been
   calculated. It is shown that near the fundamental absorption edge, the
   electric voltage appearing on the ends of SWCNs due to the optical
   rectification effect sharply changes its polarity. For a bundle of
   identical (25,0) SWCNs, 3 mu m in length and placed in an electric field
   E-0 similar to 10(4) V cm(-1), the optical rectification voltage is
   found to be about 0.35 mu V under excitation of the sample by a
   continuous laser with a radiation intensity of 30 mW cm(-2), which may
   be of practical importance for mid-IR signal processing. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{During the review of a rat carcinogenicity study, a spectrum of granular
   cell lesions was recognized in the distal female reproductive tract. To
   verify the diagnoses, cell populations of nine granular cell alterations
   of the cervix or vagina were characterized immunohistochemically and
   four were evaluated ultrastructurally. Immunoreactivity was demonstrated
   in 8/9 cases with S100 protein, 6/9 cases with neuron-specific enolase,
   and 7/9 cases with Leu-7. Granular cells were negative for smooth
   muscle-specific actin and calretinin. The immunohistochemical profile of
   these lesions was similar to that previously reported in other species,
   including humans. Ultrastructurally, as expected many lysosomal bodies
   were present in the cytoplasm of granular cells in all specimens
   evaluated. Based on the detailed evaluation of a series of lesions, we
   adopted the following diagnostic criteria and nomenclature for the
   granular cell changes of the female reproductive tract of rats. Granular
   cell aggregates were non-space-occupying lesions composed of clusters of
   typical granular cells. Benign granular cell tumors were space occupying
   lesions that typically contained prominent interstitial collagen and
   were either discrete masses or were difficult to discern from the
   surrounding tissues. Some benign tumors also contained foci of spindle
   cells with decreased granularity. Malignant tumors exhibited
   pleomorphism and an increased nucleus:cytoplasm ratio morphologically
   but had the same biologic behavior as the benign tumors. We applied
   these diagnostic criteria during the review of controls from 9
   carcinogenicity studies. Up to 23\% of control females in those
   carcinogenicity studies had granular cell lesions that could be
   classified into one of the three categories. Granular cell lesions
   appear to be common in the cervix/vagina of the Sprague-Dawley rat, and
   tumors may develop from granular cell aggregates.}},

   8 at.\%, were obtained by successively photodissolving thin (around 10
   nm) layers of silver. The optical constants (n, k) have been determined
   by a method based on the envelope curves of the optical transmission

   the Ag-photodoped chalcogenide films is analysed within the
   single-effective-oscillator approach. The optical-absorption data
   indicate that the absorption mechanism is non-direct transition. We
   found that the refractive index of the Ag-doped samples increases with
   the Ag content, whereas the optical band gap, E-g(opt), decreases from
   1.97+/-0.01 to 1.67+/-0.01 eV. These results are consistent with the

   whom increased age was associated with stricter decision criteria. Lower

   a more conservative bins. Controlling for the level of sensitivity did

   Wooly Llamas showed on average the smallest fibre diameter (23.7 mum vs
   26.1 mum in Huacayo Alpakas and 29.5 mum in Ccara-Sullo Llamas) and
   therefore the lowest prickle factor, i.e. the proportion of fibres > 30
   mum. The fibres of the Huacayo Alpacas had the lowest coefficient of
   variance and the smallest difference of the 5\% thickest fibres to the
   mean fibre diameter (Delta ?5\%). The Ccara-Sullo Llama fibres were
   highest in crimp. In all three genetic groups, fibres from withers had a
   smaller diameter than fibres from neck. With the Ccara-Sullo Llamas
   only, the coefficient of variation and Delta ?5\% were higher in fibres
   from withers than from neck, which indicates a higher proportion of
   coarse outer coat guard hair. Fibres of females of all genetic groups

   crimped. Animals not older than 3 years had significantly finer fibres
   than older ones (23 vs 30 mum), but variation remained constant. The

Abstract = {{A new turbulent mixing scheme, described in Part I of this paper, is
   tested in the climate and mesoscale configurations of the U.K. Met.
   Office's Unified Model (UM). In climate configuration, the scheme is
   implemented along with increased vertical resolution below 700 hPa (the
   same as that in the mesoscale model), in order to allow the different
   boundary layer types and processes to be identified and treated
   properly. In both configurations, the new boundary layer (PBL-N) mixing
   scheme produces some improvement over the current boundary layer (PBL-C)
   scheme. The PBL-N scheme is able to diagnose different boundary layer
   types that appear to be consistent with the observed conditions, and the
   boundary layer structure is improved in comparison with observations. In
   the climate model, the boundary layer and cloud structure in the
   semipermanent stratocumulus regions of the eastern subtropical oceans
   are noticeably improved with the PBL-N scheme. The deepening and
   decoupling of the boundary layer toward the trade cumulus regime is also
   simulated more realistically. However, the cloud amounts in the
   stratocumulus regions, which were underestimated with the PBL-C scheme,
   are reduced further when the PBL-N scheme is included. Tests of the
   PBL-N scheme in the UM single-column model and in a development version
   of the UM, where the dynamics, time stepping, and vertical grid are
   different from the standard version. both show that realistic
   stratocumulus cloud amounts can be achieved. Thus, it is thought that
   the performance of the PBL-N scheme in the standard UM may be bring
   Limited by other aspects of that model. In the mesoscale model,
   improvements in the simulation of a convective case are achieved with
   the PBL-N scheme through reductions in layer cloud amount, while the
   simulation of a stratocumulus case is improved through better
   representation of the cloud and boundary layer structure. Other
   mesoscale model case studies show that there is a consistent improvement
   in fog probabilities and forecasts of cloud-base height. The
   root-mean-square errors in screen-level temperature are also reduced
   slightly. The weak daytime bias in wind strength is improved greatly
   through a systematic increase In the IO-m wind speed in unstable
   conditions. As a result of these trials, the scheme has been implemented
   operationally in the mesoscale model.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of the singular field around the crack in functionally graded
   material (FGM) is analyzed parametrically using finite element method.
   The numerical simulations are carried out by varying the location of the
   crack in the graded region for different material gradients. Using
   linear material property variation in the gradient zone, the influence
   of material gradient and the crack position on the fracture parameters
   such as complex stress intensity factor (SIF) and energy release rate
   are studied. The crack opening displacement profiles of FGM are compared
   with the homogeneous and bimaterial counterparts. The analysis shows
   that the fracture parameters of FGM approach that of the bimaterial as
   the material gradient is increased, regardless of the position of the
   crack in the graded region. The extent of applicability of the
   homogenous crack tip fields around the crack in FGM is analyzed, and the
   results show that the size of the homogeneous field reduces with the
   increase in material gradient. Static fracture experiments are conducted
   on epoxy based FGM to determine complex SIF with electrical strain
   gages, using the homogeneous field equations to convert the strains to
   SIF. The measured SIF values compare favorably with the numerical
   results providing a limited experimental validation of the computations
   and the use of homogeneous field for FGM. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Research regarding the portrayals of minority groups on television has
   repeatedly indicated that these depictions emphasize negative and
   stereotypical images. The potential impact of such representations is of
   singular concern when the characterizations revolve around issues
   related to crime and violence. To assess the prevalence of this
   conceivably detrimental relationship, this study provides the findings
   from a systematic, content analysis of primetime television. A two-week
   sample of primetime television was constructed for the Fall 1997 season.
   Police officers and perpetrators appearing on all fictional programs
   were examined, with specific attention paid to the race of the character
   and the aggression involved in the interaction. Multinomial Logit
   regression analyses were performed to determine which variables
   significantly predicted televised police use of force. Police were
   significantly more likely to use excessive force when perpetrators were
   young racial minorities. Implications regarding the portrayals of
   minority groups on crime shows are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Early detection and prompt treatment of breast cancer are the main tools

   none of these are conclusive. The authors describe a 56-year-old woman
   who was suspected of having breast cancer on mammography. Tc-99m MIBI
   scintimammography showed a small mass with elevated radiotracer uptake
   located near the pectoral muscle of the patient's left breast. The
   possible tumor was confirmed with fine-needle aspiration biopsy, After
   the diagnosis was established, the patient did not allow any treatment.
   Eighteen months later, a second scintimammography was performed, showing
   a large mammary tumor with a high radiotracer uptake, a new small lesion
   located in the left upper quadrant, and axillary lymph node involvement.
   Chemotherapy treatment was instituted and after treatment, Tc-99m MIBI
   scintimammography was normal. This case report provides further evidence

   evolution of this region is studied to ascertain its role in flare
   production. Large changes were observed in magnetic field configuration
   due to the emergence of new magnetic flux regions (EFR). Most of the new
   emergence occured very close to the existing magnetic regions, which
   resulted in strong magnetic field gradients in this region. EFR driven
   reconnection of the field lines and subsequent flux cancellation might
   be the reason for the continuous occurrence of sub-flares and other
   related activities.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of the potassium (K+) channel opener pinacidil (Pin) on the
   coronary smooth muscle Ca2+-myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation
   pathway under hypothermic K+ cardioplegia were determined by use of an
   in vitro microvessel model. Rat coronary arterioles (100-260 mu m in
   diameter) were subjected to 60 min of simulated hypothermic (20 degrees
   C) K+ cardioplegic solutions (K+ = 25 mM). We first characterized the
   time course of changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, MLC
   phosphorylation, and diameter and observed that the K+
   cardioplegia-related vasoconstriction was associated with an activation
   of the Ca2+-MLC phosphorylation pathway. Supplementation with Pin
   effectively suppressed the Ca2+ accumulation and MLC phosphorylation in
   a dose-dependent manner and subsequently maintained a small decrease in
   vasomotor tone. The ATP-sensitive K+ (K-ATP)-channel blocker
   glibenclamide, but not the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor
   N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, significantly inhibited the
   effect of Pin. K+ cardioplegia augments the coronary Ca2+-MLC pathway
   and results in vasoconstriction. Pin effectively prevents the activation
   of this pathway and maintains adequate vasorelaxation during K+
   cardioplegia through a K-ATP-channel mechanism not coupled with the
   endothelium-derived NO signaling cascade.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanisms for coexistence among micro-organisms were studied by using a
   species-defined microcosm, consisting of the bacterium Escherichia coli,
   the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila and the alga Euglena gracilis. These
   organisms were chosen as representative of ecological functional groups
   i.e. decomposer, consumer and producer, respectively. Direct and
   indirect interactions among these organisms were evaluated by
   comparisons of their population dynamics in culture with different
   combinations of the three species. There was an E. coli cell density
   dependent predator-prey interaction between T. thermophila and E. coli
   which was only established when there were more than 10(6) cells ml(-1)
   of E. coli. Indirect interactions were evaluated from the cultivation of
   each organism in media containing metabolites of the others. Metabolites
   from each population strongly accelerated the growth of their own
   populations and those of the others except for the self-toxicity effect
   of E. coli metabolites. These observations suggested that not only the
   cell-cell contact of direct interactions, but also metabolite-mediated
   indirect interactions supported the maintenance of the populations of
   each micro-organism and their coexistence. In natural ecosystems, there
   are many interactions and it is difficult to evaluate all those
   regulating community dynamics. The gnotobiotic microcosm used in this
   study was shown to be suitable for examining the specific,
   species-species microbial interactions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the available information on the ecology and
   conservation status of invertebrates, other than butterflies, in British
   hedgerows. The main habitat factors of hedges that influence
   invertebrate diversity and abundance are identified and discussed:
   botanical composition, structural diversity and shelter. Landscape
   structure is also shown to be critical. Examination of current
   management issues reveals that responses of invertebrate communities to
   hedge cutting in particular are complex, with significant differences
   between taxa and time of year. Quality of the hedge-bottom vegetation,
   as affected by both direct management and adjacent land use, is also
   important for invertebrates. Overall there is a paucity of reliable data
   on this important element of hedgerow biota, and a need for both
   large-scale ecological surveys and further scientific studies. However,
   a number of opportunities for conservation exist, including augmenting
   botanical diversity, rotational cutting regimes and integrated
   field-edge management. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Debate exists as to whether IHPS can be treated in
   district general hospitals as effectively as in specialist paediatric
   surgical units.
   Aim: To review the surgical treatment of IHPS in babies admitted to a
   district general hospital under the care of two consultant general
   surgeons with a paediatric surgical interest.
   Patients and methods: The case notes of 66 babies operated on for IHPS
   over a 42 month period between April 1995 and September 1998 were
   retrospectively reviewed. Demographics, operative details, hospital
   stay, and overall complications were all documented.
   Results: Peri-operative complications occurred in 2 patients, both
   requiring omental patches for duodenal perforation. Nine patients had 1
   or 2 episodes of postoperative vomiting; 4 had either a wound or urinary
   tract infection; and 1 baby developed an incisional hernia. There was no
   mortality.
   Discussion: The complication rate seen in this series is comparable to
   that of specialist centres, and supports current guidelines suggesting
   that IHPS can be managed by general surgeons with a paediatric surgical
   interest in a district general hospital.}},

   rocket motor consisting of a single coaxial shear injector element and a
   cylindrical chamber with optical access has been used for flow
   visualizations and measurements. Cold-Row injection tests utilizing
   liquid nitrogen and gaseous helium at elevated pressures have been done
   for flowfield characterization by different diagnostic methods such as
   flash-light photography and high-speed cinematography using a
   shadowgraph setup. The injection visualizations and studies under
   cold-Row and combusting conditions revealed a remarkable difference
   between subcritical spray formation and evaporation and the
   supercritical injection and mixing process. The study shows that
   approaching supercritical chamber pressures injection can no longer be
   regarded as a spray formation but rather as a fluid/fluid mixing
   process. As the Row visualizations indicate, the effect of the coaxial
   atomizer gas is less effective as previously expected. The flame is
   attached to the LOX post and develops in the LOX post wake. The observed
   flame holding mechanism is discussed. An evaluation of the radiation
   spectrum of the flame inside the combustion chamber revealed that
   radiation in the visible range is mainly due to water vapor.}},

Abstract = {{Human placental isoferritin (PLF) is known to exert an immunosuppressive
   activity in vitro and is involved in the down-regulation of the maternal
   immune system during pregnancy. We have investigated the presence of PLF
   in the human embryo and early fetus and its secretion into amniotic
   fluid (AF) and fetal blood. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 25
   normal embryos end fetuses, at 7-22 weeks gestation, using the CM-HS
   monoclonal antibody (mAb), generated specifically against the human
   p43-PLF protein. The amount of p43 was measured in AF of 81 fetuses at
   11-22 weeks and in the blood of 19 fetuses at 15-22 weeks by means of an
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the same mAb. Positive p43-PLF
   immunostaining was found from 7 weeks gestation in proximal tubules of
   the primitive nephron and macrophages of the liver sinusoids, blood
   vessels and mesenchymal tissue. In the AF samples, p43-PLF was first
   detected at week 15 gestation and thereafter steadily increased with
   advancing gestation whereas in fetal blood, p43-PLF was below or just
   above the lower limit of the assay. The gap between the first appearance
   of 43-PLF in embryonic tissue and its secretion into the amniotic fluid
   is probably linked to maturation of the renal function. The detection of
   the p43-PLF immunomodulator protein in macrophages at a very early stage
   of embryonic development and its very low concentration in fetal blood
   suggests that its immunoregulatory role is limited to the feto-maternal
   interface.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate Mycobacterium vaccae immunotherapy in the treatment of
   human tuberculosis and to assess longer-term outcomes following
   treatment for tuberculosis patients, a double-blind placebo-controlled
   Phase-2 clinical trial was set up in the Mseleni and Manguzi health
   wards in north-eastern KwaZulu, South Africa. In 1991-93, 204 patients
   admitted with clinical tuberculosis to the 2 hospitals were allocated to
   receive single intradermal doses of 0(.)1 mt M. vaccae NCTC 11659 or
   0(.)1 mt tetanus toroid alongside standard 6-months chemotherapy with
   rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. The main outcome
   measures were sputum bacteriology culture conversion to negativity,
   clinical assessment, weight gain, erythrocyte sedimentation rare and
   chest radiography. Patients were followed-up after 4 years to determine
   their health status. M. vaccae cases gained weight more quickly during
   the first 8 weeks compared with `placebo' patients. Regression analysis
   found a synergistic relationship between BCG positive scar status and M.
   vaccae-induced weight gain. No further difference was found between
   treatment groups. The bacterial conversion rate to negativity at 2
   months was much lower than expected (44(.)8\% active, 38(.)8\% placebo).
   Mortality was considerably higher than expected after treatment (7(.)1\%
   each group) and after 4 years (25(.)8\% active, 21(.)0\% placebo; death
   from tuberculosis 14(.)5\% and 16(.)1\%, respectively). Immune
   sensitization to environmental mycobacteria may explain the geographical
   variability of M. vaccae efficacy, as occurs with BCG vaccination and
   occurred with Koch's tuberculins of the late 19th century. Multiple
   doses of M. vaccae may be more effective. Further work is required to
   link the ability of M. vaccae to modulate protective cytokine profiles
   to favourable outcome in clinical studies. The high mortality found in
   this study suggests urgent reviews of chemotherapy and monitoring of
   patients are necessary in KwaZulu.}},

Abstract = {{The authors tested the hypothesis of a close relationship between the
   intentional component of task-set switching ({''}advance
   reconfiguration;{''} R. D. Rogers \& S. Monsell, 1995) and long-term
   memory (LTM) retrieval. Consistent with this hypothesis, switch costs
   are reported to be larger when the switched-to task involves high
   retrieval demands (i.e., retrieval of episodic information) than when it
   involves low retrieval demands (i.e., retrieval of semantic
   information). In contrast, switch costs were not affected by a
   primary-task difficulty manipulation unrelated to intentional retrieval
   demands (Experiment 2). Also, the retrieval-demand effect on switch
   costs was eliminated when time for advanced preparation or task cues
   explicitly specifying the task rules were provided (Experiment 3).
   Overall, results were consistent with the hypothesis that the
   intentional switch-cost component reflects the time demands of
   retrieving appropriate task rules from LTM.}},

Abstract = {{In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), methotrexate (MTX) is probably the most
   frequently used disease-modifying antirheumatic drug. It is also
   prescribed for other rheumatic and non-rheumatic diseases, such as
   juvenile RA, psoriatic arthritis, polymyositis, polymyalgia rheumatica,
   Horton's arteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, etc. MTX has been
   reported to have negative effects on bone: the term ``MTX osteopathy{''}
   was first used to refer to a clinical syndrome characterized by stress
   fractures of the lower extremities, diffuse bone pain, and osteoporosis
   in children who had been placed on long-term maintenance therapy with
   low-dose MTX for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Sporadic reports of
   similar cases among patients taking low-dose MTX for rheumatic diseases,
   primarily RA, have appeared more recently. Furthermore, in vitro studies
   have suggested that MTX may exert toxic effects on osteoblasts.
   These findings have raised concern about the long-term effects of MTX on
   bone. However, densitometric studies in RA patients have so far failed
   to detect decreased bone mass inpatients on MTX treatment.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To examine, for the first time Bcl-2 expression in sequential
   (autogenous) oral mucosal biopsies taken from the same sites in a
   gender, risk-factor matched, Caucasoid sample, over a 21-year period,
   DESIGN: Retrospective immunocytochemical longitudinal study of archival
   serial biopsies.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computer records were used to identify biopsy
   specimens derived from 12 patients. These were divided into four groups:
   (I) Histologically innocuous lesions which remained histologically
   innocuous. (2) Dysplastic lesions which remained dysplastic, (3)
   Histologically innocuous lesions which later progressed to squamous cell
   carcinoma (SCC), (4) Dysplastic lesions which later progressed to SCC,
   This represented 65 biopsies in total. Bcl-2 expression was studied
   using mouse antihuman BCL-2 oncoprotein clone 124 (Dako, Denmark),
   RESULTS: Generally, there was a lack of Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in the
   epithelium, with one exception in dysplastic epithelium from a group (3)
   patient.
   CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that in our series, Bcl-2 is not
   expressed early in oral premalignant lesions and appears to contradict
   previous reports. Possible explanations for this disparity are
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{This essay is a textual analysis of Frederick Douglass' 1852 What to the
   Slave Is the Fourth Of July oration. Douglass' oration is analyzed in
   light of his change of opinion on the Constitution as a pro-slavery
   document. Situating the speech in the context of Douglass' change of
   opinion on the Constitution and his split with the Garrisonians provides
   a fuller appreciation of the speech as a defining rhetorical moment in
   Douglass' career and advances an historical understanding of the speech.
   The ``close reading{''} of the text considers Douglass' use of
   comparison via thesis and antithesis as the organizing principle of his
   speech and as the primary rhetorical strategy by which he adapted the
   epideictic occasion of the Fourth of July oration to the task of making
   ``the past useful{''} in ``behalf of emancipation{''} and advanced an
   interpretational consistency among the abolitionists cause, the
   Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution.}},

   Prostate cancer is a concern for many men because it often strikes in

   American men and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality
   after lung cancer. Although the disease can be cured if discovered
   early, it is a slow-growing malignancy that leads to an agonising death
   if left untreated. Differential diagnosis often is complicated by
   comorbid conditions that are part of the normal aging process. Moreover,
   practitioners' judgement often is prejudiced by common again
   misconceptions. Despite the benefits of early screening and detection,
   the benefits of screening initiatives remain controversial.}},

   unclear. What is also unclear is how the methods recommended in the
   guidelines are linked to the underlying efficiency or equity goal being
   targeted. If it is unclear what efficiency/equity objectives are being
   pursued, then it is unlikely that even full implementation of economic
   guidelines will improve resource allocation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Suramin has been shown to have efficacy in treatment of
   prostate cancer. In the present study we evaluated distribution of
   {[}C-14]suramin in tissues over time following a single intravenous
   dose. Methods: Male rats were given a single IV dose of 300 mg/kg
   {[}C-14]suramin and sacrificed at 1 or 6 hours, or at 1, 7, 14, 28, 56,
   or 84 days postdose. Radioactivity remaining in tissues was measured by
   quantitative whole body autoradiography. Results: At one hour highest
   tissue activity was found in blood vessel walls and caecum, followed by
   lung, blood, skin, preputial, thyroid, brown fat, heart, kidney, lymph
   nodes, liver, salivary, adrenal, Harder's and lacrimal glands, prostate,
   and spleen. Considerable activity was present in membranes surrounding
   muscle groups, bone and other organs. Relatively low activity was found
   in brain tissue although persistent concentration was evident in choroid
   plexus. High levels were present in bladder and caecum contents.
   Activity declined in blood but continued to increase in many tissues at
   later time points. Kidney reached maximum levels at 7 days postdose and
   retained concentration considerably higher than other tissues over the
   course of the study. Concentrations in tissues were persistent and
   considerable activity remained at 84 days postdose. Terminal elimination
   half life in tissues was prolonged, approximately 39 days in blood and
   91 and 102 days in kidney and spleen, respectively. Uptake in prostate
   was highest in membranous structures separating secretory lobules.
   Conclusion: Suramin is widely distributed to tissues and appears to have
   particular affinity for boundary membranes surrounding organs and other
   structural tissue elements, possibly due to uptake by
   glycosaminoglycans. Antitumor activity may be related to inhibition of
   growth factors associated with these elements. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Hypothesis: Simple admission criteria (white blood cell count, greater
   than or equal to 14.5 x 10(9)/L; blood urea nitrogen level, greater than
   or equal to 4.3 mmol/L {[}greater than or equal to 12 mg/dL]; heart
   rate, greater than or equal to 100 beats per minute; and serum glucose
   level, greater than or equal to 8.3 mmol/L {[}greater than or equal to
   150 mg/dL]) are better predictors of severe complications of gallstone
   pancreatitis than an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II
   (APACHE II) score of 5 or greater, a modified Imrie (Glasgow) score of 3
   or greater, and a biliary Ranson score of 3 or greater.
   Design:A prospective consecutive case study.
   Setting: A university-affiliated, urban, public hospital.
   Patients: Ninety-two consecutive patients (77 women and 15 men, aged 18
   to 76 years {[}mean age, 39 years]) with gallstone pancreatitis.
   Seventy-seven patients were Hispanic.
   Main Outcome Measures: Major local and systemic complications requiring
   intensive care unit care, and death.
   Results: Fourteen patients (15\%) had severe complications with a
   mortality of 2\%. On univariate analysis, a white blood cell count of
   14.5 x 10(9)/L or more (P=.03), a serum glucose level of 8.3 mmol/L or
   more (greater than or equal to 150 mg/dL) (P<.001), an APACHE II score
   of 5 or greater (P=.008), a modified Imrie score of 3 or greater
   (P<.001), and a biliary Ranson score of 3 or greater (P=.03) were
   statistically associated with the development of severe complications;
   whereas a blood urea nitrogen level of 4.3 mmol/L or more (greater than
   or equal to 12 mg/dL) and a heart rate of 100 beats per minute or more
   were not. On multivariate analysis, only a serum glucose level of 8.3
   mmol/L or more (greater than or equal to 150 mg/dL) was predictive of
   adverse events (P<.001).
   Conclusions: Glucose level(greater than or equal to 8.3 mmol/L
   {[}greater than or equal to 150 mg/dL]) is the best single admission
   predictor of severe complications of gallstone pancreatitis and is
   superior to an APACHE II score of 5 or greater, a modified Imrie score

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Overexpression and increased activities of matrix
   metalloproteinases (MMPs) have recently been reported in cultured
   conjunctival fibroblasts from patients with conjunctivochalasis. The
   role of inflammatory cytokines in modulating expression of MMPs, their
   tissue inhibitors (TIMPs), and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) as
   potential contributors to the pathogenesis of conjunctivochalasis was
   investigated.
   METHODS. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha
   (TNF-alpha) was added at 10 ng/ml to a serum-free medium. Expression of
   transcripts and proteins of MMPs. TIMPs, and uPA by cultured normal
   human conjunctival and conjunctivochalasis fibroblasts was determined by
   Northern hybridization, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and
   Western blot analysis, respectively. Gelatin and casein zymographies
   were performed in serum-free conditioned media with and without the
   respective enzyme inhibitors.
   RESULTS. Without challenging the cells, conjunctivochalasis fibroblasts
   showed mRNA and protein overexpression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 compared with
   normal conjunctival fibroblasts, which showed minor or no expression of
   these enzymes. IL-1 beta markedly and TNF-alpha to lesser extent
   increased mRNA and protein expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 in
   conjunctivochalasis fibroblasts from 2 subjects when compared with
   normal conjunctival fibroblasts from 2 subjects and with their
   nonstimulated counterparts. In conjunctivochalasis fibroblasts and
   normal conjunctival fibroblasts, TNF-alpha but not IL-1 beta, induced a
   gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9, which was further confirmed by Western
   blot analysis and ELISA. Expression of MMP-2, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 mRNA
   and protein was not influenced by IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha, and no
   difference was found in the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 between both
   cell types.
   CONCLUSIONS. Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha,
   which can potentially be derived from the ocular surface and tears, may
   be responsible for increased expression of MMPs in cultured
   conjunctivochalasis fibroblasts. Ocular inflammation might be one
   important denominator in the pathogenesis of conjunctivochalasis.}},

Abstract = {{Violacein, a pigment produced by Chromobacterium violaceum, is reported
   to be a potential drug for the treatment of Chagas' disease. Violacein
   is also effective against leukemia and lymphoma cells in culture (IC50

   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl) -2,5-biphenyl tetrazolium bromide
   reduction and neutral red uptake in these cells were used to evaluate
   the cytotoxicity of violacein in V79 Chinese hamster (M-8) fibroblasts.
   Violacein was highly cytotoxic to V79 fibroblasts (IC50 5-12 muM). Using
   the TUNEL method and the Feulgen reaction coupled to image analysis,
   violacein (5 and 10 muM) was found to trigger apoptosis but not necrosis
   in V79 cells. The morphological changes seen in the nuclei of these
   cells included chromatin condensation and a decrease in deoxyribonucleic
   acid content. These results demonstrating that violacein induces
   apoptosis in V79 cells strengthen its potential as a therapeutic agent.}},

Abstract = {{A simple methodology is presented to predict some groundwater
   parameters, major anions and cations. and total dissolved solids (TDS),
   from some others that can be easily determined, like pH and electrical
   conductivity (EC), within the area of the irrigation district (ID) 038,
   Rio Mayo. Sonora, Mexico. Multiple linear models were used to determine
   such relationships. The first step was to determine the frequency
   distribution of all parameters. it was found that EC, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+
   and TDS exhibited a log-normal distribution. These distributions were
   normalized through the logarithmic (base 10) transformation of the data,
   so classical regression statistics could be applied. The anions did not
   present well-defined frequency distributions, however they were also
   log-transformed All models expressed ail anions, cations, and TDS as a
   function of log-EC and pH. in ail cases, correlation coefficients were
   higher than 0.94, and all residual errors were lower than 0.06. As a
   final step, correlations between estimated and ground-truth data were
   assessed in order to verify the predictive capability of the regression
   models. These correlations were very low for all anions, Cl-, SO4- and
   HCO3- (R = 0.238. 0.284, 0.366 respectively), but resulted relatively
   higher for all cations (R > 0.960) and TDS (R = 0.999). It was concluded
   that the concentration of Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+ (meq/L), and TDS (mg/L) can
   be estimated from just EC (dS/m) and pH within acceptable confidence
   levels (R = 0.992, 0.990 0.988 and 0.999, respectively). The non-defined
   frequency distribution of the anions did not allow the regression
   analysis to be applied as a predictive tool.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Infants make up the most high-risk, difficult to care for
   subgroup undergoing kidney transplantation, with the lowest 1- and
   2-year graft survival rates of any other age group. The principal causes
   of graft loss have been graft thrombosis, primary nonfunction, technical
   error, and irreversible acute rejection.
   Hypothesis: Infants undergoing kidney transplantation can achieve near
   100\% graft survival at 2 years following surgery, despite their very
   high-risk status.
   Design: Analysis of 45 consecutive kidney transplants performed in
   patients weighing less than or equal to 15 kg during an 8-year period
   beginning August 1991. Patients included complex referrals from
   throughout the United States and all received transplants and were cared
   for by the same pediatric kidney transplantation team.
   Results: Mean weight at transplantation was 11.2 kg. Renal failure was
   due to congenital or urologic causes in the majority (53\%) of cases.
   Size-discrepant adult-sized kidney grafts were transplanted in 80\% of
   patients; 64\% received live-donor grafts; 78\% were receiving dialysis
   prior to transplantation; and 27\% had extremely small bladders (<20
   cm(3)) requiring modification of the ureteral implantation. Excluding 1
   transplant-unrelated death, graft and patient survival at 2 years was
   100\%. Eight-year patient and graft survival rates (for our combined
   live and cadaver donor series) were 89.6\% and 84.6\%, respectively.
   This compares favorably with much lower graft survival in low-risk adult
   recipients. Delayed graft function occurred in only 1 patient (2\%).
   Rate of incidence of rejection was 9.3\% within 2 years of
   transplantation and the overall rejection rate was 15.5\%. No graft was
   lost to vascular thrombosis, primary nonfunction,technical error, or
   acute rejection. The mean creatinine level was 53.04 mu mol/L (0.6
   mg/dL) and 61.9 mu mol/L (0.7 mg/dL) at 1 and 2 years, respectively, and
   88.4 mu mol/L (1.0 mg/dL) at 3, 4, and 5 years after transplantation.
   Conclusion: One hundred percent 2-year and excellent 8-year graft
   survival rates can be achieved in what has historically been the
   highest-risk and most difficult to care for patient subgroup undergoing
   kidney transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder
   associated with a (CTG), expansion in the 3'-untranslated region of the
   DM1 protein kinase (DMPK) gene. To explain disease pathogenesis, the RNA
   dominance model proposes that the DM1 mutation produces a
   gain-of-function at the RNA level in which CUG repeats form RNA hairpins
   that sequester nuclear factors required for proper muscle development
   and maintenance. Here, we identify the triplet repeat expansion (EXP)
   RNA-binding proteins as candidate sequestered factors. As predicted by
   the RNA dominance model, binding of the EXP proteins is specific for
   dsCUG RNAs and proportional to the size of the triplet repeat expansion.
   Remarkably, the EXP proteins are homologous to the Drosophila
   muscleblind proteins required for terminal differentiation of muscle and
   photoreceptor cells. EXP expression is also activated during mammalian
   myoblast differentiation, but the EXP proteins accumulate in nuclear
   foci in DMI cells. We propose that DM1 disease is caused by aberrant
   recruitment of the EXP proteins to the DMPK transcript (CUG)(n)
   expansion.}},

Abstract = {{Effective stiffness properties (D) of nanosized structural elements such
   as plates and beams differ from those predicted by standard continuum
   mechanics (D-c). These differences (D - D-c)/D-c depend on the size of
   the structural element. A simple model is constructed to predict this
   size dependence of the effective properties. The important length scale
   in the problem is identified to be the ratio of the surface elastic
   modulus to the elastic modulus of the bulk. In general, the
   non-dimensional difference in the elastic properties from continuum
   predictions (D - D-c)/D-c is found to scale as alpha S/Eh, where alpha
   is a constant which depends on the geometry of the structural element
   considered, S is a surface elastic constant, E is a bulk elastic modulus
   and h a length defining the size of the structural element. Thus, the
   quantity S/E is identified as a material length scale for elasticity of
   nanosized structures. The model is compared with direct atomistic
   simulations of nanoscale structures using the embedded atom method for
   FCC A1 and the Stillinger-Weber model of Si. Excellent agreement between
   the simulations and the model is found.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied the mechanical behavior of model NiAl-based eutectic
   composites to gain insight on micromechanisms of plasticity in
   multiphase intermetallics. We show that in composites where the NiAl
   matrix and the reinforcing ductile second phase can deform compatibly
   due to easy slip transfer across interfaces, high room temperature
   tensile ductility and fracture toughness are obtained. In composites
   where interfaces are strong barriers to slip transfer and the metallic
   second phase has high strength and limited ductility, incompatible
   deformation of the two phases results in negligible tensile ductility
   and limited toughness enhance ment. Factors that affect ease of slip
   transfer across interfaces are discussed. Calculations of dislocation
   pile-up stresses are used to predict whether slip is activated prior to
   cleavage or vice-versa for a given set of respective yield strengths and
   crystallographic orientation relationships between the two phases. (C)

Abstract = {{The effect of connectors on pipe buckling is acknowledged, but has
   received Little attention. Lubinski analyzed the effect of connectors on
   pipe in tension in a curved borehole, while Paslay and Cernocky extended
   this analysis to pipe in compression. These papers indicate that bending
   stresses are greater due to connector standoff. However, these papers do
   not consider a buckled pipe.
   This paper presents an analytic solution of the beam-column equations in
   three dimensions for a helically buckled pipe with connectors in a
   vertical well. For low axial compression, the solution approximates
   helically buckled pipe without connectors, however, at higher axial
   forces, the effects of connectors on contact forces and bending stress
   becomes significant. Sag between connectors is calculated so that pipe
   body contact between connectors can be determined.
   Applications include the analysis of bottomhole assemblies, drillpipe,
   casing, and tubing. The solutions are simple formulas that are suitable
   for hand calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Messenger RNA surveillance, the selective and rapid degradation of mRNAs
   containing premature stop codons, occurs in all eukaryotes tested. The
   biological role of this decay pathway, however, is not well understood.
   To identify natural substrates of mRNA surveillance, we used a
   cDNA-based representational difference analysis to identify mRNAs whose
   abundance increases in Caenorhabditis elegans smg(-) mutants, which are
   deficient for mRNA surveillance. Alternatively spliced mRNAs of genes
   encoding ribosomal proteins L3, L7a, L10a, and L12 are abundant natural
   targets of mRNA surveillance. Each of these genes expresses two distinct
   mRNAs. A productively spliced mRNA, whose abundance does not change in
   smg(-) mutants, encodes a normal, full-length, ribosomal protein. An
   unproductively spliced mRNA, whose abundance increases dramatically in
   smg(-) mutants, contains premature stop codons because of incomplete
   removal of an alternatively spliced intron. In transgenic animals
   expressing elevated quantities of RPL-12, a greater proportion of
   endogenous rpl-12 transcript is spliced unproductively. Thus, RPL-12
   appears to autoregulate its own splicing, with unproductively spliced
   mRNAs being degraded by mRNA surveillance. We demonstrate further that
   alternative splicing of rpl introns is conserved among widely diverged
   nematodes. Our results suggest that one important role of mRNA
   surveillance is to eliminate unproductive by-products of gene
   regulation.}},

Abstract = {{We have shown the localization and mobilization of modified green
   fluorescent proteins (GFPs) with various signals in different
   compartments in a vacuolar-sorting system of tobacco BY-2 cells. In
   contrast to the efficient secretion of GFP from the transformed cells
   expressing SP-GFP composed of a signal peptide and GFP, accumulation of
   GFP in the vacuoles was observed in the cells expressing SP-GFP fused
   with the C-terminal peptide of pumpkin 2S albumin. This indicated that
   this peptide is sufficient for vacuolar targeting, Interestingly, the
   fluorescence in the vacuoles disappeared sharply at 7 d after
   inoculation of the cells, but it appeared again after re-inoculation
   into a new culture medium. When SP-GFP was fused with the region, termed
   PV72C, including a transmembrane domain and a cytosolic tail of a
   vacuolar-sorting receptor PV72, GFP-PV72C was detected in the
   Golgi-complex-like small particles. Prolonged culture showed that
   GFP-PV72C that reached the prevacuolar compartments was cleaved off the
   PV72C region to produce GFP, that arrived at the vacuoles to be
   diffused. These findings suggested that the vacuolar-sorting receptor
   might be recycled between the Golgi complex and prevacuolar

Abstract = {{A polarimetric approach is presented to extract information of reflected
   waves that is masked by the transmitter-receiver directly coupled wave
   in a single-hole borehole radar measurement. Radar polarimetry theory is
   expanded to an omnidirectional radar system with electric and magnetic
   dipoles arranged on the same axis. First, we formulate the transfer
   functions directly coupled between the antennas for cross-hole and
   single-hole arrangements in copolarized channels. We found that the
   theoretical scattering matrices of the direct-wave coupling is identical
   to the scattering matrix from a dihedral corner reflector. Second, ve
   also consider signals in polarimetric channel of a wave reflected from a
   plane scatter in single-hole arrangements. As advanced reflection
   borehole radar measurement, we demonstrate a technique for both
   reduction of the directly coupled wave and enhancement of the reflected
   waves from a plane fracture with measured data in dipole-dipole and
   slot-slot antenna combinations, For quantitative determination of the
   scattering matrix, we use a technique to compensate the antenna transfer
   functions by the time derivative of the directly coupled signals in
   single-hole measurement. Also, we propose a technique to reduce the
   directly coupled component by adding vertical (VV) and horizontal (HH)
   signals and we showed that the directly coupled wave is effectively
   reduced and reflected waves are enhanced with experimental data.
   Finally, we show that this technique is more useful for near-range
   reflector detection than a conventional subtraction technique with
   moving average of the measured waveforms.}},

Abstract = {{A Rayleigh lidar (laser radar) system was developed and is now working
   well for temperature observations of the middle atmosphere at Poker Flat
   Research Range near Fairbanks, Alaska (65.1 N, 147.5 W). A comparison of

   altitudes. The atmospheric fluctuations are detected in the temperature
   profiles:obtained by the Rayleigh lidar and these are useful for: the
   study of gravity waves. A Rayleigh Doppler lidar for wind measurements
   of the middle atmosphere is under the phase of development. The expected
   accuracy in measurements of horizontal winds up to an altitude of 60 km
   is smaller than 6 m/s in 2 hours observation. The system will be
   operated at Poker Flat after the completion of development. The
   combination of these lidars and radars installed at Poker Flat, give us

Abstract = {{This study deals primarily with the morphology and ultrastructure of the
   pronephros in the green toad Bufo viridis during prometamorphosis when
   the pronephros and the developing mesonephros function simultaneously.
   Furthermore, the mesonephros was studied during pro- and
   postmetamorphosis with emphasis on the distal segments of the nephron.
   The paired kidneys consist of two cranial pronephroi immediately behind
   the gill region and two more caudal elongated mesonephroi. Each
   pronephros consists of a single convoluted tubule which opens into the
   coelom via three nephrostomes. This tubule is divided into three
   ciliated tubules, three proximal tubule branches, a common proximal
   tubule and a distal tubule, which in turn continues into the nephric
   duct. No intermediate segment is present. The length of the pronephric
   tubule is 12 mm, including the three branches of the ciliated tubules
   and proximal tubules. Primary urine is formed upon filtration from an
   external glomerulus, which is a convoluted capillary lined by podocytes,
   a specialization of the coelomic epithelium. From the coelom the
   filtrate is swept into the ciliated tubules. In the collecting duct
   system of the developing mesonephric nephron epithelial cells with
   conspicuous, apical osmiophilic granules appear in larvae of 9-10 mm.
   Heterocellularity of mixed intercalated (mitochondria rich) cells and
   principal cells is observed in the collecting duct system and nephric
   duct from a larval body length of 14 mm. As the proliferation of
   mitochondria-rich cells proceeds, the osmiophilic granules disappear and
   are completely absent from the adult amphibian mesonephros. (C) 2000

   the gene/genes responsible for the commonest form of migraine with and

   migraine loci: 5HT1D (1p36), 5HT1B (6q13), 5HT2A (13q14-q21), 5HT Trans

   Association studies were performed between migraine and polymorphic

Abstract = {{A polyurethane foam medium with characteristics described in Part I of
   this paper was tested in a toluene degrading biofilter to demonstrate
   its ability to support an active biofilm and to study feasibility of a

   biofilter was fed a model waste stream containing toluene for more than
   300 days using empty bed residence times ranging from 1 to 4 min and
   toluene concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 parts per million by
   volume. Results reported herein demonstrate that a polyurethane foam
   medium with high porosity, suitable pore size, low density, and an
   ability to sorb water was able to remove over 99\% of the influent
   toluene after implementation of a nutrient addition and biomass removal
   strategy. The strategy, made possible by use of the foam medium,
   overcame problems such as clogging, high head loss, moisture content
   control, and nutrient limitation that are often associated with
   conventional biofilter operation.}},

   were 54 min, s = 17.1 and 39 min, s = 37.6, respectively. A second
   blockade was successfully achieved in 2 dogs in which the catheter was

Abstract = {{A major goal of pain research at the present time is the identification
   of pain genes. Such genes have been informally defined in a number of
   ways, including the deletion or transcriptional inhibition of which
   produces alterations in behavioral responses on nociceptive assays;
   those the transcription of which is selective to pain-relevant anatomic
   loci (eg, small-diameter cells of the dorsal root ganglion); those the
   transcription of which is enhanced in animals experiencing tonic
   nociception or hypersensitivity states; and, finally, those existing in
   polymorphic forms relevant to interindividual variability. The purpose
   of this review is to compare the utility of various bottom-up and
   top-down approaches in defining, identifying, and studying pain genes.
   We will focus on 4 major techniques: transgenic knockouts, antisense
   knockdowns, gene expression assays (including DNA microarray-based
   expression profiling), and linkage mapping.}},

Abstract = {{The performance capabilities of pnp InGaAsN-based heterojunotion bipolar
   transistors (HBTs) for use in complementary NET technology have been
   theoretically addressed with a two-dimensional simulation program based
   on the drift-diffusion model. Simulation results closely reproduce the
   DC characteristics experimentally observed from the first demonstrated
   pnp AlGaAs/InGaAsN HBT with a current gain of Is and a turn-on voltage
   around 0.89 V. Numerous design approaches have been explored to maximize
   the transistor performances. As a result, a substantial improvement of
   the DC current gain (by a factor of 2-3) and high-frequency operation
   performances (with f(T) and f(MAX) values up to 10 GHz) can be easily
   achieved with the proper use of varying base thickness X-B and
   dopant-graded base. The effect of the quaternary band-gap value E-G is
   also addressed. Simulation results show that pup device with turn-on
   voltage similar to 0.7 V can be produced by lowering E-G to 1.0 cV,
   without any important degradation of DC and RF properties, because hole
   transport at the emitter/base side is not strongly affected. The
   replacement of the InGaAsN collector by GaAs is finally reported.
   Comparable DC and improved RF simulated performances are observed fr om
   this double HBT structure that takes advantages of the negligible
   valence band offset at the base/collector interface. These encouraging
   performances demonstrate the practicability of using InGaAsN-based HBTs
   for complementary low-power applications. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier

   measurements have been used in order to study the oxide films formed on

   duplex character of the films formed on 316L stainless steel and Alloy
   690. For these materials it is assumed that the capacitance and the
   photoelectrochemical results can be related to the semiconducting
   properties of mixed iron-nickel oxide and chromium oxide which represent
   the outer and the inner parts of the film, respectively. In the case of
   the Alloy 600 the presence of nickel oxide controls the semiconducting
   properties of the film formed at pH 10, but for the film formed at pH 8
   the presence of mixed iron-nickel oxide in the outer layer still
   controls those properties. Finally, it is demonstrated that the
   capacitance behaviour of the thin passive films formed at room
   temperatures could serve as a useful basis for interpreting the higher

   mass index (LVMI) greater than 131 g/m(2) in males and 100 g/m(2) in
   females. Progressive LVH was defined as a follow-up LVMI greater than
   105\% of the baseline value. Hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen,
   creatinine, cholesterol, albumin, prealbumin, parathyroid hormone, Kt/V,
   nPCR, fibrinogen, homocysteine and ACE gene polymorphism were also
   measured. Results: LVH was detected in 91 of 111 (82\%) ESRD patients
   starting maintenance hemodialysis. Of the 32 patients in whom follow-up
   echocardiography was performed, progressive LVH occurred in 19 patients
   (M:F = 12:7). Progressive LVH was associated with lower diastolic blood
   pressure (81 +/- 11 vs. 90 +/- 12 mm Hg, p = 0.036) and lower serum
   albumin (3.5 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.9 +/- 0.4 g/dl, p = 0.009). Serum albumin was
   negatively (r = -0.420, p = 0.017) correlated to Delta LVMI (follow-up
   LVMI minus baseline LVMI). Hypoalbuminemia was an independent risk
   factor for progressive LVH in multiple logistic regression analysis
   (R.R. = 1.29, p = 0.046). The association of progressive LVH with age,
   gender, diabetes mellitus, smoking history or other laboratory
   parameters was not significant. Conclusion: LVH was highly prevalent in
   the patients starting maintenance hemodialysis for ESRD. in the
   follow-up echocardiography, LVH progressed in a substantial portion of
   the patients, and hypoalbuminemia was a risk factor for progressive LVH.

Abstract = {{Two experiments (one with twelve heifers and the other with 14 goats)
   were designed to evaluate the effect of increasing dietary beta-carotene
   concentration on the activity of the cleaving enzyme 15,15'beta-carotene
   dioxygenase and the concentration of beta-carotene and retinol in
   selected tissues, The experiments lasted 120 days. During the first 90
   days animals were offered a beta-carotene unsupplemented diet. In the
   following 30 days, they were distributed to on of three treatments: 0,
   5.5 or 352 mg of beta-carotene/kg of dry matter intake. All animals were
   slaughtered at the end In heifers the concentration of beta-carotene in
   plasma, reflected the level of beta-carotene fed. Goats had detectable
   levels of beta-carotene only on day 10 of supplementation, In the liver,
   beta-carotene concentrations were highest with the 352 dose in both
   species. Heifers had the highest concentration of beta-carotene in the
   adipose tissue. In bovines, no interaction between beta-carotene
   treatment and intestinal sampling site was found (P > 0.2) for the
   activity of 15,15 dioxygenase. Across beta-carotene levels, results of
   the enzyme assay were: 0.19, 0.32 and 0.45 nmol retinal/(mg S-9

   Caprine data showed an interaction between beta-carotene treatment and
   intestinal sampling site (P < 0.05) for the activity of 15,15
   dioxygenase. The results for treatment 0 were: 1.4, 1.4 and 0: for

Abstract = {{Neuropathological evidence suggests that the two fibril lesions of
   neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and senile plaques are the major findings
   in brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that their occurrence is
   strongly associated with the symptoms of dementia. Genetic findings have
   indicated that the pathological molecules from the lesions function as
   causal agents. There is little evidence, however, to directly indicate
   that fibril lesions themselves kill neuronal cells in vivo. In spite of
   such limitations it is important to consider the molecular events
   involved in AD etiology. In this review of the contribution of Japanese
   neuropathologists to studies of AD, I will introduce briefly their work
   and highlight some current topics for consideration on the etiology of
   AD, and the basis of cell death, and will offer my perspective on

Abstract = {{The presence of high-affinity binding sites for antidiabetic
   sulfonylureas (SUs) and the expression of SU receptor (SUR) messenger
   RNA in the adenohypophyseal cells have recently been reported. In this
   study, we examined the effects of SU on POMC gene expression and ACTH
   secretion using the AtT20PL cell line, a subclone of AtT20 in which the
   rat POMC 5'-promoter-luciferase fusion gene was stably incorporated. A
   representative SU glibenclamide inhibited the basal POMC 5'-promoter
   activity. In contrast, glibenclamide enhanced forskolin- or CRH-induced
   POMC expression in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, the latter
   effect was not observed under treatment with
   3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor.
   Furthermore, diazoxide, an opener of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel, only
   antagonized the suppressive effect of glibenclamide. Lastly, RT-PCR
   analysis showed that mouse SUR (but not SURE) messenger RNA was
   expressed in this cell line. These results suggest that, in AtT20PL
   cells, SU has dual effects, i.e. a suppressive effect on basal POMC
   expression through diazoxide-sensitive (ATP-sensitive)
   K+-channel-mediated mechanism, and an enhancing effect on cAMP/protein
   kinase A-stimulated POMC expression through a different mechanism
   (probably mediated by phosphodiesterase). To our knowledge, this is the
   first report showing the effect of SU on the expression of the anterior
   pituitary hormone gene.}},

Abstract = {{Many international bodies and agencies such as the UNDP and the World

   Internet Pilot Project-a trial project funded under the Regional
   Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund (RTIF) to implement e-mail and
   Internet capabilities in four remote communities in the Northern

   proposal which aims to provide similar capabilities to 66 community
   government councils throughout the Northern Territory. The paper
   concludes that Internet and e-mail have an important future in remote

Abstract = {{Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization liquid chromatography/mass
   spectrometry was used in the identification of diacylglycerol and
   triarylglycerol (TAG) molecular species in a sample of a structured
   lipid. In the study of acyl glycerol standards, the most distinctive
   differences between the diacylglycerol and TAG molecules were found to
   be the molecular ion and the relative intensity of monoacylglycerol
   fragment ions. All saturated TAG ranging from tricaproin to tristearin,
   and unsaturated TAG including triolein, trilinolein, and trilinolenin,
   had ammonium adduct molecular ions {[}M + NH4](+). Protonated molecular
   ions were also produced for TAG containing unsaturated fatty acids and
   the intensity increased with increasing unsaturation. Diacylglycerol
   fragment ions were also formed for TAG. The ammonium adduct molecular
   ion was the base peak for TAG containing polyunsaturated fatty acids,
   whereas the diacylglycerol fragment ion was the base peak for TAG
   containing saturated and monounsaturated medium- and long-chain fatty
   acids; the relative intensities of the ammonium adduct molecular ions
   were between 14 and 58\%. The most abundant ion for diacylglycerols,
   however, was the molecular ion {[}M - 17](+), and the relative intensity
   of the monoacylglycerol fragment ion was also higher than that for TAG.
   These distinctive differences between the diacylglycerol and TAG spectra
   were utilized for rapid identification of the acylglycerols in the
   sample of a structured lipid.}},

Journal = {{HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Since the introduction of user fee systems in the government health
   facilities of most African countries, which shifted part of the burden
   of financing health care onto the community, affordability of basic
   health care has been a much discussed topic. It is sometimes assumed
   that in areas where high levels of spending for traditional treatments
   are common, people would be able to pay for basic health care at
   governmental facilities, but may not be willing to do so. However,
   examining willingness to pay and ability to pay in the broader context
   of different types of illness and their treatment leads us to a very
   different conclusion. in the course of a medical-ethnographic study in
   south-eastern Tanzania, we found evidence that people may indeed be
   willing, but may nevertheless not be able, to pay for biomedical health
   care - even when they can afford costly traditional medicine. In this
   article, we suggest that the ability to pay for traditional treatment
   can differ from ability to pay for hospital attendance for two main
   reasons. First, many healers - in contrast to the hospital - offer
   alternatives to cash payments, such as compensation in kind or in work,
   or payment on a credit basis. Secondly, and more importantly, the
   activation of social networks for financial help is different for the
   two sectors. For the poor in particular, ability to pay for health care
   depends a great deal on contributions from relatives, neighbours and
   friends. The treatment of the `personalistic' type of illness, which is
   carried out by a traditional healer, involves an extended kin-group, and
   there is high social pressure to comply with the requirements of the
   family elders, which may include providing financial support. In
   contrast, the costs for the treatment of `normal' illnesses at the
   hospital are usually covered by the patient him/herself, or a small
   circle of relatives and friends.}},

Title = {{The WTO and China's ban on foreign investment in telecommunication
   services: a game-theoretic analysis}},

Abstract = {{China's telecommunication services sector was closed to foreign direct
   investment (FDI) during the 1990s. The official ban on FDI persisted
   despite China's enormous demand for capital to build out its
   telecommunication infrastructure. It remained in place despite
   statements from Western analysts that it was not sustainable and
   repeated predictions that it was about to be relaxed. What created the
   ban, why did it stay in place so long, and why did China suddenly offer,
   in its World Trade Organization accession agreement with the United
   States, to change it significantly? This paper identifies the domestic
   policy bargains that supported the FDI restriction. A simple game theory
   model is used to analyze the way four players - (1) the Chinese slate,
   (2) the Ministry of Information Industry/China Telecom, (3) Telecom's
   domestic rivals, and (4) foreign strategic investors - interacted over
   access to foreign capital and technology. We contend that this
   analytical framework provides a much more solid understanding of the
   forces shaping Chinese telecommunications policy than simplistic
   extrapolations of Western notions of liberalization and privatization.
   The model is then used to assess whether China's willingness to open up
   to foreign strategic investment in the sector was driven primarily by
   its own domestic reform process, or by the external pressures generated
   by its desire to join the WTO. Our model predicts that China would not
   have opened up to foreign investment in telecommunication services
   without the need to bargain for WTO accession. It is our conclusion that
   the state's desire for WTO accession tipped the game's equilibrium
   sufficiently to alter the FDI ban. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Revitalization of distressed inner city communities is a critical matter

   printing/publishing, and (4) constructing a government office for a
   major agency of the city government. The study found that substantial,
   public/private investment activities in these areas could provide
   significant multiplier impacts, facilitating the revitalization process,
   with the printing/publishing scenario offering a somewhat higher local

Abstract = {{The base aluminium and zinc pigments corrode in aqueous alkaline media
   with the evolution of hydrogen whereas the more noble copper and brass
   pigments react with the absorption of oxygen. Both types of corrosion
   reactions can be examined gasvolumetrically. The corrosion reactions of
   all examined metal pigments can be inhibited more or less by addition of
   styrene-maleic acid-acrylate copolymers with different acrylate monomers
   (ethyl- n-butyl- and n-hexylacrylate as well as n-dodecyl- and
   n-octadecylmethacrylate). A surprising result is that the oxygen
   corrosion of the brass pigment is inhibited more effectively by the
   copolymers when compared to the copper pigment.
   With respect to the interaction of the metals with the copolymers there
   are two groups of metal pigments. The first group is aluminium pigment
   only; the corrosion inhibiting effect of the copolymers increases with
   increasing side chain length of the acrylate monomer. The second group
   consists of the base zinc pigment and the more noble copper pigment; the
   corrosion inhibiting effect of the copolymers decreases with increasing
   side chain length of the acrylate monomer. These connections between the
   chemical composition of the copolymers and their corrosion inhibiting
   effect can be correlated mathematically with the help of potential

   mycoinsecticide acts through direct contact and provides control equal
   to that of chemical insecticides in current use, although the
   speed-of-kill is slower. To test the dose-mortality response, doses
   ranging from 10(3)-10(8) conidia per insect were tested in the
   laboratory against fifth instar brown locust hoppers, Locustana
   pardalina (Walker). At the highest dose (10(8)), all insects died after
   3-4 days, while 100 \% mortality was achieved with the 10(7) and 10(6)
   dosage rates after five and six days, respectively. The 10(5) dose took
   6-10 days to achieve 100 \% mortality and a dose of 10(4) look 12-14
   days to achieve mortalities of 75-87 \%. The lowest dose rate (10(3))
   produced no significant mortality before 9-10 days after inoculation,
   with final mortality reaching only 60 \% after 21 days. This was a
   classic dose response. Locusts are pests because of: the crops and
   pastures that they consume and any reduction in food consumption is
   consequently of great value. All preliminary laboratory treatments
   caused a reduction in food consumption, even at a dose rate of 10(4)
   conidia per locust. These results may influence the future operational
   implementation of the mycoinsecticide in the field.}},

   X-ray diffraction confirmed that the main phase is NEG-123 and the unit
   cell size decreases monotonously with increasing Gd content in the
   NEG-123 matrix, supporting the presence of a complete Nd-Eu-Gd solid
   solution. The sample with x = 0.08 exhibited a large critical current
   density (J(c)) of 90 000 A cm(-2) at 77 K and 1.7 T for H parallel to
   c-axis. The scaling analyses of the volume pinning force showed that the
   peak position in the scaling curve was dependent on the Eu/Gd ratio,
   which indicates that the matrix composition mainly controls the Delta

Abstract = {{Previous studies have been largely unsuccessful in investigating Middle
   English quantity changes in terms of moraic or foot structure. The
   present study approaches quantity changes as the consequence of the
   phonologization of a syllable cut prosody (Trubetzkoy's (1939)
   `Silben-schnittkorrelation') and provides new evidence for the relevance
   of syllable cut to the diachronic phonology of English. The evidence is
   from the author's partial reconstruction of the phonological system of
   the early Middle English dialect represented in the Ormulum (Northeast
   Midlands, circa 1180), based solely on the orthographic and metrical
   evidence provided by its author, Orm. Although Orm's innovative
   orthographic system previously defied analysis, it is fully
   interpretable once the role of syllable cut is recognized. The analysis
   provides crucial support for the relevance of syllable cut to the
   diachronic phonology of English, and ultimately to the explanation of
   the pan-Germanic similarities in the `breakdown' of phonological
   quantity.{*}}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical framework is developed for calculating the nonlinear rf

   Instead, for modes satisfying the eikonal approximation, the flow drive
   can be expressed entirely in terms of moments of the linearized plasma
   responses. The method is applied to obtain explicit results for poloidal
   force generation for sheared flow drive applications in a hot plasma
   slab that supports rf waves of arbitrary polarization. The theory is
   fully electromagnetic and retains k(perpendicular to)rho(i)similar to 1
   (Bessel function) effects for the ion dynamics without approximation. An

Abstract = {{In this paper, we are interested in controlling the power dissipation
   within a homogeneous lossy cylinder of finite length when a field is
   applied to the surface of the cylinder. The fields are assumed to be
   independent of the azimuthal angle. To begin, a field which satisfies
   the required dissipation inside the cylinder is assumed on the axis of
   the lossy cylinder. An analytical evaluation of the continuous source on
   the surface of the cylinder can then be carried out. This is an inverse
   problem where the response is known and the source is to be determined.
   A realization of the continuous source (surface field) in terms of a
   discrete array is also given. Results will be presented that show an
   excellent agreement between the actual continuous sources and the
   discrete array in producing the field on the axis of the lossy cylinder.
   In fact, a small number of slots (fifteen or less) produce accurate
   agreement for the required field on the axis of the cylinder.
   Bioelectromagnetics and hyperthermia treatment of cancer in cylindrical
   objects such as limbs and torsos is one potential application.
   Nondestructive testing of manufactured cylindrical products is another
   one where the energy is focused in a given region in the cylinder.}},

Abstract = {{The car following models are extended to take into account the
   characteristics of different vehicles. The characteristic of each car
   can be included in the parameter of the dimensionless delay time. The
   traffic behavior is investigated, analytically and numerically, under
   the periodic boundary condition. At a low density, all the vehicles move
   at a constant velocity. When the density is larger than the critical
   value, the traffic flow becomes unstable and the density waves appear.
   The jamming transition does not depend only on the mean value of the
   dimensionless delay time but also on the variation. With increase in the
   variation of dimensionless delay time, the jamming transition occurs at
   a higher value of the mean value. It is found that the variation of
   vehicles stabilizes the traffic flow and suppresses the traffic jams.
   The transition line obtained by the linear stability analysis is

Abstract = {{The relationship between dispersal and differentiation of the European
   freshwater mussel Unio pictorum (Linnaeus, 1758) was studied with
   molecular genetic methods. Forty-two populations from France, Italy and
   central Europe were analysed. Genetic relationships were assessed from
   the geographical distribution of allele frequencies at 17 enzyme loci.
   Neighbouring groups of populations show small to moderate mean genetic
   distances (0.020 < D-mean < 0.263). With a few exceptions the genetic
   affinities of the populations are the closest within the same drainage
   basin. In central Europe and Northern Italy genetic differences between
   drainage systems are relatively large. Populations from north-eastern
   Italy are genetically similar to Danubian populations. Mussels from the
   islands of Corsica and Sardinia are more closely related to populations
   from the Italian peninsula than to French populations from the Rhone
   drainage system. Genetic relationships within U. pictorum from central
   Europe reflect palaeogeographical relationships between river systems
   during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. Literature data on two North
   American unionid species and one European fish species show the same
   relationship between genetic diversity and the history of drainage
   systems, although the correlations are less strong. In France and Italy
   this correspondence is much less evident. Population dynamic processes
   and human activities leading to populational bottlenecks might have
   obscured it.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{Head-and-neck irradiation in rats often results in reduction of water
   and food intake, weight loss, hyposalivation, and suppression of the
   white blood cell (WBC) count. Oxygen free radicals are believed to be
   involved in this deleterious process. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is
   known to act as a first line of antioxidant defence against oxygen free
   radicals. Here, the protective effect of manganese SOD (MnSOD) and
   copper/zinc SOD (Cu/ZnSOD) against irradiation-induced injuries to the
   head and neck in rats was investigated. Wistar rats were irradiated with
   15 Gy X-rays delivered to the head-and-neck region. MnSOD (50 mg/kg) or
   Cu/ZnSOD (100 mg/kg) were administered before and after irradiation.
   Body weight, food and water intake, WBC counts, and parotid and
   submandibular salivary functions were examined. Irradiation of 15 Gy
   resulted in a significant reduction of the parotid flow rate by 73\%
   compared with non-irradiated controls (p < 0.05). MnSOD but not Cu/ZnSOD
   partially reduced this effect on the parotid gland by 25\% (p < 0.05).
   Both MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD demonstrated a protective effect against
   irradiation-induced WBC suppression, by 35\% and 25\%, respectively (p <
   0.05). Treatment with SOD did not protect the animals against
   irradiation-induced reduction in oral intake and weight loss, or against
   submandibular hypofunction. These results suggest that SOD partially
   protects against head-and-neck irradiation-induced injury. Both MnSOD
   and Cu/ZnSOD partially protect against irradiation-induced WBC loss. The

Abstract = {{Study Design. The quantitative changes in anorectal and bladder
   functions after sacrifice of the sacral nerves were assessed.
   Objectives. To evaluate the bladder and anorectal functions before and
   after sacral nerve division in patients with sacral bone tumors.
   Summary of Background Data. The quantitative changes in bladder and
   anorectal functions after sacrifice of the sacral nerves have not been
   intensively studied, The purpose of this investigation was to measure
   the bladder and anorectal function before and after sacral nerve
   division using manometry and cystometry.
   Methods. Surgical resection of a sacral tumor was;performed in five
   patients. The sacral nerves were sacrificed bilaterally in three
   patients and unilaterally in two patients. Anorectal function was
   evaluated on the basis of symptoms and physiologic tests. Micturition
   function was evaluated based on symptoms, and intravesical pressures
   were measured by cystometry.
   Results. The two patients with unilateral sacral nerve loss did not
   experience subjective problems with defecation or micturition, although
   the residual volume of urine was increased after surgery. Two of the
   three patients with bilateral sacral nerve loss had no urge to defecate,
   were unable to differentiate between feces and flatus, and experienced
   no urgency. Fecal incontinence was uncommon because of firm feces, It
   was possible to control defecation using enemas on alternate days. The
   third patient underwent colostomy because the maximum resting pressure,
   which is controlled by the hypogastric nerves, was affected before
   surgery.
   Conclusion. Unilateral sacrifice of sacral nerves results in little
   bladder or anorectal dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Gamma knife radiosurgery has become an important
   treatment option for vestibular schwannoma. The effect of treatment can
   be assessed only by neuroimaging. We analyzed the evolution of follow-up
   MR imaging findings after gamma knife radiosurgery to provide
   information for the clinical management of these tumors.
   METHODS: Changes in tumor volume and enhancement were assessed visually
   on 341 follow-up MR studies obtained in 78 of 86 consecutive patients
   with unilateral vestibular schwannoma who underwent gamma knife
   radiosurgery.
   RESULTS: Follow-up MR studies were obtained between 10 and 63 months
   (mean, 34 months) after treatment. Tumor control rate was 81\%. Changes
   in tumor volume were classified as temporary enlargement (41\%), no
   change or sustained regression (34\%), alternating enlargement and
   regression (13\%), or continuous enlargement (12\%). Temporary
   enlargement occurred within 2 years after radiosurgery. Changes in tumor
   enhancement were classified as transient loss of enhancement (84\%),
   continuous increase in enhancement (5\%), or no change in enhancement
   (11\%). There was no significant correlation between changes in tumor
   volume and tumor enhancement. Areas of T2 hyperintensity in adjacent
   brain tissue appeared in 31\% of patients.
   CONCLUSION: Dynamic changes in vestibular schwannoma are seen on serial
   follow-up MR studies obtained after gamma knife radiosurgery. An
   increase in tumor size up to 2 Sears after radiosurgery is likely to be
   followed by regression. Changes in contrast enhancement are not
   predictive of clinical outcome. Neuroimaging follow-up is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{The present review was attempted to analyze the multiple channels of
   basal ganglia-thalamocortical connections, and the connections of their
   related nuclei. The prefrontal and motor areas consist of a number of
   modules, which seem to provide multiple subloops of the basal
   ganglia-thalamocortical connections in subhuman primates. There may be a
   gnat degree of convergence of the limbic, associative and motor loops at
   the level of the striatum, substantia nigra, pallidum, and the
   subthalamic nucleus as well as the pedunculopontine nucleus. Nigral
   dopaminergic neurons receive limbic input directly as well as indirectly
   through the striosomes in the striatum. Dopamine contributes to
   behavioral learning by signaling motivation and reinforcement. The
   pedunculopontine nucleus might be involved in behavioral state control,
   learning and reinforcement processes, locomotion and autonomic
   functions. Each subdivision of the motor areas receives a mixed and
   weighted transthalamic input from both the cerebellum and basal ganglia.
   In particular, based on the author's data, the hand/arm motor area and
   adjacent premotor area receive strong superficial basal
   ganglia-thalamocortical projections as well as the deep
   cerebello-thalamocortical projections. These areas, have very dense
   corticocotrical connections with other cortical areas, receive polymodal
   afferents from the parietal and temporal cortices, and integrated
   information, via multiple routes, from the prefrontal cortex. The author
   suggests that the ventrolateral part of the caudal medial pallidal
   segment (GPi) and the ventromedial part of the GPi are linked directly
   to these areas by ways of the oral part of ventral lateral nucleus (VLo)
   and the Ventral part of the parvicellular part of ventral anterior
   nucleus (VApc), respectively. These connections are thought to be
   involved in the acquisition and coordination of motor sequences. (C)

Abstract = {{Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by the
   presence of airflow obstruction caused by emphysema or airway narrowing,
   or both. Low attenuation areas (LAA) on computed tomography (CT) have
   been shown to represent macroscopic or microscopic emphysema, or both.
   However CT has not been used to quantify the airway abnormalities in
   smokers with or without airflow obstruction. In this study, we used CT
   to evaluate both emphysema and airway wall thickening in 114 smokers.
   The CT measurements revealed that a decreased FEV1 (\%predicted) is
   associated with an increase of airway wall area and an increase of
   emphysema. Although both airway wall thickening and emphysema (LAA)
   correlated with measurements of lung function, stepwise multiple
   regression analysis showed that the combination of airway and emphysema
   measurements improved the estimate of pulmonary function test
   abnormalities. We conclude that both CT measurements of airway
   dimensions and emphysema are useful and complementary in the evaluation
   of the lung of smokers.}},

Abstract = {{The ``intrapersonal together sense{''} is one of several meanings of the
   English words conscious and consciousness. C.S. Lewis identified the
   intrapersonal together sense as analogous to the ``interpersonal
   sense{''} of these same words: a sense that goes back, coo, to ancient
   rimes. millennia before the two words entered the English language.
   Whereas the interpersonal sense of consciousness picks out a certain
   kind of relation that exists, has existed, or will exist between two or
   a few people. the intrapersonal together sense refers to a process
   instantiated wholly by a single person yet analogous to that particular
   interpersonal relation. In addition to the interpersonal sense and the
   intrapersonal together sense, this article distinguishes the related
   concept of ``consciousness in the guilty sense{''}: which has reference
   ro a subcategory of consciousness in the intrapersonal together sense. A
   person conscious in the guilty sense has come to judge that he or she
   has committed or is committing now a legal or moral transgression - this
   kind of consciousness turning into an application of ``conscience{''}
   insofar as the judgment passed involves moral self-condemnation and
   produces feelings of guilt. All of the above are mutually similar kinds
   of consciousness and they are cases of ``awareness-with.{''} However,
   although simple awareness-with is one of their crucial ingredients, they
   are each more complex than the kind of awareness-with that consists of
   no more than undergoing inner, direct awareness of one's stares of
   consciousness.}},

   interactions of recombinant proteins, i.e., histidine-tagged
   protein-Ni2+/NTA and 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate receptor-ligand
   interactions. The E. coli lysates expressing the recombinant proteins
   were passed through the sensor chips, and biomolecular interactions were
   monitored iu real time. The molecules detected on the sensor chip were
   digested by delivering proteolytic enzyme to the sensing now cells. The
   resulting on-chip digested peptide mixture at the mid- to low-femtomole
   level was recovered on a microcapillary reversed-phase precolumn by an
   on-line system and analyzed using HPLC-MS/MS. In both cases, unambiguous
   sequence information on the recombinant proteins isolated on the sensor
   chip was obtained from only a single run of analysis. The combined
   BIA-MS/MS may prove to be a general and versatile system to discover
   novel biomolecular interactions and to analyze protein complexes.}},

Abstract = {{Central chemoreceptors appear to be widely distributed in the brainstem.
   Why are there so many central chemoreceptor sites? This review focuses
   on two hypotheses. (1) The high sensitivity of the respiratory control
   system as a whole to small changes in systemic PCO(2) results from an
   additive, or greater, effect of the multiple central chemoreceptor
   sites. Each site provides a fraction of the total response and,
   importantly, provides tonic excitatory input in eucapnia as well. (2)
   Individual central chemoreceptor sites vary in effectiveness depending
   on the arousal or vigilance state of the animal. For example, some sites
   are more important in wakefulness; others in sleep. Proof for these
   hypotheses depends critically on obtaining accurate measures of stimulus
   intensity at each chemoreceptor site in vivo. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterised by abnormal beta-cell function
   (present at the time of diagnosis) that is often associated with insulin
   resistance. An important and consistent pathophysiological finding is
   the failure to produce adequate increments in insulin secretion in
   response to carbohydrate intake. Therefore, insulin secretagogue
   therapy, particularly when focused on prandial glucose regulation, is a
   logical approach to treatment because it addresses one of the most
   fundamental pathophysiological aspects of the disease. However, the
   traditional secretagogues - the sulphonylureas - have long been
   associated with the unwanted effect of hypoglycaemia, This is
   particularly likely to occur when drugs with lengthy plasma half-lives,
   prolonged drug-receptor interactions, active metabolites or a reliance
   on renal clearance are used. The problem is most prevalent in elderly
   patients, where sulphonylurea-induced hypoglycaemia may be related to
   failure to comply with strict mealtimes or the need for supplementary
   food intake, often in the context of compromised renal function.
   Data from large-scale outcome studies demonstrate that when tight
   glycaemic control is achieved through aggressive antidiabetic therapy,
   late diabetic complications can be significantly reduced. However, the
   pursuit of stricter HbA(1c) targets with more aggressive interventions
   may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. This is an irony because the
   clinical need to avoid hypoglycaemia and patients' apprehension of it
   present barriers to the achievement of beneficial glycaemic targets,
   However, an increased risk of hypoglycaemia may not be inevitable with
   insulin secretagogue therapy. The recently introduced carbamoylmethyl
   benzoic acid derivative, repaglinide, has pharmacological properties
   that are well suited to its intended role as a prandial glucose
   regulator. When taken prior to main meals, the rapid onset and
   relatively short duration of action of repaglinide aid disposal of the
   mealtime glucose load, without continued stimulation of pancreatic
   beta-cells in the postprandial fasting period. Repaglinide is also
   characterised by hepatic metabolism and elimination, which is an
   advantage in the context of impaired renal function. Prandial glucose
   regulation with repaglinide selectively increases insulin secretion, and
   hence limits glucose excursions, in the prandial phase. If a meal is
   omitted, so too is the corresponding dose. This more flexible approach
   to the management of Type 2 diabetes has a number of advantages when
   compared with the fixed daily dosing regimens of sulphonylureas, among
   them a reduced risk of hypoglycaemia - a benefit that is particularly
   marked in the context of missed or irregular meals.}},

Abstract = {{Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic, progressive disease affecting
   many millions of people worldwide. It carries a great burden of
   morbidity and premature mortality for the individual, and places great
   demands on healthcare systems and resources. We now know from clinical
   studies that improved control of Type 2 diabetes can to some degree
   reduce its burden. We also know that in the context of a clinical trial,
   the treatments available to us can do much to improve control in many
   patients (although all will fall short of `normality'). International
   guidelines for management of Type 2 diabetes, quite correctly, encourage
   us to strive for levels of control where we believe the risk of
   complications is lowest. But is this happening in everyday practice?
   Data from a survey in three countries show that there is a great
   difference between the theory of diabetes care and the reality of
   clinical practice, with levels of glycaemic control in most patients
   falling short of desired levels. A consideration of the pathophysiology
   of Type 2 diabetes reveals that it is a complex syndrome focusing on the
   progressive failure of the pancreatic beta-cell. By acknowledging this
   fact, and addressing our therapeutic efforts appropriately, we may help
   to span the gap between theory and reality.}},

Abstract = {{In designing machine toots, the absence of a detailed procedure for
   selecting friction material on guideways often results in the stick-slip
   phenomenon, causing tolerance defects and undesirable motion properties.
   This paper describes the use of Self-organizing Maps (SOMs) to capture
   the tendencies of the stick-slip phenomenon, according to predefined
   parameters, from experimental data. These tendencies are presented
   graphically to the designer, as a result of which one can analyse and
   predict the stick-slip properties for a given guideway set-up. Owing to
   the intelligent data grouping properties of the SOM, a graphical
   interface produces areas of `acceptabte' and `unacceptable' stick-slip
   properties according to the designer's criteria for the guideway. This
   assists in the correct selection of friction material and guideway
   surface finish for a certain stress on the friction surface. The SOM
   modelling used, when compared to experience in industry, captures the
   basic characteristics of different combinations of guideway and friction
   material.}},

Abstract = {{Adult male and female CD rats ( F-0) were dosed with glutaraldehyde (
   GA; CAS number 111-30-8) in drinking water at concentrations of 0 (
   controls), 50, 250, or 1000 ppm for a 10-wk prebreed period and through
   mating, gestation, and lactation. Resultant F-1 offspring, selected to
   be parents of the next generation, were continued on the same regime
   from prebreed through lactation. Twenty-eight parental animals per sex
   per generation for each dose group were evaluated for clinical signs,
   body weight ( absolute and gain), and water and food consumption. The
   offspring were evaluated for survival and body weight to weaning.
   Necropsy and light microscopic examination of removed tissues were
   conducted in all F-0 and F-1 parents and in 10
   offspring/sex/group/generation. Average daily consumptions of GA ( as
   mean +/- SD) for the low, intermediate, and high concentrations were
   respectively 4.25 +/- 0.87, 17.50 +/- 4.16, and 69.07 +/- 14.58 mg/kg/d
   for F-0 parental males, and 6.68 +/- 0.78, 28.28 +/- 4.09, and 98.37 +/-
   11.71 mg/kg/d for F-0 parental females. The corresponding values for the
   F-1 parents were 4.53 +/- 1.02, 21.95 +/- 4.88, and 71.08 +/- 16.21
   mg/kg/d for males and 6.72 +/- 0.84, 29.57 +/- 5.41, and 99.56 +/- 16.72
   mg/kg/d for females. There were no effects on parental fertility and
   mating performance or on pup viability and litter size in any
   generation. No apparent treatment-related histopathology was seen in
   parents or offspring. Parental body weights and body weight gains were
   significantly reduced at 1000 ppm at a few isolated time periods,
   particularly during prebreed. Food consumption was significantly reduced
   at 1000 ppm for F-0 and F-1 parents during the prebreed and gestation
   periods, and at 250 ppm for F-0 males during prebreed and gestation and
   F-1 females during gestation and lactation. Water consumption by the F-0
   and F-1 parents of the 250 at 1000 ppm groups was reduced throughout the
   prebreed period. At 1000 ppm, average litter weights were reduced over
   lactation d 21-28 for the F-1 and F-2 offspring. The no-observed-effect
   level ( NOEL) for adult toxicity was 50 ppm and for offspring 250 ppm.
   There were no indications of reproductive toxicity, and the NOEL for
   this study was therefore >1000 ppm.}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed the safety and efficacy of filgrastim (r-metHuG-CSF
   {[}recombinant human methionine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]),
   when combined with intravenous (IV) antibiotics, in the treatment of
   hospitalized adult patients with multilobar community-acquired pneumonia
   (CAP), Four hundred eighty patients were randomized to receive placebo
   (n = 243) or filgrastim 300 mu g/day (n = 237), in addition to standard
   therapy. Treatment with study drug was continued for 10 days, until the
   peak white blood cell (WBC) count reached 75 x 10(9)/L, until discharge
   from the hospital, until death, or until IV antibiotics were
   discontinued. Study-related observations continued through day 29.
   Filgrastim increased WBC counts (baseline median, 13.3 x 10(9)/L; median
   peak, 43.8 x 10(9)/L), The 2 treatment groups were not statistically
   different with respect to the study end points; however, there was a
   trend toward reduction of mortality in patients with pneumococcal
   bacteremia, Although further studies will be required to validate this
   observation, filgrastim was safe and well tolerated when administered to
   patients with multilobar CAP.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of fluvoxamine (FVX) was studied by square-wave techniques,
   leading to two methods for its determination in aqueous samples (pH 2.0
   and 4.7) and pharmaceuticals formulations. The application of the
   square-wave mode shows the determination of FVX between 2 x 10(-8) and 3
   x 10(-6) mol L-1.FVX gave an adsorptive stripping voltammetric peak at
   the hanging mercury drop electrode at - 0.76 V, using an accumulation
   potential of - 0.50 V By the stripping technique, FVX proved to be more
   sensitive, yielding signals five times larger than those obtained by
   applying a square-wave scan without the previous accumulation. The
   calibration plot to determine FVX was linear in the range 5 x 10(-9) and
   1 x 10(-6)mol L-1 by stripping mode. The relative standard deviations
   obtained for concentration levels of FVX as low as 1.5 x 10(-6) mol L-1
   with square-wave was 3.54 \% (n = 10) and for 6.0 x 10 (-7) mol L-1 with
   stripping square-wave was 2.39\% (n = 10) in the same day. The two
   proposed methods (SW and SWAdSV) were applied to the determination of

   vegetation present following wildfires and clear-cut logging has been
   compared separately in three areas of the black spruce (Picea mariana
   (Mill.) BSP) - feathermoss (Pleurozium schreberi (Brid.) Mitt.)) forest
   of western and central Quebec. In each area, a detrended correspondence
   analysis successfully differentiated the burned and logged stands along
   the first ordination axis. This separation mainly resulted from the
   greater abundance of pioneer species or lichens after fire and the
   greater abundance of residual species after clear-cutting. Spearman's
   correlation coefficients were calculated to relate variables
   characterizing physical disturbance of the forest floor and general site
   conditions to the two first differentiating axes. Variables
   characterizing forest floor disturbance severity were strongly
   associated with the first ordination axis in two of the study areas but
   not in the third one. The interpretation of compositional differences in
   the light of plant reproductive strategies led to the identification of
   regeneration patterns that illustrated the influence of disturbance type
   and severity on post-disturbance vegetation composition. These results
   suggest that certain forestry practices such as careful logging with the
   protection of regeneration and soil, scarification, and prescribed
   burning may differ in their capability to address sustainable forest

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{The binding of the methylanthraniloyl derivatives of ATP (mant-ATP), ADP
   (mant-ADP), 2'deoxyATP (mant2'deoxyATP), and 3'deoxyATP
   (mant-3'deoxyATP) to thr catalytic subunit of protein kinase A was
   studied to gain insights into the mechanism of nucleotide binding. The
   binding of the mant nucleotides leads to a large increase in
   fluorescence energy transfer at 440 nm, allowing direct measurements of
   nucleotide affinity. The dissociation constant of mant-ADP is identical
   to that for ADP, while that for mant-ATP is approximately threefold
   higher than that for ATP. The dissociation constant for mant-3'deoxyATP
   is approximately fivefold higher than that for 3'deoxyATP while
   derivatization of 2'deoxyATP does not affect affinity. The
   time-dependent binding of mant-ATP, mant-2'deoxyATP, and mant-ADP,
   measured using stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy, is best fit to
   three exponentials. The fast phase is ligand dependent, while the two
   slower phases are ligand independent. The slower phases are similar but
   not identical in rate, and have opposite fluorescence amplitudes. Both
   isomers of mant-ATP are equivalent substrates, as judged by
   reversed-phase chromatography, although the rate of phosphorylation is
   approximately 20-fold lower than the natural nucleotide. The kinetic
   data are consistent with a three-step binding mechanism in which initial
   association of the nucleotide derivatives produces a highly fluorescent
   complex. Either one or two conformational changes can occur after the
   formation of this binary species, but one of the isomerized forms must
   have low fluorescence compared to the initial binary complex. These data
   soundly attest to the structural plasticity within the kinase core that
   may be essential for catalysis. Overall, the mant nucleotides present a
   useful reporter system for gauging these conformational changes in light
   of the prevailing three-dimensional models for the enzyme.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing attention has been given recently to the role of free
   radicals in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, since the inflamed
   intestine is exposed to oxidative stress generated by infiltrating
   macrophages and neutrophils within the lamina propia. The overall goal
   of this study was to evaluate whether experimental ulcerative colitis
   induces significant changes in the antioxidant defense system in an
   experimental model induced by the intrarectal administration of
   2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. Twenty rats were treated with 80
   mg/kg body weight of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and 20 with the same
   volume of 0.9\% NaCl. Rats were killed at one and two weeks after
   treatment to evaluate colon damage by light and electron transmission
   microscopy. The degree of tissue injury and inflammation was determined
   by measuring alkaline phosphatase, gamma -glutamyltranspeptidase, and
   myeloperoxidase activities and prostaglandin E-2 and leukotriene B-4.
   Glutathione levels and the activity of the enzymes of the antioxidant
   defense system were determined. Enzymatic markers of colon injury showed
   higher activities in rats with ulcerative colitis. Concentrations of
   prostaglandin E-2 and leukotriene B-4 were higher in the groups treated
   for one week with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and markers decreased
   after two weeks of treatment. All antioxidant enzyme activities were
   higher at one and two weeks after treatment; however, a significant
   decrease in total glutathione content was also observed. In conclusion,
   ulcerative colitis induced by trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid damages the
   intestinal mucosa and is accompanied by a shift in the antioxidant
   enzyme activities, and low levels of glutathione. This deficiency in
   glutathione could be a target for new therapies to treat ulcerative
   colitis.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To determine the effect of a specialist nurse on the
   management outcome of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
   Design Audit of the management of a cohort of patients in the year prior
   to the employment of the specialist nurse and the year immediately
   after.
   Subjects 339 patients, both male and female, with either Crohn's disease
   or ulcerative colitis, resident in the Cambridge health district.
   Setting Addenbrooke's Hospital NHS Trust Outpatient Centre.
   Main outcome measures Health status was measured by blood tests
   (C-reactive protein, albumin and haemoglobin) throughout the year,
   symptom indices, number of clinic attendances, admissions to hospital
   and length of stay. Quality of life was measured via a postal
   questionnaire.
   Results Hospital visits were reduced from 1377 to 853 (38\% reduction)
   and in-patient length of stay measured in bed-days from 516 to 417 (19\%
   reduction). The number of patients in remission increased from 63 to
   69\%. Patient satisfaction improved in key areas, in particular, access
   to information on IBD and advice on avoidance of illness and maintaining
   health. Of a total of 251 calls to the telephone helpline, only 19
   patients were referred for a medical opinion and five patients required
   hospital admission.
   Conclusion The IBD nurse specialist is a valuable and cost-effective
   member of the gastroenterology team. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams \&

Abstract = {{Experimental protocols to identify and quantify nitrogen nutrient
   deficiency in the activated sludge process were developed and tested
   using respirometry. Respirometric experiments showed that when a
   nitrogen nutrient deficient sludge is exposed to ammonia nitrogen, the.
   oxygen uptake rate (OUR) of the sludge increases while an initial
   nitrogen nutrient uptake takes place at the same time. Our investigation
   suggests that this initial nitrogen uptake is metabolically mediated.
   The protocols developed in this study can be used: (a) to assess whether
   a sludge sample is nitrogen nutrient deficient or not; and (b) to
   estimate the amount of nitrogen required to remedy a nutrient deficient
   condition in the sludge. Finally, a respirometry-based strategy to
   control nutrient addition to the activated sludge process is proposed.

Abstract = {{We investigated endocrine circadian rhythm (CR) during pulsatile and
   nonpulsatile left heart bypass (PLHB and NLHB). A ventricular assist
   device (VAD) was installed in five goats. After 2 weeks of PLHB, NLHB
   was subsequently conducted for 4 weeks. The levels of melatonin,
   cortisol, and renin activity were measured every 2 hours for 24 hours on
   the last day of the second PLHB week and the second and fourth NLHB
   weeks. Acquired data were compared with those of the normal control
   goats (Cont) to determine the presence or absence of CR, as well as the
   timing, acrophase, amplitude, and mesor of CR. Variations in melatonin,
   CR were consistently detected at all sampling points. In contrast, CR of
   cortisol during PLHB and NLHB was observed in a few cases, although
   considerable CR was noted in most of the Cent cases. The variations in
   renin activity indicated CR in most of the Cent cases and in all cases
   at all sampling points during PLHB and NLHB, whereas their acrophases
   were diversified. In conclusion, the CR of melatonin, reflecting the
   fundamental circadian clock, was maintained during both PLHB and NLHB,

   responsive renin during these bypass modalities.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) is a rare disease associated
   with prepubertal periodontitis, Our previous studies demonstrated that
   three unrelated patients with PLS showed the similar antigen-specific
   immune responses to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The initiation
   of antigen-specific immune responses was involved with human leukocyte
   antigens (HLA) on antigen-presenting cells. The aim of this study was to
   examine HLA haplotypes in the three patients with PLS,
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The three PLS patients, their mothers and the
   father of one patient participated in this study. HLA class I and class
   II antigens were determined serologically and DNA typing for DRBI and
   DQBI was performed using the restriction fragment length
   polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction method,
   RESULTS: The distribution of serologic HLA haplotypes, in two of three
   patients, was found to be quite similar. The DNA typing revealed that
   DRBI{*}0406, DRBI{*}08032, DQBI{*}0302, DQBI{*}06011 genotypes were
   shared in the two patients. The probability of sharing these four DNA
   types in unrelated individuals was nearly 1:40,000 in the Japanese
   population,
   CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that HLA antigen may be included as a
   possible host factor in the pathogenesis of PLS and that a genetically
   controlled immune response may account for an increased susceptibility
   to periodontal infection.}},

Abstract = {{De Queiroz and Gauthier, in a serial paper, argue that biological

   essentialists. Their paper argues for the scrapping of the current
   system of nomenclature, but fails to provide specific rules for the new
   ``Phylogenetic Systematics{''}-instead we have been presented with a
   vague and sketchy manifesto based upon the assertion that ``clades are
   individuals{''} and therefore must be pointed at with proper names,
   rather than diagnosed by synapomorphies. They claim greater stability
   for ``node pointing,{''} yet even their own examples show that the
   opposite is true, and their node pointing system is only more stable in
   a purely metaphysical sense detached from characters, evidence, usage of
   names, and composition of groups. We will show that the node pointing
   system is actually far LESS stable than the existing linnaean System

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that a wide variety Of recently reported

   perceptual classification, which have led to the development of a number

   terms of a single-system exemplar-similarity model. The phenomena
   include various rule- and prototype-described patterns of
   generalization, dissociations between categorization and similarity
   judgments, and dissociations between categorization and old-new
   recognition. The alternative exemplar-based interpretation relies on the
   idea that similarity is not an invariant relation but a
   context-dependent one. Similarity relations among exemplars change
   systematically because of selective attention to dimensions and because
   of changes in the level of sensitivity relating judged similarity to
   distance in psychological space. Adaptive learning principles may help
   explain the systematic influence of the selective attention process and
   of modulation in sensitivity settings on judged similarity.}},

Abstract = {{Transcription of algD, encoding GDP-mannose dehydrogenase, the key
   enzyme in the alginate biosynthetic pathway, is highly regulated in
   Azotobacter vinelandii. We describe here the characterization of a Tn5
   insertion mutant (AC28) which shows a higher level of expression of an
   algD::lacZ fusion. AC28 cells were morphologically abnormal and unable
   to encyst. The cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the Tn5-disrupted
   locus in AC28 revealed an operon homologous to the Escherichia coli
   ampDE operon. Tn5 was located within the ampD gene, encoding a cytosolic
   N-acetyl-anhydromuramyl-L-alanine amidase that participates in the
   intracellular recycling of peptidoglycan fragments. The ampE gene
   encodes a transmembrane protein, but the function of the protein is not
   known. We constructed strains carrying ampD or ampE mutations and one
   with an ampDE deletion. The strain with a deletion of the ampDE operon
   showed a phenotype similar to that of mutant AC28. The present work
   demonstrates that both alginate production and bacterial encystment are
   greatly influenced by the bacterial ability to recycle its cell wall.}},

Abstract = {{The enzymatic degradation of cynaroside (luteolin 7-O-glucoside), a
   dominant flavonoid in artichoke, has been investigated in the herbal
   drug Cynarae folium (artichoke leaves). Various drug samples obtained
   from several suppliers were shown to behave extremely variable in terms
   of their ability to hydrolyse endogenous flavone 7-O-glucosides under
   fermentative conditions. Cynaroside was best hydrolysed by protein
   extracts prepared Rom the drug at pH 5.0 and 55 degrees C. The
   responsible cynaroside 7-O-beta-D-glucosidase was purified 250-fold in
   about 3 \% yield by the combination of ammonium sulphate Fractionation,
   hydrophobic interaction chromatography on Phenylsepharose 6EF, anion
   exchange on Source 30Q, and gel filtration chromatography on Superdex
   200. Kinetic constants were determined using partially purified enzyme.
   Cynaroside and other flavonoid 7-O-glucosides were all well hydrolysed
   by the enzyme preparation, whereas the 3-O-glycosides tested were either
   barely deglycosylated (isoquercitrin) or not hydrolysed at all
   (rutoside). During drug processing with a view to producing
   phytopharmaceuticals the cynaroside 7-O-beta-D-glucosidase described
   here may become active, thus releasing luteolin from its precursor
   cynaroside. This in turn might be of some relevance with regard to the
   pharmaceutical quality of artichoke preparations since luteolin is
   regarded as one of the important active principles of artichoke herbal
   preparations.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated blood pressure imposes increased mechanical stress on the
   vascular wall, and mechanical strain is a mitogenic stimulus for
   vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells. The role of mechanical forces in
   regulating the production of noncellular material by VSM cells for VSM
   cells of human origin remains undefined. We thus investigated the
   effects of chronic cyclical mechanical strain on extracellular matrix
   (ECM) protein production by cultured human VSM cells. To simulate a
   blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg, human VSM cells were repetitively
   stretched and relaxed by 10\% to 16\% of their original length with the
   Flexercell apparatus. Fibronectin and collagen protein concentrations,
   matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, and transforming growth
   factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) mRNA expression by human VSM cells were
   measured in response to mechanical strain. Exposing human VSM cells to 5
   days of chronic cyclical mechanical strain increased fibronectin (+48\%,
   P<0.01) and collagen (+50\%, P<0.001) concentrations when compared with
   cells grown in static conditions. Mechanical strain also increased MMP-2
   activity, the predominant matrix-degrading isoform (+ 11\%, P<0.05) in
   human VSM cells, thus strain-induced ECM accumulation was not due to
   inhibition of ECM protein degradation. Strain also increased TGF-beta(1)
   mRNA expression and the production of a soluble factor that increased
   ECM protein production. Moreover, a TGF-beta-blocking antibody inhibited
   the effect of strain-conditioned media on matrix production by human VSM
   cells. These results suggest that chronic cyclical mechanical strain can
   directly modulate the fibrogenic activity of human VSM cells by inducing
   ECM protein synthesis and MMP activity. This occurs, at least in part,
   through mechanical strain-induced TGF-beta(1) production, a mechanism
   that could explain the increased vascular ECM deposition in
   hypertension.}},

   Study Design: Retrospective chart review.
   Setting: University-based, tertiary care teaching hospital.
   Patients: Three patients with acoustic neuromas who experienced

   Interventions: Radiographic imaging, surgical removal of tumors, and
   pathologic analysis.
   Main Outcome Measures: Patient histories, radiologic characteristics,
   surgical results, and pathologic findings.
   Results: Tumoral hemorrhage can occur in patients with acoustic
   neuromas. These three cases and a review of the world literature suggest
   that tumor size may be the most important risk factor for tumor-related
   hemorrhage.
   Conclusion: These findings have implications for those patients with

   Svalbard Radar (ESR), where the data are recorded in eight separate
   channels using different frequencies. For the real satellites we find
   large variations of the relative powers from event to event, which is
   probably due to a different number of pulses catching the satellite over
   the integration period. However, the large power difference remains
   unexpected in one case. Over short time scale (less than or equal to 10
   s) the relative power difference seems to be highly stable. For most
   NEIAL events the differences between channels are within noise level. In
   a few cases variations of the relative power well above both the
   estimated and expected 1-sigma level occur over a signal preintegrated
   profile. We thus suggest that the frequency dependence of the power in

Abstract = {{The species of ixodid ticks, attached to dogs and cats presented to
   veterinary practices in Great Britain and Ireland were identified. Most
   host animals carried only one tick species with Ixodes ricinus Linne
   (Acari: Ixodidae) being the most common, identified on 52\% of animals,
   Ixodes hexagonus Leach (Acari: Ixodidae) the second most common (on
   39\%) and Ixodes canisuga Johnston (Acari: Ixodidae) the third most
   common (on 11\%). A significantly higher proportion of dogs than cats
   carried I. ricinus, while I. hexagonus was more frequently carried by
   cats. One animal carried a single specimen of Haemaphysalis punctata
   Canestrini \& Fanzago (Acari: Ixodidae), one carried a Dermacentor
   reticulatus Fabricius (Acari: Ixodidae) but none carried Rhipicephalus
   sanguineus Latreille (Acari: Ixodidae). This indicates that the latter
   two species, vectors of `exotic' tick-borne diseases, remain at low
   densities in Great Britain and Ireland. Retrospective information on
   exposure of the animals to different habitats and geographic regions was
   collected by questionnaire and subject to contingency table and logistic
   regression analysis. Woodlands and moorlands were habitats significantly
   associated with I. ricinus attachment. Exposure to urban parks was
   significantly associated with I. hexagonus attachment and exposure to
   boarding kennels and catteries was significantly associated with I.
   canisuga attachment. Ixodes hexagonus, rather than I. ricinus, was the
   ixodid tick species most likely to be encountered by urban populations
   of dogs and cats and, by inference, possibly also humans. The
   implications of these findings, for the transmission of tick-borne
   pathogens to dogs, cats and humans are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To study the age-related trends in the incidence rates of
   ovarian cancer in South East England between 1967 and 1996.
   Design A retrospective review of systematically collected data on
   ovarian cancer in South East England.
   Methods Data were obtained from the Thames Cancer Registry on the
   numbers and rates per 100,000 population of ovarian cancer per five-year
   age group (0-85+) in the 30-year period from 1967 to 1996 from the 26
   health authorities in the Thames region. Linear regression was performed
   to determine the changes in incidence rates of ovarian cancer per age
   group over time.
   Main outcome measures The change in overall incidence of ovarian cancer
   in South East England, as well as the change in incidence of ovarian
   cancer in each five-year age groups (20-85+) in the 30-year study
   period.
   Results There was a strong positive correlation between ovarian cancer
   rates and year of diagnosis in women aged greater than or equal to 70
   years, and this was particularly marked in women > 85 years of age.
   There was a negative correlation between rates and year of diagnosis in
   women aged 45-59 years. The analysis did not demonstrate a significant
   correlation between ovarian cancer rates and year of diagnosis in women
   < 44 years of age or women aged 60-69 years.
   Conclusions There have been significant changes in the pattern of
   ovarian cancer incidence in South East England during the 30-year period
   studied. The observed changes in ovarian cancer incidence in younger
   women may, in part, be explained by known reproductive factors. The rise
   in ovarian cancer rates among the older age group is difficult to
   explain, but has important implications for the future planning and

Abstract = {{Bilateral perinatal testicular torsion (PTT) is an extremely rare
   condition. A baby boy at the postnatal 28th hour presented with right
   scrotal erythema and swelling, and left hydrocele were detected. There
   were no systemic symptoms. Right hydrocele had been detected during
   prenatal ultrasonography at the 34th week of gestation. Emergency
   technetium Tc 99m pertechnetate scintigraphy showed hypoperfusion in
   both sides suggesting testicular torsion. The patient underwent surgery
   immediately. Right necrotic testis was removed, left testis was judged
   as viable, and thus was treated with detorsion. Bilateral PTT in the
   neonate is a true emergency because of the risk of anorchia. Controversy
   still exists regarding the treatment of unilateral PTT. Some
   investigators suggest delayed operation regarding the anesthetic risk
   imposed on the neonate and the reality that operative salvage of the
   prenatally torsed testicle is a remote possibility. However, although
   asynchronous bilateral PTT is rare, the patient with unilateral PTT is
   at risk of contralateral testicular torsion in the waiting period of
   delayed operation. Therefore, the authors recommend early surgical
   intervention. J Pediatr Surg 35:1348-1349. Copyright (C) 2000 by W.B.

Abstract = {{The influence of a xylanase supplement on performance of laying hens fed
   different energy-graded, wheat-based rations was tested in a 12-week
   trial. Two varieties of wheat with different extraction viscosity were
   selected. In addition to the control ration, three test rations with
   reduced energy contents of -3, -6, and -9\% were used. Sixteen groups,
   each consisting of 30 hens were kept in single cages. At the beginning
   of the experiment hens were 24 weeks old. Single eggmass and daily
   eggmass production showed a statistically significant difference. This
   was not caused by the enzyme supplement or the energy content, but by
   the variety of wheat. Interaction effects between variety of wheat,
   enzyme supplement and energy content became obvious with regard to the
   yolk colour. The influence of the enzyme on the yolk colour is positive
   and statistically highly significant. Thus, the addition of xylanase to
   wheat-based rations does not affect the performance parameters of laying
   hens positively.}},

Abstract = {{The electromagnetic properties of a current on a thin horizontal wire
   above a flat lossy earth is reviewed. Attention is given to the
   historical development of the topic, starting with the seminal work of
   Carson. Particularly, the importance of Professor Wait's contribution to
   the initial understanding of the modal and radiative behaviors of the
   current, as described in his influential paper {[}1], is discussed in
   detail. A description of Wait's full wave analysis is provided to show
   how that analysis justified many of the assumptions embedded in Carson's
   result and how that same analysis later led to a fuller understanding of
   the current's spatial spectrum. Although no rigorous proof is known to
   exist with respect to the completeness of this spectrum, a necessary
   condition for completeness is offered; the basis of this condition is
   the measurable input conductance of the wire. The paper concludes with a
   short discussion on the various extensions of Wait's classic work that
   have been provided over the last two decades.}},

Abstract = {{Spray application of 24 and 46 g ha(-1) MON 37500 was used in efficacy
   studies, and vacuum infiltration or droplet application of radiolabeled
   MON 37500 was used in metabolism studies to evaluate temperature and
   soil moisture on MON 37500 efficacy and metabolism. Day/night
   temperatures before vs. after application of MON 37500 of 25/23 vs.
   25/23, 25/23 vs. 5/3, 5/3 vs. 25/23, and 5/3 vs. 5/3 C were evaluated
   for the efficacy study whereas day/night temperatures of 5/3 and 25/23 C
   were used for the metabolism study. Soil moisture of one-third and full
   pot capacities was evaluated for both studies. No Triticum aestivum
   injury was observed at the different temperatures or soil moistures
   because of rapid metabolism of MON 37500 by T. aestivum. Weed control
   was greater when the temperature after application was 25/23 C or soil
   moisture was at full pot capacity than when the temperature was at 5/3 C
   after application or soil moisture was at one-third pot capacity.
   Susceptibility to MON 37500 was greatest for Bromus tectorum, moderate
   for Avena fatua, and least for Aegilops cylindrica. This pattern of
   susceptibility for the weed species was related to their ability to
   metabolize MON 37500. Aegilops cylindrica metabolized more MON 37500 in
   the first 24 h than did A. fatua, whereas B. tectorum metabolized the
   least MON 37500. Cool air temperatures decreased MON 37500 metabolism in

Abstract = {{Mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins cause hypertrophic
   cardiomyopathy (HCM). The sarcomeric protein actin plays a central, dual
   role in cardiac myocytes, generating contractile force by interacting
   with myosin and also transmitting force within and between cells. Two
   missense mutations in the cardiac actin gene (ACTC), postulated to
   impair force transmission, have been associated with familial dilated
   cardiomyopathy (DCM), Recently, a missense mutation in ACTC was found to
   cosegregate with familial HCM. To further test the hypothesis that
   mutations within functionally distinct domains of ACTC cause either DCM
   or HCM, we performed mutational analyses in 368 unrelated patients with
   familial or sporadic HCM. Single strand conformation polymorphism and
   sequence analyses of genomic DNA were performed, De novo mutations in
   ACTC were identified in two patients with sporadic HCM who presented
   with syncope in early childhood. Patients were heterozygous for missense
   mutations resulting in Pro164Ala and Ala331Pro amino acid substitutions,
   adjacent to regions of actin-actin and actin-myosin interaction,
   respectively A mutation that cosegregated with familial HCM was also
   found, causing a Glu99Lys substitution in a weak actomyosin binding
   domain. The cardiac phenotype in many affected patients was
   characterized by an apical form of HCM. These Endings support the
   hypothesis that a single amino acid substitution in actin causes either
   congestive heart failure or maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy, depending
   on its effect on actin structure and function. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

   to 90 kg live weight, either a control (CONT) diet containing palm oil
   or one of three diets based on full-fat rapeseed (FFR; 250 g kg(-1))
   (diets RD), The RD diets were supplemented with 0, 200 or 500 mg
   DL-alpha-tocopherol acetate (ATA) kg(-1) diet (diets RD0, RD200 and
   RD500 respectively). Diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous and
   isocaloric. M semimembranosus (S memb) muscle subcellular fractions
   (microsomes and mitochondria) were analysed for fatty acid composition,
   alpha-tocopherol (AT) content and oxidative stability. The fatty acid
   composition of the neutral lipids (NL) and phospholipids (PL) of the
   membrane fractions were only slightly influenced by dietary fatty acid
   composition, Greater influence of dietary fatty acids was observed on
   the NL than on the FL. The mitochondrial fraction contained a higher
   content of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) than the microsomal fraction.
   The AT content of the subcellular fractions increased with increasing
   levels of dietary ATA. AT was between 1.7 and 2.5-fold higher in
   mitochondrial fractions than in microsomal fractions. As the ATA content
   of RD diets increased, the oxidation of membrane lipids decreased. More
   oxidation occurred in the microsomal fraction compared to the
   mitochondrial fraction, which can be attributed mainly to a lower AT/UFA
   ratio in the microsomal fraction. (C) 2000 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

   structure assuming simple two-states transition has been developed using
   experimental values of T-m, DeltaH(m) and heat capacity change
   (DeltaC(p,u)) compiled in the database ``ProTherm{''}. In order to
   account for dependence of thermostability on pH and salt concentration,
   the difference in electrostatic interactions between native and
   denatured states (DeltaH(u,ele)) was computed applying Debye-Huckel type
   potential between partial charges located on ionizable side chain atoms.
   Standard unfolding free energy (DeltaG(u)(0)), enthalpy (DeltaH(u)(0)),
   and DeltaC(p,u) at 25 degreesC after subtracting electrostatic energies
   were obtained using a data set of 63 experimental data on 32 uncharged
   proteins. Each of these quantities was assumed to be a sum of products
   of the difference in accessible surface area (Delta ASA) of an i-th
   constituent atomic group between the native and unfolded extended
   structure times a corresponding adequate constant. Proportional
   constants for six (aliphatic, aromatic, hydroxyl, amide, carbonyl, and
   thiol) atomic groups were determined using the data set. Thus,
   DeltaG(u)(0), DeltaH(u)(0), and DeltaC(p,u) for a protein at uncharged
   form of known 3D structure can be computed using its Delta ASA value of
   every group, and DeltaG(u)(T) at T is determined according to
   thermodynamic relation, adding DeltaH(u,ele)(T). Values of T-m and
   DeltaH(m) for the protein may, therefore, be evaluated as values at
   DeltaG(u)(T)=0. The agreement of calculated and experimental values for
   the data set used for the determination of the constants was practically
   the same as that for another data set of 33 experimental data on T-m and
   DeltaH(m) for 19 proteins with standard deviations of about 12 degreesC
   and 38 kcal/mol, respectively. The stability and instability of
   correctly and misfolded proteins (hemerythrin, and Ig-variable domain
   fragment) were successfully explained in terms of DeltaG(u).}},

Abstract = {{A variety of reactions which are commonly used in synthetic chemistry
   are feasible with the automated synthesizer (MED-LEY). Air-sensitive
   organolithium and Grignard reagents as well as transition metal
   catalysts like Ni(0) and Pd(0) species are employable, The precise
   control of both the reaction temperature and the amount of added
   reagents enables to examine the dependence of chemical yields on the
   reaction temperature. Since the order of reagent addition is programmed
   and the reaction temperature is quickly tunable, sequential reactions
   can be conducted smoothly. An advanced control system was incorporated
   which allows a task to start immediately after the preceding one has
   finished. Owing to this function, the time for completing the multistep

Abstract = {{In the present payer some preliminary results of an experiment performed
   in the Velebit Channel between 4 September and 11 October 1998 are
   discussed. Throughout the experiment currents were measured at three
   stations and two levels, using Aanderaa RCM-4S and RCM-7 current meters.
   At the beginning and end of the experiment the CTD profiling was done
   using a Sea Bird 17 probe, at the network of 27 stations positioned c.2
   NM apart. On the final day of the experiment the CTD profiles were also
   taken in the Zrmanja Estuary. All the experimental data could be
   compared with the tide-gauge records routinely collected at the nearby
   stations (Bakar, Zadar) and with the time series originating from the
   meteorological stations in the area (Senj, Obrovac, Sibenik).
   Meteorological data showed that during the summer 1998 rainfall was
   below the long-term average and that in September 1998 it suddenly
   surpassed not only the corresponding average but the upper
   standard-deviation limit as well. As a consequence of this anomaly, in
   the course of our experiment the salinity was considerably reduced in
   the Velebit Channel, mostly in the surface layer, thus enabling various
   freshwater discharges in the area to be quantitatively documented. As
   the interval between the two CTD surveys was also characterised by
   numerous sirocco and bora wind pulses, current meters simultaneously
   operating in the channel captured its response to the wind forcing. Both
   the density and current data indicated that the northern part of the
   Velebit Channel is predominantly influenced by the wind, whereas its
   southern part is mostly buoyancy driven. implications of these findings
   for the proposed construction of thermal power plant in the area are
   briefly commented upon.}},

Abstract = {{Studies following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound,
   Alaska indicated that river otters (Lontra canadensis) from oiled
   regions displayed symptoms of degraded health, including reduced body
   weight. We examined the fate of ingested oil in the digestive tract and
   its effects on gut function in captive river otters. Fifteen wild-caught
   males were assigned to three groups, two of which were given weathered
   crude oil in food (i.e., control, 5 ppm day(-1), and 50 ppm day(-1))
   under controlled conditions at the Alaska Sealife Center. Using glass
   beads as non-specific digesta markers and stable isotope analysis, we
   determined the effects of ingested oil on retention time and nutrient
   uptake. Our data indicated that oil ingestion reduced marker retention
   time when we controlled for activity and meal size. Fecal isotope ratios
   suggested that absorption of lipids in the oiled otters might have been
   affected by reduced retention time of food. In addition, a dilution
   model indicated that as much as 80\% of ingested oil was not absorbed in
   high-dose animals. Thus, while the ingestion of large quantities of
   weathered crude oil appears to reduce absorption of oil hydrocarbons and
   may alleviate systemic effects, it may concurrently affect body
   condition by impacting digestive function.}},

   O-2 reduction occurs on chalcosite surface containing Cu2S film and on
   pyrite surface supporting Fe(OH)(3) film. In the case of galene, the
   formation of elemental S on generator electrode (due to surface chemical
   oxidation) and collector electrode of the flow cell (due to oxidation of
   the generated sulphide ions) hinder the electroreduction of oxygen,
   impeding the determination of the kinetic parameters, k(1) (direct way)
   and k(2) (indirect way). From the k(1)/k(2) ratio, chalcosite appears to

Abstract = {{Many epidemiological studies provide evidence of an association between
   ambient particles, measured as PM10, and daily mortality. Most of these
   studies have been conducted in urban areas where PM10 is highly
   correlated with and dominated by fine particles less than 2.5 mum in
   diameter (PM2.5). Fewer studies have investigated impacts associated
   with the fraction of coarse mode particles (between 2.5 and 10 mum in
   diameter). In a previous study using data from 1989 through 1992 in the
   Coachella Valley, a desert resort and retirement area east of Los
   Angeles, we reported associations between PM10 and several different
   measures of mortality {[}Ostro B.D., Hurley S., and Lipsett M.J. Air
   pollution and daily mortality in the Coachella Valley, California: a
   study of PM10 dominated by coarse particles. Environ. Res. 1999: 81:
   231-238]. In this arid environment, coarse particles of geologic origin
   are highly correlated with and comprise approximately 60\% of PM10,
   increasing to >90\% during wind events. This study was intended to
   repeat the earlier investigation using 10 years (1989-1998) of daily
   data on mortality and PM10. The last 2.5 years of data also included
   daily measures of PM2.5, allowing examination of size-specific impacts.
   To ensure adequate statistical power, we attempted to develop predictive
   models for both fine and coarse particles to use in analyses of the full
   10-year period. An acceptable fit was found only for coarse particles,
   which were found to be a cubic function of PM10 (R-2=0.95). Outcome
   variables included several measures of daily mortality, including
   all-cause (minus accidents and homicides), cardiovascular and
   respiratory mortality. Multivariate Poisson regression analyses using
   generalized additive models were employed to explain the variation in
   these endpoints, controlling for temperature, humidity, day of the week,
   season, and time, using locally weighted smoothing techniques. pollution
   lags of up to 4 days were examined. Several pollutants were associated
   with all-cause mortality including PM2.5, carbon monoxide and nitrogen
   dioxide. More consistent results were found for cardiovascular-specific
   mortality, for which associations were found for coarse particles (RR =
   1.02; 95\% C.I., 1.01-1.04), PM10 (RR = 1.03; 95\% C.I., 1.01-1.05).
   None of the pollutants was associated with respiratory-specific
   mortality. Ozone was not associated with any of the mortality outcomes.
   These findings are generally consistent with those we previously
   reported for the Coachella Valley for the period 1989-1992,
   demonstrating associations between several measures of particulate
   matter and daily mortality in an environment in which particulate
   concentrations are dominated by the coarse fraction.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the in vivo effects of intraarticular MMP-13.
   Methods: Human recombinant MMP-13 was injected intraarticularly (i.a.)
   into the hamster knee joint. MMP-13 activity, collagen and proteoglycan
   fragments, and hyaluronan were measured in synovial fluid. Antibody 9A4
   was used to localize collagen damage. Western blotting was used to
   determine the size of type II collagen fragments.
   Results: MMP-13 activity measurements showed greater than 98\% of MMP-13
   to be cleared instantly from the joint cavity. The remainder was cleared
   with a t(1/2) of 2 h. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated collagen
   cleavage was limited to a thin superficial band on the surface of the
   articular cartilage whereas collagen damage extended more deeply into
   the synovial capsule and the menisci. The elevation of proteoglycan and
   hyaluronan in synovial fluid after MMP-13 was modest. Collagen fragments
   appeared in synovial fluid within 15 min following MMP-13. They were
   cleared with a half-life of circa 1.8 h and the predominant fragment was
   32 kDa.
   Conclusions: Activated MMP-13 leads to tissue collagen damage with the
   release of collagen fragments. These fragments are measurable and could
   provide a method for assessment of cartilage collagen damage. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Introduction: Long-acting opioids may be needed for postoperative pain
   relief in sheep. Reports on the analgesic efficacy of the partial Ci
   agonist buprenorphine, however, are controversial. Therefore, the aim of
   this study was to compare the effects of buprenorphine with the mu full
   agonist piritramide on clinical pain following orthopaedic surgery in
   sheep.
   Material and methods: Postoperative analgesia of intramuscular
   buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg) and piritramide (0.57 mg/kg) were evaluated
   in a prospective, randomised and blinded study in 22 ewes submitted to
   an experimental tibia osteotomy. For evaluation of postoperative
   analgesia the rime from extubation to first attempt to stand, to
   standing, to first food/water uptake, to first postoperative analgesic
   treatment, the number of animals treated per group, postoperative
   behaviour and lameness scores were compared.
   Results: The distribution of behavioural scores in standing/walking
   animals was significantly different (P = 0.018) between the two
   treatment groups. In the buprenorphine group behaviour scores ranged
   more in the lower score range while higher scores were recorded in the
   piritramide group. In both groups the same number of nine sheep required
   additional postoperative analgesic treatment at almost identical time
   intervals. No significant differences existed for the other variables.
   Conclusion: Buprenorphine and piritramide provided effective analgesia
   following tibia osteotomy in sheep with a slightly better quality in
   animals pre-treated with buprenorphine.}},

Abstract = {{Regions vary strongly according to the participation of firms in R\&D
   activity. By linking data on R\&D activity at the firm level with
   GIS-based data on economic and other location features of regions, we
   are able to investigate the impact of local factors on R\&D involvement
   for various types of firms. The relative importance of local factors as
   determinants of the R\&D involvement of firms is estimated by means of a
   tobit model. Rather strong differences are found between zones in the
   same urban region. For example, modern manufacturing firms located in
   the centre of large cities have relatively low levels of R\&D, and the
   opposite holds for rings of zones at certain distances from the cities.

Abstract = {{Background: Accidental intrathecal vincristine (VCR) administration
   results in severe neurotoxicity, usually fatal in outcome. No specific
   therapy for initrathecal VCR toxicity has been reported so far. In our
   recent report, complete in vitro degradation of VCR by hypochlorous acid
   (HOCl) was demonstrated. Methods: In this comparative study, we examined
   the in vivo effectivity of HOCl in the cerebrospinal fluid of 24 New
   Zealand rabbits following intracisternal VCR administration. Results:
   There were no significant clinical or histopathologic abnormalities in
   the control and HOCl groups; however, multiple necrotic foci on
   histopathological examination of brain sections in the VCR group were
   determined. There were significantly lower numbers of necrotic foci in
   brain sections of rabbits which received HOCl administration than those
   without therapy. Conclusion: Our results indicate that HOCl may reduce
   VCR neurotoxicity. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.}},

   could benefit from the insights provided by recent work in the cognitive

Abstract = {{Fear of humans is a source of stress for Holstein dairy cattle and can
   result when animals are handled aversively. We used aversion learning
   techniques to determine which handling practices cattle find most
   aversive. In an aversion race, the cows are repeatedly walked down a
   race and treatments applied when they reached the end; the time and
   force required for cows to walk down the race are measured. The animal
   learns to associate walking down the race with the treatment received;
   if the treatment is aversive, the animal will take more time and require
   more force to reach the end of the race than if the treatment is
   positive. In experiment 1, 54 cows were assigned to four treatments
   (hit/shout, brushing, control, and food). Treatments of 2-min duration
   were applied three times a day for 4 days. Cows on the hit/shout
   treatment took more time and required more force to walk through the
   race than cows on other treatments, while brushed cows took longer to
   move through the race than cows given food. In experiment 2, 60 cows
   were assigned to five treatments (electric prod, shouting, hitting, tail
   twist, and control). Treatments of 1-min duration were applied three
   times a day for 3 days. Cows on the shout and electric prod treatments
   took more time and required more force to walk down the race than cows
   on the control treatment. In experiment 3, thirty-six 1-1.5-year-old
   heifers were assigned to three treatments (hand feeding, gentling, or
   control) applied as in experiment 2. Treatments did not affect the time
   or force required to walk down the race. The aversion race successfully
   discriminated between handling treatments that differ greatly in
   aversiveness but lacked sensitivity to distinguish between treatments
   that were similar. Although many procedural factors must be considered,
   aversion learning techniques are an effective method to determine which
   handling practices cattle find aversive or rewarding. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Transthyretin (TTR) is the major T-4-binding protein in rodents. Using a
   TTR-null mouse model we asked the following questions. 1) Do other T-4
   binding moieties replace TTR in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)? 2) Are
   the low whole brain total T-4 levels found in this mouse model
   associated with hypothyroidism, e.g. increased 5'-deiodinase type 2 (D2)
   activity and RC3-neurogranin messenger RNA levels? 3) Which brain
   regions account for the decreased total whole brain T-4 levels? 4) Are
   there changes in T-3 levels in the brain? Our results show the
   following. 1) No other T-4-binding protein replaces TTR in the CSF of
   the TTR-null mice. 2) D2 activity is normal in the cortex, cerebellum,
   and hippocampus, and total brain RC3-neurogranin messenger RNA levels
   are not altered. 3) T-4 levels measured in the cortex, cerebellum, and
   hippocampus are normal. However T-4 and T-3 levels in the choroid plexus
   are only 14\% and 48\% of the normal values, respectively. 4) T-3 levels
   are normal in the brain parenchyma. The data presented here suggest that
   TTR influences thyroid hormone levels in the choroid plexus, but not in
   the brain. Interference with the blood-choroid-plexus-CSF-TTR-mediated
   route of T-4 entry into the brain caused by the absence of TTR does not
   produce measurable features of hypothyroidism. It thus appears that TTR
   is not required for T-4 entry or for maintenance of the euthyroid state
   in the mouse brain.}},

Abstract = {{Aim-To assess the ability of commercial blood culture systems to
   maintain leptospires.
   Methods-Nine different commercial blood culture bottles were compared
   for their ability to maintain four leptospiral strains at two
   temperatures, 30 degrees C and 37 degrees C. Bottles were subcultured at
   48 hours, and one, two, three, and four week intervals and examined
   microscopically for the presence of viable leptospires.
   Results-The results were comparable with those of an earlier study,
   which showed that different commercial blood culture systems varied in
   their ability to maintain leptospires.
   Conclusions-No single factor appears to influence the viability of
   leptospires in blood culture systems, In general, the combination of an
   aerobic blood culture and an incubation temperature of 30 degrees C
   enhances the viability of leptospires, and hence would increase the
   chances of their subsequent isolation from suspected cases of

   changes in sensitivity to egg infection caused by active substances in
   the extracts affecting the egg shell. Exposure to the extracts
   significantly (P = 0.05) increased the sensitivity of Meloidogyne

   of cyst nematode eggs to V. chlamydosporium infection increased from 18
   in the control to 46 and 49 \% following treatment with poultry manure

   eggs increased two fold over the controls when exposed to pine tree bark

   fungal infection and the concentration of aqueous extracts was detected.
   These results demonstrate that hydrophilic secondary metabolites in the

Title = {{Appraisal of early evaluation of blunt chest trauma: Development of a
   standardized scoring system for initial clinical decision making}},

Year = {{2000}},

Abstract = {{Background: Current techniques for assessment of chest trauma rely on
   clinical diagnoses or scoring systems. However, there is no generally
   accepted standard for early judgement of the severity of these injuries,
   especially in regards to related complications. This drawback may have a
   significant impact on the management of skeletal injuries, which are
   frequently associated with chest trauma. However, no convincing
   conclusions can be determined until standardization of the degrees of
   chest trauma is achieved. We investigated the role of early clinical and
   radiologic assessment techniques on outcome in patients with blunt
   multiple trauma and thoracic injuries and developed a new scoring system
   for early evaluation of chest trauma.
   Methods: A retrospective investigation was performed on the basis of
   4,571 blunt polytrauma (Injury Severity Score {[}ISS] greater than or
   equal to 18) patients admitted to our unit. Inclusion criteria were
   treatment of thoracic injury that required intensive care therapy,
   initial Glasgow Coma Scale score greater than 8 points, and no local or
   systemic infection. Patients with thoracic trauma and multiple
   associated injuries (ISS greater than or equal to 18) were included, In
   all patients, the association between various parameters of the thoracic
   injuries and subsequent mortality and morbidity was investigated,
   Results: A total of 1,495 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria,
   Patients' medical records and chest radiographs were reevaluated between
   May 1, 1998, and June 1, 1999. The association between rib fractures and
   chest-related death was low (> three ribs unilateral, mortality 17.3\%,
   odds ratio 1.01) unless bilateral involvement was present (> three ribs
   bilateral, mortality 40.9\%, odds ratio 3.43). Injuries to the lung
   parenchyma, as determined by plain radiography, were associated with
   chest-related death, especially if the injuries were bilateral or
   associated with hemopneumothorax (lung contusion unilateral, mortality
   25.2\%, odds ratio 1.82; lung contusion bilateral + hemopneumothorax,
   mortality 53.3\%, odds ratio 5.1), When plain anteroposterior chest
   radiographs were used, the diagnostic rate of rib fractures (less than
   or equal to three ribs) increased slightly, from 77.1\% to 97.3\% during
   the first 24 hours of admission. In contrast, pulmonary contusions were
   often not diagnosed until 24 hours after admission (47.3\% at admission,
   92.4\% at 24 h, p = 0.002). A new composite scoring system (thoracic
   trauma severity score) was developed that combines several variables:
   injuries to the chest wall, intrathoracic lesions, injuries involving
   the pleura, admission PaO2/FIO2 ratio, and patient age. The receiver
   operating characteristic curve demonstrated an adequate discrimination,
   as demonstrated by a value of 0.924 for the development set and 0.916
   for the validation set. The score was also superior to the ISS (0.881)
   or the thorax Abbreviated Injury Score (0.693).
   Conclusion: Radiographically determined injuries to the lung parenchyma
   have a closer association with adverse outcome than chest-wall injuries
   but are often not diagnosed until 24 hours after injury. Therefore,
   clinical decision making, such as about the choice of surgery for long
   bone fractures, may be flawed if this information is used alone. A new
   thoracic trauma severity score may serve as an additional tool to
   improve the accuracy of the prediction of thoracic trauma-related
   complications.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfurtransferases transfer a sulfane atom from a donor substrate to a
   thiophilic acceptor molecule. Recently a sulfurtransferase specific for
   the substrate 3-mercaptopyruvate was isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana
   {[}Papenbrock, J. \& Schmidt, A. (2000) Eur. J. Biochem. 267, 145-154].
   In this study a second sulfurtransferase from Arabidopsis was
   characterized and compared to the enzyme described previously. Sequences
   of the mature proteins had an identity of 77.7\%. The plant
   sulfurtransferases formed a distinct group within the known eukaryotic
   sulfurtransferases. When Southern blots were hybridized with labelled
   cDNA fragments from each of the plant sulfurtransferases the same
   pattern of bands was obtained indicating the existence of only these two
   closely related sulfurtransferases. The new sulfurtransferase was
   expressed in Escherichia coli fused with an N-terminal His(6)-tag,
   purified and tested for enzyme activity. Like the first enzyme, the
   newly isolated protein preferred 3-mercaptopyruvate to thiosulfate as
   substrate. The K-m of both enzymes determined for 3-mercaptopyruvate and
   cyanide were almost identical. As a result of database searches it
   became obvious that sulfurtransferase proteins from higher plants showed
   high similarities to small senescence- and stress-induced proteins. To
   prove the involvement of sulfurtransferases in senescence-associated
   processes 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase activity was determined
   in crude protein extracts from Arabidopsis plants of different ages.
   3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase activity and steady-state RNA
   levels of sulfurtransferases increased with increasing age. However,
   steady-state protein levels as measured by using an antibody against the
   sulfurtransferase protein expressed previously decreased. Putative roles
   of sulfurtransferases in senescence-associated processes are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We report amplification of the MLL gene region (11q23-->11qter) in a
   72-year-old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome progressing to acute
   myelomonocytic leukemia and in a BI-year-old man with a history of hairy
   cell leukemia and secondary myelodysplasia progressing to acute
   myelogenous leukemia. The amplicons containing MLL were shown by
   molecular cytogenetics to extend fi om chromosomal region 11q23 to the
   distal long arm of chromosome 11 and to be present in the first patient
   in five copies on a large ring chromosome and present in the second
   patient also in five copies on two derived chromosomes. Other karyotypic
   findings in the first patient included del(5q), +8, and der(21)t(17;21),
   resulting in the loss of a copy of 17p, whereas deletion 7q was observed
   in the second patient. Southern-blot analysis for the second patient was
   consistent with MLL amplification but did not demonstrate rearrangement
   of the germ-line MLL band. Amplification of MLL and the 11q23 region has
   been documented in only a few cases and appears to be yet another
   mechanism by which MLL contributes to the leukemia phenotype, (C) 2000

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the spatial distribution of soil pH, clay
   content, and clap mineralogy on a hillslope (Bicknoller Combe, Somerset,
   UK) in order to identify lateral and vertical variation of chemical
   weathering intensity associated with a podzolic catena. Despite a steep
   slope gradient and a clear catena on the study slope, active chemical
   weathering is mostly limited to upper soil horizons down to about 40-50
   cm soil depth, below which throughflow causes lateral differentiation of
   soil pH and clay content along hillslope profiles. The depth of the
   active weathering zone becomes deeper along the upper part of a
   hillslope hollow in which acid throughflow converges from adjacent
   spurs, while an accumulation of clay is observed in the subsurface
   layers of the lower hollow. The intensity of chemical weathering
   identified Ly the transformation sequence of mica correlates well with
   the evolutionary sequence of podzolisation in the upper soil horizon;
   this enables the spatial variation of chemical weathering across the
   slope to be assessed. The results show chat more adequate consideration
   of both catena and horizon development is necessary in order to
   understand the longterm pattern of chemical denudation on hillslopes.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the involvement of antibody in protection against
   vaginal herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) infection by comparing
   intact and B-cell knockout (KO) mice. Vaginal immunization of intact
   mice with attenuated HSV-2 markedly reduced an HSV-2 challenge infection
   in the vagina. In contrast, immunization of B-cell KO mice produced less
   immunity against the challenge infection and that immunity occurred in a
   different pattern. At 20 hr after challenge, immunostaining of virus
   proteins in the vaginal epithelium and shed virus protein titres in the
   vaginal secretions were not significantly different between immunized
   and non-immunized B-cell KO mice and were much greater than in immunized
   intact mice. At 48 hr after challenge, the vaginal infection in
   immunized B-cell KO mice was markedly less than at 20 hr but remained
   approximate to sevenfold higher than in intact mice. This pattern of
   challenge infection in the vagina indicates that B cells, and probably
   the antibody derived from them, provided significant protection against
   reinfection in intact mice, especially during the first 20 hr after
   challenge, while other effector mechanisms became important between 20
   and 48 hr after challenge. To determine whether T-cell immunity in
   immunized B-cell KO mice was equal to that in intact mice, we assessed
   interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion by memory T cells in vivo in the
   vagina at 20 hr after challenge. We found no significant differences in
   the up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II
   antigens in the epithelium, up-regulation of vascular cell adhesion
   molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in vascular endothelium, or recruitment of T cells
   to the mucosa, indicating that the memory T-cell response to virus
   challenge was the same in intact and B-cell KO mice.}},

Abstract = {{Tn a consecutive series of 498 patients with 528 fractures of the femur
   treated by conventional interlocking intramedullary nailing, 14
   fractures of the femoral neck (2.7\%) occurred in 13 patients. The
   fracture of the hip was not apparent either before operation or on the
   immediate postoperative radiographs. It was diagnosed in the first two
   weeks after operation in three patients and after three months in the
   remainder.
   Age over 60 years at the time of the femoral fracture and female gender
   were significantly predictive of hip fracture on bivariate logistic
   regression analysis, but on multivariate analysis only the location of
   the original fracture in the proximal third of the femur (p = 0,0022,
   odds ratio = 6,96, 95\% CI 2.01 to 24,14), low-energy transfer (p =
   0,0264, odds ratio = 15,56, 95\% CI 1.38 to 75.48) and the severity of
   osteopenia on radiographs (p = 0,0128, odds ratio = 7,55, 95\% CI 1.54
   to 37.07) were significant independent predictors of later fracture.
   Five of the 19 women aged over 60 years, who sustained an osteoporotic
   proximal diaphyseal fracture of the femur during a simple fall,
   subsequently developed a fracture of the neck.
   Eleven of the hip fractures were displaced and intracapsular and, in
   view of the advanced age of most of these patients, were usually treated
   by replacement arthroplasty, Reduction and internal fixation was used to
   treat the remaining three intertrochanteric fractures. Three patients
   developed complications requiring further surgery; five died within two
   years of their fracture.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To study working memory function in untreated major
   depression using a digit probe identification and matching task.
   Methods: We compared behavioural performance and event-related
   potentials during processing of the Sternberg working memory task in 14
   depressed patients and 13 healthy matched control subjects.
   Results: patients made more mistakes than controls as the memory load
   was increased from one to 5 digits and had significantly slower reaction
   times at all levels of memory load. The patients' event-related
   potentials (ERPs) differed significantly from controls. pathological
   changes were similar for auditory and visual presentation. Surface
   negative activity in the 157-210 ms section of the waveform was reduced
   for all levels of memory load, suggesting abnormal sensory/perceptual
   processing in the modality-specific association cortices, possibly due
   to a failure of selective attention mechanisms. In the 375-840 ms epoch,
   the patients' responses showed large amplitude sustained negative
   activity, maximal at CZ and a reduced late positive wave. The large
   prolonged negativity in the patients' ERPs suggests activation of
   additional neuronal assemblies than those normally participating in the
   task. This could reflect either compensatory mechanism or dysfunction of
   inhibitory systems. These changes were sensitive to memory load,
   suggesting that they reflect alterations of memory-related processes.
   Conclusions: This study provides objective evidence that major
   depression significantly affects working memory. The ERP changes in
   depression could he accounted for by dysfunction of the central
   executive control of working memory. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland

Abstract = {{Purpose: Many behavior modification and intervention programs are based
   on operant procedures developed for animal subjects, but few use
   modeling procedures in which one student observes interactions between
   two proficient trainers. We show how such procedures, which successfully
   trained Grey parrots (Psittacus erithacus) to produce and comprehend
   elements of human language, can be adapted for use with children with
   three types of disabilities: (a) autism with limited social and language
   skills, (b) developmental delay with physical handicaps and lack of
   language skills, and (c) hyperactivity with impaired cognitive and
   social skills.
   Summary: Children were evaluated before entering the program and
   outcomes were recorded to determine improvement levels. No child reached
   totally normative (physical age-appropriate) levels, but all
   significantly improved their social and communication skills and use of
   contextually appropriate behavior.
   Conclusions: A two-trainer modeling system can be a valuable
   intervention tool for children whose disabilities involve social and

Title = {{Immobilization of lipid vesicles on polymer support via an amphiphilic

Abstract = {{To immobilize lipid vesicles on a polymer support, we have used a
   peptidic anchor with the following sequence:
   Ala-Ala-Leu-Leu-Leu-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-
   Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Trp-Lys-Lys-Lys-Lys-Lys-Lys. This amphiphilic
   peptide was previously de signed in our group to interact spontaneously
   and strongly with vesicles without perturbing their permeability. At the
   end of the solid-phase peptide synthesis, the peptide was left on the
   polymer beads and this novel polymer-peptide system was used for vesicle
   immobilization. It was shown that this polymer-peptide system could
   immobilize as much as 200 mu mol of lipids per gram of dry resin. The
   amount of immobilized vesicles was decreased by a reduction of the
   proportion of the negatively charged lipids in the vesicles, indicating
   the importance of electrostatic interactions in the immobilization of
   the vesicles. The integrity of the vesicles was mostly preserved after
   the immobilization. This new polymer-peptide system was used easily and
   successfully to immobilize a membrane-bound enzyme, gamma-glutamyl
   transpeptidase. The activity of the membrane-bound enzyme was studied by
   monitoring the release of p-nitroaniline. The activity of the enzyme was
   still retained, even after being re-used eight times, indicating the
   strong immobilization of the enzyme in its active form. The
   polymer-peptide support could be regenerated by washing with ethanol and
   reused.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines reciprocal relations among Wolof small farmers in
   Senegal after the emergence of rural weekly markets (loumas) and the
   implementation of neoliberal policies in the 1980s. Contrary to the
   notion that markets are a force of social dissolution, new trading
   practices and free market: policies have not weakened community
   relations among small farmer neighbours and kin. Rather, the spatial and
   temporal patterning of loumas has served to strengthen intra-community
   bonds. Farmers have, since the formation of loumas, limited their travel
   beyond their home zones. While at loumas they interact avidly with
   extralocal merchants, they have not allowed outsiders to settle
   permanently in local villages. Furthermore, because loumas occur only
   once a week, farmers continue to benefit from daily, multiplex
   interactions with one another. After analysing the spatial and temporal
   organisation of loumas, this article looks at specific examples of small
   farmers augmenting their economic security during a period of economic
   restructuration by innovating new modes of reciprocal exchange with one
   another.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: to examine the influence of low-intensity, habitual physical
   activity on blood lipids and lipoproteins and other cardiovascular risk
   factors in older adults living at home.
   Design: cross-sectional observational study.
   Participants: a convenience sample of healthy, older adults (n = 155)
   who were mainly non-Hispanic, white (96.8\%), female (65.2\%) and on
   medications for cardiometabolic-related disorders (60.6\%) and had an
   average age of 74.2 +/- 0.5 years.
   Methods: we used a question from the Yale Physical Activity Survey to
   assess the typical number of hours per day spent in motion during the
   past month, collapsing responses into <5 and <greater than or equal to>5
   h/day. We determined blood lipids, Lipoproteins and glucose with Kodak
   Ektachem serum oxidase assays or finger stick using the Cholestech LDX
   system enzymatic technique, and measured blood pressure by auscultation.
   Waist circumference was the indicator of abdominal fat distribution and
   body mass index the measure of overall adiposity.
   Results: after adjusting for age, sex, adiposity, postprandial state,
   medication use and method of blood sampling, greater amounts of daily
   accumulated movement were associated with more favourable blood
   lipid-lipoprotein profiles. Subjects reporting greater than or equal to5
   h of daily movement had higher levels of high-density lipoprotein
   cholesterol {[}mean difference (95\% confidence interval): 0.23 mmol/l
   (0.07, 0.39); P = 0.002] and a lower ratio of total to high-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol {[}average difference: -0.92 (-1.36, -0.48); P =
   0.003]. They had lower levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol
   {[}mean difference: -0.39 mmol/l (-0.80, 0.03); P = 0.074)] and a lower
   ratio of triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol {[}mean
   difference: -1.31 (-2.50, -0.12); P = 0.059]. Total cholesterol was
   similar in the two groups (P > 0.05). The mean blood glucose was 1.49
   mmol/l lower (-2.67, -0.31) in the more active group (P = 0.02),
   independent of age, sex, adiposity medication use and postprandial
   state.
   Conclusions: low-intensity, habitual physical activity is a sufficient
   stimulus to enhance blood lipids/lipoproteins and glucose in older
   adults, independent of abdominal and overall adiposity.}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{810-819}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate 12 x-ray image intensifier (XRII) digital spot
   systems.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four objective tests were performed to assess
   XRII digital spots: entrance exposure, patient exposure, soft-copy gray
   scale, and pixel noise. Two additional tests were performed to assess
   high-contrast limiting resolution and threshold contrast detection.
   RESULTS: Digital spot XRII entrance exposures averaged 1 x 10(-7) C/kg
   (0.38 mR) for units with large fields of view (FOVs); mean entrance
   exposure in a medium-sized patient was 1.25 x 10(-5) C/kg (48 mR).
   Luminance measurements of the table-side monitors provided a mean of 473
   just-noticeable differences in gray scale with the room lights off. Mean
   resolution with a bar test pattern was measured as 1.5 line pairs per
   millimeter for systems with a 40-cm FOV. Measured pixel noise (in
   relative units) was 6-25. Mean threshold contrast with the lights off
   was 0.85\%.
   CONCLUSION: Once input exposure is normalized for FOV and image matrix
   size, soft-copy assessment of limiting resolution with either
   low-contrast detection or, preferably, an off-line noise metric (pixel
   SD) provides objective measurements of digital spot image quality. With
   the lights on, 10 systems with room-light sensors had an 11\% loss of
   gray scale. For systems without sensors, the loss was 33\%.}},

Abstract = {{1) The oxygen consumption increases during Bufo bufo development in
   accordance with the two steps which border at the ``heart beat{''} stage
   2) Cytochrome c oxidase activity is not proportional to the oxygen
   consumption: it is notable and constant in the first step, and it only
   increases in the second 3) In the mitochondria of preneural embryos,
   citrate synthase, NADP(+) dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, and
   succinate dehydrogenase activities are very low in respect to malate
   dehydrogenase and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase activities. The
   Krebs cycle results lowered at the condensing reaction level with acetyl
   accumulation when pyruvate is available. The same behavior has been
   observed in the Xenopus laevis oocytes and differentiated tissues. 4)
   The presence of a phosphagen system which is different from creatine
   phosphate and arginine phosphate, supporting ATP level, has been
   demonstrated in B. bufo embryos. 5) Mitochondria of portneural embryos
   are able to accomplish a complete Krebs cycle by increasing citrate
   synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase activities. 6) In all B. bufo
   development malate dehydrogenase and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase
   constitute a multienzymatic system by which the mitochondria accomplish
   a decarboxylic amino acid shunt required for the transformation of
   deutoplasm into protoplasm. This shunt is also operative in the X.
   laevis oocytes. 7) Through pyruvate production, by oxidative
   decarboxylation of malate, the NAD(P)(+) dependent malic enzyme could
   carry out a fundamental anaplerotic function in the mitochondria which
   is specialized in the production of biosynthetic blocks belonging to the
   embryo in which the carbohydrates metabolism rather than the glycolytic
   activity is designed for pentose phosphate and glycerol phosphate
   synthesis for protein and cytomembrane production. 8) Consistent
   metabolic differences have been highlighted between B. bufo embryos and
   X. laevis embryos.}},

Abstract = {{Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown origin,
   characterized in affected organs by an accumulation of activated T
   lymphocytes and macrophages. Musculoskeletal manifestations of
   sarcoidosis include acute and chronic arthritis and muscular and osseous
   sarcoidosis. In certain populations, acute sarcoidosis often presents
   with constitutional symptoms, polyarthritis and erythema nodosum
   (Lofgren's syndrome). Erythema nodosum, often with joint symptoms, also
   occurs in association with several other conditions including
   infections, medications and other underlying diseases. The diagnosis of
   sarcoidosis should be based on a tissue biopsy, but a patient with
   typical Lofgren's syndrome may not require biopsy proof. Among the long
   list of biochemical markers that have been suggested as aids for
   diagnosis and monitoring of sarcoidosis, calcium in serum and urine and
   angiotensin-converting enzyme in serum are well-established clinical
   tools. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme can be used for monitoring
   disease activity in the individual patient, but because of lack of
   sensitivity and specificity its diagnostic value is rather low.
   Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents usually effectively alleviate
   acute sarcoid arthritis and joint symptoms associated with erythema
   nodosum. In severe acute arthritis and in chronic arthritis,
   corticosteroids may be required to control the symptoms. In patients
   requiring persistent corticosteroid therapy, antimalarial agents and
   methotrexate constitute therapeutic alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{The third edition of the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur.; effective from
   January, 1(st), 1997) slates that biological indicators are to be stored
   at specified temperature and that an expiry date has to be set. In
   addition to that, biological indicators shall have a specified spore
   population with a certain resistance (D-value(1))) against the
   sterilising agent. For steam sterilisation, spores of Bacillus
   stearothermophilus (e.g. ATTC 7953) are recommended. The number of
   viable spores/indicator shall exceed 5 x 10(5) and the D-value of these
   spores at T = 121 degrees C shall exceed 1.5 min. The use of biological
   indicators for routine monitoring of sterilisation is mainly justified
   for sterilisation with gases, but in case of steam sterilisation it is
   also recommended in certain cases. To test deteriorating effects of
   prolonged storage times on spores of biological indicators, indicators
   for monitoring irradiation sterilisation are suited best as only one
   parameter (adsorbed dose (kGy) which can easily be determined by using
   dosemeters) has to be monitored. But also indicators for steam
   sterilisation with two relevant parameters (time and temperature, which
   can easily be monitored by physical/technical means) can be used to
   investigate storage conditions.
   In the present investigation it could be demonstrated that storage of
   biological indicators up to 2 years longer than the stated expiry date
   does neither affect the viability of the indicator spores nor their
   resistance against the sterilising agent: In cases like that it could be
   helpful if the European Pharmacopoeia like the US Pharmacopoeia could
   describe ranges in which the certified parameters are to be determined.

   substrates with complex shapes. All layers analysed are very smooth and
   exhibit a quasi-amorphous fracture surface. XRD and TEM analysis
   indicate a nanocrystalline structure with grain sizes in the order of 2

Abstract = {{In Mexico, bioassays for water toxicity testing can be useful tools for
   water quality control programs and environmental risk evaluation.
   However, since many bioassays have not been standardized, their
   application and acceptance in pollution monitoring and control sectors
   are limited. In an effort to overcome this limitation, the Mexican
   Institute of Water Technology (MIWT) agreed to participate in an
   international laboratory network (WaterTox), sponsored by the
   International Development Research Centre (IDRC). The Centre seeks to
   evaluate the analytical repeatability and reproducibility of six
   bioassays (Allium, Hydra, Daphnia magna, and Panagrellus assays; lettuce
   seed germination and Fluctuation tests) and to determine their
   sensitivity patterns and the manner in which they are complementary or
   redundant in a core test battery. In addition, the Mexican team added
   the Vibrio fischeri Microtox toxicity test to the evaluation. A series
   of 24 blind samples were analyzed over a 1-year period. Results
   indicated that precision, or repeatability, was acceptable for most
   bioassays. For blind sample replicates, the overall coefficient of
   variation was less than 22\%, except for the Muta-ChromoPlate test
   (60\%) and the nematode assay (greater than 100\%). While most toxic
   samples were detected by D. magna and Hydra attenuata assays, those that
   produced little effect on these two organisms affected lettuce and onion
   root elongation. The complementary nature of these tests provides a wide
   spectrum of toxicant detection, in contrast to the Microtox test which
   showed a more limited and redundant sensitivity pattern when compared
   against a battery comprised of the four inexpensive bioassays. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The hypersonic flow pattern around meteoroids with cavities and grooves

   For steady-state hypersonic flows, the dependence of the distribution of
   aerothermodynamic parameters over the meteoroid surface on the shape and
   depth of the cavity and its slope to the oncoming stream has been
   determined. The stream parameters (Mach and Reynolds numbers) and the
   geometry of the cavity are shown to affect the overall and discrete
   levels of pressure oscillations near the surface. We also explained the
   relation between gas pressure oscillations inside cavities and grooves
   and their gas-dynamic heating. The results presented in this paper may
   introduce refinements in the theory of motion, heating, and disruption

Abstract = {{It is widly accepted that Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) is the
   main test to distinguish benign from malignant thyroid lesions.
   Nevertheless, this technique presents some limits such as the
   possibility of false-negative or inadequate samples and it is unable to
   cytologically discriminate among adenomathosus goiter, follicular
   adenoma and well-differentiated follicular carcinoma. The aim of this
   study was to evaluate the possibility of restricting these limitations
   using Core Needle biopsy (CN) technique. Therefore we selected for CN,
   40 out of 136 patients who underwent FNAB during a one year period;
   among these patients only 32 agreed a to this technique. Forty-two out
   of 136 patients underwent surgery; 29 of them were subjected to both
   biopsies. Sixteen of the diagnostic microbiopsies have been
   histologically confirmed. We had no discordant cases between cytological
   and microhistological diagnosis, except for one case which appeared
   cytologically colloid goiter, microhistologically follicular neoplasm
   and histologically follicular adenoma. In. this case it was not possible
   to microhistologically discriminate benign from malign follicular
   lesion. In our experience not all patients accepted CN biopsy as well as
   FNAB and, moreover this technique showed no advantage over FNAB
   diagnosis On this base we think that actually FNAB should be the main
   procedure in the diagnosis of the thyroid lesions. It is easily
   performed accepted by the patients and has a low cost-benefit ratio. If
   the sample is not diagnostic it can be easily repeated and
   false-negative cases could be discovered thanks to an adequate clinical
   and ultrasonographical follow-up of the patients.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. To assess the incidence and timing of cardiac rupture following
   streptokinase (SK) administration in acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
   Methods. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical sheets of AMI patients
   treated at the Coronary Care Unit in University Hospital Split, Croatia,
   between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 1998. We selected the patients
   who died following SK administration (1.5 million U in a 30 min iv.
   infusion), with a discharge diagnosis of ``AMI{''} and ``cardiac
   tamponade - ventricular rupture{''}. AMI was defined by typical chest
   pain, EGG, and/or en zymatic changes. Echo or autopsy verified diagnosis
   of cardiac tamponade and/or rupture, as well as pericardial effusion
   and/or free-wall rupture.
   Results. Out of 726 AMI patients 136 (18.7\%) were treated with SK, and
   6 had cardiac rupture (4 men and 2 women; 4.4\%). Autopsy revealed that
   1 patient had ischemic and 2 had transmural hemorrhagic AMI. Three out
   of 6 patients died 2-4, and 3 died 5-7 hours after SK administration.
   Six patients who died from cardiac rupture (mean age 72.3+/-9.0) were
   significantly older than AMI survivors treated with SK (121 patients,
   mean age 60.5+/-12.0 years, p<0.001).
   Conclusion. In case of unexplained clinical deterioration in AMI
   patients over 70 during the first hours after SK administration, cardiac
   tamponade due to a free-wall rupture should be suspected. SK
   administration in patients with AMI over 70 years should be a selective
   and not a routine treatment.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the rule of external and internal factors in stimulation of
   processes of stress cracking of pipelines. We identify the number of
   successive stages that cause fracture of pipelines. We experimentally
   established that passivation of a pipe steel in electrolyte under the
   coating and formation of a passive film consisting of oxides and iron
   carbonates is the main stage of corrosion cracking. Under the action of
   activating factors, the breakdown of a passive film occurs and local
   sites of corrosion appear. This stage is determined by the composition
   of the electrolyte under the insulated coating, the state of the surface
   of the metal, and its nature. Then pittings are transformed into
   microcracks in the field of tensile stresses. At the final stage,
   microcracks form colonies, which join together into the main crack. We
   established the similarity of cracks formed in actual gas pipelines and
   cracks initiated under laboratory conditions. We investigate the
   corrosion-electrochemical behavior of 09G2BT steel in NaHCO3 solutions
   of various concentrations. We established that a decrease in the
   concentration of a solution leads to an increase in the density and
   depth of pittings. We draw a conclusion about the probabilistic
   character of initiation of pittings on the surface of steel, which is
   described by the Poisson law. We propose to use the density of pittings
   and the current in a single pitting for the early diagnostics of
   fracture of pipelines.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of the channel access protocol is a main factor when
   designing and evaluating the overall performance of a multimedia and
   multihop radio network. A search in the current open literature shows
   almost no results or investigation on this subject. The purpose of this
   research is to design and evaluate several candidates for the channel
   access protocol. The main objective is to find one, or more, protocol
   that can meet or exceed the performance requirements for all informed
   voice service to be provided by a hand-held mobile multimedia terminal
   (MMT) in a multihop network. Extensive simulation models of MMT have
   been developed using both asynchronous and synchronous protocol modes,
   The first one accesses the channel using a suitable random policy. The
   second one reserves time slots or periods in a fashion similar to
   conventional time division multiple access (TDMA) techniques. Within
   each mode there are several options involving various levels of
   implementation complexity. Based on the simulation results, the
   following recommendations and conclusions are made: (i) use an
   asynchronous policy that meets the requirements for all informed voice.
   At least one of the options studied and simulated meets those
   requirements; (ii) design a convenient mechanism to reserve channel
   capacity to ensure promised quality of service. This is particularly
   important for restricting the channel use for data streams on those
   nodes which are also handling voice packet streams; (iii) design
   practical methods to estimate channel capacity; (iv) the level of
   complexity for implementing any synchronous mode protocol greatly
   outweighs any potential network performance gain. No performance gain
   was observed with the synchronous mode procedure implemented in this
   research work; (v) refine the model to closely match the current design
   specification for the MMT system at the link layer level. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The vascularization of the cerebrum (cerebral cortex and basal ganglia)
   in the common tree shrew (Tupaia glis) has been studied in detail using
   vinyl injection and vascular corrosion cast/SEM techniques, It is found
   that the arterial supply of the cerebral cortex are from cortical
   branches of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and of the anterior
   cerebral artery (ACA). These arteries are in turn branches of the
   internal carotid artery (ICA), In addition, the cerebral cortex receives
   the blood from the cortical branches of the posterior cerebral artery
   (PCA) that originates from the basilar artery (BA). These cortical
   arteries gives rise to rectilinear orientated intracortical arteries
   that are divided into dense capillary networks to supply the cerebral
   cortex. The capillary networks drain the blood into intracortical veins
   and then into the tributaries of major superficial cerebral veins. The
   basal ganglia (caudate and lentiform nuclei) are supplied by central or
   perforating branches of the ACA and MCA. These central or medullary
   arteries give rise to arterioles that ramify into dense capillary
   plexuses. The venous blood from both nuclei drains into venules and
   finally into the tributaries of internal cerebral veins. It is obvious
   that on the ventral aspect, the diameter of the lateral striate artery
   (LSA) and of the penetrating arterioles from the MCA are much smaller
   than that of the MCA. These arterioles have few side branches while the
   peripheral branches of the superficial cerebral arteries exhibit several
   series of branches that are gradually reduced in diameter before
   branching into intracortical arteries. This could be one of the reasons
   why the rupture of cerebral arteries in man mostly occurs in the those
   originating from the ventral surface rather than from the dorsolateral
   surface. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) plays a key role in gut inflammation.
   NF-kappaB up-regulates proinflammatory genes encoding cytokines,
   adhesion molecules, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). However,
   NF-kappaB has also been shown to up-regulate protective or
   anti-apoptotic factors. We utilized an adenoviral vector carrying a
   super-repressor form of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB, I kappaB, to examine
   the effects of NF-kappaB inhibition on cytokine-induced nitric oxide
   production and apoptosis in rat small intestinal epithelial cells
   (IEC-6). Chemical inhibitors of NF-kappaB, including pyrrolidine
   dithiocarbamate (PDTC), tosyl-lysine-chloromethylketone (TLCK),
   genistein, and N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal (n-LLnL) were also utilized.
   Treatment of AdI kappaB-transfected cells with cytomix {[}1000 U/mL
   IFN-gamma, 1 nM IL-1 beta, and 10 ng/mL tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF
   alpha)] or TNF alpha -containing cytokine combinations resulted in
   inhibition of cytokine-induced nitrite production and a marked increase
   in apoptosis compared to control cells. Apoptosis occurred independently
   of nitric oxide (NO) production since exogenous sources of NO did not
   inhibit apoptosis. Inducible NOS and cIAP were dawn-regulated in AdI
   kappaB-transfected cells treated with cytomix. TLCK and LLnL treatment
   also induced apoptosis in cytomix-treated cells, while PDTC and
   genistein did not. Thus, although NF-kappaB up-regulates various
   pro-inflammatory genes, it may also have protective or anti-apoptotic
   effects in enterocytes. NF-kappaB appears necessary for upregulating
   cIAP in IEC-6 cells upon cytokine exposure.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The oriJ-based plasmids contain the origin of DNA replication from the
   cryptic Rac prophage, present in the chromosomes of most Escherichia
   coli K-12 strains. The organization of the oriJ replication region
   resembles that of the bacteriophage lambda, although sequence similarity
   is small. Here we investigated the regulation of replication of the
   oriJ-based plasmid in E. coli relA(+) and relA(-) hosts during amino
   acid starvation and limitation. i.e., during the stringent and relaxed
   responses. We found that, contrary to plasmids derived from phage
   lambda, replication of the oriJ-based plasmid proceeds efficiently
   during both stringent and relaxed responses. On the other hand, density
   shift experiments and measurement of the stability of a putative
   replication initiator protein (thr lambda O protein homologue) suggest
   that this replication may be carried out by the heritable replication
   complex, as previously demonstrated for lambda plasmids. We demonstrate
   that contrary to bacteriophage lambda p(R) promoter, an analogous
   promoter from the oriJ region is activated rather than inhibited at
   increased ppGpp levels. We propose that various responses of these
   promoters (p(R) and p(R).(R,JC), which are necessary for transcriptional
   activation of ori lambda and perhaps oriJ, respectively) to ppGpp are
   responsible for differences in the replication regulation between ori
   lambda- and oriJ-based plasmids during the stringent response. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Unemployment is a major problem in urban centres in sub-Saharan Africa.
   The impact of policies associated with structural adjustment programmes
   has frequently meant major formal job losses in both the public and
   private sectors. Although it is widely recognized that there has been a
   major (further) shift into the informal sector, it is also often claimed
   that `unemployment' rates have greatly increased. When it is also
   assumed that net rural-urban migration has continued at a rapid pace,
   this is believed to be a significant contributor to the rise in
   unemployment. However, because `unemployment' and `under-employment' are
   hard to measure and to keep discrete when studying urban Africa, it is
   apparent that there is much confusion over current levels and trends in
   unemployment. This article discusses the problems of analysing African
   urban unemployment, drawing in particular on a recent ILO report, and
   presents evidence from long-term research on migrants in Harare which
   casts doubt on the extent to which net in-migration is a major factor
   contributing to unemployment in contemporary, economically adjusting
   sub-Saharan Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence has implicated complement in renal transplant injury and
   identified the kidney as a source of complement components. We therefore
   investigated the local gene expression of complement component C3,
   pivotal to complement activation pathways and a mediator of inflammatory
   injury, in a rat renal transplant model. By reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, the expression of C3 mRNA
   increased in two phases. The first phase coincided with post-ischemic
   injury over 2 days posttransplantation and was localized by irt situ
   hybridization to vessels and glomerular mesangial cells in allogeneic
   and syngeneic (control) kidney transplants. In allografts only, a second
   phase was found in tubular epithelial cells, glomerular parietal cells,
   vessel walls and some infiltrating cells, which peaked on day 4 together
   with rapid influx of leukocytes, tubule cell damage, the induction of
   interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma mRNA, and the up-regulation of tumor
   necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta mRNA in the graft, In vitro
   studies showed that interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma up-regulate C3
   production in renal tubule cells, We conclude that post-ischemic injury
   led to transient up-regulation of glomerular expression of C3 mRNA.
   Subsequent cellular rejection was associated with
   tubulointerstitial/glomerular parietal cell expression of C3 mRNA, This
   differential expression of local C3, immediately post-transplant or
   associated with acute rejection, may have implications for putative
   therapeutic complement inhibition in clinical transplantation.}},

   outdoors in containers under three levels of mater availability
   (irrigated at -20, -80, and -200 kPa) to investigate the effects of soil
   water availability on combined soil/root (rhizosphere) respiration
   rates, and developmental morphology of root systems. Rhizosphere
   respiration was measured with a portable infrared gas analyzer, and root
   biomass was estimated by electrical capacitance. These nondestructive
   measurements were compared with final root dry weights of harvested
   trees, to determine their reliability for estimating relative
   differences in root biomass, Water stress reduced final biomass
   similarly for both rootstocks, but the relative reduction in shoot
   growth was greater for MM.111. Root to shoot ratios were higher and
   average specific root respiration was lower for M.9 rootstock compared
   with MM.111. M.9 appeared to be more tolerant of water stress then
   MM.111, due to reduced canopy transpiration relative to root system
   mass. Water stress increased root to shoot ratios, specific root length,
   and the carbohydrate costs of root maintenance as indicated by specific
   respiration rates. Root dry weight (DW) was better correlated to
   rhizosphere respiration than to root electric capacitance. The observed
   r(2) values between root capacitance and root DW were as high as 0.73,
   hut capacitance measurements were also influenced by soil water content

Abstract = {{Focal hand dystonia in musicians is a strongly task-related movement
   disorder. Typically, symptoms become apparent only when players execute
   specific overpracticed skilled exercises on their instrument. We
   therefore examined five guitarists with functional MRI during dystonic
   symptom provocation by means of an adapted guitar inside the magnet. The
   activation patterns obtained in comparable nondystonic guitarists and in
   the study patients when performing normal-hand exercise served as
   references. A 1.5-T system equipped with echo-speed gradients and
   single-shot echoplanar imaging software was used. Data acquisition was
   centered on the cortical motor system encompassed in eight contiguous
   slices. Dystonic musicians compared with both control situations showed
   a significantly larger activation of the contralateral primary
   sensorimotor cortex that contrasted with a conspicuous bilateral
   underactivation of premotor areas. Our results coincide with studies of
   other dystonia types in that they show an abnormal recruitment of
   cortical areas involved in the control of voluntary movement. However,
   they do suggest that the primary sensorimotor cortex, rather than being
   underactive in idiopathic dystonic patients, may be overactive when
   tested during full expression of the task-induced movement disorder. (C)

Abstract = {{Uni-rhinal olfactory acuity in schizophrenia was investigated in two
   experiments. The first assessed the presence of a predicted atypical
   asymmetry of nostril laterality and the second assessed the effect of
   antipsychotic treatment on the asymmetry. Although olfactory
   identification impairment has been well documented in schizophrenia,
   olfactory acuity has been neglected. This may be an oversight as
   cerebral structures of the mesial temporal lobe important to olfactory
   perception have often been implicated in the pathophysiology of
   schizophrenia and it is thus reasonable to postulate a primary
   impairment of olfactory acuity in schizophrenia. In addition,
   unmedicated patients with schizophrenia have exhibited asymmetrical
   laterality favouring the right over the left hemisphere in studies of
   visual, haptic, and auditory perception, and the few published
   prospective treatment studies have suggested a reversal of this
   asymmetry with first generation neuroleptic treatments. In experiment 1
   a generalization of the perceptual asymmetry to olfactory acuity was
   examined by measurement of n-butanol olfactory thresholds with the
   Connecticut Chemosensory Perception Exam (CCPE) in an unmedicated sample
   of 17 patients with schizophrenia and 17 age, gender, and handedness
   matched normal controls. The patient sample showed an asymmetrical
   impairment of the left nostril that was not apparent in the normal
   control sample. In experiment 2, the CCPE was administered to a new
   sample of 10 patients with schizophrenia before and after neuroleptic
   treatment. The asymmetry observed in experiment 1 was replicated, and
   the relative advantage of the right nostril shifted to a relative
   advantage of the left nostril over the course of 8 weeks of treatment.
   Results are discussed in relation to cerebral aspects of schizophrenia
   and potential implications to cognitive change from treatment. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The structure of the endozepine-like peptide (ELP) gene is closely
   related to the intracellular acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP), but unlike
   the generalized distribution of the latter, it is restricted to the male
   germ cells of the testis. In the present study a combination of
   nonradioactive in situ mRNA hybridization and immunohistochemistry was
   used to precisely determine the cellular expression patterns of ELP mRNA
   and protein in control and methoxyacetic acid (MAA)-treated rat testes.
   ELP transcripts are first detectable in late stages (step 6) of round
   spermatids, with transcription increasing through late-elongating steps.
   Translation of the ELP mRNA is delayed, with first immunohistochemical
   staining occurring in elongated spermatids at step 16, and protein
   accumulating through step 19. ELP immunoreactivity proves to be an
   excellent marker for late spermatid stages and highlights the presumably
   clonal recovery of spermatids following MAA treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid pace of development in both Internet applications and emerging
   optical technologies is bringing about fundamental changes in networking
   philosophies. Key trends are the emergence of dynamic wavelength
   provisioning and a corresponding reduction in wavelength provisioning
   timescales. As this transition continues, the current use of the
   wavelength-routing paradigm for carrying bursty Internet traffic will
   likely suffer from various shortcomings associated with circuit-switched
   networks. Meanwhile, optical packet switching technology is still facing
   significant cost and technological hurdles. Recently, optical burst
   switching, or OBS, which represents a balance between circuit and packet
   switching, has opened up some exciting new dimensions in optical
   networking. This article describes the OBS paradigm, and also proposes
   the use of labeled OBS, or LOBS, as a natural control and provisioning
   solution under the ubiquitous IP multiprotocol label switching
   framework.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES To validate the accuracy of real-time three-dimensional
   echocardiography (RT3DE) for quantifying aneurysmal left ventricular
   (LV) volumes.
   BACKGROUNDS Conventional two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) has
   limitations when applied for quantification of LV volumes in patients
   with LV aneurysms.
   METHODS Seven aneurysmal balloons, IS sheep (5 with chronic LV aneurysms
   and 10 without LV aneurysms) during 60 different hemodynamic conditions
   and 29 patients (13 with chronic LV aneurysms and 16 with normal LV)
   underwent RT3DE and 2DE. Electromagnetic flow meters and magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) served as reference standards in the animals and
   in the patients, respectively. Rotated apical six-plane method with
   multiplanar Simpson's rule and apical biplane Simpson's rule were used
   to determine LV volumes by RT3DE and 2DE, respectively.
   RESULTS Both RT3DE and 2DE correlated well with actual volumes for
   aneurysmal balloons. However, a significantly smaller mean difference
   (MD) was found between RT3DE and actual volumes (-7 ml for RT3DE vs. 22
   ml for 2DE, p = 0.0002). Excellent correlation and agreement between
   RT3DE and electromagnetic flow meters for LV stroke volumes for animals
   with aneurysms were observed, while 2DE showed lesser correlation and
   agreement (r = 0.97, MD = -1.0 ml vs. r = 0.76, MD = 4.4 ml). In
   patients with LV aneurysms, better correlation and agreement between
   RT3DE and MRI for LV volumes were obtained (r = 0.99, MD = -28 ml) than
   between 2DE and MRI (r = 0.91, MD = -49 ml).
   CONCLUSIONS For geometrically asymmetric LVs associated with ventricular
   aneurysms, RT3DE can accurately quantify LV volumes. (C) 2000 by the

Abstract = {{The performance of four commercially available ICPMS instruments of
   three different types was compared by means of uranium ``isotopic
   measurements{''}. Examined were two quadrupole sector (different
   generation, different manufacturer), one single detector double focusing
   magnetic sector and one multiple collector double focusing magnetic
   sector instruments. The same samples of the IRMM-072 series were used
   under routine conditions to measure the U-233/U-235 and the U-233/U-238
   ratios which, in these samples, vary over almost three orders of
   magnitude from similar to 1 to similar to 2 (.) 10(-3). Within expanded
   (k = 2) uncertainties, good agreement was observed between the certified
   values and the data internally corrected for mass-discrimination
   effects. The magnitude of the evaluated uncertainties was different for
   each type of instrument. With the multiple collector instrument,
   expanded uncertainties varied from +/- 0.04\% to+/- 0.24\% for the
   U-233/U-235 ratio, and from +/- 0.08\% to +/- 0.27\% for the U-233/U-238
   ratio. They were similar to 1 to 5 times larger with the single detector
   magnetic sector instrument, and similar to 10 to 25 times larger with
   both quadrupole sector instruments. With the multiple collector
   instrument, repeatability of the measurements seemed to be limited by
   the difficulty of correcting properly for instrumental background,
   whereas with the single detector magnetic sector instrument the counting
   statistics was the only limitation (on smallest ratios). Apparent
   mass-discrimination was clearly found to be larger but more reproducible
   (and hence easier to correct for) in the case of magnetic sector
   instruments than for both quadrupole: sector instruments. If space
   charge effects were the main source of mass-discrimination for all
   instruments, these results are in contradiction with the hypothesis of
   the size of mass-discrimination decreasing with the acceleration
   voltage. With the single detector magnetic sector instrument in
   particular (when operated by changing the ion energy only), our results
   pointed at more than only one major source of mass-discrimination with
   variable size depending on the ratios measured.}},

Abstract = {{The polyhedral model provides a single unified foundation for systolic

   investigate the problem of memory reuse when compiling Alpha (a
   functional language based on this model). Direct compilation would
   require unacceptably large memory (for example O(n(3)) for matrix
   multiplication). Researchers have previously addressed the problem of
   memory reuse, and the analysis that this entails for projective memory
   allocations. This paper addresses, for a given schedule, the choice of
   the projections so as to minimize the volume of the residual memory. We
   prove tight bounds on the number of linearly independent projection
   vectors. Our method is constructive, yielding an optimal memory
   allocation. We extend the method to modular functions, and deal with the
   subsequent problems of code generation. Our ideas are illustrated on a
   number of examples generated by the current version of the Alpha

   model provided a good description (r(2)=0.77) of the length-at-age
   relationship. The maximum calculated daily growth rate was 0.71 mm per
   day for 74-day-old fish. The average growth rate up to 160-days-old was
   0.64 mm per day. The back-calculated hatching-date distributions showed
   that spawning occurs from October to April. The average birthdate
   distributions correspond to the beginning of the productivity cycle and
   consequently the growth was not limited by feeding conditions during
   1995 and 1996. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Neuropsychological tests measured attention, concentration, learning,
   memory, executive function, and psychomotor speed. Other measures
   included Marin's Apathy Evaluation Scale, the Adherence Determinants
   Questionnaire, CD4 cell count, and HIV RNA viral load. Apathy was
   consistently related to depression and unrelated to neuropsychological
   impairment. Patient expectancies regarding medication adherence were
   unrelated to apathy when the analysis was controlled for depressive

Abstract = {{Landscapes are shaped by complex relationships between human population,
   social structure, and environmental conditions. Traditionally, these
   factors have been studied separately within their respective
   disciplines. Few studies explore the relationship between indicators of
   social structure and ecological factors. Our objective was to examine
   the relationship between housing density, as recorded in the U.S. Census
   data, and a satellite land-cover classification in the northwest
   Wisconsin Pine Barrens region. We used a geographical information system
   (GIS) to integrate these two data sets. Our results revealed strong
   patterns. For example, housing densities were higher where water is more
   abundant, a possible case where land cover influences housing density.
   In other cases, housing density appears to influence land cover. These
   complex relationships are discussed. Our approach represents an initial
   methodology to integrate social and ecological data, a task needed to
   improve our understanding of rural societies and to facilitate
   broad-scale ecosystem management.}},

Abstract = {{We study similarity queries for time series data where similarity is
   defined, in a fairly general way, in terms of a distance function and a
   set of affine transformations on the Fourier series representation of a
   sequence. We identify a safe set of transformations supporting a wide
   variety of comparisons and show that this set is rich enough to
   formulate operations such as moving average and time scaling. We also
   show that queries expressed using safe transformations can efficiently
   be computed without prior knowledge of the transformations. We present a
   query processing algorithm that uses the underlying multidimensional
   index built over the data set to efficiently answer similarity queries.
   Our experiments show that the performance of this algorithm is
   competitive to that of processing ordinary (exact match) queries using
   the index, and much faster than sequential scanning. We propose a
   generalization of this algorithm for simultaneously handling multiple
   transformations at a time, and give experimental results on the
   performance of the generalized algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with an increased risk of
   medical complications during pregnancy. In sub-Saharan Africa, fetal and
   maternal mortality rates are particularly high. This study evaluated the
   effect of an active prenatal management program on pregnancy outcome in
   patients with SCD in an African setting. Pregnant women with SCD
   attending the National Teaching Hospital in Cotonou (The Republic of
   Benin, West Africa) were recruited before the 28th week of gestation.
   Management was based on providing information and education about SCD
   and improving nutritional status, malaria prevention, early detection of
   bacterial infections, and restricted use of blood transfusion, Maternal
   and fetal mortality rates and SCD-related morbidity were the principal
   variables assessed. One hundred and eight patients (42 SS and 66 SC)
   with 111 fetuses were included in the study, Thirteen fetal deaths (from
   9 SS and 4 SC mothers) were recorded and 2 deaths of SC mothers. The
   maternal mortality rate of 1.8\% was comparable with the overall
   maternal mortality rate for this maternity unit (1.2\%), Few SCD-related
   events were recorded. Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection was the
   major cause of morbidity, Sixty-three patients (19 SS and 44 SC)
   successfully completed their pregnancy (58.3\%) without requiring
   transfusion. Providing pregnant SCD patients with relevant medical care
   based on simple cost-effective approaches can have a positive impact on
   SCD-associated morbidity and mortality in an otherwise difficult setting

Abstract = {{Bench-scale and full-scale investigations of waste stabilization and
   volume reduction were conducted using spiked soil and ash wastes
   containing heavy metals such as Cd, Cr, Pb, Ni, and Hg. The waste
   streams were stabilized and solidified using chemically bonded phosphate
   ceramic (CBPC) binder, and then compacted by either uniaxial or harmonic
   press for volume reduction. The physical properties of the final waste
   forms were determined by measuring volume reduction, density, porosity,
   and compressive strength. The leachability of heavy metals in the final
   waste forms was determined by a toxicity characteristic leaching
   procedure (TCLP) test and a 90-day immersion test (ANS 16.1). The
   structural composition and nature of waste forms were determined by
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   respectively.
   CBPC binder and compaction can achieve 80-wt \% waste loading and
   39-47\% reduction in waste volume. Compressive strength of final waste
   forms ranged from 1500 to 2000 psi. TCLP testing of waste forms showed
   that all heavy metals except Hg passed the TCLP limits using the
   phosphate-based binder. When Na2S was added to the binder, the waste
   forms also passed TCLP limits for Hg. Long-term leachability resistance
   of the final waste forms was achieved for all metals in both soil and
   ash wastes, and the leachability index was similar to 14. XRD patterns
   of waste forms indicated vermiculite in the ash waste was chemically
   incorporated into the CBPC matrix. SEM showed that waste forms are
   layered when compacted by uniaxial press and are homogeneous when
   compacted by harmonic press.}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted during 1995-97 at Rahuri, to study the
   productivity and economics of soybean {[}Glycine max (L.) Merr.]-based
   cropping sequences under irrigated conditions. The total grain
   equivalent of soybean-chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) (65.92 q/ha) was
   significantly higher than the rest of sequences. Next in order was
   soybean-wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori \& Paol.) (50.60 q/ha)
   and lowest was in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.)wheat (41.61 q/ha).
   Optimum level of irrigation (at all critical growth stages) recorded the
   maximum grain-equivalent yield than suboptimum (elimination of 1
   irrigation from recommended CGS). The total consumptive use (CU) was
   maximum in soybean-wheat (55 cm), while water-use efficiency (WUE) was
   higher in soybean-chickpea (153 kg/ha-cm). The total CU and WUE were
   24\% higher and 20\% lower respectively in optimum as compared to
   suboptimum irrigation. The soybean-chickpea sequence gave significantly
   higher gross (Rs 59,274/ha) and net returns (Rs 46,530/ha) than rest of
   sequences, followed by soybean-wheat sequence. The per day productivity
   (Hs 270/day/ha) and returns per unit of water used (Rs 1,398/ha-cm) were
   maximum in soybean-chickpea (4.65) than other sequences studied. The
   optimum irrigation recorded significantly higher gross and net returns
   than suboptimum Irrigation. The returns per unit of water used were 15\%
   lower in optimum irrigation than suboptimum Irrigation (Rs 1,049/ha-cm).}},

Abstract = {{We examined the actions of different heme oxygenase (HO) inhibitors on
   the basal HO activity in the opossum internal anal sphincter (IAS),
   rectum, and liver tissues and the IAS smooth muscle relaxation in
   response to nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) nerve stimulation and
   different agonists. All the tissues examined were found to have
   significant levels of basal HO activity, Among different HO inhibitors,
   tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPP IX) was found to be most selective in
   inhibiting the HO activity in the IAS smooth muscle. Conversely, in the
   liver, all the HO inhibitors except SnPP IX caused significant
   inhibition of HO activity. Consistent with HO activity inhibition, the
   IAS smooth muscle relaxations caused by NANC nerve stimulation and
   vasoactive intestinal polypeptide also were inhibited by zinc
   protoporphyrin IX and SnPP IX. Zinc protoporphyrin IX also caused a
   significant attenuation of the IAS smooth muscle relaxation caused by
   isoproterenol. The IAS smooth muscle relaxation caused by nitric oxide
   was not significantly modified by any of the HO inhibitors. The data
   show the presence of HO activity in the IAS and other gastrointestinal
   tissues. The differential attenuation of HO activity by different HO
   inhibitors in the IAS smooth muscle and liver confirms the presence of
   different isozymes of HO in different tissues. Suppression of basal HO
   activity and the IAS smooth muscle relaxation induced by NANC nerve
   stimulation or VIP but not NO suggest that some of the stimuli that
   cause IAS smooth muscle relaxation may involve HO activity.}},

Abstract = {{Connatal bacterial pneumonia is common in neonates. Animal studies and
   initial clinical reports indicate that surfactant dysfunction is
   involved in the pathophysiology of severe neonatal pneumonia. Since
   respiratory distress syndrome and connatal pneumonia may be difficult to
   differentiate in the first hours of life, neonates with respiratory
   failure due to bacterial infections might receive surfactant. Under such
   conditions surfactant components might be catabolized by bacteria and
   promote bacterial growth. We therefore investigated the influence of
   three modified natural (Curosurf, Alveofact, and Survanta) and two
   synthetic (Exosurf and Pumactant) surfactant preparations on the growth
   of bacteria frequently cultured from blood or tracheal aspirate fluid in
   the first days of life. Group B streptococci (GBS), Staphyloccocus
   aureus, and Escherichia coli were incubated in a nutrient-free medium
   (normal saline) for 5 h at 37 degrees C, together,vith different
   surfactants at concentrations of 0, 1, 10, and 20 mg/ml, With the
   exception off. coli, incubation in saline alone led to a variable
   decrease in CFU, In the presence of Alveofact, Exosurf, and Pumactant
   the decline in bacterial numbers was less marked than in saline alone.
   Curosurf was bactericidal in a dose-dependent fashion for GBS and had a
   strong negative impact on the growth of a GBS subtype that lacked the
   polysaccharide capsule. In contrast, Survanta (10 and 20 mg/ml)
   significantly promoted the growth of E. coli, indicating that surfactant
   components may actually serve as nutrients. We conclude that bacterial
   growth in different surfactant preparations is influenced by microbial
   species and the composition and dose of the surfactant, Further studies
   are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms behind our findings and to
   evaluate the effects of surfactant on bacterial growth in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{In order to more fully elucidate the phylogenetic relationships of the
   lignicolous, pyrenomycetous genus Chaetosphaeria and its anamorphs and
   reveal the most reliable molecular data set we sequenced a portion of
   the large nuclear ribosomal. RNA gene (LSU rDNA) and the complete ITS
   region (ITS1, the 5.88 rRNA gene and ITS2) of 25 members of the
   Chaetosphaeriaceae including Porosphaerella cordanophora,
   Striatosphaeria codinaeophora, species of Chaetosphaeria and
   Melanopsammella, and representatives of eight of the eleven of their
   anamorph genera. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on four different
   data sets. The phylogeny inferred from the LSU rDNA sequence data showed
   two main groups, each with two subgroups, within the monophyletic
   Chaetosphaeriaceae. These subgroups are easily identified by
   morphological features of anamorphs and teleomorphs and serve as a
   background to subdivide the Chaetosphaeria species in to two,
   respectively, two and four natural groups of taxa. Two sexual species
   currently referred to Chaetophaeria and two related asexual species
   grouped with Hypocreales and Microascales, respectively Knoxdaviesia is
   relegated to synonymy with Custingophora, The morphology-based
   classification of Chaetosphaeria is compared with results from analyses
   of molecular data. The taxonomic value of morphological characters
   observed in teleomorphs and dematiaceous hyphomycetous anamorphs is
   discussed in the light of the results of these analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have reported cyclic fluctuations in lipids and
   lipoproteins as a function of the phase of the menstrual cycle. However,
   the reported patterns are quite variable and have led to an unclear
   picture of the influence of the menstrual cycle on the variability of
   lipids and hence of the role of the menstrual cycle phase in the
   interpretation of serum lipids for premenopausal women. As part of the
   DELTA Study (Dietary Effects on Lipoproteins and Thrombogenic Activity),
   we evaluated the cyclic variation of circulating lipids and lipoproteins
   in 39 premenopausal women and compared intraindividual variances in
   these women, 18 postmenopausal women, and 46 men under conditions of
   tight dietary control. Cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein
   (HDL)-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol,
   triglyceride, apolipoproteins A-1 (apo A-1) and B-100 (apo B-100), and
   lipoprotein (a) {[}Lp(a)] all demonstrated cycling in the premenopausal
   women. However, the observed cycling accounts for only a small fraction
   of the total biologic variability of lipids in premenopausal women. The
   magnitude of total intraindividual variability based on coefficient of
   variation (CV) for these lipids in premenopausal women (CV, 4\% to
   8.1\%) was similar to that found for men (CV, 4.3\% to 9.1\%) and for
   postmenopausal women (CV, 3.7\% to 6.7\%). These results suggest that
   protocols for screening and monitoring of serum lipids in premenopausal
   women need not differ from those used for men or postmenopausal women.

Abstract = {{Objective: The goal of the current study was to compare premorbid
   behavioral and cognitive functioning between co-twins discordant for
   psychotic disorder and between these pairs of twins and pairs of twins
   with no psychotic disorders.
   Method: The authors linked data from the Israeli Draft Board Registry,
   which contains cognitive and behavioral assessments of all
   16-17-year-old male Israeli twins, with data from the National
   Psychiatric Hospitalization Case Registry. Pairs of male twins who were
   healthy at the time of testing but discordant for psychoses later on
   were compared with one another and with pairs of healthy male twins.
   Results: The affected twins performed significantly worse than healthy
   twins on measures of individual autonomy, social functioning, and
   physical activity and nonsignificantly worse on measures of abstract
   reasoning. There were no significant differences in cognitive or
   behavioral scores between the co-twins who did or did not develop
   psychotic disorders.
   Conclusions: The authors conclude that these findings underscore the
   familial nature of behavioral and cognitive deficits antecedent to
   psychoses.}},

Abstract = {{Primary myelosarcomas are rare manifestations of acute myeloid leukaemia
   (AML) that precede bone marrow involvement. Out of 744 children observed
   during the AML-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) studies 87 and 93, 34
   children presented with extramedullar myelosarcomas and no blasts (n =
   21; 2.8\%), or a low blast count (n = 13; 1.7\%) in the bone marrow.
   Owing to the initially mild and variable symptoms, in some children (n =
   12) diagnostic procedures were delayed and treatment intensity was
   reduced. At 0.65 +/- 0.13, the cumulative incidence of relapse was
   significantly higher than in other AML patients (0.28 +/- 0.02). The
   5-year event-free survival was 0.19 +/- 0.08 (compared with 0.48 +/-
   0.02 in AML-BFM studies 87/93; P(log rank) < 0.03). Overall, 18 out of
   34 patients died from disease (estimated 5 year survival 0.44 +/- 0.09
   compared with 0.55 +/- 0.02 in the AML-BFM-studies 87/93; P(log rank) =
   0.35, n.s.). An early diagnostic workup is needed in children with
   unusual skin lesions or tumours, considering myelosarcoma as a primary
   manifestation of AML. Intensive AML-specific chemotherapy is recommended
   soon after diagnosis.}},

Title = {{Differential localization of human nongastric H+-K+-ATPase ATP1AL1 in

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-RENAL PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{279}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The human H+-K+-ATPase, ATP1AL1, belongs to the subgroup of nongastric,
   K+-transporting ATPases. In concert with the structurally related
   gastric H+-K+-ATPase, it plays a major role in K+ reabsorption in
   various tissues, including colon and kidney. Physiological and
   immunocytochemical data suggest that the functional heteromeric ion
   pumps are usually found in the apical plasma membranes of renal
   epithelial cells. However, the low expression levels of characteristic
   nongastric ion pumps makes it difficult to verify their spatial
   distribution in vivo. To investigate the sorting behavior of ATP1AL1, we
   expressed this pump by stable transfection in MDCK and LLC-PK1 renal
   epithelial cell lines. Stable interaction of ATP1AL1 with either the
   endogenous Na+-K+-ATPase beta-subunit or the gastric H+-K+-ATPase
   beta-subunit was tested by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and
   surface biotinylation. In cells transfected with ATP1AL1 alone, the
   alpha-subunit accumulated intracellularly, consistent with its inability
   to assemble and travel to the plasma membrane with the endogenous
   Na+-K+-ATPase beta-subunit. Cotransfection of ATP1AL1 with the gastric
   H+-K+-ATPase beta-subunit resulted in plasma membrane localization of
   both pump subunits. In cotransfected MDCK cells the heteromeric ion pump
   was predominantly polarized to the apical plasma membrane. Functional
   expression of ATP1AL1 was confirmed by Rb-86(+) uptake measurements. In
   contrast, cotransfected LLC-PK1 cells accumulate ATP1AL1 at the lateral
   membrane. The distinct polarization of ATP1AL1 indicates that the
   a-subunit encodes sorting information that is differently interpreted by
   cell type-specific sorting mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{We test three different conceptual models - ``experience with
   police,{''} ``quality of life,{''} and ``neighborhood context{''} - for
   directional accuracy and ability to explain satisfaction with the
   police. We also investigate whether these models help to explain the
   common finding that African-Americans are more dissatisfied with the
   police than are Caucasians. To do so, we use hierarchical linear
   modeling to simultaneously regress our outcome measure on clusters of
   citizen- and neighborhood-level variables. The analysis was conducted
   using recently collected information from the Project on Policing
   Neighborhoods (POPN). The data file consisted of survey responses from
   5,361 citizens residing in 58 neighborhoods located in Indianapolis,
   Indiana and St. Petersburg, Florida. At the citizen level, the
   psychologically based ``quality of life{''} model accounts for the
   greatest proportion of explained variance and provides the greatest
   directional accuracy. Also, residents of neighborhoods characterized by
   concentrated disadvantage express significantly less satisfaction with
   the police. In addition, neighborhood context reduces the negative
   effect of African-American status on satisfaction with police when a
   sparse citizen-level specification is used; racial variation in
   satisfaction with police persists, however, when citizen-level
   hierarchical models are specified more fully.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined possible effects of aging on the lateralization of

   (mean age 68.4 years) and younger participants (mean age 26.4 years)
   viewed slides of positive, neutral, or negative emotional content. While
   participants viewed the slides, bilateral electromyographic (EMG)
   recordings were obtained from the skin surface over zygomatic and
   corrugator facial muscles. The participants also made ratings of
   experienced emotional valence and arousal. Expected patterns of
   subjective experience and asymmetrical EMG activity were found in
   response to target stimuli. Greater corrugator muscle activity occurred
   during presentation of negative stimuli, whereas greater zygomatic
   muscle activity occurred during presentation of positive stimuli.
   Consistent with right-hemisphere specialization theories of emotion,
   left-sided facial EMG activity was consistently greater than that of the
   right side during presentation of emotional stimuli. However, neither
   subjective ratings nor EMG patterns showed a significant effect of age
   group. Such similar patterns of emotional response for the two groups
   suggest, that the aging process does not produce marked changes in
   stimulus-evoked emotional experience or in the pattern, magnitude, or

Abstract = {{The seasonal phytoplankton biomass distribution pattern in stratified
   temperate marine waters is traditionally depicted as consisting of
   spring and autumn blooms. The energy source supporting pelagic summer
   production is believed to be the spring bloom. However, the spring bloom
   disappears relatively quickly from the water column and a large
   proportion of the material sedimenting to the bottom following the
   spring bloom is often comprised of intact phytoplankton cells. Thus, it
   is easy to argue that the spring bloom is fueling the energy demands of
   the benthos, but more difficult to argue convincingly that energy fixed
   during the spring bloom is fueling the pelagic production occurring
   during summer months. We argue here that periodic phytoplankton blooms
   are occurring during the summer in the North Sea at depths of >25 m and
   that the accumulated new production {[}sensu (Dugdale and Goering,
   Limnol. Oceanogr., 12, 196-206, 1967)] occurring in these blooms may be
   greater than that occurring in the spring bloom in the same regions.
   Thus, such blooms may explain apparent discrepancies in production
   yields between different temperate marine systems.}},

Abstract = {{If we think of perceptual expertise, we might think of a neurologist
   interpreting a CAT scan or an astronomer looking at a star. But
   perceptual expertise is not limited to `experts'. Perceptual expertise
   is at the heart of our everyday competence in the world. We navigate
   around obstacles, we take turns in conversations, we make left-turns in
   face of on-coming traffic. Each of us is a perceptual expert (though
   only in certain domains). If we misunderstand perceptual expertise, we
   risk misunderstanding our epistemic relationship to the world. I argue
   that the standard arguments for the received view of perceptual
   expertise are problematic at best. Of course, the issue of whether the
   received view is actually correct is an empirical issue. But the
   decision to adopt the received view, I argue, was not a scientific
   decision, but was made by inheriting a philosophical tradition - which
   many philosophers today would question.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This retrospective analysis assessed the efficacy of balloon
   dilatation, endoureterotomy, percutaneous ureteroneocystostomy with
   stenting, and insertion of Wallstents in the management of malignant
   ureteral strictures with an intact or compromised vascular supply.
   Patients and Methods: A series of 127 patients with ureteral strictures
   secondary to malignancies were assessed after at least 2-year follow-up
   (range 2-5 years; mean 3.5 years). Balloon dilation (antegrade approach)
   was applied in 46 patients, endoureterotomy with temporary stenting in
   37, percutaneous ureteroneocystostomy with stenting in 34, bougie and
   stents in 13, and Wallstents in 31.
   Results: Balloon dilatation was successful in only two of four malignant
   midureteral stenoses with intact vascular supplies and was even less
   successful (10\%) in midureteral strictures with a compromised vascular
   supply. Endoureterotomy failed in all cases to prevent ureteral
   obstruction. Percutaneous ureteroneocystostomy achieved patency in 11 of
   34 patients (33\%) having a compromised ureteral vascular supply.
   Wallstents were successful in 18 of 31 patients (58\%) with stenoses of
   the pelvic ureter.
   Conclusions: Percutaneous ureteroneocystostomy with stenting meets the
   requirement for palliation in patients with obstruction secondary to
   pelvic neoplasms. Wallstents proved to be most successful when used in
   the pelvic ureter.}},

   substrates was less than that of M2 tool steel, whereas that for the DLC
   layer corresponded to the value previously reported for titanium

   adult painted turtles, Chrysemys picta, as part of a study of the
   potential impact of contaminants originating from the Massachusetts
   Military Reservation on Cape, Cod, MA. In animals from both Moody Pond,
   a site potentially impacted by contaminants, and Washburn Pond, a
   non-impacted site, rates of hepatic microsomal
   ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity were very low yet
   differences were detected. In Moody Pond, rates in both females and
   males peaked in June (4.3 +/- 0.5 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) and 5.9 +/- 1.5
   pmol min(-1) mg(-1) (mean +/- sem) respectively). At Washburn Pond, EROD
   rates in males peaked in May (3.8 +/- 0.6 pmol min(-1) mg(-1)), and in
   females were highest in August (2.5 pmol min(-1) mg(-1)). There were
   differences in EROD rates between turtles from the two locations (ANOVA;
   p <0.05), with higher activity at the impacted site. Western blot
   analysis for CYP1A protein showed a seasonal pattern of expression at
   the impacted site and a significant difference in expression between the
   two sites in June, with values being higher at the potentially impacted
   site (p <0.05). Hepatic cytosolic GST activity, measured by
   1,2-chlorodinitrobenzene conjugation, also showed a seasonal pattern in
   females, but not males. In Moody Pond, rates in females were highest in
   June (8.05 +/- 1 x 10(-5) mu mol min(-1) mg(-1)) and rates in males were
   highest in July (7.74 +/- 2 x 10(-5) mu mol min(-1) mg(-1)). Rates were
   highest in females from Washburn Pond in May (8.2 +/- 1.1 x 10(-5) mu
   mol min(-1) mg(-1)) and, in males in June (6.63 +/- 1 x 10(-5) mu mol
   min(-1) mg(-1)). There was no significant difference in activity between
   males and females, but there were significant (p <0.05) differences
   between females from the two sites, with activity being higher at the
   potentially impacted site. The elevated activity of hepatic enzymes at
   the impacted site indicates that responses to unidentified pollutants or
   pollutant mixtures are superimposed upon a normal seasonal rhythm of
   enzyme activity at this location.}},

Abstract = {{Background Hev b 1 represents one of the most important allergens in
   Hevea brasiliensis latex. It is difficult to get an appropriate amount
   of native Hev b 1 (nHev b 1) for research purposes.
   Objective The aim of this study was to produce sufficient amounts of Hev
   b 1 by recombinant methods to prove its suitability for latex allergy
   diagnostics.
   Methods We isolated total RNA of Hevea brasiliensis leaves and
   synthesized cDNA by RT PCR. Recombinant Hev b 1 (rHev b 1) as well as
   three fragments (amino acid residues 29-137, 48-137, 78-137) were
   subcloned and expressed as fusion proteins with Maltose-binding protein
   (MBP) in Escherichia coli. The MBP-rHev b 1 fusion protein was examined
   by RAST with the CAP method, histamine release test and immunoblots with
   human sera from spina bifida patients as well as from health care
   workers with latex allergy and monoclonal antibodies.
   Results Histamine release test and immunoblots revealed the high
   allergenicity of the MBP-rHev b 1 construct. By the CAP method, 54 out
   of 58 serum samples (93\%) from latex-sensitized spina bifida patients
   previously showing immunoglobulin (Ig) E to nHev b 1 exhibited
   IgE-binding to rHev b 1. Among 71 latex-allergic health care workers
   tested, 16 (22.5\%) had IgE antibodies to rHev b 1. The analysis of the
   fusion proteins carrying rHev b 1 fragments revealed that the loss of
   the N-terminal 28 amino acid residues did not affect IgE-binding. In
   contrast, the lack of the first 47 amino acid residues led to decreased
   IgE-binding reactivity in two out of four sera tested, whereas
   the;absence of the N-terminal 77 residues abolished IgE-binding in these
   two sera.
   Conclusion The MBP-rHev b 1 fusion protein exhibits a corresponding
   IgE-binding reactivity to nHev b 1 and may therefore substitute natural
   Hev b 1 for both in vitro diagnostics and research purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Bacterial adherence to mucosal and epithelial cell
   structures is of importance for the persistence of bacteria in the
   airways. Cigarette smoking and chronic bronchitis are associated with
   increased bacterial adherence. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) medication reduces
   the number of infectious exacerbations in patients with chronic
   bronchitis, and NAC medication has been associated with low
   intrabronchial bacterial numbers. Objective: We investigated whether NAC
   influences bacterial adherence as a possible mechanism behind its
   clinical effects. Methods: Highly adhering test strains of Streptococcus
   pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were used to investigate the
   influence of four pharmacological compounds on adherence to
   oropharyngeal epithelial cells in vitro. Adhesion assays were performed
   both during short-term exposure to, as well as after long-time
   incubation with, NAG, lidocaine, hydrocortisone and terbutaline at
   concentrations not inhibiting bacterial growth. Results: Only NAC showed
   a significant inhibitory effect on adhesion of H. influenzae during
   short-term incubation. After long-term incubation, both NAC and
   hydrocortisone inhibited bacterial adhesion for both strains in a
   dose-dependent manner. When NAC's effect on three different strains of
   S. pneumoniae and four strains of H. influenzae was studied, inhibition
   of bacterial adhesion was found for th ree strains of each species.
   Conclusions: NAC lowers bacterial adhesion in vitro to oropharyngeal
   epithelial cells in doses equivalent to that is being used clinically.
   This effect might be a contributory mechanism behind the reduction of
   infectious exacerbations in chronic bronchitis patients. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Unlike some overseas countries, perioperative nursing roles in Australia
   are largely undeveloped, and very little research has explored the
   opinions of perioperative nurses regarding the development of their
   specialty. This study was undertaken to identify the current scope,
   possible future directions, and the barriers to developing perioperative
   nursing practice in the state of Victoria (Australia). The study design
   was descriptive and utilized survey methodology. An instrument was
   constructed by the researcher for the specific purposes of the study,
   and comprised three stages of development: questionnaire development;
   validation by a panel of experts; and a pilot study. The questionnaire
   was sent randomly to selected perioperative nurses (n = 224) and a
   response rate of 79\% (n = 176) was obtained. Data were analysed using
   the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Descriptive
   statistics were used to summarize data, and independent sample t-tests,
   one-way ANOVA and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to test
   differences between groups. For the purpose of data reduction factor
   analysis was undertaken. The findings of the study indicated that the
   perioperative nursing model in its espoused form is not being practised,
   but a large majority of participants believe that perioperative nursing
   practice should not be restricted to the intraoperative phase of the
   perioperative model. Expanded rather than extended activities and
   functions were perceived as more important for development of the
   specialty, and perceived barriers to advanced perioperative nursing
   practice centred predominantly on the current application of the
   perioperative model. Recommendations include refinement of the
   perioperative nursing model to reflect changes in the delivery of
   healthcare, addressing issues of cost associated with further education,
   and undertaking interpretive research to provide more detailed
   information on the possible future direction for perioperative nursing.}},

Abstract = {{According to the data of the literature, the prevalence of pain in
   cancer patients at various stages of the disease and the settings of
   care range from 38 to 51\%, with an increase of up to 74\% in the
   advanced and terminal stages. Despite published World Health
   Organization (WHO) guidelines for pain management, 42 to 51\% of cancer
   patients receive inadequate analgesia and 30\% receive no analgesics at
   ail.
   A 3-year Research Project ``Towards a Pain-free Hospital{''}, which
   began one year ago, is ongoing at the National Cancer Institute of
   Milan. The research is organized in three subsequent steps. In the 1(st)
   one, a series of patient- and staff-oriented evaluation tools are used
   to assess the level of appropriateness of pain communication,
   assessment, management and control of the in-patients. The 2(nd) step
   will implement a number of continuing educational interventions aimed at
   improving patient awareness and staff knowledge of the appropriate pain
   assessment and management in order to respond to the patient's pain
   problem. In the 3(rd) step, all the assessment tools used in step one
   will be applied again to establish the prevalence of pain, the causes
   and intensity and patient satisfaction with pain management and to
   evaluate the impact of the interventions performed during the 2(nd) step
   regarding the overall ability of our hospital to tackle pain emergency
   in the hospitalized cancer population.
   The results relative to the 1(st) step are herein reported In particular
   as regards the study on prevalence, causes, severity of pain, the
   interference of pain with sleep, mood and concentration, the use of pain
   medications and the relief obtained, the structural validity and
   internal consistency of the assessment tool used. A total of 258
   patients hospitalized for at least 24 h were interviewed by 9 physicians
   using a brief structured questionnaire prepared ad hoc: 51.5\% of the
   patients presented pain during the previous 24 h caused by surgery
   (49.6\%) or by the tumor mass Itself (29.3\%). Out of the 133 patients
   with pain, a high degree (much or very much) of pain at rest was present
   in 27.1\% and pain on movement in 30.8\%; 31.6\% did not take any
   analgesic treatment, and 14.3\% of the fatter reported a high degree of
   pain at rest and 21.4\% on movement. Pain interfered with sleep from
   much to very much in 28.8\% and with irritability and nervousness In
   15.9\% of the patients. In the 91 patients taking analgesics, 57.2\%
   reported a high degree of pain relief. A high degree of pain and
   interference, however, was associated with low relief levels. The
   assessment tool used was shown to have a good structural validity and
   internal consistency (Chrombach alpha index of interference scale =
   0.73).
   Although the Milan Cancer Institute has the longest tradition in Italy
   of pain assessment by means of validated tools and pain management
   according to the WHO guidelines and educational efforts In this field,
   the results of the study clearly show that it is necessary to persevere
   with continuing educational and Informative programs In order to reduce
   the frequency and severity of pain and thus improve the quality of life
   of in patients.}},

Abstract = {{The RU5 region at the 5' RNA terminus of spleen necrosis virus (SNV) has
   been shown to facilitate expression of human immunodeficiency virus type
   1 (HIV) unspliced RNA independently of the Rev-responsive element (RRE)
   and Rev. The SNV sequences act as a distinct posttranscriptional control
   element to stimulate gag RNA nuclear export and association with
   polyribosomes. Here we sought to determine whether RU5 functions to
   neutralize the cis-acting inhibitory sequences (INSs) in HIV RNA that
   confer RRE/Rev dependence or functions as an independent stimulatory
   sequence. Experiments with HIV gag reporter plasmids that contain
   inactivated INS-1 indicated that neutralization of INSs does not account
   for RU5 function. Results with luciferase reporter gene (luc) plasmids
   further indicated that RU5 stimulates expression of a nonretroviral RNA
   that lacks INSs. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses indicated that RU5
   does not increase the steady-state levels or nuclear export of the luc
   transcript but rather that the U5 region facilitates efficient
   polyribosomal association of the mRNA. RU5 does not function as an
   internal ribosome entry site in bicistronic reporter plasmids, and it
   requires the 5'-proximal position for efficient function. Our results
   indicate that RU5 contains stimulatory sequences that function in a
   5'-proximal position to enhance initiation of translation of a
   nonretroviral reporter gene RNA. We speculate that RU5 evolved to
   overcome the translation-inhibitory effect of the highly structured
   encapsidation signal and other replication motifs in the 5' untranslated
   region of the retroviral RNA.}},

Abstract = {{Regulation of growth of the fetus and its placenta begins before
   pregnancy. Early in pregnancy the mother sets the rate of growth of the
   fetus on a trajectory, which may be modified by events later in
   pregnancy.
   Low maternal weight for height, history of previous small babies,
   maternal undernutrition, pregnancy disorders, e.g. pre-eclampsia, are
   associated with low birthweight. Maternal smoking is a major factor in
   developed countries; infections and undernutrition in developing
   countries.
   Recently, there has been emphasis on adverse long-term outcomes
   including ischaemic heart disease, hypertension and diabetes associated
   with poor fetal growth. Experimental studies in animals show that some
   of these outcomes can readily be induced by restriction of fetal growth.
   Progress in determining successful treatments to improve the growth of
   the fetus has lagged behind these epidemiological and experimental
   findings. However, nutrient supplements improve growth in undernourished
   women and smoking cessation also improves fetal size and outcome. (C)

Abstract = {{The kinetic profile of gentamicin in premature infants has been studied
   to enable the development of optimized dosage schedules for neonatal
   intensive-care units and to stress the relationship between the
   pharmacokinetic parameters and several demographic, developmental and
   clinical factors which might be associated with changes in gentamicin
   disposition.
   Sixty-eight newborn patients of 24- to 34-weeks gestational age and
   600-3100 g current weight in their first week of life, undergoing
   routine therapeutic drug monitoring of their gentamicin serum levels,
   were included in this retrospective analysis.
   Gentamicin pharmacokinetic parameters were determined through non-linear
   regression by using a single-compartment open model. By regression
   analysis the current weight (g) was shown to be the strongest
   co-variate, and both gentamicin clearance (L h(-1)) and volume of
   distribution (L) had to be normalized. Additionally, gentamicin
   clearance depended on gestational age with a cut-off at 30 weeks, which
   allowed the division of the overall population into two subsets (< 30
   weeks and between 30-34 weeks of gestational age).
   The younger neonates (<30 weeks of gestational age) showed a lower
   gentamicin clearance (0.0288 vs 0.0340 L h(-1) kg(-1)), a slightly
   higher volume of distribution (0.464 vs 0.435 L kg(-1)), and a longer
   half-life (11.17 vs 8.88 h) compared with the older subgroup (30-34
   weeks of gestational age).
   On the basis of the pharmacokinetic parameters obtained, we suggest
   loading doses of 3.7 and 3.5 mg kg(-1) for the two subgroups of neonates
   (<30 weeks and 30-34 weeks of gestational age), respectively. The
   appropriate maintenance doses in accordance with the characteristics of
   the patients should be 2.8 mg kg(-1)/24 h and 2.6mg kg(-1)/18 h for
   neonates < 30 weeks and between 30-34 weeks of gestational age,
   respectively. Finally, when compared with previous studies, the
   information obtained on the pharmacokinetics and determinants of the
   pharmacokinetic variability of gentamicin in neonates was shown to be
   consistent.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore age-of-onset criterion for the diagnosis of
   attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a school sample of
   young Brazilian adolescents. Methods: 191 students aged 12 to 14 years

   global impairment. Results: Both adolescents with ADHD (n = 30) and
   adolescents who fulfilled all DSM-IV ADHD criteria, except age of onset
   of impairment criterion (ADHD w/o age-of-onset, n = 27) had
   significantly higher scores on Attention Problems, Delinquent and
   Aggressive Behavior scales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and
   lower scores on the Child Global Assessment scale (CGAS) than non-ADHD
   adolescents (n = 134). Adolescents with ADHD and youths with ADHD w/o

Abstract = {{Objective: Based on hypotheses generated dr,ring clinical interviews
   with 80 women with a lifetime history of bulimia nervosa (BN), we
   designed an instrument for assessing the extent to which, women with BN
   report parental intrusiveness and breakdown of appropriate role
   boundaries during their adolescent development. Method: Through an
   iterative process of item generation and scale administration, the
   Parental Intrusiveness Rating Scale (PIRS), consisting of 20 maternal
   items and 20 paternal items, was developed. Maternal subscales include
   Invasion of Privacy, Jealousy and Competition, and Overconcern with the
   Daughter's Eating, Weight, and Shape. Paternal subscales include
   Invasion of Privacy Seductiveness, and Overconcern with the Daughter's
   Eating, Weight, and Shape. We validated the instrument using a subset of
   die above BN and comparison women (ns = 55 and 33, respectively), as
   well as an independent sample of women with BN and college com parison
   subjects (ns = 31 and 540, respectively). Results: Parental
   intrusiveness scores were significantly positively correlated with
   disturbed relationships in the family of origin of our initial cohort.
   Reliability analyses, both test-retest and item-scale correlations,
   revealed adequate to strong statistical associations in the combined
   sample. Conclusion: The PIRS promises to enrich our understanding of
   problematic parental behaviors among women who develop BN and allows us
   to broaden the conceptualization of familial risk factors for this
   disorder. (C) 2000 by John Wiley \&Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance related protein (MRP)
   overexpression is often responsible of the development of multidrug
   resistance in cancer therapy. These proteins ale also expressed in
   normal tissues, where their physiological role is related to the
   extrusion of endogenous toxins or to secretory function in liver and
   kidney. The LLC-PK1 cell line is derived from normal pig proximal renal
   tubule and physiologically expresses low levels of P-gp and MRP. A
   resistant cell line (LLC-PK1/ADR) has been established in our laboratory
   by chronic exposure to increasing doses of doxorubicin. Cytofluorimetric
   analysis of P-gp and MRP expression performed by C219 and MRPm6
   immunofluorescence detection showed that these cells overexpress P-gp,
   but nor MRP. The uptake of doxorubicin and rhodamine 123 has been
   quantified in LLC-PK1 and LLC-PK1/ADR cells and compared with data
   obtained using other tumor cell lines commonly used as reference for
   studying P-gp or MRP overexpression. P388 sensitive cells and its
   resistant counterpart P388/ADR cells, which overexpress P-gp and PANC-1
   cells, which express high levels of MRP were used. A lower fluorescence
   intensity was evident with both doxorubicin and rhodamine 123 in
   LLC-PK1/ADR as well as in P388/ADR cells, that overexpresses P-gp, in
   comparison with the parental fines. The uptake was increased by a
   pretreatment with verapamil. Verapamil was completely ineffective on
   PANG-I cells, confirming a selective effect of this inhibitor on P-gp.
   Propidium iodide staining, performed after doxorubicin treatment,
   confirmed a higher cytotoxicity of the antineoplastic drug in the
   LLC-PK1 cells compared with the resistant counterpart.}},

Abstract = {{Volatile organic compounds from Penicillium viridicatum and
   Methylobacterium mesophilicum growing on laboratory media and on

   gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. P, viridicatum produced
   compounds such as 4-methyl thiazole, terpenes and alcohols, whereas M.
   mesophilicum produced dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, and
   chlorophenol with growth on laboratory media. In comparison with
   laboratory media, fewer volatiles were detected from colonized foam
   insulation materials. Biofilms of M, mesophilicum on aluminum evaporator
   components produced mainly dimethyl disulfide. These biofilms, after
   inoculation with P. viridicatum, produced offensive smelling alcohols
   and esters such as 2-methyl propanol, 3-penten-2-ol, and the ethyl ester
   of butanoic acid. The moisture and substrates innate to the automobile
   air conditioning systems provided an environment suitable for microbial
   biofilm development and odor production. Reduction of retained moisture
   in the air conditioning system coupled with use of less susceptible or
   antimicrobial substrates are advised for remediation of the noxious
   odors.}},

Abstract = {{To assess whether trends ill the troposphere's circulation have occurred
   this century in concert with changes at the surface, we consider the
   low-frequency behavior in the global angular momentum of the atmosphere.
   Values of this index have been computed each month since 1870 from model
   experiments conducted by the UK Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and
   Research, in which the model atmosphere is driven by prescribed boundary
   forcings, most especially sea surface temperature (SST) fields. The
   interannual variability of the model's atmospheric angular momentum
   compares favorably with that derived from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for
   the period of overlap (the second half of the twentieth century).
   Evidence is found for a notable increase in interannual variability
   since around 1970, but this recent high level of variability may not be
   significantly greater than that during 1900-1920. This latter result is
   strongly dependent on the character of the SST field used in an
   experiment, because low-frequency signals in atmospheric momentum are
   closely linked to those in the El Nino/Southern Oscillation. Large
   differences exist, however, among SST estimates in the tropical Pacific
   for the early part of the century.}},

Abstract = {{Individual cells translate concentration gradients of extracellular

   either transactivators or transrepressors are present is converted to an
   on/off switch when these factors compete for the same DNA regulatory
   element. Hill coefficients of dose-response curves confirm that the
   synergistic responses generated by each factor alone are additive,
   obviating the need for feedback loops. We postulate that regulatory
   networks of competing transcription factors prevalent in cells and

Abstract = {{Purpose: We report our experience with the Kansas technique of
   phakosection which eliminates or limits most complications of classic
   manual extracapsular extraction.
   Patients and methods: This retrospective study included our first 80
   patients undergoing surgery for mature cataract between May 1996 and May
   1998 where we used the Kansas technique. We compared outcome with a
   group of 30 patients who underwent classic manual extracapsular
   extraction in a study performed in 1995 by the same surgeon in the same
   hospital.
   Results: Per- and post-operative complications were significantly lower
   with phakosection. Functional rehabilitation was quicker, better and
   provided better patient comfort.
   Discussion: Despite some difficulties encountered in a public hospital
   (viscoelastic excessively fluid and in small quantity, lack of suitable
   knives or reuse of sterilized disposable knives), we found that the
   Kansas technique is very well adapted to mature cataracts and our
   working conditions.
   Conclusion: Phakosection allowed us to give our patients with mature or
   very mature cataracts the benefit of small incisions. With a moderate
   increase in cost, this technique significantly reduced our per- and
   post-operative complication rates and gave quicker and better visual
   recovery. in our countries, this technique provides better care than
   phakoemulsification.}},

Title = {{Immediate and delayed effects of heat stress on follicular development
   and its association with plasma FSH and inhibin concentration in cows}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to characterize the immediate effects of heat
   stress on plasma FSH and inhibin concentrations, and its involvement in
   follicular dynamics during a complete oestrous cycle, and to examine a
   possible delayed effect of heat stress on follicular development.
   Holstein dairy cows were oestrous synchronized and randomly assigned to
   either cooled (n = 7) or heat-stressed (n = 6) treatment groups. During
   a complete oestrous cycle, control cows, which were cooled, maintained
   normothermia, whereas heat-stressed cows, which were exposed to direct
   solar radiation, developed hyperthermia. At the end of this oestrous
   cycle (treated cycle), both groups were cooled and maintained
   normothermia for the first 10 days of the subsequent oestrous cycle.
   Throughout this period, follicular development was examined by
   ultrasonography, and plasma samples were collected. During the second
   follicular wave of the treated oestrous cycle, a significantly larger
   cohort of medium sized follicles (6-9 mm) was found in heat-stressed
   cows than in cooled cows (P < 0.05). The enhanced growth of follicles in
   this wave in heat-stressed cows was associated with a higher plasma FSH
   increase which lasted 4 more days (days 8-13 of the oestrous cycle; P <
   0.05), and coincided with a decrease in the plasma concentration of
   immunoreactive inhibin (days 5-18 of the oestrous cycle; P < 0.05).
   During the follicular phase (days 17-20 of the treated cycle),
   heat-stressed cows showed an increase in the number of large follicles
   (greater than or equal to 10 mm), and the preovulatory plasma FSH surge
   was significantly higher in heat-stressed cows than in cooled cows (P <
   0.01). The effect of heat stress was also observed during the first
   follicular wave of the subsequent cycle: the postovulatory plasma FSH
   concentration was higher (P < 0.01), but fewer medium follicles
   developed, and the first follicular wave decreased at a slower rate in
   previously heat-stressed cows than in cooled cows (0.40 and 0.71
   follicles per day, respectively). This study shows both immediate and
   delayed effects of heat stress on follicular dynamics, which were
   associated with high FSH and low inhibin concentrations in plasma. These
   alterations may have physiological significance that could be associated
   with low fertility of cattle during the summer and autumn.}},

Abstract = {{One of the peculiarities of the December 1998 votes in the House of
   Representatives to impeach Bill Clinton was that they took place during
   a lame-duck session. Roughly 10 percent of the voting population were in
   their final term and therefore no longer faced any risk of electoral
   retribution by the citizenry. While most of the relevant empirical
   literature suggests that the absence of electoral discipline does not
   matter, in theory, these departing legislators could ignore the
   preferences of their districts and vote according to their own personal
   preferences, the wishes of special interests, their new constituencies
   when relevant, or any other idiosyncratic factor. Because the votes on
   impeachment are so politically important, and since they offer an
   exceptional opportunity to examine the so-called last term problem, our
   analysis explores whether the factors influencing the votes of departing
   members of Congress were different than those influencing the votes of
   their continuing colleagues. We And that, contrary to past findings
   regarding political shirking, those leaving the House exhibited
   contrasting behavioral patterns relative to those who were continuing in
   the 106th Congress. In deciding their vote choices on the impeachment
   articles, reelected incumbents weighted district preferences far more
   heavily than departing members. Consequently, our results suggest that
   the severing of electoral ties is relevant for legislator behavior and
   that it is a matter of some importance whether or not a vote takes place
   during a lame-duck session.}},

Abstract = {{Background We assessed the effects of impaired Executive Control
   Function (ECF) on Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) and
   level of tare among noninstitutionalized elderly retirees with
   ``subclinical{''} cognitive impairment.
   Methods. Subjects (N = 561; age 78.2 +/- 5.0 years) were residents of a
   single, 1500 bed, continuing care retirement community. Subjects were
   examined for cognitive impairment using the Executive Interview
   (EXIT25), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and an executive
   clock-drawing task (CLOX). The CLOX is divided into executively
   sensitive (CLOX1) and simple constructional (CLOX2) subtests.
   Results. Residents in congregate high-rises (n = 301) differed
   significantly From those in independent-living apartments (n = 260) with
   respect to age, gender, percent living alone, EXIT25, CLOX1, MMSE, and
   CLOX2 scores (all P < .03). Only differences in ECF measures persisted
   after adjusting for age and living alone (p < .004). The EXIT25 (P <
   .006) and CLOX2 (p = .02) were associated with the use of prostheses.
   The differences in EXIT25 scores persisted after adjusting for level and
   living alone (p = .01). All instruments distinguished residents with
   impairment in IADLs. However, only CLOX2 (p < .001), EXIT25 (p < .001),
   and age (p < .001) made significant independent contributions.
   Conclusions. ECF has statistically significant effects on level of care
   and IADL impairment, even among noninstitutionalized retirees. This
   emergent disability is not well detected by traditional global cognitive
   measures. Evaluation and treatment may he delayed unless ECF measures
   are employed.}},

Abstract = {{Lygus spp. are attacked by a variety of predators, parasitoids, and
   pathogens in the United States, but the overall impact of this natural
   enemy complex on Lygus populations is not well known. Although nymphal
   and adult parasitism have been characterized in a number of studies, egg
   parasitism and the impact of predation are still not well delineated.
   Several studies indicate that some native predators and parasitoids can
   inflict high mortality on Lygus populations; however, efficacy of these
   natural enemies appears to vary among the bugs' host plants, with crop
   systems experiencing some of the poorest biological control. The fungal
   pathogen Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) may have potential for managing
   early-season populations of Lygus spp. in crop systems, but its role at
   present is quite limited. More information is needed on the role of
   native natural enemies in the population dynamics of Lygus spp., in both
   crop and natural systems. This information may help us develop programs
   using native natural enemies, through either releases or conservation,
   to target and suppress Lygus populations over large areas and before
   they enter crop systems. In addition to native natural enemies, there
   are opportunities for enhancing biological control of Lygus spp. through
   importation of exotic natural enemies. Although neither the tarnished
   plant bug (TPB) (Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois)) nor the western
   tarnished plant bug (WTPB) (Lygus hesperus Knight) occur in Europe,
   there are several promising parasitoids of congeneric mirids in Europe
   which exhibit good host specificity, and appear to be good candidates
   for importation. Several species of European parasitoids have been
   introduced into the United States, one of which (Peristenus digoneutis
   Loan) is now established in 7 states of the northeastern U.S., but has
   failed to establish below 40 degreesN latitude. Continuing efforts
   should be directed toward importing exotic, effective natural enemies
   that can provide permanent population suppression, as well as the
   development of habitats that are conducive to survival and reproduction
   of Lygus natural enemies, whether resident or introduced. These
   approaches provide opportunities to extend suppression of Lygus
   populations well beyond the crop system.}},

Abstract = {{Coupled axial tibial rotation in response to an anterior tibial load has
   been used as a common diagnostic measurement and as a means to load the
   ligamentous structures during laboratory tests. However, the exact
   location of the point of application of these loads as well as the
   corresponding sensitivity of the coupled tibial rotation to this point
   can have an effect on the function of the soft tissues at the joint.
   Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of
   four different points of application of the anterior tibial load on the
   anterior tibial translation and coupled axial tibial rotation. The four
   points include: (1) geometric point - midway between the collateral
   ligament insertion sites on the tibia, (2) clinical point - a position
   that attempts to simulate clinical diagnostic tests, (3) medial point -
   a position medial to the geometric point and (4) lateral point - a
   position lateral to the clinical point. A robotic/universal force-moment
   sensor testing system was used to apply the anterior tibial load at the
   four points of application and to record the resulting joint motion.
   Anterior tibial translation in response to an anterior tibial load of
   100 N was found not to vary between the four points of application of
   the anterior tibial load at all flexion angles examined. However,
   internal tibial rotation was found for the lateral point (13 +/- 10
   degrees at 30 degrees of knee flexion) in all specimens and clinical
   point (8 +/- 10 degrees at 30 degrees of knee flexion) while external
   rotation resulted when the load was applied at the medial point (-8 +/-
   7 degrees at 30 degrees of knee flexion). Both internal and external
   tibial rotations occurred throughout the range of flexion when the
   tibial load was applied at the geometric point. The results suggest that
   the clinical point should be used as the point of application of the
   anterior tibial load whenever clinical examinations are simulated and
   multi-degree-of-freedom joint and soft tissue function are examined. (C)

Abstract = {{Several important advances in pancreatic surgery have been made over the
   past year. As in other areas of general surgery, laparoscopic techniques
   are being used with increasing frequency, but their real value remains
   to be determined. Methods to stage pancreatic cancer, perform palliative

   described. Using more conventional surgical approaches, data continue to
   accumulate about pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy as an
   alternative to the standard operation, The survival benefit of extended
   pancreatic resection for pancreatic cancer remains dubious. Studies
   continue to demonstrate lower morbidity and mortality rates for
   pancreaticoduodenectomy performed at high-volume centers. In the arena
   of chronic pancreatitis, pain relief is still the most common reason for
   surgical treatment, and the efficacy of various operations has been
   assessed by some new studies. Data continue to show that aggressive
   surgical treatment for infected necrosis leads to improved survival in

Abstract = {{Apoptosis is an intrinsic and fundamental biologic process that plays a
   critical role in the normal development of multicellular organisms and
   in the maintainance of tissue homeostasis. Some of the well known
   regulators of apoptosis are cytokines of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
   ligand family, such as Fas ligand (Fas L) and TNF, which induce
   apoptosis by activation of their corresponding receptors, Fas and
   TNFR-1. Recently, a new member of the TNF family known as TRAIL
   (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) was identified and shown to
   induce p53-independent apoptosis in a variety of tumor cell lines but
   not in normal cells. Four human receptors for TRAIL were also recently
   identified and designated TRAIL-R1, -R2, -R3, and -R4. The aim of this
   study is to examine whether TRAIL and TRAIL receptors (-R1, -R2, -R3)
   are expressed in uterine cervical cancer and whether it is correlated
   with apoptosis, TRAIL, and TRAIL receptors. The subjects were 20
   patients who were diagnosed with cervical cancer. Western blotting was
   performed in nine cases and immunohistochemical staining for TRAIL and
   TRAIL, receptors (-R1, -R2, -R3) and TUNEL method for detection of
   apoptosis was performed in 11 cases. There were proteins for TRAIL,
   TRAIL-R1, -R2, and -R3 in tissues from cervical cancer. All TRAIL
   receptors were expressed in both normal cervical epithelium and tumor
   cells, and TRAIL-R1 and -R2 were more strongly expressed in tumor cells
   than normal epithelium (P < 0.05). Apoptosis correlated with expression
   of TRAIL-R1 and -R2 (P < 0.05). This study suggests that TRAIL induces
   apoptosis in cervical cancer through its receptors.}},

Title = {{IGF-I and ventilation after short-term progestin in postmenopausal women

Journal = {{RESPIRATORY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{909-916}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Progestins stimulate respiration. We have previously shown prolonged
   ventilatory improvement in chronic respiratory failure with short-term
   medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). The mechanism of the sustained
   respiratory effect is unknown. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and
   insulin have anabolic effects which could also improve ventilation in
   the long-term. To better understand the interactions between hormones
   and control of breathing, we evaluated the degree and duration of
   changes in IGF-I, insulin and cortisol after short-term MPA therapy in
   chronic respiratory insufficiency.
   Fourteen postmenopausal women with permanent or episodic hypercapnic or
   hypoxaemic respiratory failure were recruited for a placebo-controlled
   single-blind trial. After 14 days of placebo treatment and 7 days of
   washout, a daily dose of 60 mg MPA was administered for 14 days. Serum
   IGF-I, insulin and cortisol were measured five times at 3-week
   intervals: at baseline, after 14 days on placebo, after 14 days on MPA,
   and during the washout, on days 21 and 42.
   Serum IGF-I levels were 15.2 (SD 4.6), 20.8 (SD 6.8) and 17.2 (SD 6.4)
   at baseline, on MPA and after a 3-week washout. Serum insulin levels did
   not change {[}12.5 mU l(-1) (SD 4.1), 12.2mU l(-1) (SD 4.8) and 14.5mU
   l(-1) (SD 3.6), respectively]. Serum cortisol did not change. On MPA,
   IGF-I increased on average by 5.6 nmol l(-1) {[}95\% confidence interval
   (95\% CI) 1.4 to 9.9] or 42.0 \% (95\% CI 6.3 to 77.8) from baseline.
   The IGF-I response coincided with the previously reported ventilatory
   improvement.
   MPA 60 mg daily for 2 weeks increases serum IGF-I in postmenopausal
   women with chronic respiratory insufficiency. During follow-up after
   MPA, there was a trend towards increased IGF-I and insulin levels. The
   role of these two hormones to induce prolonged ventilatory stimulation
   could not be excluded and further studies in larger populations are
   warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP) is a hereditary
   neurodegenerative disorder characterized by levodopa-responsive
   parkinsonism with onset before age 40 years and a slowly progressive
   course. Families with this condition have been described predominantly
   in Japanese population, occasionally under different names including an
   autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism with diurnal fluctuation
   (AR-EPDF) or a familial form of juvenile parkinsonism. Recently, the
   causative gene for AR-JP was mapped on chromosome 6q25.2-q27, and
   subsequently a novel gene `parkin' was identified by means of positional
   cloning. In this manuscript, we review the clinical, pathological and
   genetical aspects of AR-JP. It would not only promise to provide
   important insights into the molecular mechanisms of selective
   degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in AR-JP, but also bring insights
   into the mechanisms of degeneration of these neurons in Parkinson's
   disease. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In usual incoherent scatter data analysis, the plasma distribution
   function is assumed to be Maxwellian. In space plasmas, however,
   distribution functions with a high energy tail which can be well modeled
   by a generalized Lorentzian distribution function with spectral index
   kappa (kappa distribution) have been observed. We have theoretically
   calculated incoherent scatter spectra for a plasma that consists of
   electrons with kappa distribution function and ions with Maxwellian
   neglecting the effects of the magnetic field and collisions. The ion
   line spectra have a double-humped shape similar to those from a
   Maxwellian plasma. The electron temperatures are underestimated,
   however, by up to 40\% when interpreted assuming Maxwellian
   distribution. Ion temperatures and electron densities are affected
   little. Accordingly, actual electron temperatures might be
   underestimated when an energy input maintaining a high energy tail
   exists. We have also calculated plasma lines with the kappa distribution
   function. They are enhanced in total strength, and the peak frequencies
   appear to be slightly shifted to the transmitter frequency compared to
   the peak frequencies for a Maxwellian distribution. The damping rate
   depends on the electron temperature. For lower electron temperatures,
   plasma lines for electrons with a re distribution function are more
   strongly damped than for a Maxwellian distribution. For higher electron
   temperatures, however, they have a relatively sharp peak.}},

   Methods: EPA-28, a fish oil enriched with n-3 PUFAs including
   eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, was administered
   subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice before and after subcutaneous
   inoculation of B16 melanoma cells. The effects of EPA-28 on the
   antitumor activities of T cells and macrophages were investigated.
   Results. The treatment of the mice with EPA-28 before and after the
   tumor inoculation enhanced the growth and metastasis of B16 melanoma and
   dea eased the survival rate of the tumor-bearing mice. The treatment
   also decreased the number of CD4+ T cells in the spleen and tumor
   draining lymph nodes on day 14 after the tumor inoculation Moreover,
   EPA-28 suppressed the antimelanoma cytolytic activity of T cells and

Abstract = {{There is ambiguity concerning the nomenclature and classification of
   fractures of the ring of the second cervical vertebra (C2), Disruption
   of the pars interarticularis which defines true traumatic
   spondylolisthesis of C2, is often wrongly called a pedicle fracture. Our
   aim in this study was to assess the influence of asymmetry on the
   anatomical and functional outcome and to evaluate the criteria of
   instability established by Roy-Camille et al, We studied the plain
   radiographs and CT scans of 24 patients: 13 were judged to be
   asymmetrical, ten were considered unstable and 14 stable.
   Treatment was with a Minerva jacket in 15 fractures and by operation in
   nine. Surgery was undertaken in patients with severe C2 to C3 sprains.
   One patient with an unstable lesion refused operation and was treated
   conservatively with a poor radiological result.
   Our study showed that asymmetry of the fracture did not affect the
   outcomes of treatment and should not therefore influence decisions in
   treatment. The criteria of Roy-Camille seem to be reliable and useful.
   We prefer the posterior approach to the cervical spine, which allows
   both stabilisation of the fracture and correction of a local kyphosis.}},

Abstract = {{1 We investigated the effects of the phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2))
   activators calcium ionophore A 23187, hydrogen peroxide
   (H2O2),bradykinin (BK), histamine and noradrenaline (NA) on the
   8-iso-prostaglandin (PG)F-2 alpha formation in the isolated human
   umbilical vein and the isolated rabbit ear. For comparison, the
   influence of these substances on the thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) release
   was also investigated. The release of total (esterified as well as free)
   8-iso-PGF(2 alpha), free 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) and TXB2, the stable
   metabolite of TXA(2), was determined by specific enzyme immunoassays.
   2 The results show that bolus injections of 5.4 mmol H2O2, 30 nmol A
   23187, 10 nmol BK, 50 nmol histamine and 20 nmol NA caused an increased
   release of total 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) in the umbilical vein and the rabbit
   ear. A perfusion with H2O2 at a final concentration of 0.3 mM also
   increased the release of this isoprostane. Increased formation of free
   8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) was induced by A 23187 injection and by both modes of
   H2O2 administration, but not by the other treatments.
   3 Bolus injections of A 23187, BK and histamine induced an increased
   release of TXB2 in both organs. Both modes of H2O2 administration and NA
   showed no releasing effects.
   4 In conclusion, our results show that the substances used are able to
   stimulate the formation of 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) concurrently with the
   release of PGs. This effect might be of pathophysiological relevance in
   inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases in which an enhanced release of
   free radicals, BK, histamine or NA play an important role.}},

Abstract = {{cAMP-dependent protein kinase has a central role in the control of
   mammalian sperm capacitation and motility. Previous protein biochemical
   studies indicated that the only cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic
   subunit (C) in ovine sperm is an unusual isoform, termed C-s, whose
   amino terminus differs from those of published C isoforms of other
   species. Isolation and sequencing of cDNA clones encoding ovine C-s and
   C alpha 1 (the predominant somatic isoform) now reveal that C-s is the
   product of an alternative transcript of the C alpha gene. C-s cDNA
   clones from murine and human testes also were isolated and sequenced,
   indicating that C-s is of ancient origin and widespread in mammals. In
   the mouse, C-s transcripts were detected only in testis and not in any
   other tissue examined, including ciliated tissues and ovaries. Finally,
   immunohistochemistry of the testis shows that C-s first appears in
   pachytene spermatocytes. This is the first demonstration of a cell
   type-specific expression fur any C isoform. The conservation of C-s
   throughout mammalian evolution suggests that the unique structure of C-s
   is important in the subunit's localization or function within the sperm.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES We sought to investigate the potential benefit of
   thrombolytic therapy (TT) and intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation
   (IABP) on in-hospital mortality rates of patients enrolled in a
   prospective, multi-center Registry of acute myocardial infarction (MI)
   complicated by cardiogenic shock (CS).
   BACKGROUND Retrospective studies suggest that patients suffering from CS
   due to MI have lower in-hospital mortality rates when IABP support is
   added to TT. This hypothesis has not heretofore been examined
   prospectively in a study devoted to CS.
   METHODS Of 1,190 patients enrolled at 36 participating centers, 884
   patients had CS due to predominant left ventricular (LV) failure.
   Excluding 26 patients with IABP placed prior to shock onset and 2
   patients with incomplete data, 856 patients were evaluated regarding TT
   and IABP utilization. Treatments, selected by local physicians, fell
   into four categories: no TT, no IABP (33\%; n = 285); IABP only (33\%; n
   = 279); TT only (15\%; n = 132); and TT and IABP (19\%; n = 160).
   RESULTS Patients in CS treated with TT had a lower in-hospital mortality
   than those who did not receive TT (54\% vs. 64\%, p = 0.005), and those
   selected for IABP had a lower in-hospital mortality than those who did
   not receive IABP (50\% vs. 72\%, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, there was a
   significant difference in in-hospital mortality among the four treatment
   groups: TT + IABP (47\%), IABP only (52\%), TT only (63\%), no TT, no
   IABP (77\%) (p < 0.0001). Patients receiving early IABP (less than or
   equal to 6 h after thrombolytic therapy, n = 72) had in-hospital
   mortality similar to those with late IABP (53\% vs. 41\%, n = 64,
   respectively, p = 0.172). Revascularization rates differed among the
   four groups: no TT, no IABP (18\%); IABP only (70\%); TT only (20\%); TT
   and IABP (68\%, p < 0.0001); this influenced in-hospital mortality
   significantly (39\% with revascularization vs. 78\% without
   revascularization, p < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS Treatment of patients in cardiogenic shock due to
   predominant LV failure with TT, IABP and revascularization by PTCA/CABG
   was associated with lower in-hospital mortality rates than standard
   medical therapy in this Registry. For hospitals without
   revascularization capability, a strategy of early TT and IABP followed
   by immediate transfer for PTCA or CABG may be appropriate. However,
   selection bias is evident and further investigation is required. (J Am

Abstract = {{The goal of this research was to examine methods of automatically
   scoring patient pain drawings. Two hundred and fifty pain drawings were
   selected from the files of an orthopaedic surgeon who specializes in the
   treatment of low back pain patients. An artificial neural network was
   designed to score these drawings. The drawings were segmented into 85
   regions following dermatomal mappings and from these regions the percent
   area in pain in each was computed and used as the neural network input
   variables, With five outcome categories (scores) we obtained a
   classification sensitivity of 49\%, which is approximately as well as
   physician experts and discriminant analysis achieved using a subset of
   the same data. We conclude that an artificial neural network is well
   suited to automatically score patient pain drawings. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A new technique for ROI image reconstruction from projections using
   filter banks is reported in this paper. It is known that the convolution
   back projection operator, used for reconstruction of images from
   1D-projections, has a non-local filter which requires global projection
   data. In X-ray tomography, the exposure time of the object to harmful
   radiation is thereby increased. Recently, it has been proved that this
   filtering operation can be done on a chosen wavelet function instead of
   the projections. This localizes the filter and leads to ROI image
   reconstruction with reduced projections. This concept was extended using
   2D and 1D MRA filter banks, in which the filters are combined with the
   non-local CBP filter to get short length filters. In this paper it is
   proved that the presence of unwanted information in all previous
   algorithms is due to aliasing and a new technique is proposed for
   reconstruction without any aliasing. The proposed scheme is implemented
   using Shepp-Logan phantom head image and the performance is compared.}},

Abstract = {{The treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is still a
   challenging problem in the neurosurgical field. The deep-seated AVMs are
   a definite indication for radiosurgery for the small AVMs and with
   pre-embolisation for the large AVMs. The superficial AVMs are a good
   indication for surgery. In the case of small AVMs, surgery alone is a
   viable option; however, in the case of large AVMs, pre-operative
   embolisation is essential for prevention of NPPB (normal perfusion
   pressure breakthrough). Embolisalion alone cannot be used, except for a
   small AVM in the non-eloquent cortex. Preoperative embolisation makes
   surgery easy; however, It causes the surrounding cortex to infarct.
   Hyperperfusion may occur after the direct removal of high-flow large
   AVMs, therefore postoperative management will be difficult in these
   cases. In eloquent cortex minimally invasive surgery is more reliable
   with respect to the morbidity produced. Therefore in cases of small AVMs
   In the functional colter, direct surgery is the only choice. In cases of
   high-flow large AVMs, surgery and postoperative management are risky
   because at NPPB. Therefore pre-operative embolisation followed by
   surgery is a better choice. In high-flow AVMs, local blood circulation
   is not decreased by temporary clipping of the feeding arteries. So we
   recommend temporary clipping of all feeding arteries, even away from the
   nidus where it is easter to control bleeding. (C) 2000 Harcourt

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the automatic
   detection of deviance in introverts and extraverts. Event-related
   potentials were recorded to standard and deviant stimuli. These were
   presented either rapidly or slowly. Stimuli that are presented slowly
   may intrude into consciousness.
   Methods: Twenty subjects were tested and divided into introverted acid
   extraverted groups. A 500 Hz standard stimulus was presented on 85\% of
   trials. On the remaining 15\% of trials, a 750 Hz deviant was presented.
   In separate conditions, stimuli were presented rapidly (every 500 ms) or
   slowly (every 1500 ms). Subjects ignored the stimuli while reading.
   Results: The deviant stimulus elicited a mismatch negativity (MMN) in
   both conditions, No inter-group differences in the MMN emerged when a
   rapid rate of presentation was employed. When a slower rate was
   employed, a late negativity was significantly larger for the extraverted
   than the introverted group. This was followed by a late positive wave.
   Conclusion: The late negative-positive complex is thought to reflect
   intrusiveness. It would therefore appear that extraverts are more
   distractible than introverts when stimuli are presented slowly. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{This paper proposes application of a parallel-beam structure to the

   features: 1) the tip moves in parallel at the end; 2i) this structure
   converts the small displacement into the large concentrated strain; 3)
   even though some units are piled up, each unit does not interfere with
   another; and 4) the lateral rigidity is high. The authors analyzed these
   basic features by finite-element method analysis. We have proposed the
   parallel-beam sensor/actuator unit using this structure, and a new
   gyroscope, Here, we show two methods to improve its performance; these
   are the resonance frequency control and the mechanical coupling
   suppression. From this result, the proposed structure is suited for the

Abstract = {{Cyclopentenone prostaglandins (PGs) are known to arrest the cell cycle
   at the G(1) phase in vitro and to suppress tumor growth in vivo.
   However, their effects on neurons are unclear. Here, we report that some
   cyclopentenone PGs function as neurite outgrowth-promoting factors. They
   promoted neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells and from dorsal root ganglion
   explants but only in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF), We refer
   to these PGs as neurite outgrowth-promoting PGs (NEPPs), Through study
   of the structure-function relationship of NEPP1-10 and related
   compounds, we found that the cross-conjugated dienone moiety of NEPPs
   was essential for promoting neurite outgrowth, and NEPP10 was concluded
   to be the best candidate for drug development. We also investigated the
   intracellular mechanism of the promotion by NEPPs and obtained evidence
   that immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein/glucose-regulated
   protein 78 (BiP/GRP78) plays a role in the promotion, based on the
   following observations: Antisense nucleotides for BiP/GRP78 gene blocked
   the promotion of neurite outgrowth; BiP/GRP78 protein level increased in
   response to NEPPs; and overexpression of BiP/GRP78 protein by adenoviral
   gene transfer promoted the neurite outgrowth by NGF.}},

Abstract = {{Antibacterial kinetics of modified-release clarithromycin (CLA) and

   relation to their pharmacokinetic profile. The study was carried out in
   three strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A beta-hemolytic
   Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus
   influenzae, respectively, exposed to concentration gradients of CLA and
   AZI simulating human serum pharmacokinetics after administration of 500
   mg p.o. in a single dose. Bactericidal kinetics were assessed by
   counting the number of survivors before each change in concentration
   over a period of 36 h. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of
   CLA and AZI were evaluated at time 0 and after 36 h of exposure to
   antibiotics in the surviving organisms. The results showed that CLA and
   AZI, in the experimental conditions adopted, had different antibacterial
   kinetics. Moreover, the addition of the 14-OH metabolite of CLA at the
   same concentrations reached in human serum exerted a bactericidal effect
   against two strains of H. influenzae resistant to CLA and AZI. An
   increase in MICs was observed against S. pyogenes and H, influenzae,
   with higher values for AZI. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.}},

   of 8,400 bands was analysed. Eleven differentially expressed fragment
   cDNAs were reamplified and identified by nucleotide sequencing. Six of
   these could be identified as coding for proteins that may take part in
   virus reactivation and differentiation. The most striking finding was
   the induction of s-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY) expression. The

Month = {{FAL}},
Abstract = {{The paper deals with the key theoretical and methodological principles
   of Alexander Hirner's sociology. The analysis focuses on his concept of
   sociology as a study of social reality. Presented are not only basic
   ontological and epistemological assumptions but also components of
   Hirner's specific sociological optics. The reader witnesses the inner
   development of this thinking as he is reminded of the humanistic mission
   of Hirner's sociology.
   Hirner's model of social system is reconstructed with respect to its 12
   basic elements. The fundamental differences between systems of social
   variables and social systems are explained. Finally, his theory of an
   autokinetic social system is examined paying special attention to its
   theoretical and humanistic effect. The review of Hirner's theoretical
   approach is complemented by the set of concrete illustrations
   originating from his own researches of diverse social systems (village,
   region, factory, personality) and social processes, such as
   system-forming processes (e.g., sociability), self-regulational
   processes (e.g., social control) and self-organizational processes
   (e.g., personality potentials).}},

Abstract = {{The relation between blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular (LV)
   systolic function in systemic hypertension is controversial. We assessed
   the relation of LV midwall fractional shortening (FS) to 24-hour BP in
   1,702 never-treated hypertensive subjects (age 48 +/- 12 years), who
   underwent 24-hour BP monitoring and echocardiography, Stress-corrected
   endocardial and midwall FS (the latter calculated taking into account
   the epicardial migration of midwall during systole) were predicted in
   hypertensives on the basis of the values observed in 130 healthy
   normotensives (age 43 +/- 13 years, office BP 126/78 mm Hg). Subjects
   below the fifth percentile of observed-to-predicted FS had depressed LV
   function. The use of midwall FS resulted in an increase from 3.5\% to
   17.5\% in the proportion of patients with depressed chamber function.
   Compared with the group with normal function, subjects with low midwall
   LV function had similar office systolic BP (155 +/- 21 vs 154 +/- 17 mm
   Hg), but increased 24-hour systolic BP (140 +/- 17 VS 133 +/- 12 mm Hg,
   p <0.001). Midwall FS had a closer negative relation to 24-hour systolic
   BP than to office systolic BP (r = -0.27 vs -0.08, p <0.001), whereas
   this difference was nat apparent for diastolic BP (r = -0.23 vs -0.20).
   Compared with endocardial FS, midwall FS had a stronger inverse
   association to LV mass (r = -0.45 vs -0.16, p <0.001). Thus, an
   increased 24-hour BP load may chronically lead to depressed myocardial
   function in systemic hypertension in the absence of clinically overt
   heart disease. (C) 2000 by Excerpta Medico, Inc.}},

   magnetic domain structure. High resolution MFM images reveal detailed
   information on the domain wall. Additionally, we imaged magnetic domains
   in the dependence on the applied magnetic field. This detailed
   investigation gives new insight into the correlation between film
   topography and magnetic domain structures. Systematic magnetization
   measurements in-plane and out-of-plane have shown high anisotropy in our
   films. The out-of-plane magnetization determined as a function of the
   applied field reveals that the direction of the magnetic moments in the
   domain walls are out-of-plane, thus the domain walls are determined as
   180 degrees Bloch type. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), photoluminescence (PL), and
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements have been made on
   n-type silicon after implanting with 5.6 MeV Si3+ ions using doses of
   10(9)-10(14) cm(-2) and anneals at 525 and 750 degrees C. In all the
   samples, there is only a small dependence of the widths and energies of
   the PL zero-phonon lines on implantation dose, allowing the high
   resolution of PL to be exploited. In samples annealed at 525 degrees C,
   the PL intensity can provide a measure of the concentration of defects
   over the implantation range, 10(9)-10(12) cm(-2). Carbon-hydrogen
   complexes are identified as transient species with increasing dose, and
   the ``T{''} center is related to a DLTS trap 0.20 eV below the
   conduction band energy E-c. At the highest doses in these samples, TEM
   imaging shows the presence of nanometer-sized clusters, and the PL
   spectra show that many previously unreported defects exist in the
   implanted zone, in addition to two broad bands centered on similar to
   885 and similar to 930 MeV. The multiplicity of defects supports recent
   suggestions that a range of interstitial complexes is present in the
   annealed samples. Annealing at 750 degrees C produces complete recovery
   in both the DLTS and PL spectra for doses of less than 10(13) cm(-2). At
   higher doses, \{113\} self-interstitial aggregates are observed in TEM,
   along with the ``903{''} PL signal associated with the \{113\} defects,
   and the E-c-0.33 eV ``KA{''} DLTS trap. These data support the recent
   identification of that trap with the \{113\} defects. The well-resolved
   PL spectra show that many previously reported defects also exist in
   samples implanted with a dose of 10(14) cm(-2) and annealed at 750
   degrees C, again implying the presence of a range of interstitial
   complexes. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Purpose: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of a
   continuous infusion of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor amrinone on
   mucosal villus blood flow in a normotensive model of endotoxemia.
   Materials and Methods: Twenty-four anesthetized and ventilated rats
   underwent laparotomy, and an ileal portion was exteriorized and opened
   by an antimesenteric incision. The ileal segment was fixed on a
   plexiglass stage with the mucosal surface upward. Microcirculatory
   parameters were assessed by intravital videomicroscopy. The animals were
   randomly assigned to receive one of three treatments: infusion of
   Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 2 mg/kg/h) without
   phosphodiesterase inhibitor pretreatment (LPS group); or infusion of LPS
   with amrinone pretreatment (40 mu g/kg/min, start 30 minutes before LPS
   infusion) (amrinone group), or infusion of eqivalent volumes of NaCl
   0.9\% (control group), Macrohemodynamic parameters (MAP, HR) and
   microhemodynamic parameters of ileal mucosa (mean diameter of central
   arterioles = D-A and mean erythrocyte velocity within the arterioles =
   V-E) were measured 30 minutes before and at 0, 60, and 120 minutes after
   induction of endotoxemia. Mucosal villus blood flow was calculated from
   D-A and V-E.
   Results: In this normotensive endotoxemia model, MAP remained stable in
   the control and the LPS group but significantly decreased in the
   amrinone group. The endotoxin-induced decrease of V-E and D-A of central
   arterioles of mucosal villi could be attenuated and prevented,
   respectively. Thus, the endotoxin-induced decrease of mucosal villus
   blood flow was diminished but not fully restored by amrinone infusion.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that amrinone during an early stage of
   sepsis is of limited value. It attenuates mucosal hypoperfusion but
   contributes to systemic hypotension. Copyright (C) 2000 by W.B. Saunders

Abstract = {{We determined the solution structure of two 27-nt RNA hairpins and their

   spectroscopy. The RNA hairpins used in this study are the P4 region from
   Escherichia coli RNase P RNA and a C-to-U mutant that confers altered
   divalent metal-ion specificity (Ca2+ replaces Mg2+) for catalytic
   activity of this ribozyme, Co(NH3)(6)(3+) is a useful spectroscopic
   probe for Mg(H2O)(6)(2+)-binding sites because both complexes have
   octahedral symmetry and have similar radii. The thermodynamics of
   binding to both RNA hairpins was studied using chemical shift changes
   upon titration with Mg2+, Ca2+, and Co(NH3)(6)(3+). We found that the
   equilibrium binding constants for each of the metal ions was essentially
   unchanged when the P4 model RNA hairpin was mutated, although the NMR
   structures show that the RNA hairpins adopt different conformations. In
   the C-to-U mutant a C.G base pair is replaced by U.G, and the conserved
   bulged uridine in the P4 wild-type stem shifts in the 3' direction by 1
   nt, Intermolecular NOE cross-peaks between Co(NH3)(6)(3+) and RNA
   protons were used to locate the site of Co(NH3)(6)(3+) binding to both
   RNA hairpins. The metal ion binds in the major groove near a bulge loop,
   but is shifted 5' by more than 1 bp in the mutant. The change of the
   metal-ion binding site provides a possible explanation for changes in
   catalytic activity of the mutant RNase P in the presence of Ca2+.}},

Abstract = {{RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES. The extravasation properties of two
   macromolecular MR imaging contrast media (CM) in relation to structural
   differences of the terminal vascular bed were investigated to determine
   whether differentiation between normal (physiological) and tumor
   (pathological) tissue can be achieved by means of extravasation
   characteristics.
   METHODS. Gd-DTPA-polylysine (50 kD, CM1) and Gd-DOTA cascade polymer
   (Gadomer 17; 20 kD, CM2) were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate
   (FITC) to enable in vivo fluorescence microscopy of the
   microcirculation. After implantation of a dorsal skinfold chamber and 7
   days (range, 6-8) after induction of an amelanotic melanoma (A-Mel-3),
   14 male hamsters weighing 85 g (range, 70-95 g) received 200 mu mol/kg
   of CM1 by intravenous injection into the jugular vein, CM2 was similarly
   investigated after an interval of 24 hours. Fluorescence microscopy was
   performed in areas of subcutaneous tissue, striated muscle, and tumor
   tissue. Microscopic images Were registered by a charge-coupled-device
   video camera and transferred to a video system, Distribution intensities
   of CM were evaluated on a digitally based measurement system,A control
   investigation was performed with FITC-dextran (150 kD),
   RESULTS. Gd-DTPA-polylysine showed no extravasation into physiological
   tissue for the first 10 minutes after injection. After this period,
   however, the first signs of leakage became apparent. Gd-DOTA cascade
   polymer was extravasated after 5 minutes into the tumor-free tissue, In
   tumor capillaries, Gd-DTPA-polylysine could be detected in the
   extravasal space as well as in physiological tissue after 15 minutes,
   After injection of Gd-DOTA cascade polymer, direct leakage from tumor
   capillaries was observed, with a contrast maximum between tumor and
   surrounding tissue occurring 3 to 5 minutes after CM injection, Good
   delineation of tumor vascularization from striated muscle and
   subcutaneous tissue was achieved.
   CONCLUSIONS. The CM studied showed different microvascular permeation
   properties. Faster leakage of Gd-DOTA cascade polymer was observed in
   areas with neoplastic tumor vessels, whereas extravasation in
   physiological tissue was detected after a period of 5 minutes.
   Gd-DTPA-polylysine demonstrated nonspecific leakage at later time
   points.}},

Abstract = {{In sexual abuse cases children's testimony plays an important role. To
   evaluate the quality of a witness' statement, the interviewing
   techniques and the context of the investigative interview have to be
   considered. The interviewing techniques from the highly publicized day
   care abuse cases during the 1980s have been repeatedly found to be
   directive and suggestive. Many of these interviewing techniques, such as
   positive and negative reinforcement, inducing stereotypes and repeated
   questioning within and between interviews, have been shown empirically
   to elicit false statements from young children. Many different interview
   guidelines point to this problem and suggest alternative interviewing
   techniques.
   Overall, there are few quantitative studies of interviewer behavior in
   sexual abuse cases. None of these has compared the interviewer behavior
   in a day care abuse case with interviewer behavior in ``normal{''}
   sexual abuse cases by the Child Protective Service (CPS) in the USA. A
   first study compared behavior in these two contexts and confirmed the
   notion that the amount of suggestive interviewing techniques is
   significantly higher in a sample of day care abuse interviews than in a
   sample of CPS interviews. These results support the former statements of
   Ceci \& Bruck (1995) that interviews with child witnesses in sexual
   abuse cases, especially in day care ritual abuse cases, include
   suggestive interviewing techniques. These have to be discussed
   considering their impact on statements of child witnesses.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-angiogenesis therapy with thalidomide has been reported to have

   angiogenesis and cytogenetic abnormalities in 34 patients with active
   MM. BM microvessel density (MVD), as determined by staining with
   anti-CD34, was significantly higher in MM (MVD: 221 +/- 94 per mm (2))
   than in controls (80 +/- 36; P < 0.0001). In patients with the presence
   of at least one unfavourable cytogenetic abnormality (deletion of 13q14,
   deletion of 17p13, aberrations of 11q), a significantly increased BM MVD
   was observed (254 +/- 93 vs. 160 +/- 60 in patients with absence of

Abstract = {{The perceptual interference effect refers to the fact that object
   identification is directly related to the amount of information
   available at initial exposure. The present article investigated whether
   perceptual interference would dissipate when a short, unfilled interval
   was introduced between exposures to a degraded object. Across three
   experiments using both musical and pictorial stimuli, identification
   performance increased directly with the length of the unfilled interval.
   Consequently, significant perceptual interference was obtained only when
   the interval between exposures was relatively short (<500 msec for
   melodies; <300 msec for pictures). These results are consistent with
   explanations that attribute perceptual interference to increased
   perceptual noise created by exposures to highly degraded objects. The
   data also suggest that perceptual interference is mediated by systems
   that are not consciously controlled by the subject and that perceptual
   interference in the visual domain decays more rapidly than perceptual
   interference in the auditory domain.}},

Abstract = {{Why do racial differences in many indicators of mental and emotional

   emotional well-being are influenced by aspects of the social context,
   including experiences of unfair treatment and the concentration of
   households with incomes below the poverty level, and that differential
   exposure to these factors influences racial differences in mental
   well-being. We analyze the reporting of psychological distress and life
   satisfaction in a multistage area probability sample of 1,139 African
   American and white residents of the Detroit metropolitan area aged 18
   and older. Both psychological distress and life satisfaction are
   significantly associated with exposure to unfair treatment and with the
   proportion of households in the census block group that were below the
   poverty level. Racial differences in psychological distress and life
   satisfaction were eliminated or reversed once differentials in the
   percent of households living below the poverty line and exposure to
   unfair treatment were accounted for. These findings contribute to a
   growing body of evidence that ``race{''} effects operate through
   multiple pathways that include race-based residential segregation and
   its attendant economic disinvestment at the community level, and
   interpersonal experiences of unfair treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Dicot leaf growth is characterized by partly transient tip-to-base
   gradients of growth processes, structure and function. These gradients
   develop dynamically and interact with dynamically developing stress
   conditions like drought, In Ricinus communis plants growing under
   well-watered and drought conditions growth rates peaked during the late
   night and minimal Values occurred in the late afternoon, During this
   diurnal course the leaf base always showed much higher rates than the
   leaf tip. The amplitude of this diurnal course decreased when leaves
   approached maturity and during drought stress without any significant
   alteration of the diurnal pattern and it increased during the first days
   after rewatering. Unique relationships between leaf size and cytological
   structure were observed, This provided the framework for the analysis of
   changes in assimilation, transpiration and dark respiration,
   chlorophyll, protein, carbohydrate, and amino acid concentrations, and
   of activities of sink-source-related enzymes at the leaf tip and base
   during leaf development in well-watered and drought-stressed plants, Gas
   exchange was dominated by physiological rather than by anatomical
   properties (stomatal density),Tip-to-base gradients in carbohydrate
   concentrations per dry weight and sink-source-related enzymes were
   absent, whereas significant gradients were found in amino acid
   concentrations per dry weight, During drought stress, growing leaves
   developed source function at smaller leaf size, before specific
   physiological adaptations to drought occurred, The relevance of the
   developmental status of individual leaves for the drought-stress
   response and of the structural changes for the biochemical composition
   changes is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To examine the impact of laparoscopic nephrectomy and
   recipient education on the proportion of kidney recipients who could
   identify a potential live donor, and on the live donor (LD)
   transplantation rate,
   Summary Background Data Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) results in
   less postoperative surgical pain, a shorter hospital stay, and quicker
   recovery than the standard open donor nephrectomy (ODN). The authors
   hypothesized that the availability of this less invasive surgical
   technique would enhance the willingness of family and friends to donate.
   Methods The study population consisted of 3,298 end-stage renal disease
   patients referred for kidney transplant evaluation between November 1991
   and February 2000, divided into three groups. The first group received
   no formal LD education and had only ODN available. The second group
   received formal education about the LD process and had only ODN
   available. The third group had both formal LD education and LDN
   avail-able. Records were examined to determine what proportion of each
   group had any potential donors tissue-typed, and the rate at which they
   received an LD transplant.
   Results Before LDN availability and formal LD education, only 35.1\% of
   referrals found a potential donor, and only 12.2\% received an LD
   transplant within 3 years. Institution of a formal education program
   increased the volunteer rate to 39.0\%, and 16.5\% received an LD
   transplant. When LDN became available, 50\% of patients were able to
   find at least one potential donor, and within 3 years 24.7\% received an
   LD transplant. Regression analysis indicated that availability of LDN
   was independently associated with a 1.9 relative risk of receiving an LD
   transplant. Kapian-Meier death-censored 1- and 3-year graft survival
   rates for ODN transplants were 95.8\% and 90.6\%, versus 97.5\% and
   94.8\% for LDN.
   Conclusions The availability of LDN and an LD family education program
   has doubled the live donor transplantation rate, and outcomes remain
   excellent.}},

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{The present studies were performed to determine if a protective diet has
   different effects on the metabolic activity or function of islet cells,
   as well as the metabolic activity of mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells
   and spleen cells, from BioBreeding (BB) rats. Diabetes-prone BB (BBdp)
   rats and control non-diabetes-prone BB (BBc) rats were fed for about 20
   days either a mainly plant-based diabetogenic diet, NIH-07 (NIH). or a
   protective semipurified diet with hydrolyzed casein (HC) as the amino
   acid source. At 6 to 8 weeks of age, BBdp rats had high plasma D-glucose
   and low insulin concentrations, low insulin content, and low metabolic
   and secretory responses to D-glucose in isolated pancreatic islets.
   Islet metabolism, as measured by accumulation of C-14-acidic
   metabolites, amino acids, and the ratio of D-{[}U-C-14]glucose oxidation
   and D-{[}5-H-3]glucose utilization was increased in control rats fed HC
   (P < .05); a similar trend in BBdp rats was not significant. Feeding the
   HC diet increased islet insulin content (P < .01) by 13\% in BBdp and
   23\% in BBc rats; other metabolic and hormonal variables were
   unaffected. Compared with BBc rats, BBdp rats displayed higher rates of
   L-{[}U-C-14]glutamine oxidation, D-{[}5-H-3]glucose utilization, and
   D-{[}U-C-14]glucose oxidation in MLN cells, but not in splenocytes.
   There was a dramatic decrease of L-{[}U-C-14]glutamine oxidation in MLN
   cells from BBc and BBdp rats fed HC. Glycolysis was decreased in control
   rats. We conclude that the protection afforded by feeding BBdp rats a HC
   diet is associated with increased insulin in target beta cells and
   downregulation of metabolic activity in gut-associated MLN cells.
   Metabolic activity in splenocytes, cells representative of the systemic
   immune system, was less affected. These data suggest that diet-induced
   metabolic changes occur in the islets and nearby cells of the gut immune
   system in the period before classic insulitis. Changes in the islets
   were smaller in comparison to the dramatic remodeling of nutrient
   catabolism in MLN cells. MLN downregulation may reflect baseline
   metabolic activity in the absence of diabetogenic (or other) food
   antigens and further highlights an important interaction between
   diabetogenic food antigens and the gut immune tissues. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Evidence is given that implication (and its special case, negation)
   carry the logical strength of a system of formal logic. This is done by
   proving normalization and cut elimination for a system based on
   combinatory logic or lambda-calculus with logical constants for and. or,
   all, and exists, but with none for either implication or negation. The
   proof is strictly finitary, showing that this system is very weak. The
   results can be extended to a ``classical{''} version of the system. They
   can also be extended to a system with a restricted set of rules for
   implication: the result is a system of intuitionistic higher-order BCK
   logic with unrestricted comprehension and without restriction on the
   rules for disjunction elimination and existential elimination. The
   result does not extend to the classical version of the BCK logic.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The detection of the human group B rotavirus (HuGBR) CAL
   strain from India has given us an opportunity to design suitable primers
   for the detection of HuGBR since CAL is the second HuGBR detected until
   now, the Chinese Adult Diarrhoea Rotavirus (ADRV) being the first
   reported human pathogen belonging to this group of viruses. The primers
   described here may thus be used for the detection of human group B
   rotaviruses by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) in a diagnostic
   laboratory. Objective: To establish a set of primers suitable for the
   detection of various genes of human group B rotaviruses using a rapid
   RT-PCR assay. Study design: Until recently, the Chinese ADRV strain was
   the only HuGBR strain that had been partially sequenced by cloning
   various viral genes using vector-specific primers. Consequently, there
   are very few reports in the literature describing primers that may be
   used for the detection of HuGBR, viruses using RT-PCR in a clinical
   laboratory. The sequences of various genes from the ADRV strain that had
   been submitted to the nucleotide sequence database GenBank were analyzed
   in order to design several putative detection primer pairs for an RT-PCR
   assay. The rationale was to amplify the cognate genes from five isolates
   of the HuGBR CAL strain (CAL-1 to GAL-5) that have been detected to date
   from India. Primers that resulted in a specific product of the expected
   size from the CAL isolates were used to standardize a protocol for
   amplifying various genes of the CAL isolates under identical reaction
   conditions. Results: Out of several synthetic oligonucleotides designed,
   12 were found to be satisfactory for the amplification of gene segments
   4,5, 6, 7, and 9 from the five CAL isolates and are presented here. A
   set of previously described primers that have been shown to be specific
   for human group B rotavirus gene segment 8 were also found to amplify
   the cognate gene from the CAL isolates. All the reactions were carried
   out using the same thermal cycling conditions. Conclusions: The extreme
   virulence potential of HuGBR has been documented in several epidemics in
   China. Until recently, the Chinese ADRV strain was the only known HuGBr
   strain. As there have not been any reports of HuGBR infections outside
   China, there are no consensus nucleotide sequences available for HuGBR
   that may be used to validate primers for the detection of HuGBR. Here we
   report a set of 12 primer sequences that were designed from ADRV
   sequences and also found to amplify various genes from the different CAL
   isolates and hence may represent consensus primers suitable for the
   detection of HuGBR. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Pippard ineffectiveness condition -that electrons strongly
   scattering from impurities and defects are ineffective in scattering
   phonons- is based on the assumption that electron scatterers vibrate in
   the same way as the host lattice. Then the relaxation rate of a
   low-energy phonon with the wave vector q is 1/tau(ph-e) similar to
   u(2)q(2)l/v(F) (u and v(F) are the sound velocity and Fermi velocity, l
   is the electron mean free path). Boundaries and defects moving
   differently from host lattice drastically change the character of the
   interference between scattering processes and increase the
   phonon-electron coupling. In the presence of the quasistatic potential
   the phonon relaxation is (q(2)lL)(-1) times faster: 1/tau(ph-e) similar
   to u(2)/(v(F)L) (L is the electron mean free path with respect to
   scattering from the quasistatic potential). Analogous effect is expected

Abstract = {{Vegetative adults of Acetabularia acetabulum (L.) Silva were studied as
   a model system for subcellular patterning in plants, and a description
   of several phenotypic and physiological characteristics that reveal
   patterns of subcellular differentiation in this unicellular macroalga
   was undertaken. Initially, calcification patterns were studied. Under
   favorable conditions, the rhizoid and most of the stalk calcified. Only
   the apical 10-20\% of the stalk and a small region adjacent to the
   rhizoid remained uncalcified. Calcification in algae has been reported
   to result from a biologically mediated local increase in alkalinity. To
   test this model extracellular pH and extracellular hydrogen ion
   gradients were examined with ion-selective, self-referencing,
   electrodes. In the light, A. acetabulum displayed a general pattern of
   extracellular alkalinity around the entire alga, although in some
   individuals the region near the rhizoid and the rhizoid itself displayed
   extracellular acidity. Acetabularia acetabulum also displayed net
   hydrogen ion influx at the rhizoid and the apical half of the stalk,
   variable flux in the lower part of the stalk, and net hydrogen ion
   efflux at the base of the stalk next to the rhizoid. The lack of
   complete correlation between external pH patterns and calcification
   suggests that other factors contribute to the control of calcification
   in this alga. To examine whether net hydrogen ion flux patterns
   correlated with photosynthetic or respiration patterns, oxygen flux was
   measured along the stalk using self-referencing O-2 electrodes.
   Photosynthetic oxygen evolution occurred at comparable levels throughout
   the stalk, with less evolution in the rhizoid. Respiration mainly
   occurred mar and in the rhizoid, with less O-2 consumption occurring
   more apically along the stalk. Our studies of calcification patterns,
   net hydrogen ion flux and O-2 flux revealed several overlapping patterns
   of subcellular differentiation in A. acetabulum.}},

Abstract = {{To evidence a collagen synthesis and identify which type(s) of collagen
   is present in hemocytes from the mollusc Haliotis tuberculata, we have
   performed three separate approaches, namely, de novo synthesis by
   cultured cells, immunological approaches, and northern blot analysis. We
   demonstrated first that after 40-hr labeling, the de novo synthesis of
   collagen in the cell layer of cultured hemocytes represents 9.48 +/-
   1.25\% with respect to the total {[}H-3]proline-labeled protein
   synthesis. In addition, IGF-I elicited a significant stimulation of
   collagen synthesis in cultured hemocytes in a dose-dependent manner from
   10(-10) to 10(-8) M. The maximal stimulation (10(-9) M) induced an
   increase of 286 +/- 56\% with respect to 100\% control. By
   immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting, we showed that hemocytes present
   immunoreactive molecules to antibodies directed against the type I
   fibrillar collagen. In addition, using as a probe Hf 677 corresponding
   to a human proal(I) collagen cDNA and which encompasses the (Gly-X-Y)
   repeated sequence found in all Metazoa, four collagen transcripts of
   approximately 6.4, 5, 2.2, and 2 kb in length have been detected. These
   data suggest the presence of fibrillar type I collagen in hemocytes and
   are compatible with the concept that these cells are involved in the
   extracellular matrix deposition, a cardinal function in tissue repair as
   well as in developmental processes. Our model may appear as an excellent
   system to study the role of growth factors on the regulation of collagen
   synthesis by molluscan hemocytes. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   atmosphere at 730 K leads to Ni2+ cation reduction to the metal state
   and to the formation of acidic hydroxy groups. Nevertheless, Ni2+
   cations can be regenerated by reoxidation of the reduced sample with
   oxygen at 670 K and further evacuation at 870 K. Thermal destruction of
   NiO in the reoxidized sample also proceeds on acidic hydroxy groups, but
   the temperature of this process is higher than the temperature of oxide
   decomposition in the initial NiNaY zeolite. The IR spectra of molecular
   hydrogen complexes with Ni2+ cations were observed for the first time. A
   considerable decrease in the H-H stretching vibration frequency for the
   coordinated molecules (up to 210 cm(-1)) can be explained by electron
   density redistribution between a hydrogen molecule and the cation in the
   complex.}},

Abstract = {{According to a popular hypothesis, short-term memories are stored as
   persistent neural activity maintained by synaptic feedback loops. This
   hypothesis has been formulated mathematically in a number of recurrent
   network models. Here we study an abstraction of these models, a single
   neuron with a synapse onto itself, or autapse. This abstraction cannot
   simulate the way in which persistent activity patterns are distributed
   over neural populations in the brain. However, with proper tuning of
   parameters, it does reproduce the continuously graded, or analog, nature
   of many examples of persistent activity. The conditions for tuning are
   derived for the dynamics of a conductance-based model neuron with a slow
   excitatory autapse. The derivation uses the method of averaging to
   approximate the spiking model with a nonspiking, reduced model.
   Short-term analog memory storage is possible if the reduced model is
   approximately linear and if its feedforward bias and autapse strength
   are precisely tuned.}},

Abstract = {{The solubility of both beta-whitlockite and alpha-whitlockite has been
   experimentally determined between 1200 and 1400 degrees C at 1 atm using
   a wide range of natural rocks and synthetic mixtures as starting
   materials. The solubility of both phases depends strongly on melt
   composition, decreasing systematically with increasing silica content
   and aluminosity. Experiments also show that alpha-whitlockite contains
   much more Na (0.5-6.3 wt.\% Na2O) than beta-whitlockite (<0.5 wt.\%
   Na2O). Lunar low- and high-Ti mare basalts are far below the saturation
   limit of whitlockite and need 90-99\% fractionation of olivine,
   pyroxene, plagioclase, and ilmenite to precipitate whitlockite, whereas
   KREEP basalts need less but at least 80-95\% fractionation. It is shown
   here that both lunar mafic and felsic immiscible melts, the former
   enriched in Fe, REE, P, U, and Th, and the latter in Si and K, are
   undersaturated in whitlockite, and further fractionation of fayalite,
   ilmenite, plagioclase, and K-feldspar is required to reach the
   saturation limit. Thus, lunar whitlockite must have crystallised from
   highly fractionated residual melts. Lunar whitlockite, which is low in
   Na (0.09-0.49 wt.\% Na2O), crystallised originally as beta-whitlockite
   from low-temperature residual melts. In contrast, meteoritic whitlockite
   contains more Na (0.5-3.3 wt.\% Na2O and therefore, had formed initially
   as alpha-whitlockite at higher temperatures and transformed into
   beta-whitlockite upon cooling. It is proposed that the interior of the
   Martian mantle and crust was enriched in volatiles in its early history
   (4.6-1.3 Ga), but has become essentially dry and very depleted in water
   and halogens at least since the last 180 Ma. Calculations show that the
   Earth's crust and mantle as a whole contains only 5\% of the total P of
   the Earth, and the remaining 95\% is stored in the core. In contrast,
   the crust and mantle of Mars are much more enriched in P and contain as
   much as 43\% of the Martian total P budget, with the remaining 57\%
   being distributed in the relatively smaller Martian core. This
   difference in the distribution of P among planetary shells must have
   resulted from a more oxidising environment during the accretion and
   early evolution of Mars compared to the more reducing conditions under
   which Earth formed. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Title = {{Tamoxifen enhances myoepithelial cell suppression of human breast
   carcinoma progression in vitro by two different effector mechanisms}},
Journal = {{CANCER LETTERS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{157}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{133-144}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Our previous studies have indicated that myoepithelial cells surrounding
   ductal and acinar epithelium of glandular organs, such as the breast,
   exert multiple paracrine suppressive effects on incipient and developing
   cancers that arise from this epithelium. Myoepithelial cells and derived
   cell lines (HMS 1-6) exert these effects through the secretion of a
   number of different effector molecules that exert anti-invasive,
   anti-proliferative, and anti-angiogenic activities. Since previous basic
   and clinical studies have examined the role of estrogen agonists and
   antagonists on human breast cancer cells and because issues of hormone
   replacement therapy (HRT) and tamoxifen chemoprevention are such timely
   issues in breast cancer, we wondered whether or not hormonal
   manipulations might affect myoepithelial cells in vitro as far as their
   paracrine suppressive activities on breast cancer were concerned. The
   present in vitro study demonstrates that treatment of myoepithelial
   cells with tamoxifen but not 17 beta -estradiol increases both maspin
   secretion and invasion-blocking ability. Furthermore tamoxifen but not
   17 beta -estradiol increases inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
   expression and nitric oxide (NO) production by myoepithelial cells when
   they are co-cultured with conditioned media from or breast carcinoma
   cells directly. This increased myoepithelial NO exerts both autocrine
   and paracrine antiproliferative effects which can be blocked by
   inhibition of iNOS. 17 beta -Estradiol, however, competes with all of
   these suppressive effects of tamoxifen suggesting that the mechanism of
   tamoxifen action is estrogen receptor mediated. Myoepithelial cells lack
   ER-alpha but express ER-beta. Tamoxifen, but not 17 beta -estradiol,
   increases AP-1 CAT but not ERE-CAT activity. Again, 17 beta -estradiol
   competes with the transcription-activating effects of tamoxifen. These
   experiments collectively suggest that the actions of tamoxifen on the
   increased secretion of maspin and increased production of NO by
   myoepithelial cells are mediated through ER-beta and the
   transcription-activation of an ER-dependent AP-1 response element. (C)

Abstract = {{The K562 cell line undergoes megakaryocytic differentiation in response
   to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation. This event
   correlates with mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, cell cycle
   arrest, and expression of the Egr-1 transcription factor. We have
   isolated K562 cells that are resistant to the growth-inhibitory action
   of PMA. Molecular characterization demonstrates that PMA resistance is
   downstream from PMA-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein
   kinase pathway. Although the levels of Egr-1 expression and cyclic
   AMP-responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation are comparable in
   wild-type and PMA-resistant clones in response to PMA, the expression of
   megakaryocytic cell surface marker CD41 is detected only in the
   wild-type cells, The lack of differentiation of the PMA-resistant clones
   correlates with a failure of the PMA-treated cells to induce
   dephosphorylation and down-regulation of the retinoblastoma protein.
   These cells may provide a useful model system to distinguish those
   events that are connected to cell cycle arrest from those involved in
   the differentiation program initiated by PMA.}},

Abstract = {{Senescent mice exhibit decreased numbers of pre-B cells in the bone

   marrow of 18-27 months old BALB/c mice after stimulation with IL-7. Both
   lambda 5 and VpreB expression were decreased at the mRNA level as
   indicated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR; this suggests that the reduced
   surrogate light chains seen in senescent B cell precursors result from
   dysfunctional transcriptional regulation. The transcription of surrogate
   light chains is regulated, in part, by E2A (E47) gene products. Levels
   of E2A proteins, including E47, were decreased in senescent B cell
   precursors by up to 90\%. Reduced E2A (E47) expression and subsequent
   reduced transcription of the surrogate light chain components lambda 5

Abstract = {{Carbon and oxygen contamination on the Ti surface strongly influences
   hydrogen absorption and desorption, and it can even passivate the
   surface completely. The effect of C and O on the hydrogen absorption and
   thermal release on Ti films was investigated by using high-energy
   non-Rutherford backscattering and elastic recoil detection techniques.
   The experimental results show that the concentration gradient in the
   region of about 300 nm near the surface is very large due to the joint
   contamination of about 1.26 X 10(16) atoms/cm(2) of C and 2.5 x 1016
   atoms/cm(2) of O; also, the thermal releasing temperature increased
   greatly. A thin Ni film coated on the Ti film may considerably reduce
   the contamination of gaseous impurities, in particular C, and prevents
   further oxidation and improve the absorption and desorption of hydrogen.

Abstract = {{The work reported here investigated whether the extent of McGurk effect
   differs according to the vowel context, and differs when cross-modal
   vowels are matched or mismatched in Japanese. Two audio-visual
   experiments were conducted to examine the process of audio-visual
   phonetic-feature extraction and integration. The first experiment was
   designed to compare the extent of the McGurk effect in Japanese in three
   different vowel contexts. The results indicated that the effect was
   largest in the /i/ context, moderate in the /a/ context, and almost
   nonexistent in the /u/ context. This suggests that the occurrence of
   McGurk effect depends on the characteristics of vowels and the visual
   cues from their articulation. The second experiment measured the McGurk
   effect in Japanese with cross-modal matched and mismatched vowels, and
   showed that, except with the /u/ sound, the effect was larger when the
   Vowels were matched than when they were mismatched. These results
   showed, again, that the extent of McGurk effect depends on vowel context
   and that auditory information processing before phonetic judgment plays
   an important role in cross-modal feature integration.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The lymph node is an integral component of the immune system
   and the major site of antigen-dependent lymphocyte proliferation and
   differentiation. Development of animal models possessing functional
   primary human lymph nodes will have a significant impact on research in
   lymphopoiesis and immune response. To date, successful transplantation
   of primary human lymph nodes in rodents has not yet been reported. This
   work was undertaken to develop a reliable methodology to engraft primary
   human fetal Lymph nodes in immunodeficient mice,
   Materials and Methods. Three different sets of parameters, including
   three different transplantation sites in the mice, two different strains
   of immunodeficient mice, and two different preconditioning regimens,
   were evaluated, The growth characteristics of the implanted primary
   human fetal lymph nodes were examined 3 months after transplantation by
   histologic, immunocytochemical, and flow cytometric methods.
   Results. Transplantation of primary human fetal lymph nodes into
   subcutaneous pouches in the ears in severe combined immunodeficiency
   (SCID) mice preconditioned with etoposide reproducibly give rise to
   >80\% engraftment, The engrafted primary human fetal lymph nodes undergo
   massive growth (>200-fold) and retain the same histology and cellular
   composition as fresh human fetal Lymph nodes from the same donors.
   Conclusions. We report, for the first time, the development of a
   reliable methodology to successfully engraft human fetal lymph node in
   SCID mice, The engrafted human lymph nodes are visible and accessible to
   experimental manipulations. This SCID-hu mouse model with human lymph
   node should provide a physiologically relevant system to investigate
   lymphopoiesis, immunologic response, and virus-mediated
   immunosuppression. (C) 2000 International Society for Experimental

Abstract = {{Since fault current tends to increase with electrical power demand,
   current-limiting technology for overcurrents has been investigated. As a
   promising candidate, the superconducting fault-current limiter (SC-FCL)
   is expected to be introduced into power systems. One of the most
   important features of the SC-FCL is recovery to a normal operating mode,
   that is, superconducting state rapidly after current interruption. In
   this paper, the recovery time of an SC-FCL introduced into a
   distribution power system is discussed. To obtain the fundamental data,
   the recovery time of short Nb-Ti superconducting cables was measured. We
   developed a method of calculation of the recovery time and it was
   confirmed that the calculated results agree with the measured ones. We
   studied the recovery characteristics of an SC-FCL in a 6.6-kV
   distribution system for the short-circuit fault near the substation. We
   considered 3 and 17 cycles as the period from fault occurrence until
   current interruption. As a result, the superconducting cable length
   required to recover within the high-speed reclosing time of 0.3 s are
   more that 270 and 480 m for 3 and 17 cycles, respectively. (C) 2000

   (the class of distributions on (0,infinity) that have regularly varying

   deals with decomposition problem of distributions in D(alpha) related to
   MS convolution. A representation of a regularly varying function F of
   the following form is investigated: F(x)=Sigma (n-1)(k=0) b(k)f(a(k)x),
   where f is a measurable function and a and b(k) (k=1,...,n-1) are real

Abstract = {{Purpose: This paper, part 2 of the two-part paper, reviews
   return-to-work outcomes among individuals with coronary heart disease,
   who participated in an experimental field study reported in part 1 of
   the two-part paper. Study results reflected specific job stressors
   associated with physical and mental demands among various job tasks.
   Trends suggest that personality characteristics commonly associated with
   `type a' personalities and cardiac disease risk factors may also serve
   as positive forces that influence return-to-work activity.
   Methods/Results: Relatively high levels of job satisfaction were
   reported among most experimental subjects. Despite having high
   return-to-work expectations, these patients lacked specific strategies
   and resources to facilitate a concrete return to work action plan.
   Conclusion: The researchers conclude that it is essential for cardiac
   rehabilitation staff, when creating a return to work transition for
   their cardiac patients, to explore the physical and psychosocial
   dimensions of jobs, the receptivity of the employer, and the
   accommodations needed to promote a safe and timely return to work.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the structural and electric properties of TiB2 thin
   films produced by RF sputtering on glass substrates. The films are
   composed of the TiB2 small crystallites as well as the Brich amorphous
   phase, which is resulting from the Brich composition of the films. The
   resistivities of the films vary from 239 to 323 mu Omega cm depending on
   the RF power and the sputter time. These values are considerably larger
   than that of a bulk sample. The temperature dependence of the
   resisitivities is found to be carrier concentration dependent. However,
   the very high carrier densities (0.7-1.2 X 10(22)/cm(3)) and the
   relatively small mobilities (2.3-5.7 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) were obtained,
   suggesting that the conduction carrier might behave like nearly free
   electrons. We discuss these features in conjunction with the
   microstructure of the films. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To characterize the active phase of labor in triplet
   pregnancies and compare it with gestational age-matched twins and
   singletons.
   METHODS: Active phase rates were calculated beginning at 5 cm of
   dilation for women with triplet gestations longer than 24 weeks who
   labored and reached the second stage. Twin and singleton cohorts that
   also completed the first stage of labor were matched for gestational age
   at delivery (+/-1 week), parity, and epidural use. Intrapartum variables
   included oxytocin use (induction or augmentation, duration of infusion,
   and maximum dosage), cervical dilation at membrane rupture, and active
   phase dilation rate.
   RESULTS: Thirty-two triplet pregnancies met inclusion criteria between
   January 1994 and September 1998 and were each compared with twin and
   singleton cases in a 1:2 ratio. Triplet and twin active phase rates,
   while similar (1.8 versus 1.7 cm/hour, respectively), were significantly
   lower than the mean singleton dilation rate (2.3 cm/hour, P =.02). No
   other intrapartum variables differed between the three groups. Despite
   controlling for gestational age at delivery, mean birth weights were
   significantly higher in singletons and correspondingly lower in ttl,ins
   and triplets (2493 versus 2112 and 1968 g, respectively; P =.001). An
   analysis of active phase dilation rates as a function of the cumulative
   birth weight per pregnancy demonstrated an inverse correlation, with
   slower progress in active labor associated with increasing total fetal
   weight (R = -.24; P =.002).
   CONCLUSIONS: Triplet and twin active phase dilation proceeds at a slower
   rate than that observed in singleton pregnancies. The 1 are of active
   phase dilation is inversely correlated to total fetal weight. Copyright

   Change dictated from outside the organization makes a reorganization
   project even more difficult. This study follows the information systems
   reorganization of the US Naval Construction Forces whose restructuring
   was directed as a result of budget cuts and military `right-sizing'. The
   process was conducted through the use of action research, tin intensive
   investigative method seeing limited use in information system's
   research. This method directly involves the researcher in the
   organizational change effort while placing organization members in close
   collaboration with the researcher. The study describes the action
   research methodology while illustrating the research strategy in phases
   and recounts the successful migration from a highly centralised to a
   decentralised organization.}},

Abstract = {{In two previous experiments, we studied how stimulus motion affects bath
   the self-report of emotion experience and the physiological sequelae of
   emotion. In both studies, image motion intensified emotional responding,
   and the effect of motion was relatively specific to the arousal
   dimension of the emotion; there was little evidence that image motion
   altered the valence of the image. Moving images also appeared to sustain
   the attention of the participants for a longer period of time than did
   the still images. In these two experiments, however, image motion was
   manipulated within participants. In the present experiment, we used a
   between-subjects manipulation of image motion and found a nearly
   identical pattern of results. These data indicate that motion inherently
   increments the arousal value of an image and that this increment is not
   dependent on the context in which motion is introduced.}},

Abstract = {{This study assesses the effects of the family environment on men's job

   environment as measured by the Family Environment Scale (Moos \& Moos,
   1974) predicts only three aspects of job satisfaction as measured by the
   Job Descriptive Index (Smith, Kendal, \& Hulin, 1975). In addition,
   results indicate that the family environment has a limited effect on
   men's self-esteem as measured, by the Four Component Self-Esteem Scale
   (Hampilos, 1988). The authors conclude that the limited relationship
   between these measures may be due to men's lack of involvement in their
   family and that men continue to have a traditional view of their role in
   the family as that of provider and disciplinarian. Implications for
   counseling are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, surgical vacuum aspiration is the method of choice of
   terminating first trimester unwanted pregnancy. Cervical priming prior
   to surgical evacuation reduces the risks of cervical injury by making
   the cervix softer and easier to dilate. Over the years, a number of
   effective methods of cervical priming have became available: osmotic
   dilators; antiprogesterone and prostaglandins. Of these, prostaglandins
   remain the most widely used method of cervical preparation. However many
   of the natural and synthetic analogues of prostaglandins are either
   expensive or associated with troublesome side-effects. More recently,
   misoprostol, a synthetic 15-deoxy-16 hydroxy 16-methyl analogue of
   naturally occurring prostaglandin E, used in the manangement of peptic
   ulcers, has established a lead for cervical priming in terms of
   availability, ease of administration, cost and effectiveness. In fact it
   appears that both oral and vaginal misoprostol given at dosages of 400
   mu g are effective for cervical priming when administered 3 h prior to
   surgical vacuum aspiration. Now that the use of misoprostol for cervical
   priming has been validated, its widespread use in gynaecological
   practice is expected.}},

Abstract = {{Sivakumar et al. (2000a), by employing the correlation dimension method,
   provided preliminary evidence of the existence of chaos in the monthly
   rainfall-runoff process at the Gota basin in Sweden. The present study
   verifies and supports the earlier results and strengthens such evidence.
   The study analyses the monthly rainfall, runoff and runoff coefficient
   series using the nonlinear prediction method, and the presence of chaos
   is investigated through an inverse approach, i.e. identifying chaos from
   the results of the prediction. The presence of an optimal embedding
   dimension (the embedding dimension with the best prediction accuracy)
   for each of the three series indicates the existence of chaos in the
   rainfall-runoff process, providing additional support to the results
   obtained using the correlation dimension method. The reasonably good
   predictions achieved, particularly for the runoff series, suggest that
   the dynamics of the rainfall-runoff process could be understood from a
   chaotic perspective. The predictions are also consistent with the
   correlation dimension results obtained in the earlier study, i.e. higher
   prediction accuracy for series with a lower dimension and vice-versa, so
   that the correlation dimension method can indeed be used as a
   preliminary indicator of chaos. However, the optimal embedding
   dimensions obtained from the prediction method are considerably less
   than the minimum dimensions essential to embed the attractor, as
   obtained by the correlation dimension method. A possible explanation for
   this could be the presence of noise in the series, since the effects of
   noise at higher embedding dimensions could be significantly greater than
   that at lower embedding dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{The pan-NK cell marker NK1.1, present in some mouse strains, is also
   found on a subset of TCR alpha beta(+) lymphocytes termed NKT cells.
   These cells are primarily CD4(+) or CD4(-)CD8(-) (double negative, DN),
   and both NKT subpopulations contain cells reactive with the MHC class
   I-like molecule CD1d. Murine NK cells express clonally distributed
   inhibitory receptors of the Ly49 family that bind to different alleles
   of MHC class I molecules and transmit negative signals regulating NK
   cell function. Ly49 receptors are also found on TCR alpha beta(+)
   NK1.1(+) T cells. To investigate the potential role of inhibitory Ly49
   markers in the regulation of NKT cells, we have done a thorough analysis
   of their expression on different NKT populations. The CD4(+) and DN
   NK1.1(+) T cell subsets have traditionally been dealt with as one
   NK1.1(+) T cell population, but we found dramatic differences between
   these two NKT cell subsets. We demonstrate here expression of Ly49
   receptors on DN, but not on CD4(+), NK1.1(+) T cells in spleen and
   liver. Absence of the specific MHC class I ligand in the host was
   associated with elevated levels of expression and, to a greater extent
   than has been found for NK cells, increased the frequencies of
   Ly49-positive cells within the DN subset, while CD4(+) NK1.1(+) cells
   remained negative. In the thymus and bone marrow both NK1.1(+) T cell
   subsets contained high frequencies of Ly49-positive cells. Results from
   in vitro stimulation of DN NKT cells further suggest that activation and
   expansion of NKT cell subsets are regulated by the Ly49 receptors.}},

Abstract = {{The psychological consequences of adverse political experiences among
   South African youth were studied in a sample of 540 black and white
   adolescents from age groups, evenly divided by gender. Three
   questionnaires were administered, measuring exposure to political life
   events, the presence of symptoms symptoms of psychopathology, and
   stressful personal life events during the previous 5 years. The first
   hypothesis, predicting a substantial contribution of stressful political
   experiences to psychopathology, was strongly supported; when stressful
   personal life events were partialed out, a significant effect for
   political life events remained both on general distress and
   symptomatology indices, The second hypothesis of a linear, elation
   between exposure to political life events and severity of distress was
   also confirmed. The findings underscore the enduring impact on
   children's mental health of past apartheid policies in South Africa
   specifically, and adverse political environments in general.}},

Abstract = {{Many rural communities in the Rocky Mountain West with high amenity

   environment, growth, and development issues, and that these differences
   are resulting in widespread social conflict. We evaluate these ``culture
   clash{''} and ``gangplank{''} hypotheses using survey data from three
   rural communities in the Rocky Mountain West that are experiencing
   amenity-related in-migration. We examine attitudes about environmental
   concern, population growth, economic development, and tourism
   development. Results indicate that newcomers differ significantly from
   longer-term rest dents on a number of sociodemographic dimensions, but
   either there are no significant attitude differences between the two
   groups, or, where difference exist, longer-term residents wish more
   strongly than newcomers to limit population growth and development in
   their communities. We offer explanations for why the results differ from
   media accounts and from the earlier research observations and

Abstract = {{An adequate level of physical activity may maintain or promote work
   ability in aging workers, Project Active is a randomized trial comparing
   a Lifestyle physical activity program with a Structured exercise program
   in sedentary but healthy adults aged 35 to 60 years. Subjects in both
   groups received 6 months of intensive intervention followed by 18 months
   of active follow-up. The total number of subjects was 235, from which 80
   subjects participated in the work ability assessment. Primary outcome
   measures were energy expenditure (kg(-1) . day(-1)), cardiorespiratory
   fitness (peak oxygen uptake in ml . min(-1) . kg(-1)), and the Work
   Ability Index. At 6 months, daily energy expenditure had increased
   significantly over baseline (mean +/- SD, from 33.0 +/- 0.9 to 34.4 +/-
   1.8 kcal . kg(-1) . day-(1)) and was maintained over baseline at 24
   months (34.0 +/- 2.5 kcal . kg(-1) . day(-1)). The significant increase
   in energy expenditure was observed particularly in moderate levels of
   activity, The average percentage of body fat was significantly higher at
   baseline compared with 6 months and 24 months. Peak oxygen uptake
   increased from baseline significantly during the first 6 months (from
   29.6 +/- 5.7 to 30.6 +/- 6.3 ml . min(-1) . kg(-1)) and decreased to the
   baseline level (29.1 +/- 5.5 ml . min(-1) . kg(-1)) at 24 months, At
   baseline the average Work Ability Index runs 44.2 +/- 4.0 and If
   remained unchanged at 6 months (44.4 +/- 3.9) and at 24 months (44.2 +/-
   3.1). In conclusion, a 2-year physical activity intervention increased
   daily energy expenditure, reduced body fat, and maintained peak oxygen
   uptake in healthy, middle-aged, sedentary subjects. The average Work
   Ability Index score at baseline was excellent and did not change during
   the 2-year physical activity interventions.}},

   combined mass and combined geometric stiffness matrices are employed to
   improve the calculations of natural frequency and buckling load,

   the versatility and potential accuracy of the present methods. A

Abstract = {{The satellite spectra arising due to L3Mx-MxN4.5 (x = 1-5) transition
   array in X-ray emission spectra of Mo-42, Ru-44, Pd-46, Cd-48, Sn-50 and
   Te-52, have been calculated using available I-IFS data on K-LM and L-MN
   Auger transition energies. The agreement between the calculated and
   measured energies, that between calculated and measured separations in
   energies and the consideration of the relative probabilities of all the
   L3Mx-MxN4.5 transitions have been used as the basis for deciding the
   origin of the satellites. It has been established that three satellites
   observed in the L beta(2) region of the X-ray spectra of various
   elements and named beta(2)((b)), beta(2)(II) and beta(2)((c)) in order
   of increasing energy are mainly emitted by L3M4.5-M4.5N4.5 transitions.
   It is observed that only beta(2)((b)) in all these spectra can be
   assigned to superposition of F-3(4)-(3)G(5) and F-3(4)-D-3(3)
   transitions and that this must be the most intense of all these
   satellites. Each of the remaining two satellites is found to have
   different origin in different elements. So is the case with the line
   beta(2)(I) which has been observed on lower energy side of beta(2)((b))
   and has been associated with an L3M4.5-M4.5N4.5 transition in some
   elements. The suitable transitions to all these lines have been
   presented. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fuzzy predictive control integrates conventional model-based predictive
   control with techniques from fuzzy multicriteria decision making. The
   information regarding the fuzzy criteria of the control problem is
   combined by using a decision function from the fuzzy set-theory. The use
   of fuzzy criteria in the cost function leads usually to a non-convex
   optimization problem, which is numerically complex. The numeric
   optimization problem becomes more tractable by discretizing the control
   actions, limiting the search of the optimal solution to this space. This
   paper extends the application of the branch-and-bound optimization
   technique to predictive control problems with fuzzy cost functions. This
   approach can reduce significantly the search time, allowing the
   application of fuzzy predictive control to a broader class of systems,
   and to real-time control problems. Simulation and real-time results of
   temperature control in a fan-coil unit show the applicability of the

Abstract = {{Behavioral techniques were used to determine underwater masked hearing
   thresholds for a northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), a
   harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), and a California sea lion (Zalophus
   californianus). Octave-band white noise maskers were centered at five
   test frequencies ranging from 200 to 2500 Hz; a slightly wider noise
   band was used for testing at 100 Hz. Critical ratios were calculated at
   one masking noise level for each test frequency. Above 200 Hz, critical
   ratios increased with frequency. This pattern is similar to that
   observed in most animals tested, and indicates that these pinnipeds lack
   specializations for detecting low-frequency tonal sounds in noise.
   However, the individual pinnipeds in this study, particularly the
   northern elephant seal, detected signals at relatively low
   signal-to-noise ratios. These results provide a means of estimating
   zones of auditory masking for pinnipeds exposed to anthropogenic noise
   sources. (C) 2000 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract = {{Plant-produced phenolic compounds inhibit soil microbial activity and
   are suspected to be involved in the failure of natural regeneration of
   French subalpine Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests. This work
   evaluated relationships between phenolic compounds and soil
   microorganisms in humus collected in spruce forest during winter and
   summer seasons. After having identified and quantified different
   phenolics from humus samples, we incubated another set of humus samples
   with 10 times the concentration of naturally occurring phenolics, and
   effects on the density of microorganisms were compared to humus with no
   addition of phenolic compounds. Furthermore, in order to follow the
   degradation of phenolic compounds by microbes, the concentration of
   phenolics in the incubated humus samples was determined by HPLC after
   three and six days of incubation. The results indicate that humus
   microorganisms use phenolics as a carbon source, since almost all
   phenolic compounds had disappeared after six days of incubation.
   Addition of phenolic compounds to the humus samples also affected the
   soil microbial populations so that bacteria were inhibited in the humus
   collected both in the winter and in the summer. However, there were
   differences between the experiments. Fungi and cellulose hydrolyzers
   were stimulated in the winter humus experiment, while fungi were
   unaffected and cellulose hydrolyzers were inhibited in the summer
   experiment. The addition of phenolic compounds stimulated ammonifiers in
   the summer experiment. We anticipate that the role of soil
   microorganisms in the problem of natural regeneration failure is
   probably more important than previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{The paper traces the historical development of American radical

   The central aim is to examine the implications of their recent move

   particular, and the future of American radical economics more generally.
   By embracing neoclassical concepts and methodology, radical economists
   have denied themselves the opportunity to elucidate both the bases of
   capitalist class conflict, and thr nature of more complex social
   interactions at the point of production. American radical economics once
   provided a powerful critique of capitalism and its system of production,
   but it now struggles to provide more than a policy prescription for
   reduced levels of opportunism among individual workers. American radical
   economics cannot remain a distinctive voice in economics while it

Abstract = {{A textual analysis of post-World War II social psychology methodology
   manuals and handbook chapters on ``methods{''} indicates that the
   introduction of the experimental method was enforced and gradually
   strengthened through the use of scientific rhetoric and the minimization
   of alternative research strategies. As a consequence, by the 1960s
   experimentation had become such an established identifying feature of
   psychological social psychology that the acceptability of ideas in the
   field came to depend largely on the ability of authors to couch them in
   the language of the experiment. Text writers continually shored up the
   defenses of scientific legitimacy and denigrated all other types of
   argument. We explore three sources of tension or strains evident as
   contradictions in these texts: (1) between a rational experimenter's
   carefully following prescribed, logic-generated scientific practices and
   the investigator's artfully or intuitively designing research; (2)
   between social psychologists' missionary activities of proselytizing the
   experiment as the primary research method and social psychologists'
   apologies and insecurities expressed about using experiments; and (3)
   between the treatment of participants as docile and submissive versus
   portraying them as underhanded and damaging to the outcome of the
   research. In addition, we briefly reexamine the strain (4) between sober
   scientific experimentation and a playful ``fun and games{''} approach to
   experimentation (Lubek \& Stam, 1995). (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

   with prostheses made of chrome-cobalt alloy or mixed prostheses
   presented a higher SCE value than the controls but not significantly
   different. The presence of high-frequency cells was alarming only in 5
   patients, 4 of whom had titanium alloy prostheses, whereas none belonged
   to the control group. The number of SCE was not affected by the presence

Abstract = {{Phagosome acidification is an important component of the microbicidal

   phagosomal acidification on the survival of intracellular Salmonella
   Enterica serovar Typhimurium in different cell types. Bafilomycin A1, a
   specific inhibitor of the vacuolar proton-ATPases, was used to block
   acidification of salmonella-containing vacuoles. We found that in
   several epithelial cell lines, treatment with bafilomycin A1 had no
   effect on intracellular survival or replication. Furthermore, although
   acidification was essential for Salmonella intracellular survival in
   J774 cultured macrophages, as reported previously (13), it is not
   essential in other macrophage cell lines. These data suggest that
   vacuolar acidification may play a role in intracellular survival of

Abstract = {{Using renormalization group methods, we study multifractality in

   in the renormalization procedure. We calculate the family of
   multifractal exponents \{psi(l)\} for the scaling behavior of the noise

Abstract = {{Riverine inputs of nitrogen is an important factor that controls
   productivity of coastal marine waters. Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON)
   comprises most of the N in boreal rivers. During spring floods, DON flux
   may exceed the baseflow flux by several orders of magnitude. However,
   little is known about the biological availability of spring flood DON
   and, thus, its potential effect on coastal productivity.
   We have investigated the dynamics of DON bioavailability and chemical
   composition during a spring flood in two streams in northern Sweden.
   Potential bioavailability was determined by employing bacterial regrowth
   bioassays with brackish medium and a coastal bacterial inoculum. In
   addition, concentrations of urea and amino acids and the proportion of
   D-isomers in fetal dissolved amino acids were analyzed because a high
   proportion of D-isomers is suggested to indicate old and refractory
   organic material.
   During the flood, potential DON bioavailability increased from 19-28\%
   at baseflow to 55-45\% during peak how in the two streams, while DON
   concentration remained relatively constant. At the end of the hood,
   bioavailability returned to the baseflow values. Potential DON
   bioavailability was positively correlated with the concentration of
   dissolved combined amino acids and the proportion of L-enantiomers of
   amino acids. However only 5-18\% of DON was identified as urea and free
   and combined amino acids, suggesting that bacteria also utilized other
   DON compounds. Our results imply that a major portion of the annual
   export of labile nitrogen occurred during a few weeks of spring flood.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Following the early Eocene collision of the Indian and Asian plates,
   intracontinental subduction occurred along the Main Central Thrust (MCT)
   zone in the High Himalaya. In the Kishtwar-Zanskar Himalaya, the MCT is
   a 2 km thick shear zone of high strain, distributed ductile deformation
   which emplaces the amphibolite facies High Himalayan Crystalline (HHC)
   unit south-westwards over the lower greenschist facies Lesser Himalaya.
   An inverted metamorphic field gradient, mapped from the first appearance
   of garnet, staurolite and kyanite index minerals, is coincident with the
   high strain zone. Petrography and garnet zoning profiles indicate that
   rocks in the lower MCT zone preserve a prograde assemblage, whereas
   rocks in the HHC unit show retrograde equilibration. Thermobarometric
   results derived using THERMOCALC indicate a P-T increase of c. 180
   degrees C and c, 400 MPa across the base of the MCT zone, which is a
   consequence of the syn- to postmetamorphic juxtaposition of M1 kyanite
   grade rocks of the HHC unit on a cooling path over biotite grade
   footwall rocks, which subsequently attain their peak (M2) during
   thrusting. Inclusion thermobarometry from the lower MCT zone reveals
   that M2 was accompanied by loading, and peak conditions of 537 +/- 38
   degrees C and 860 +/- 120 MPa were attained. M1 kyanite assemblages in

   There is no evidence for dissipative or downward conductive heating in
   the MCT zone. Instead, the primary control on the distribution of peak
   assemblages, represented by the index minerals, is postmetamorphic
   ductile thrusting in a downward propagating shear zone. Polymetamorphism

Abstract = {{M-mode and Doppler echocardiographic values,were obtained from 30 normal
   adult ferrets (14 neutered females, 13 neutered males, 3 intact males)
   sedated with an intramuscular combination of ketamine hydrochloride and
   midazolam, Routine M-mode measurements of the left and right ventricle,
   left atrium (LA) and aorta (AO) and Doppler measurements of aortic and
   pulmonic outflow, and mitral inflow were recorded. The following values
   were calculated: LA:AO diameter, ratio of peak E: peak A wave velocity
   (E:A ratio) for mitral inflow, and stroke volume (SV), cardiac output
   (CO) and cardiac index (CI) for both pulmonary and aortic outflow
   tracts. Maximal aortic velocities (AO(max) and velocity-time integral
   values (AO VTI) were significantly less than corresponding pulmonary
   outflow tract values (PA(max), PA VTI) but there was no difference in
   calculated values for SV, CO or CI, Calculated CO values were in the
   range expected based on the size of the species, Difficulties in
   aligning the aortic outflow tract for Doppler imaging may make pulmonary
   outflow Doppler values more consistent for use in estimating volume flow

Abstract = {{In 3 experiments the interdependencies between timing and force

   examined as participants (N = 6 in each experiment) tapped (a) to 1 of 3
   target periods (333 ms, 500 ms, and 1,000 ms), while they simultaneously
   produced a constant peak force (PF) over a 50-s trial; (b) to produce 1
   of 3 target forces (5, 10, and 15 N) at their preferred frequency, while
   keeping their rhythm as invariant as possible; and (c) to all
   combinations of target force and period. The results showed that (a)
   magnitudes of force and period were largely independent; (b) variability
   in timing increased proportionally with tapping period, and the
   variability in force increased with peak force; (c) force variability
   decreased at faster tapping rates; and (d) timing variability decreased
   with increasing force levels. (e) Analysis of tap-to-tap variability
   revealed adjustments over sequences of taps and an acceleration in the
   tapping rate in unpaced conditions. The interdependencies of force and

   In marked contrast to left-handed coiled coil tetramers, the
   right-handed coiled coil reveals large hydrophobic cavities that are
   filled with water molecules. As a consequence, the packing of the
   hydrophobic core differs markedly from that of a right-handed parallel

Abstract = {{A generic Hamiltonian, which contains the potential energies and the
   coulomb interactions of an assembly of N He-4 nuclei and 2N electrons is
   studied using second quantisation techniques and different sets of
   boundary conditions for three related problems. For an infinite volume
   of fluid periodic boundary conditions are imposed. For a finite volume
   which fills a cube the wave functions are chosen to vanish on the
   boundaries and for a finite volume contained in a vessel of arbitrary
   shape similar boundary conditions are imposed on a macroscopic volume of
   the liquid which is sufficiently remote from the walls and surface. In
   each example the appropriate value of N is determined by using the known
   density of the liquid. Use is also made of several other experimentally
   determined properties; that, at the lowest temperatures, the liquid is
   almost entirely super-fluid and that as the temperature is raised it
   appears to be composed of two homogeneously mixed fluids, the super- and
   the normal fluid, with little change in overall density. The first of
   these properties is used as a guide to a possible form for the ground
   state of an unperturbed Hamiltonian, that it should be a many-particle
   function that ensures that the density of particles and charge is
   uniform in space. The second is used to reason that each low-lying
   excited state of the unperturbed Hamiltonian will contain a part in
   which the ground state appears to have been expanded and the overall
   density has been restored by replacing the particles which have been
   removed in the expansion back into states which have not been used in
   forming the expanded ground state. A detailed examination of such a
   possibility shows that there are many possible ways of constructing
   mutually orthogonal states with this property. So the way is open to
   using these states as basis states for a perturbation theory and
   characterising them with a momentum variable, k. Another property, that
   the super-fluid supports longitudinal phonon-like modes is then used to
   define some more low-lying states, so enlarging the number of mutually
   orthogonal many-particle states. It is then a relatively simple exercise
   in perturbation theory to show how, after the meaning of the momentum
   variable, k, has been slightly changed, the famous (epsilon, k)
   dispersion curve emerges.}},

   years after diagnosis. The relapse free interval was about 33 month on
   average. There was neither a correlation to the age of the patients at
   the time of first diagnosis nor to the histology or the hormonal
   receptors. A statistically significant correlation was found between the
   duration of relapse free interval and the size of the primary cancer,
   the number of positive lymph nodes and the cytological and histological
   grading. Comparing mastectomy or breast conserving surgery the
   correlation to the size of the cancer decreased in the group of patients
   with mastectomy and there was no significance for the lymph nodes at
   all. The hereditary disease and the multifocality were of great
   importance. Women with breast conserving surgery were less likely to
   suffer local recurrence. Among the adjuvant therapies only local
   radiation showed a benefit to the patients. Early appearance of the
   first local recurrence had a worse prognosis with respect to later
   metastasis. The risk associated with these criteria should be taken into
   consideration in planning the therapy. Women thus identified as
   belonging to higher risk groups should receive local radiation more
   often. They should be followed up in shorter intervals, especially in
   the first 2 years. Reference is done to corresponding trials of therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Somatostatin (SST) is known for its inhibitory effect on the
   gastrointestinal tract. Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations
   (TLESR), low or absent LES pressure (LESP) and swallow-induced LES
   relaxations are the most important reflux mechanisms. Methods: We have
   studied the effect of somatostatin on lower esophageal sphincter (LES)
   characteristics in man. Nine healthy volunteers participated in four
   experiments performed in random order and double-blind during continuous
   infusion of somatostatin (250 mu g/h) or saline (control) under fasting
   and postprandial conditions. Esophageal motility was measured with
   sleeve manometry combined with pH merry. Results: Under fasting
   conditions LESP was not influenced by somatostatin. Ingestion of the
   carbohydrate meal significantly (P < 0.01) decreased LESP. During
   continuous somatostatin infusion the postprandial decrease in LESP did
   not occur; LESP was even significantly (P < 0.05) increased over basal
   levels. Somatostatin did not significantly influence TLESR frequency,
   neither under basal conditions, nor postprandially. The residual
   pressure during swallow-induced LES relaxation was significantly (P <
   0.05) increased by somatostatin. Conclusion: In humans somatostatin
   prevents postprandial reduction in LESP, does not affect TLESR, but
   inhibits swallow-induced LES relaxation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the effects of raloxifene, estrogen, and placebo on
   quality of life in healthy, asymptomatic, postmenopausal women.
   Methods: In a multicenter, double-blind, 12-month study, 398 women were
   assigned randomly to one of four groups: raloxifene HCl, 60 (n = 97) or
   150 mg/day (n = 100); conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/day (n =
   96); or placebo (n = 105). The Women's Health Questionnaire, a validated
   quality-of-life instrument for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women,
   was administered at baseline and 3-month intervals.
   Results: Overall, quality of life from baseline to end point was
   preserved equally in all treatment groups. Six domains (depressed mood,
   somatic symptoms, memory/ concentration, sexual behavior, sleep
   problems, and perceived attractiveness) were unchanged in all groups.
   Three domains (menstrual symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and
   anxiety/fears) were statistically significantly different among groups.
   Mean scores for menstrual symptoms significantly worsened and vasomotor
   symptoms significantly improved from baseline to end point in the
   estrogen group. Mean scores for vasomotor symptoms did not worsen at any
   point in the raloxifene 60 mg/day group. Mean anxiety/fears scores
   improved significantly during raloxifene 60 mg/day administration
   throughout treatment (P < .05), irrespective of previous hormone
   replacement therapy, baseline estradiol (E2) levels, or years
   postmenopause.
   Conclusion: Most quality-of-life domains were not affected by treatment
   with estrogen or raloxifene. Estrogen provided relief from vasomotor
   symptoms but caused menstrual symptoms. Raloxifene 60 mg/day improved
   anxiety levels in postmenopausal women. (Obstet Gynecol 2000;96: 359-65

Abstract = {{Pheromones represent one of the major components of ecologically based
   orchard pest management. This paper reviews recent progress and
   highlights outstanding issues. The greatest use of pheromones has been
   as lures for moth to traps, although identification of attractants for
   other insect groups is permitting diversification. Sex pheromone traps
   have been widely used for decision support, usually with thresholds for
   intervention using either broad-spectrum, or more recently, selective
   insecticides. Many of the issues associated with this type of
   application have been resolved, but new trapping systems need to ensure
   that lure longevity, trap efficiency, and other factors (e.g.
   interpretation, thresholds) are addressed. The use of kairomones
   (inter-specific cues) as lures in traps raises analogous issues.
   Attractants for beneficials (such as sex pheromones of wasp parasitoids)
   can offer additional benefits, including demonstrating the level of
   abundance or synchrony of the biological control agent with the target
   pest. Pheromones have also enjoyed considerable success for direct
   control of orchard pests, mainly through mating disruption. The
   technical and biological issues have been more challenging in direct
   control applications. There remain major knowledge gaps in the amount of
   pheromone required to achieve disruption, as well as the plume structure
   and behavioural mechanisms that operate with different types of
   formulations, blends and delivery systems. There has been a recent
   upsurge of interest in lure and kill tactic internationally. The
   challenges associated with direct control by mass trapping, lure and
   kill or lure and infect tactics need further research. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A gasdynamical detector has been applied to measure the arrival time of
   driver gas in a low concentration in the test section of a high-enthalpy
   shock tunnel. The detection determines the useful test time with
   uncontaminated test gas for a wide range of specific reservoir
   enthalpies. Effects of over- or undertailored interface condition on
   severe contamination have been investigated,It is experimentally
   demonstrated that overtailored interface operation must be avoided to
   achieve the test duration necessary for aerodynamic measurements,
   especially for high-enthalpy Row. The interface condition is optimized
   for the longest test time attainable. As an active method for delaying
   driver gas contamination, a device to trap the driver gas at the end of
   the shock tube has been tried for an overtailored condition. The method,
   however, causes the contamination to occur earlier. A modified device
   using a sleeve to capture driver gas upstream has been developed.
   Results with the longest sleeve tested show that strong contamination is
   dramatically delayed and that the uncontaminated test time is
   significantly increased. Nevertheless, improved test times are still
   shorter than the test time without the device at a slightly
   undertailored condition.}},

Volume = {{42}},

Pages = {{321-337}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The triad interactions have been known to be important only for shoaling
   waves or finite depth wind waves. In deep water, they are insignificant
   compared with the quadruplet interactions in respect to the evolution of
   wind waves due to energy transfer among the wave components. However,
   the triad interactions may be important even for deep water waves
   because they may closely be related to the wave steepness, which
   definitely affects wave breaking, drag of air flow over the sea, or
   navigation of ships, especially during the early stage of the
   development of wind waves. This study reports a series of laboratory
   experiments, whose data are subjected to bispectral analyses to
   investigate the triad interactions of deep-water wind waves. It is found
   that the bicoherence at the spectral peak frequency and the wave
   steepness are almost directly proportional, indicating that the steep
   waves with peaked crests and flat troughs are resulted from the triad
   interactions. Both bicoherence and wave steepness increase with the wave
   age during the early stage of wave generation and then drop off as the
   waves grow old. It seems that the energy of the secondary spectral peak
   developed by the triad interactions during the early stage of wave
   generation is redistributed to the neighboring frequencies by the
   quadruplet interactions during the later stage.}},

Abstract = {{The morphological characteristics of two tropical clavicipitalean fungi
   on species of the plant family Asteraceae were examined. These species
   were found to be superficial on the stems of living plants but early
   stages of infection involve necrotrophy of scale insects. These fungi
   are distinct from other Clavicipitaceae by possession of anamorphs
   producing multiseptate conidia. A new genus, Hyperdermium , was proposed
   to accommodate these ttwo species. In cultures on potato dextrose agar
   overlaid with cellulose acetate sheets, both species produced colonies
   resembling those on plant tissues. Hyperdermium bertonii produced
   conidia in culture but not perithecia. Hyperdermium pulvinatum produced
   both conidia and perithecia in culture. Phylogenetic analysis using
   large subunit rDNA sequences placed Hyperdermium in the subfamily
   Cordycipitoideae. A study was made of perithecial ontogeny in H.
   pulvinatum. Centrum development was of the Epichloe-type.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of reagents used in separating chalcopyrite from pyrite an
   the cake moisture of the copper concentrate at Daye Iron Mine Mineral
   Processing Plant was investigated. The results showed that the dosage of
   lime used for depressing pyrite was the main factor that increased the
   filter cake moisture of copper concentrate. With increasing the dosage
   of lime, the cake moisture of copper concentrate increased sharply. The
   cause was concluded to be the addition of lime to the pulp, which
   resulted in the formation of flee and a high pH value. The collector
   Z-200\#, used for collecting chalcopyrite, had, as well, an adverse
   effect on the cake moisture of copper concentrate, but its effect was
   inferior in respect to that of lime. The cake moisture of copper
   concentrate can be decreased by changing the method with which lime is
   added and the pH value of pulp is regulated. The experiment results
   showed that the sulfuric acid was the best regulator. When the clarified
   liquor of lime was used as a depressant and the pH value of the pulp was
   regulated to 6.5-7.0 by adding sulfuric acid, the cake moisture of
   copper concentrate was reduced from 15.49\% to 13.13\%. The examination
   of chalcopyrite surface by using ESCA (Electron Spectroscopy for
   Chemical Analysis) showed that calcium sulfate and iron hydroxide had
   formed on the surface of chalcopyrite when lime was added to the pulp.
   The formation of calcium sulfate and iron hydroxide on its surface
   increased the hydrophilicity of chalcopyrite so that its cake moisture
   increased. The addition of sulfuric acid to the pulp not only removed
   the calcium sulfate, but also reduced the concentration of iron
   hydroxide on the surface of chalcopyrite so that the cake moisture of
   copper concentrate was decreased.}},

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1592-1603}},

Abstract = {{A beam implementation is presented for efficient full-volume 3-D
   prestack Kirchhoff depth migration of seismic data. Unlike conventional
   Kirchhoff migration in which the input seismic traces in time are
   migrated one trace at a time into the 3-D image volume for the earth's
   subsurface, the beam migration processes a group of input traces (a
   supergather) together. The requirement for a supergather is that the
   source and receiver coordinates of the traces fall into two small
   surface patches. The patches are small enough that a single set of time
   maps pertaining to the centers of the patches can be used to migrate all
   the traces within the supergather by Taylor expansion or interpolation.
   The migration of a supergather consists of two major steps: stacking the
   traces into a tau-P beam volume, and mapping the beams into the image
   volume. Since the beam volume is much smaller than the image volume, the
   beam migration cost is roughly proportional to the number of input
   supergathers. The computational speedup of beam migration over
   conventional Kirchhoff migration is roughly proportional to N-g, the
   average number of traces per supergather, resulting a theoretical
   speedup up to two orders of magnitudes. The beam migration was
   successfully implemented and has been in production use for several
   years. A factor of 5-25 speedup has been achieved in our in-house depth
   migrations. The implementation made 3-D prestack full-volume depth
   imaging feasible in a parallel distributed environment.}},

Abstract = {{Trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and acetylene were codeposited in nitrogen and
   argon matrices and adducts of these species were identified using
   infrared spectroscopy. Formation of the adducts was evidenced by shifts
   in the vibrational frequencies of the modes involving the TMP and
   acetylene submolecules. The structures of these adducts, energies and
   the vibrational frequencies were computed at the HF/6-31G{*}{*} level.
   Both the experimental and computational studies indicated that two types
   of TMP-acetylene complexes were formed; one in which the hydrogen in
   acetylene was bonded to the phosphoryl oxygen and another in which the
   bonding was at the alkoxy oxygen of the phosphate. In addition to the
   primary hydrogen bonded interaction at the phosphoryl oxygen, this
   complex, also appeared to be stablilized by a secondary and weaker
   interaction involving a methyl hydrogen in TMP and the pi cloud in
   acetylene - a case of a H ...pi interaction. The computed vibrational
   frequencies in the adducts agreed well with the observed frequencies for
   the modes involving the TMP submolecule, while the agreement was
   relatively poor for the modes involving the acetylene submolecule. The
   stabilization energies of these adducts, corrected for both zero-point
   energies and basis set superposition errors, were approximate to 3
   kcal/mol for the phosphoryl complex and approximate to 1 kcal/mol for
   the alkoxy complex. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Heroin street doses are complex mixtures commonly analyzed in forensic
   laboratories. Identification of the illicit substance in these street
   doses is among the primary analytical tasks of a forensic laboratory. We
   demonstrate that the one-dimensional 1D-TOCSY NMR experiment permits

   more different components. This method produces an easily-identified and
   effective ``fingerprint{''} for heroin within a mixture of other
   substances. The method has been successfully tested as a tool for
   identification of heroin in street doses from police casework in Israel.
   This NMR technique is robust and quick (a measurement can be carried out
   in 10-15 min), and it does not require any preliminary physical or
   chemical treatments of the sample to be examined, due to the effective
   spectroscopic ``filtering{''} of the interfering components. The
   1D-TOCSY NMR method can potentially be used in combination with
   additional analytical methods as a routine tool in forensic laboratories
   to positively identify heroin for court purposes.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: TO estimate the rate Of development of active tuberculosis
   (TB) in a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive
   patients, and to identify the characteristics of these patients.
   DESIGN: A total of 175 HIV-positive individuals were recruited from
   clinics for sexually transmitted diseases and followed up for 31 +/- 6.8
   months. Clinical examination, chest X-ray, sputum smear for acid-fast
   bacilli and culture for mycobacteria and HIV serology were performed at
   the time of registration and repeated periodically.
   RESULTS: Seventeen patients had TB at intake and another 24 developed TB
   during follow-up, giving a breakdown rate of 6.9/100 person-years (p-y)
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CT] 4.1-9.6). The attack rates were 10.8)
   and negative (6.7/100 p-y, 95\%CI 2.6-10.8) patients. There was a trend
   towards higher mortality in patients who developed TB (10.5/100 p-y,
   95\%CI 4.8-15.2) compared to those who did not (6.1/100 p-y, 95\%Cl
   3.2-8.8).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide information regarding the
   high risk of development of active tuberculosis and its associated
   mortality in HIV-infected persons. The risk of developing TB appears to
   be equally high in tuberculin positive and negative individuals,
   suggesting that new infections could play a major role in this

Abstract = {{We analyzed the FEV1/FEV6 and FEV1/FVC results of 502 consecutive
   patients in the spirometric diagnosis of airway obstruction. We also
   examined the agreement between FEV6 and FVC in the spirometric diagnosis

   337 subjects (67\%). The sensitivity of FEV1/FEV6 for diagnosing airway
   obstruction as defined by FEV1/FVC was 95.0\%; the specificity was
   97.4\%. When interpretations differed, the measured values were all
   close to the lower limits of the reference ranges. When analysis
   included +/- 100-ml variability in FEV1 and FEV6, the sensitivity
   increased to 99.5\% and the specificity to 100\%. The reproducibility of
   FEV6 was superior to that of FVC. These results suggest that FEV6 is an
   accurate, reliable alternative to FVC for diagnosing airway obstruction

   water (EAW) has a bactericidal effect, and an endoscopic washing device

   on the infectivity of viruses, we treated duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV),
   which has similar properties to hepatitis B virus, with EAW, and
   determined the number of remaining infectious virus particles in a
   bioassay system. One-day-old Pekin ducks were inoculated with duck serum
   containing 10(5.5) ID50 DHBV; the serum had previously been incubated
   with 100 volumes of EAW or ion-exchanged water at room temperature for 7

   serum samples 1-8 weeks after inoculation. Treatment of serum with EAW
   diminished DHBV infectivity whereas treatment with ion-exchanged water
   did not. The virus load was estimated to have been reduced to
   10(1)-10(3) ID50 during the first 1 min and to <10(0.5) ID50 in the next
   6 min of incubation when compared with the control. Thus, EAW directly
   inactivates DHBV and its clinical application is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{A 54-year-old male patient was admitted to Osaka University Medical

   daily administration of recombinant interferon-alpha 2a started at the
   dose of 9 megaunits per day. Fourteen days later, moderate right pleural
   effusion was detected by abdominal magnetic resonance imaging study. He
   had experienced no symptom to suggest pleural effusion or any pulmonary
   lesions during interferon treatment. The pleural fluid was serous,
   showing the character of slightly bloody, turbid and positive Rivalta
   test, and the levels of lactic dehydrogenase and adenosine deaminase
   were not elevated. His serum titer of anti-nuclear antibody increased to
   80 in homogenous staining, but anti-DNA antibody and anti-liver kidney
   microsome-l antibody remained negative. Other laboratory tests or
   physical findings could not satisfy the criteria of any autoimmune
   diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. After discontinuation of
   interferon administration, his pleural effusion resolved gradually and
   disappeared completely by use of no specific drugs. This is the first
   case that pleural effusion developed during interferon administration
   without any other clinical signs indicating autoimmune diseases. The
   increase of serum titer of anti-nuclear antibody prompted us to
   elucidate that pleuritis might be induced by immunological activation of
   interferon.}},

Abstract = {{Lymphomas are a group of diseases, prevalent at reproductive age.
   Fertility is notoriously reduced among lymphoma patients. This study
   evaluates pre- and post-treatment semen concentration and motility, and
   factors associated with semen quality deterioration. We followed-up 33
   patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or with Hodgkin's disease during
   the years 1987-1997 who were referred for semen cryopreservation,
   Pretreatment semen analysis, and hormonal profile were recorded at
   diagnosis and at least 1 year after completion of the treatment, and
   compared. Medical records for disease type, disease stage and treatment
   protocols were related to long-term sperm outcome. Hormonal
   concentrations were not predictive of posttreatment sperm concentration.
   In patients with localized disease, initial sperm concentration and
   motility tended to be preserved, compared with patients with widespread
   disease (P = 0.016), In Hodgkin's disease patients, treatment with the
   adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD) protocol,vas
   superior to the mechloretamine, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone
   with ABV protocol regarding germinal toxicity (P = 0.0008), The
   post-treatment sperm outcome was better in patients treated with local
   irradiation than in those who did not undergo irradiation (P = 0.0027),
   No predictive tools for post-treatment fertility were found and,
   therefore, every patient with a lymphoma should have his semen
   cryopreserved at diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine whether blood cultures reflect
   real bacterial dissemination into the tissues of patients who die of
   septic shock. A total of 20 patients were divided into two groups with
   surgical (nine) and non-surgical (11) sepsis. Blood cultures were taken
   and the adequacy of antibacterial therapy was assessed. Post-mortem
   tissue samples of different organs were studied using light microscopy
   for the presence of bacteria. A semiquantitative measure, the
   contamination index, was applied. Despite negative blood cultures from
   14 patients, bacteria were found in almost all of the organs examined
   from all of the patients. There was no difference in contamination index
   between patients who received adequate antibacterial therapy and those
   who did not. We conclude that septic shock is the manifestation of
   bacterial dissemination into the organs, and that blood cultures are of
   limited value in the diagnosis of sepsis, especially when they are taken

Abstract = {{Thiolic compounds are important metal-complexing ligands as well as
   important components of the global sulfur biogeochemical cycle. A lack
   of information on the concentration and distribution of thiols in
   natural waters, especially in the dissolved fraction, is still a major
   impediment to a complete understanding of the role of thiols in these
   biogeochemical processes. The concentrations of dissolved, colloidal,
   and particulate thiols were measured along a salinity gradient in
   estuarine waters off of Galveston Bay, Texas. The majority of thiols
   were present in the dissolved fraction, although more thiolic species
   were detected in the particulate phase. Dissolved glutathione was
   present at higher concentrations (0.23 to 6.23 nM) than was the
   particulate glutathione (0.094 to 0.72 nM). Most gamma-glutamylcysteine
   was present in the particulate phase, with concentrations as high as
   2.24 nM in the middle of the estuary. Phytochelatin-2 was ubiquitous in
   surface waters, with chlorophyll a-normalized concentrations of up to
   6.3 mu mol g Chi a(-1). A major thiol peak was present in Lower
   Galveston Bay and a minor peak in Upper Galveston Bay, and in both
   regions, 5-6 mol of gamma-glutamylcysteine were produced per mole of
   glutathione. This bimodal distribution indicates in situ production of
   thiols from two different phytoplankton communities in Galveston Bay
   during this period.}},

Abstract = {{A nonlinear response analysis of a typical airfoil section with control
   surface freeplay excited by periodic gust loads in low subsonic flow is
   presented along with a companion wind-tunnel test program. The
   analytical model uses Peters's finite state model for the
   two-dimensional aerodynamic flow over the airfoil (Peters, D, A.,
   ``Finite-State Airloads for Deformable Airfoils on Fixed and Rotating
   Wings,{''} Symposium on Aeroelasticity and Fluid/Structure Interaction,
   American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Winter Annual Meeting, Nov.
   1994, rev. 3, May 1996). Results for a single harmonic gust and a
   continuous frequency sweep gust have been computed and measured for flow
   velocities below the Butter speed. A theoretical and experimental
   chaotic response phenomenon for the nonlinear structural model was
   observed. These results further confirm some conclusions about limit
   cycle oscillations and complement our earlier theoretical and
   experimental studies of self-excited oscillations. The experimental
   investigation has been carried out in the Duke University wind tunnel
   using a rotating slotted cylinder gust generator. The fair to good
   quantitative agreement between theory and experiment verifies that the
   present analytical approach has reasonable accuracy and good
   computational efficiency for nonlinear gust response analysis in the
   time domain.}},

Abstract = {{We produced a monoclonal antibody, designated MC301, against the extract
   of testicular cells from 12-day-old rats. This age corresponds to the
   onset of meiosis during testis development. MC301 specifically
   recognized a 90-kDa glycoprotein, GP90-MC301, which was ubiquitously
   expressed in various tissues and localized predominantly in the Golgi
   area of epithelial cells. In adult testes, stage-specific intense
   expression of GP90-MC301 was shown in the cytoplasm of meiotic
   spermatogenic cells from the preleptotene to mid-pachytene stages.
   Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that the glycoprotein was
   localized in spermatocytes on protein synthesis-related organelles such
   as the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear envelope. The
   plasma membrane of spermatocytes and the intercellular space surrounding
   the cells were also immunoreactive. No specific immunoreactivity was
   found on the organelles in other testicular cells. A considerable amount
   of the glycoprotein was detected in the extracellular fluid of the
   testes. These results suggest that GP90-MC301 is produced mainly by
   spermatocytes in the testis and secreted into the surrounding
   intercellular space. The evidence for developmentally regulated
   expression of GP90-MC301 in the meiotic spermatogenic cells suggests a
   possible role for the glycoprotein in male germ cell meiosis.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aim: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the
   relationship between glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urinary
   albumin excretion remains an unresolved issue. In order abnormalities,
   GFR and urinary albumin excretion were assessed, and their relationship
   was examined in normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional study of 85 nonhypertensive Japanese
   patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus not showing overt proteinuria,
   the GFR was measured using Tc-99m-diethylenetriamine pentaacetate
   renography. Fifty-one diabetic patients lacked microalbuminuria (albumin
   excretion <30 mg/day), while 34 patients showed microalbuminuria
   (between 30 and 300 mg/day). Fifteen healthy subjects served as
   controls. Results: The three groups were well matched with regard to
   gender, age, and body mass index. The GFR in microalbuminuric patients
   (134 +/- 23 ml/min/1.48 m(2)) was significantly higher than in patients
   without microalbuminuria (108 +/- 21 ml/min/1.48 m(2)) and in controls
   (109 +/- 18 ml/min/1.48 m(2); p < 0.0004). In type 2 diabetic patients,
   the GFR positively correlated with the logarithmically transformed
   urinary albumin excretion. Multiple regression analysis showed that the
   urinary albumin excretion was significantly and independently affected
   by GFR (beta = 0.548), duration of diabetes (beta = 0.297), and systolic
   blood pressure (beta = 0.232; R-2 = 0.409; p < 0.0001). Conclusion: It
   is suggested that one of the mechanisms underlying increased urinary
   albumin excretion in early nephropathy in normotensive type 2 diabetes
   is glomerular hyperfiltration. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.}},

Abstract = {{Encephalopathy with electrical status epilepticus during sleep or ESES
   is an age-dependent and self-limited syndrome whose distinctive features
   include a characteristic age of onset (with a peak around 4-5 years),
   heterogeneous seizures types (mostly partial motor or unilateral
   seizures during sleep and absences or falls while awake), a typical EEG
   pattern (with continuous and diffuse paroxysms occupying at least 85\%
   of slow wave sleep) and a variable neuropsychological regression
   consisting of IQ decrease, reduction of language (as in acquired aphasia
   or Landau-Kleffner syndrome), disturbance of behaviour (psychotic
   states) and motor impairment (in the form of ataxia, dyspraxia, dystonia
   or unilateral deficit). Despite the long-term favourable outcome of
   epilepsy and status epilepticus during sleep (SES), the prognosis is
   guarded because of the persistence of severe neuropsychological and/or
   motor deficits in approximately half of the patients. No specific
   treatment has been advocated for this syndrome, but valproate sodium,
   benzodiazepines and ACTH have been shown to control the seizures and the
   SES pattern in many cases, although often only temporarily. Subpial
   transection is proposed in some instances as in non-regressive acquired
   aphasia. Recent data support the concept that ESES syndrome may include
   a large subset of developmental or acquired regressive conditions of
   infancy. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   rationalize the coeffcients of wavelet filters that will preserve
   biorthogonality and perfect reconstruction. Furthermore, most of the
   zeros at z = -1 will also be preserved. These zeros are important for
   achieving regularity. The rationalized coefficients filters have
   characteristics that are close to the original irrational coefficients
   filters. Three popular pairs of filters, which include the ``9/7{''}
   pair, will be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence is increasing that oral health has important impacts on
   systemic health. This paper presents data from the third National Health
   and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) describing the prevalence
   of dental caries and periodontal diseases in the older adult population.
   It then evaluates published reports and presents data from clinical and
   epidemiologic studies on relationships among oral health status, chronic
   oral infections (of which caries and periodontitis predominate), and
   certain systemic diseases, specifically focusing on type 2 diabetes and
   aspiration pneumonia. Both of these diseases increase in occurrence and
   impact in older age groups. The NHANES iii data demonstrate that dental
   caries and periodontal diseases occur with substantial frequency and
   represent a burden of unmet treatment need in older adults. Our review
   found clinical and epidemiologic evidence to support considering
   periodontal infection a risk factor for poor glycemic control in type 2
   diabetes; however, there is limited representation of older adults in
   reports of this relationship. For aspiration pneumonia, several lines of
   evidence support oral health status as an important etiologic factor.
   Additional clinical studies designed specifically to evaluate the
   effects of treating periodontal infection on glycemic control and
   improving oral health status in reducing the risk of aspiration
   pneumonia are warranted. Although further establishing causal
   relationships among a set of increasingly more frequently demonstrated
   associations is indicated, there is evidence to support recommending
   oral care regimens in protocols for managing type 2 diabetes and
   preventing aspiration pneumonia.}},

Abstract = {{Zen meditation, or zazen, has attracted the interest of many
   psychotherapists. The teachings and practices of the Soto Zen tradition
   are understood as encouraging important areas of both psychological and
   spiritual development. Zen, like the relational psychoanalytic theories,
   encourages its practitioners to become aware of the fundamentally
   distorted aspects of an overly individualistic view of human experience.
   As a spiritual practice. zazen increases the practitioner's tolerance
   and appreciation of the Wholeness that Buddhists refer to as Emptiness.
   As a psychological practice, it helps us to be more flexibly and
   intimately present with our patients. An effective therapeutic process,
   even of the most secular type, will often contain elements of the
   meditative process of zazen, and failure to actualize this in
   psychotherapy can have a negative impact on our ability to understand
   and help our patients.}},

Abstract = {{Dayside poleward moving auroral forms (PMAFs) were detected between
   06:30 and 07:00 UT on December 16, 1998, by the meridian scanning
   photometer and the all-sky camera at Ny Alesund, Svalbard. Simultaneous
   SuperDARN HF radar measurements permitted the study of the associated
   ionospheric velocity pattern. A good general agreement is observed
   between the location and movement of velocity enhancements (flow
   channels) and the PMAFs. Clear signatures of equatorward flow were
   detected in the vicinity of PMAFs. This flow is believed to be the
   signature of a return flow outside the reconnected Aux tube, as
   predicted by the Southwood model. The simulated signatures of this model
   reproduce globally the measured signatures, and differences with the
   experimental data can be explained by the simplifications of the model.
   Proposed schemes of the flow modification due to the presence of several
   flow channels and the modification of cusp and region 1 field-aligned
   currents at the time of sporadic reconnection events are shown to fit
   well with the observations.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the dynamics between Western public diplomacy and
   the mediation of international military conflicts by US-dominated global
   television news, it looks at aspects of television coverage of wars in
   the post-Cold War era, in particular the 1999 Kosovo crisis and argues
   that only the wars in which the West has a geo-strategic interest appear
   to receive adequate coverage by Western television. NATO's bombing of
   Yugoslavia in March-June 1999 was the most extensively covered military
   action since the 1991 Gulf War. In both cases, Western television news
   channels. notably Cable News Network (CNN), consistently reproduced the
   agenda set by the United States and moulded public opinion in support of
   war. NATO's campaign in Kosovo was represented as a ``humanitarian{''}
   involvement instead of it being an action aimed at establishing a
   precedent for intervention into the internal affairs of a sovereign
   state and outside its area of operation. The article assesses
   international implications of such coverage, arguing that given the
   global reach and influence of Western television and the dependence of
   world's broadcasters on US-supplied television news footage, the
   dominant perspectives on a conflict can be American, although the US,
   more often than not, may be actively involved in the war. Recognising
   this, the article argues, that Western diplomacy has become
   sophisticated in packaging public information in a visually astute
   fashion and television networks, which often operate in a symbiotic
   relationship with the authorities, tend to conform to the geo-political
   agendas set by powerful governments.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives-To examine changes in predictive control of early antagonist
   responses to limb perturbations in patients with defined lesions of the
   cerebellum.
   Methods-Eight cerebellar patients and eight sex and age matched control
   subjects participated. Subjects field a handle that was rotated around
   the elbow joint. They were instructed to hold the forearm at 90 degrees
   flexion against a mechanical perturbation. Extensor torque (5 Nm) was
   applied for 140 ms (pulse), or for 1400 ms (step) through an external
   motor. Motor responses were tested under two different conditions of
   anticipatory information. In the expected condition, subjects
   anticipated and received a pulse. Under the unexpected condition,
   subjects expected steps, but received unexpected pulses. Biceps and
   triceps EMG as well as angular kinematics were compared between expected
   and unexpected pulse perturbations to quantify possible effects of
   prediction.
   Results-In all healthy subjects, the degree of overshoot in the return
   flexion movement was significantly less in expected pulse perturbations
   compared with unexpected trials. The degree of amplitude reduction was
   significantly smaller in the patient group than in the control group
   (22.8\% v 40.0\%). During the expected trials, latency of peak triceps
   activity was on average 20\% shorter in the control group, but 4\%
   larger in the cerebellar patients.
   Conclusions-In the expected condition, controls achieved a significant
   reduction in angular amplitude by generating triceps activity earlier,
   whereas the ability to use prediction for adjusting early antagonist
   responses after limb perturbation was impaired in cerebellar patients.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the presence and outcome of uterine vascular
   malformations in women with abnormal premenopausal bleeding. Study
   design: In this observational study 265 consecutive patients with
   abnormal premenopausal bleeding were examined by the same
   ultrasonographer with transvaginal gray-scale ultrasonography and color
   Doppler imaging. A final diagnosis of uterine vascular malformation was
   based on ultrasonographic findings, hysteroscopy or histological
   findings. Patients suspected of uterine vascular malformations at
   ultrasonography were closely monitored. Results: In nine patients
   (3.4\%) we found ultrasonographic features of uterine vascular
   malformations; Color Doppler imaging showed hypervascularity, marked
   turbulence, and low-impedance, high-velocity flow. In six patients the
   condition resolved spontaneously. Two patients with hydatiform mole
   needed chemotherapy and their condition normalized. One patient
   underwent a selective embolization of the uterine artery. Subsequently,
   five patients had uncomplicated pregnancies after resolution of the
   vascular malformation. Conclusion: Uterine vascular malformations are
   more common than previously thought. We conclude that conservative
   management is a valuable option in many of the acquired
   pregnancy-related cases that are diagnosed with color Doppler imaging.

Abstract = {{Objective: Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is an initial rate-limiting
   enzyme in the synthesis of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and
   spermine) that play a role in cell growth and differentiation. Recent
   studies have shown that spermidine and spermine cause injury to a
   variety of cells including myocytes in vitro. In this investigation, we
   used alpha -difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a specific and irreversible
   inhibitor of ODC activity and polyamine synthesis to test the hypothesis
   that polyamines contribute to myocardial injury in rat. Methods: Male
   Sprague Dawley rats were treated with (i) saline (0.2 ml/day, s.c.),
   (ii) isoproterenol (ISO) (5 mg/kg/day for 8 days, s.c.) to produce
   necrotizing myocardial injury, or with (iii) DFMO + ISO. DFMO was
   started 2 days before the initiation of ISO and both ISO and DFMO were
   continued until the end of the experimental period. Myocardial injury
   was assessed by determining the increased release of creatine
   phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the plasma, and
   by morphometric analysis of the lesion area in heart sections stained
   with Gomori trichrome. Results: ISO induced the release of CPK and LDH
   by 6 hr and 24 hr, respectively, and produced subendocardial necrosis,
   which was both acute and resolving following 8 days of ISO. DFMO
   treatment inhibited ISO-induced increases in (i) ODC activity and
   putrescine and spermidine levels in heart, (ii) CPK and LDH activity in
   plasma, and (iii) the area of subendocardial lesions. Conclusions: These
   observations suggest that polyamines are one of the intracellular
   factors that contribute to ISO-mediated cardiac injury in the rat.

Abstract = {{The group B coxsackieviruses (CVB) induce experimental pancreatitis and
   myocarditis in mice and are established agents of human myocarditis,
   especially in children. We tested the hypothesis that the development of
   CVB-induced myocarditis is linked to CVB-induced pancreatitis by
   studying the replication of different CVB strains in mice. Eight of nine
   genotypically different type 3 CVB (CVB3) strains induced acute
   pancreatitis in mice; of these, three viruses also induced acute
   myocarditis. One CVB3 strain was avirulent for both organs. Myocarditis
   was not observed in the absence of pancreatitis. The results obtained by
   inoculation of mice with strains of other CVB serotypes were consistent
   with these data. Infectious Virus titers were measured in serum,
   pancreas, and heart as a function of time after inoculation of mice with
   three CVB3 strains. Each strain was representative of one of the three
   viral virulence phenotypes: avirulent, pancreovirulent only, and
   cardiovirulent. All strains replicated well and persisted in the
   pancreas through 8 days post-inoculation, but the cardiovirulent CVB3
   strain tended to replicate to higher titer earlier and persist longer in
   sera, pancreatic, and cardiac tissues than the noncardiovirulent
   strains. Replication of the CVB3 strains were studied in two human
   pancreatic tumor lines and in primary human endothelial cell cultures
   derived from cardiac artery. Cardiovirulent strains, both individually
   and as a group, tended to replicate to titers as high as, or higher
   than, noncardiovirulent strains did in cell culture. The data are
   consistent with the possibility of an etiologic link between CVB-induced
   pancreatic and heart disease. J,Med. Virol. 62: 70-81, 2000. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{A study on uptake of neutral and dissociating organic compounds from
   soil solution into roots, and their subsequent translocation, was
   undertaken using model simulations. The model approach combines the
   processes of lipophilic sorption, electrochemical interactions, ion
   trap, advection in xylem and dilution by growth. It needs as input data,
   apart from plant properties, log K-ow, pK(a) and the valency number of
   the compound, and pH and chemical concentration in the soil solution.
   Equilibrium and dynamic (steady-state) models were tested against
   measured data from several authors, including non-electrolytes as well
   as weakly acidic and weakly basic compounds. Deviations from the
   measured values led to further development of the model approach:
   sorption in the central cylinder may explain the small transpiration
   stream concentration factor of lipophilic compounds. For
   non-electrolytes, the model predicted uptake and translocation with high
   accuracy. For acids and bases, the tendency of the results was
   satisfactory. The dynamic model and the equilibrium approach gave
   similar results for the root concentration factor. The calculation of
   the transpiration stream concentration factor was more accurate with the
   dynamic model, but still gave deviations up to factor of ten or more.
   The dominating process for monovalent weak electrolytes was found to be
   the ion trap effect. (C) 2000 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The aim was to use mitochondrial DNA sequence data to test between
   vicariance and oversea dispersal explanations for the origin of the
   Chatham Islands biota.
   Location New Zealand and the Chatham Islands, separated by c. 800 km in
   the south-west Pacific Ocean.
   Methods DNA sequences from the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I
   (COI) were obtained from four genera of relatively large and flightless
   insects (Coleoptera-Geodorcus, Mecodema; Orthoptera-Talitropsis;
   Blattoidea-Celatoblatta). These were used to test alternative hypotheses
   for the origin of the Chatham taxa.
   Results Phylogenetic analysis revealed the Chatham taxa in each genus to
   be monophyletic. Genetic distances exhibited by these genera, between
   taxa found on the Chatham Islands and mainland New Zealand were
   relatively low (11.2, 2.8, 3.0 and 4.9\%, respectively).
   Main conclusions Even allowing for variation in molecular evolutionary
   rates, these genetic distances indicate phylogetic separation of New
   Zealand and Chatham insect lineages in the Pliocene (2-6 Ma). Such dates
   are more than one order of magnitude too recent to be explained by
   vicariant (tectonic) processes. Oversea dispersal from New Zealand to
   the Chatham Islands is implicated and this conclusion is in keeping with
   the taxonomy of the endemic avifauna, flora and fossil molluscan fauna.}},

Abstract = {{Generalised architecture for languages, encyclopaedias and nomenclatures
   in medicine (GALEN) has developed a new generation of terminology tools
   based on a language independent model describing the semantics and
   allowing computer processing and multiple reuses as well as natural
   language understanding systems applications to facilitate the sharing
   and maintaining of consistent medical knowledge. During the European
   Union 4 Th. framework program project GALEN-IN-USE and later on within
   two contracts with the national health authorities we applied the
   modelling and the tools to the development of a new multipurpose coding
   system for surgical procedures named CCAM in a minority language
   country, France. On one hand, we contributed to a language independent
   knowledge repository and multilingual semantic dictionaries for
   multicultural Europe. On the other hand, we support the traditional
   process for creating a new coding system in medicine which is very much
   labour consuming by artificial intelligence tools using a medically
   oriented recursive ontology and natural language processing. We used an
   integrated software named CLAW (for classification workbench) to process
   French professional medical language rubrics produced by the national
   colleges of surgeons domain experts into intermediate dissections and to
   the Grail reference ontology model representation. From this language
   independent concept model representation, on one hand, we generate with
   the LNAT natural language generator controlled French natural language
   to support the finalisation of the linguistic labels (first generation)
   in relation with the meanings of the conceptual system structure. On the
   other hand, the Claw classification manager proves to be very powerful
   to retrieve the initial domain experts rubrics list with different
   categories of concepts (second generation) within a semantic structured
   representation (third generation) bridge to the electronic patient
   record detailed terminology. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The effects of a fraction (T1) of Tityus serrulatus scorpion venom
   prepared by gel filtration on gastric emptying and small intestinal
   transit were investigated in male Wistar rats, Fasted animals were
   anesthetized with urethane, submitted to tracheal intubation and right
   jugular vein cannulation. Scorpion toxin (250 mu g/kg) or saline was
   injected iv and 1 h later a bolus of saline (1.0 ml/100 g) labeled with
   (99m)technetium-phytate (10 MBq) was administered by gavage, After 15
   min, animals were sacrificed and the radioactivity remaining in the
   stomach was determined. Intestinal transit was evaluated by instillation
   of a technetium-labeled saline bolus (1.0 mi) through a cannula
   previously implanted in the duodenum. After 60 min, the progression of
   the marker throughout 7 consecutive gut segments was estimated by the
   geometric center method, Gastric retention of the liquid test, meal in
   rats injected with scorpion toxin (median: 88\%; range: 52-95\%) was
   significantly higher (P<0.02) than in controls (54\%; 21-76\%), an
   effect which was not modified by gastric secretion blockade with
   ranitidine. The progression of the isotope marker throughout the small
   intestine was significantly slower (P<0.05) in rats treated with toxin
   (1.2; 1.0-2.5) than in control animals (2.3; 1.0-3.2). Inhibition of
   both gastric emptying and intestinal transit in rats injected with
   scorpion toxin suggests an increased resistance to aboral flow, which
   might be caused by abnormal neurotransmitter release or by the local
   effects of venom on smooth muscle cells.}},

   was analyzed by Western blotting. The production of AprII was
   significantly repressed under iron-rich conditions. Northern
   hybridization analysis demonstrated that April biosynthesis was

   indicate that aprII is a new member of the iron regulon and plays an

Abstract = {{Integrin alpha 2 beta 1 is the major receptor for collagens in the human
   body, and the collagen-binding site on the alpha 2 subunit von
   Willebrand factor A-type domain (vWFA domain) is now well defined.
   However, the biologically important conformational changes that are
   associated with collagen binding, and the means by which the vWFA domain
   is integrated into the whole integrin are not completely understood. We
   have raised monoclonal antibodies against recombinant alpha 2 vWFA
   domain for use as probes of function. Three antibodies, JA202, JA215 and
   JA218, inhibited binding to collagen, collagen I C-propeptide and
   E-cadherin, demonstrating that their function is important for
   structurally diverse alpha 2 beta 1 ligands. Cross-blocking studies
   grouped the epitopes into two clusters: (I) JA202, the inhibitory
   antibody, Gi9, and a non-inhibitory antibody, JA208; (II) JA215 and
   JA218. Both clusters were sensitive to events at the collagen binding
   site, as binding of Gi9, JA202, JA215 and JA218 were inhibited by
   collagen peptide, JA208 binding was enhanced by collagen peptide, and
   binding of JA202 was decreased after mutagenesis of the cation-binding
   residue Thr(221) to alanine. Binding of cluster I antibodies was
   inhibited by the antifunctional anti-beta 1 antibody Mab13, and binding
   of Gi9 and JA218 to alpha 2 beta 1 was inhibited by substituting Mn2+
   for Mg2+, demonstrating that these antibodies were sensitive to changes
   initiated outside the vWFA domain. Mapping of epitopes showed that JA202
   and Gi9 bound between residues 212-216, while JA208 bound between
   residues 199-216. We have therefore identified two epitope clusters with
   novel properties; i.e. they are intimately associated with the
   collagen-binding site, responsive to conformational changes at the
   collagen-binding site and sensitive to events initiated outside the vWFA
   domain.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this prospective, follow-up study was to examine the
   influence of overt hypothyroidism (OHP) and subclinical (SHP), before
   and during thyroxine (T-4) treatment, on lipoprotein(a) {[}Lp(a)], other
   lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins. Twenty-four patients (17 females, 7
   males) with OHP, aged 54 +/- 11.1 years (group A) and 23 patients
   (females) with SHP aged 50.1 +/- 13.2 years (group B) were evaluated and
   compared to 34 and 38 controls, respectively. All patients received T-4
   therapy in a stepwise fashion until euthyroidism was reached.
   Thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), and total triiodothyronine
   (TT3) levels were measured before T-4 therapy and repeatedly every 4
   weeks after the initiation of treatment until the euthyroid state was
   reached. Levels of Lp(a), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG),
   low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc), high-density lipoprotein
   cholesterol (HDLc), apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) and apolipoprotein B
   (apoB) were measured before and 4 months after the achievement of
   euthyroidism. Additionally, body mass index (BMI) was also evaluated. We
   found that in OHP patients, levels of TC, LDLc, and apoB were elevated
   before treatment and decreased significantly after the return to the
   euthyroid state. BMI and levels of triglycerides also decreased
   significantly; Lp(a) was higher in OHP patients in comparison with
   controls and decreased significantly by 14.56\% (25.29\% in men and
   10.34\% in women) during T-4 treatment. In SHP patients, levels of all
   common lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, and Lp(a) did not differ
   significantly from controls before treatment and did not change after
   the euthyroid stage was reached. It is concluded that in overt
   hypothyroidism, Lp(a) levels and most of the lipoproteins were elevated
   before treatment and decreased significantly. In subclinical
   hypothyroidism, lipoproteins and Lp(a) levels were normal at baseline
   and did not change during treatment.}},

Abstract = {{An 88-year-old woman presented to us with angiosarcoma of the scalp that
   had developed over a 6-month period following previous trauma. Despite
   explicit information concerning the extremely malignant potential of the
   tumour the patient refused any surgical intervention. However, she
   agreed to receive local, intralesional interferon alpha -2b and
   interleukin-2 therapy. After partial remission of the tumour, the
   intralesional cytokine injections were combined with surface
   radiotherapy. This combination therapy led to a 2-year remission of both
   the tumour and sonographically suspicious cervical lymph nodes. Apart
   from the typical, moderate side-effects of interferon (alpha -2b and
   interleukin-2 the therapy was well tolerated. In conclusion, in our
   limited experience intralesional cytokine therapy - alone as well as in
   combination with surface irradiation - seems to be an alternative
   therapeutic option for patients who is not a candidate for surgery.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of increase in population on, land use and subsistence
   pattern was examined in two environmentally contrasting Huli-speaking
   communities, Hell and Wenani, in the Tari basin in Papua New Guinea
   Highlands. Despite the similar extent of population increase in both
   communities, the damage to land differed markedly. In Hell, a decrease
   in land productivity owing to excessive agricultural use has induced
   farmers to shorten the fallow duration, which in rum has led to further
   land degradation and difficulties in increasing food production. In
   contrast, Wenani villagers have coped with the population increase by
   enlarging areas for cultivation and possibly will be able to double
   their present production level, although increasingly frequent disputes
   over land rights have restricted peoples' access to fertile areas.
   During a period of climatic perturbations in 1994, land and labor
   productivities of crops were three rimes higher in Wenani than in Hell,
   which suffered a severe food shortage. This difference in ability to
   cope with climatic perturbations may have increased with population
   growth. The findings in the present study suggest that the effects of
   population pressure on food production may differ between communities,
   depending on the indigenous environment and subsistence pattern.}},

   differences in the selection of information, Both the thinking-aloud and
   the click-and-read methods affected the judgment task outcome. Thinking

Abstract = {{The pallido-subthalamic pathway powerfully controls the output of the
   basal ganglia circuitry and has been implicated in movement disorders
   observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). To investigate the normal
   functioning of this pathway across the sleep-wake cycle, single-unit
   activities of subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus (GP) neurons
   were examined, together with cortical electroencephalogram and nuchal
   muscular activity, in non-anaesthetized head-restrained rats. STN
   neurons shifted from a random discharge in wakefulness (W) to a bursting
   pattern in slow wave sleep (SWS), without any change in their mean
   firing rate. This burst discharge occurred in the 1-2 Hz range, but was
   not correlated with cortical slow wave activity. In contrast, GP
   neurons, with a mean firing rate higher in W than in SWS, exhibited a
   relatively regular discharge whatever the state of vigilance. During
   paradoxical sleep, both STN and GP neurons increased markedly their mean
   firing rate relative to W and SWS. Our results are not in agreement with
   the classical `direct/indirect' model of the basal ganglia organization,
   as an inverse relationship between STN and GP activities is not observed
   under normal physiological conditions. Actually, because the STN
   discharge pattern appears dependent on coincident cortical activity,
   this nucleus can hardly be viewed as a relay along the indirect pathway,
   but might rather be considered as an input stage conveying
   corticothalamic information to the basal ganglia.}},

   The subjects were divided into 4 groups according to their BAR and UCP1

   milia on the hands and ankles. The parents were clinically unaffected
   and the family medical history was negative for blistering disease. The

   intensity and the number of anchoring fibrils was reduced, as revealed
   by transmission electron microscopy,
   The diagnosis of a ``sporadic{''} case of dominant dystrophic
   epidermolysis bullosa was suggested, although a mitis case of recessive
   dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa cannot be excluded on the basis of
   clinical, immunofluorescent and ultrastructural examination.
   However recent studies, carried out in a series of seemingly sporadic
   cases, have pointed out the possibility of inheritance of two mutant
   alleles from unaffected parents. This implies that `mild' recessive
   dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is commoner than once thought. This

Abstract = {{Two local varieties of roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.), Jamaican Green
   and Jamaican Red, were grown to determine the amount of natural
   cross-pollination. Two planting arrangements (alternating rows;
   alternating individuals in a row) and two planting dates, a month apart,
   were used for the outcrossing experiments. Stem pigmentation, red (R-)
   vs. green (rr), was used as a genetic marker in the estimation of
   outcrossing. Homozygous dominant and recessive genotypes of Jamaican Red
   and Jamaican Green, respectively, were grown in both of the planting
   arrangements and dates. Seeds from open-pollinated capsules of randomly
   selected Jamaican Green plants were planted to score the frequency of
   cross-pollination. Estimates of natural cross-pollination ranged from
   0.20 +/- 0.09\% to 0.68 +/- 0.34\%. Roselle outcrosses at a low rate in
   Jamaica.}},

Abstract = {{A pregnant 33-year old woman developed nystagmus and cerebellar ataxia.
   A tumor in the roof of the fourth ventricle was diagnosed. The tumor was
   subtotally removed using microneurosurgical techniques. The
   histopathological diagnosis was choroid plexus papilloma (CPP).
   Twenty-one months later, the tumor recurred and was reoperated.
   Histologically the tumor displayed now increased mitotic activity and
   pleomorphism. Radiation therapy of the neuroaxis was performed. Within
   59 months, the CPP recurred 3 more times with neuroradiological evidence
   of extensive spinal seeding.
   After several palliative irradiations, including 2 gamma-knife boosts,
   the patient was referred to chemotherapy. She was treated with CCNU
   (Lomustin) 100 mg/m(2) orally (12 cycles, cumulative dosis 1440
   mg/m(2)).
   Within 42 months, there was no new local recurrence and spinal seeding
   showed significant regression. Clinically the patient improved and
   stabilized, but needs continuous support because of persisting severe
   gait ataxia. The course of disease in our patient provides evidence for
   therapeutic efficacy of CCNU in recurrent CPP.}},

   the present study, the manufacturer's calibration of one type of device
   (CoaguChek(R)) in terms of the international normalized ratio (INR) was
   evaluated by one laboratory. Three subsequent lots of test strips for
   the CoaguChek were investigated using blood samples from 56

   patients were analysed with two international reference preparations for
   thromboplastin (IRP), i.e., rTF/95 (recombinant human) and RBT/90
   (rabbit brain). There were statistically significant INR differences
   between CoaguChek and the international reference preparations (p
   <0.001), but the mean relative deviation of the INR was not greater than
   0.104. Clinically relevant criteria were used to assess the agree ment
   between the CoaguChek and the IRP results. Standard agreement ranged

Abstract = {{According to A.H.C. Van der Heijden (1992), attentional selection of
   visual stimuli can be considered as location selection. Depending on the
   type of task, location selection can be considered to be automatic
   (e.g., in case of abrupt onsets), directly controlled (e.g., in case of
   symbolic precues), or indirectly controlled (e.g.. in case of visual
   search). In tasks with symbolic precues a contralateral enhancement of
   the P1 event-related potential (ERP) component has been found, whereas
   in visual search tasks a contralateral enhancement of the N2 component
   has been found. We hypothesized that both lateralized effects reflect
   the influence of location selection, which differs only in its moment of
   activation. Linear arrays (a target among five distractors, presented at
   two eccentricities) requiring left or right responses, were preceded by
   cues indicating either the precise target location or the side of the
   target, or by bilateral cues that indicated all array positions.
   Array-evoked ERPs, corrected for cue-evoked and interactive effects,
   showed not only lateralized but also target location-specific effects
   for both components, which supports the view that, defending on the type
   of task, either the P1 or the N2 component reflect the influence of
   location selection.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To assess the characteristics of patients with recurrent
   disease by a retrospective analysis.
   Methods. Between 1982 and 1998, 488 patients were treated in Nijmegen
   for testicular cancer. All patients underwent orchiectomy and adjuvant
   treatment when indicated. Patients were routinely followed up.
   Results. In 36 patients (7.4\%), disease recurrence was found during
   follow-up; 12 had contralateral disease and 24 systemic recurrence.
   Contralateral testicular cancer occurred a median of 63.8 months (range
   43.2 to 165.2) after orchiectomy and systemic recurrence at a median of
   6.1 months (range 1.5 to 94.4). Contralateral testicular cancer was more
   frequent in patients with pure seminoma (odds ratio 4.3, 95\% confidence
   interval 1.4 to 13.1); 8 of 9 patients with contralateral cancer
   received adjuvant radiotherapy. The best predictor of systemic
   recurrence after nonseminoma germ cell tumor was the presence of
   teratoma and embryonal cell components in the primary tumor. In the
   entire population, 19 patients (3.9\%) died of the disease. None of the
   patients with contralateral testicular recurrence or systemic recurrence
   after Stage I seminoma died of the disease. One of 10 patients died of
   recurrent Stage I nonseminoma germ cell tumor. The chance of dying of
   recurrence after metastatic nonseminoma germ cell tumor was 36\%.
   Conclusions. Recurrence after an initially complete response is rare in
   testicular cancer. Contralateral testicular cancer is associated with
   the presence of seminoma components in the primary tumor and occurs
   almost 10 times later than systemic recurrence. The prognosis after
   contralateral testicular cancer and after recurrence in Stage I seminoma
   is good. UROLOGY 56: 467-473, 2000. (C) 2000, Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. A randomized cross-over design study in six tetraplegic
   patients.
   Objectives. To investigate the efficacy of coughing in tetraplegic
   patients.
   Summary of Background Data. In tetraplegic patients, pulmonary
   complications due to insufficient clearance of bronchial mucus
   frequently are described. Coughing in tetraplegic patients is thought to
   be insufficient because of severely impaired expiratory muscle function.
   More recently, however, it has been reported that many tetraplegic
   patients may have dynamic airway compression and thus a more or less
   effective cough.
   Methods. Mucus clearance was measured using a radioactive aerosol tracer
   technique during 45 minutes on 2 days: once without intervention, and
   once with voluntary coughing in the period 15 to 30 minutes (once every
   30 seconds). Measurements were done in a randomized order. For each day,
   individual slopes for the decrease in radioactivity were calculated,
   reflecting mucus transport in the peripheral, central, and the whole
   lung region.
   Results. Significant differences in slopes were found between the
   control day and the cough day in the peripheral lung region for the
   interval 0 to 30 minutes and in the whole lung region for the interval 0
   to 30 minutes and 0 to 45 minutes. The improvement of mucus clearance
   due to coughing, however, was relatively small in these patients, only
   3\% after 45 minutes: from 4\% whole lung clearance during quiet
   breathing to 7\% whole lung clearance during coughing.
   Conclusion. Tetraplegic patients may achieve a statistically significant
   increase in their bronchial mucus transport by voluntary coughing.}},

Abstract = {{During the production of pig iron in a blast furnace, a Zn- and
   Pb-containing sludge is generated in the air pollution control system.
   This toxic waste can be landfilled after dewatering and pretreatment,
   which is very costly. The sludge particles contain large amounts of Fe
   and C that could be recycled in the furnace. However, the Zn content of
   the sludge is high, and the Zn input to the blast furnace must be
   limited, so Zn has to be removed. This paper describes a
   hydrometallurgical process whereby the sludge is leached under both acid
   (HCl) and oxidizing conditions. After the separation of the solids,
   which mainly contain C and Fe, from the leaching solution, the latter is
   passed through an anion exchanger to remove Zn and Pb and is
   recirculated to the reactor. Investigation of the leaching behavior
   showed that a pH below 1.5 and a redox potential above 650 mV are
   required to obtain high leaching efficiencies for Zn and Pb. Sequential
   extraction showed that the largest part of Zn and Ph is extracted in
   acid medium, whereas an additional 16-18\% is extracted in oxidizing
   acid medium. XRD analysis showed that after acid leaching, Zn partially
   occurs as sfalerite and as Franklinite. Comparison of the leaching
   behavior of the sludge with that of sfalerite and Franklinite
   geochemical standards confirmed this and showed that sfalerite dissolves
   in acid oxidizing conditions, whereas the Franklinite does not.
   Calculations with the geochemical speciation program MINTEQA2 were
   compared with experimental results, and the process developed was tested
   in a pilot plant.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The American Urological Association (AUA) published clinical
   guidelines for the treatment of ureteral calculi in adults and note that
   up to 98\% of stones less than 5 mm. in diameter will pass
   spontaneously. Ureteroscopy and shock wave lithotripsy were acceptable
   treatment choices for stones less than 10 mm. in diameter in the distal
   ureter. We reviewed our management of distal ureteral stones in children
   to see if the AUA Guidelines for adults would apply.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 14 males and 19 females with a mean
   age of 12 years (range 0.5 to 17) required hospitalization in the last 6
   years for distal ureteral obstruction due to stones. Excretory urography
   or computerized tomography was performed in all cases, and mean stone
   size was 4 mm. (range 1 to 15). When stones did not pass spontaneously
   most patients were treated with ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy.
   Results: There were 12 (36\%) with a mean age of 11 years and a mean
   stone size of 2 mm. (range 1 to 3) who passed stones spontaneously with
   intravenous hydration and narcotics. No child passed a stone 4 mm. or
   greater spontaneously in this series. Of 21 patients (64\%) with a mean
   age of 12 years and a mean stone size of 5 mm. (range 1 to 15) 2 were
   treated with ureteral stents, 17 with ureteroscopic lithotripsy and 2
   with shock wave lithotripsy. All patients were stone-free at the end of
   the procedures. The stone composition was predominantly calcium oxalate,
   Mean followup was 2 years.
   Conclusions: Similar to the AUA guidelines in adults, most stones less
   than 3 mm. in diameter in the distal ureter of children Will pass
   spontaneously. Stones 4 mm or greater in the distal ureter are likely to
   require endosurgical treatment. Ureteroscopy and shock wave lithrotripsy
   have a high success rate for stones between 4 and 15 mm. in the distal
   ureter. Needle ureteroscope and laser lithotripsy have allowed more
   stones to be treated safely and effectively in smaller children.}},

Abstract = {{An effective two-dimensional dynamic interaction is developed which
   incorporates screening of electrons by plasmas and by optical phonons to
   discuss the nature of the pairing mechanism leading to superconductivity
   in layered electron doped cuprates. The system is treated as an ionic
   solid containing layers of electrons as carriers and a model dielectric
   function is set up which fulfils the appropriate sum rules on the
   electronic and ionic polarizabilities. Estimate of the Coulomb
   pseudo-potential (mu{*} = 0.24), describing the screening effects on
   superconductivity is due to reduced electron density and large value of
   the optical dielectric constant as well the effective mass of electrons.
   The electron-phonon coupling constant (lambda) is evaluated as 1.5 which
   infers strong strength of coupling. Following strong coupling theory,
   the superconductivity transition temperature of optimally doped
   Nd-Ce-CuO is estimated as 30 K and the energy gap ratio is larger than
   the BCS value. The isotope exponent, coherence length and magnetic
   penetration depth are also estimated. The implications of the model and

Abstract = {{Single-mode optical fibres were fabricated from a germanosilicate glass
   by the method of modified chemical vapour deposition (MCVD), which used
   sintering of a porous glass in a reducing (helium or

   recording quadratic nonlinear susceptibility compared to a standard
   germanosilicate fibre. Sintering, both in nitrogen and in helium
   atmospheres, was shown to increase the concentration of germanium
   oxygen-deficient centres in glass. It is likely that nitrogen enters
   into a germanosilicate glass in the concentration that is sufficient to
   modify the glass structure and to additionally increase its
   photosensitivity. The replacement of oxygen or silicon in the close
   vicinity of an oxygen vacancy by nitrogen may play a key role in the
   photosensitivity enhancement owing to the formation of additional

Abstract = {{The 63F early puff in the larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes
   contains the divergently transcribed E63-1 and E63-2 ecdysone-inducible
   genes. E63-1 encodes a member of the EF-hand family of Ca2+-binding
   proteins, while E63-2 has no apparent open reading frame. To understand
   the functions of the E63 genes, we have determined the temporal and
   spatial patterns of E63-1 protein expression, as well as undertaken a
   genetic analysis of the 63F puff. We show that E63-1 is expressed in
   many embryonic and larval tissues, but the third-instar larval salivary
   gland is the only tissue where increases in protein levels correlate
   with increases in ecdysone titer. Furthermore, the subcellular
   distribution of E63-1 protein changes dynamically in the salivary glands
   at the onset of metamorphosis. E63-1 and E63-2 null mutations, however,
   have no effect on development or fertility. We have characterized 40 kb
   of the 63F region, defined as the interval between Ubi-p and E63-2, and
   have identified three lethal complementation groups that correspond to
   the dSc-2, ida, and mg-e genes. We show that mge mutations lead to
   first-instar larval lethality and that Mge protein is similar to the
   Tom22 mitochondrial import proteins of fungi, suggesting that it has a
   role in mitochondrial function.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Ineffective tumour antigen processing is recognised as an
   important cause of failure of immunotherapy in melanoma. GM-CSF may
   augment the cytotoxic lymphocyte response by activating
   antigen-presenting cells. This study evaluates a schedule combining
   GM-CSF with biochemotherapy.
   Patients and methods: Nineteen patients with advanced malignant melanoma
   received cisplatin (25 mg/m(2) days 1-3), dacarbazine (220 mg/m(2) days
   1-3), interleukin-2 (9 MIU/m(2)/24h) and interferon-alpha 2b (5
   MIU/m(2)) both days 6-10 and days 17-21, and tamoxifen 40 mg/day
   continuously. Subcutaneous GM-CSF was given in escalating doses to three
   cohorts: 1) 450 mu g/m(2) days 4-5 and 15-16; 2) as 1) plus 225 mu
   g/m(2) days 6-10 and 17-21; 3) 450 mu g/m(2) days 4-10 and 15-21. Each
   cycle was 28 days.
   Results: Constitutional side effects were the major non-haematological
   toxicity and lymphopaenia the main haematological toxicity. Six patients
   responded (32\%, 95\% confidence interval: 13\%-57\%), two patients had
   complete remission. There was an apparent trend for increasing responses
   with increasing GM-CSF dose; zero of six responses in cohort 1, two of
   seven in cohort 2 and three of six in cohort 3 (P = 0.016). Median
   overall survival was 6.2 months. Increasing GM-CSF doses significantly
   increased serum concentrations of neopterin and TNF-alpha.
   Conclusions: The combination of GM-CSF with biochemotherapy is feasible
   and there appears to be a dose-response relationship with GM-CSF in
   terms of host immunological response, and possibly clinical efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, caterpillars are included among the agents that elicit contact
   urticaria by a non-immunologic mechanism. Our objective was to find the
   role that an IgE-mediated mechanism could have among patients with
   suspected contact urticaria from pine processionary caterpillars. 16
   patients with suspected contact urticaria from this caterpillar were
   studied by prick testing and specific IgE detection by immunoblotting.
   87\% of the patients had a positive prick test and immunoblotting for
   caterpillar extract. In these allergic patients, the symptoms associated
   with urticaria were: angioedema (79\%), conjunctivitis (36\%) and severe
   anaphylaxis (14\%). The most frequent localizations of the wheals were
   the neck (100\%) and forearms (93\%). Angioedema was more frequent on
   the eyelids (79\%). The IgE-immunoblot detected in the caterpillar
   extract several reactive bands, with apparent MWs from to 45 to 4kDa. A
   total of 5 major allergens were identified, but a band around 14kDa
   proved to be the dominant allergen. Sensitization to Thaumetopoea
   pityocampa was found to be the most important mechanism of airborne
   contact urticaria from this caterpillar. Low-MW proteins are the main
   IgE binding components of crude caterpillar extract.}},

Abstract = {{Staging laparoscopy avoids unnecessary laparotomies in patients with
   unresectable intra-abdominal malignancies. However, the postoperative
   oncologic treatment of these patients has not been documented. This
   study compares rates and timing of postoperative chemotherapy (ChT)
   and/or radiation therapy (XRT) in patients with unresectable
   intra-abdorninal malignancies initially evaluated by staging laparoscopy
   (SL) or exploratory laparotomy (E-L). The records of patients surgically
   evaluated for esophageal, gastric, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic cancers
   or abdominal lymphoma were retrospectively reviewed. Data gathered
   included type of exploration (SL or EL), resectability, whether
   postoperative cancer treatment was given (ChT, XRT, or both), and the
   time from surgery to the beginning of such treatment. This study
   includes only patients with unresectable malignancies. Twenty-one
   patients underwent SL and 58 EL. Sixteen of the SL patients (76\%) and
   25 of the EL patients (43\%) received postoperative cancer treatment (P
   = 0.009). The median number of days from surgery to postoperative cancer
   treatment was 13 days (range 5 to 41 days) for the SL group and 35 days
   (range 16 to 89 days) for the EL group (P = 0.0004). We conclude that
   patients with unresectable intra-abdominal malignancies discovered by SL
   are more likely to receive postoperative ChT and/or XRT than patients
   surgically evaluated by EL. Further studies to determine whether this
   better utilization of postoperative treatment results in better outcomes
   in these patients are needed.}},

Abstract = {{The flow and structural characteristics of concentrated milk were
   analyzed between concentrations of 12.5 and 46.7\% solids content at
   room temperature. The rheological behavior of milk concentrates was
   represented by parameters corresponding to Newtonian, Power Law, or
   Herschel-Bulkley equations depending on the solids content level. The
   resulting flow behavior indices and consistency coefficients were
   correlated to concentration by a single-term exponential equation, with
   only milk concentrates above 40\% solids content exhibiting yield
   stress. Milk concentrates were characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), complemented by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
   and image analysis (IA). Casein micelles appeared as granular particles
   (0.1-0.3 mu m) with a rough surface. Fat globules, noted as small holes
   in the SEM pictures, appeared to be major spherical components (0.5-10
   mu m) in the transmission electron microscope images as well as in the
   image analysis inverted micrographs. Fat globules in the milk
   concentrates were surrounded by a membrane which was thicker in the
   concentrated milk than in the fresh milk. TEM images were very helpful
   in observing the interparticle interactions, as well as the thickness of
   the fat membranes that corroborated with the SEM observations. The IA
   pictures allowed the identification and characterization of the fat

Abstract = {{Insight into the temporal and spatial variability of nitrous oxide (N2O)
   fluxes from soils is required to set up efficient sampling protocols of
   N2O fluxes and to set up strategies to reduce N2O fluxes. The aim of the
   present study was to assess the temporal stability of the spatial
   pattern of N2O fluxes along a transect (400 m) on a fertilized sloping
   grassland soil. Geostatistical analyses of flux chamber measurements
   over 4 d showed a clear spatial dependency of N2O fluxes. The spatial
   variability of N2O fluxes was much higher than the temporal variability
   during the 4 d. Despite the decreasing magnitude of the flues in time,
   the spatial pattern persisted during 4 d, that is, fluxes were always
   highest at the steepest part of the transect. The N-15 natural abundance
   (delta(15)N) in soil N was significantly correlated with N2O fluxes,
   indicating a long-term effect of N loss as N2O on the N-15 abundance in
   the soil. It was suggested that topography played a role in the observed
   spatial patterns of N2O nuxes and Delta(15)N in soil N. The study showed
   that despite the persistent spatial pattern of N2O fluxes, flux
   magnitude may strongly fluctuate in time. Therefore, it is often not
   possible to combine N2O flux measurements made at different times in
   order to obtain enough data for geostatistical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{We measured the detectability of moving signal dots in dynamic noise to
   determine whether local motion signals are preferentially combined along
   an axis parallel to the direction of motion. Observers were asked to
   detect a signal composed of three dots moving in a linear trajectory
   among dynamic noise dots. The signal dots were collinear and equally
   spaced in a configuration that was either parallel to or perpendicular
   to their trajectory. The probability of detecting the signal was
   measured as a function of noise density, over a range of signal dot
   spacings from 0.5 degrees to 5.0 degrees. At any given noise density,
   the signal in the parallel configuration was more detectable than that
   in the perpendicular configuration. Our four observers could tolerate
   1.5-2.5 times more noise in the parallel configuration. This improvement
   is not due merely to temporal summation between consecutive dots in the
   parallel trajectory. Temporal summation functions measured on our
   observers indicate that the benefit from spatial coincidence of the dots
   lasts for no more than 50 ms, whereas the increased detectability of the
   parallel configuration is observed up to the largest temporal
   separations tested (210 ms). These results demonstrate that dots
   arranged parallel to the signal trajectory are more easily detected than
   those arranged perpendicularly. Moreover, this enhancement points to the
   existence of visual mechanisms that preferentially organize motion
   information parallel to the direction of motion. (C) 2000 Optical

Abstract = {{It has been shown in a companion paper that the permeability of a porous
   body can be found from a three-point bending experiment. When the sample
   is bent, a pressure gradient is created in the liquid within the pores;
   as the liquid nons in response to the gradient, the force that must be
   applied to the rad to sustain a fixed deflection decreases with time. Bg
   fitting the force decay curve to the predicted shape, the permeability
   is obtained, along with the elastic modulus, In this paper, that theory
   is tested using porous Vycor(R) glass saturated with various solvents,
   including several normal alcohols, water, and glycerol. The shape of the
   measured decay is in excellent agreement with the prediction. Consistent
   with observations of previous workers, we find that the permeability is
   influenced by the size of the soh-ent molecule; by assuming that the
   pore surfaces are covered with a monolayer of immobile solvent, the
   observed variation can be explained, The advantage of the beam-bending
   method is that the results are obtained in a few minutes; moreover,
   there is no problem with leaks or need for high pressures, as there is
   in conventional measurements of low permeabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Our own series of tumors of the upper cervical spine was analyzed

   total of nine patients (mean age 61 years, metastasis 4, plasmocytoma 3,
   chordoma 1, histiocytosis 1) were treated between 1/92 and 2/99. A total
   of 12 operations were carried out. One-step procedures (6): Three
   extraoral, one transoral, one dorsal and in one case combined dorsal and
   extraoral tumor removal were performed. Three dorsal occipitocervical or
   atlantoaxial stabilizations. one ventral plating and two combined
   ventral plating plus dorsal three-point fixations, and four vertebral
   body replacements were carried out. Two-step procedures (3): three
   extraoral tumor removals with ventral plating plus dorsal three-point
   fixation, in combination with vertebral body replacement in two cases.
   The neurological status and the quality of life (Karnofsky performance
   status, pain levels) were analyzed preoperatively and at the follow-up
   outpatient examinations (mean follow-up: 18 months). Flexion-extension
   radiographs were performed at the follow-up. There was no operative
   mortality. The transient morbidity was 11 \%. The operative intervention
   improved the quality of life in all patients. Three patients died within
   27 months of operation. Tumor resection at the upper cervical spine
   using individually modified surgical strategies over an approach
   corresponding to the tumor location, stabilization and vertebral body
   replacement increases significantly the time of survival and quality of
   life with an acceptable surgical risk for complications.}},

Abstract = {{Up to 1620, Charles had fulfilled the first stage of his dynastic
   process: the attainment of nearly al his patrimonial heritage. The
   second stage, the preservation of this great empire, proved a difficult
   one, so from 1522 the emperor transferred some parts of his own
   patrimony and rights to his brother Ferdinand. The latter created his
   own dynastic patrimony, made up of a part of his German territories,
   Austria, the hereditary crowns of Bohemia and Hungary and finally the
   rights over the empire. The third stage, the establishment of an heir to
   secure the dynastic process, was initiated as early as 1525. Charles in
   fact decided he needed two heirs: a son of his own for his patrimonial
   possessions, and his brother Ferdinand for the empire. The attainment of
   both aims, without establishing which of them was the main one, followed
   a single path, but with two different aims. Fundamental in this third
   process were the arrangements for the imperial wedding, its celebration
   in Seville in 1526, the pregnancy of Isabel de Portugal in Granada in
   the same year, and the birth of an heir in Valladolid in 1527. The main
   goal in the process, the imperial coronation in Rome and the election of
   Ferdinand as king of Romans, were postponed due to the historical events
   and were fulfilled in 1530 and 1531, concluding the third stage in the
   dynastic course of the emperor Charles V.}},

Abstract = {{External radiation therapy of brain tumors may cause adverse effects on
   normal brain tissue, resulting in severe neuropsychological and
   cognitive impairment. We investigated the late delayed radiation effects
   in the white matter (WM) using H-1 magnetic resonance spectroscopic
   imaging ((HMRSI)-H-1). Nine glioma patients with local radiation-induced
   signal abnormalities in the T-2-weighted MR images were studied with
   nine age- and sex-matched controls. The metabolite ratios in the
   radiation-induced hyper intensity area (RIHA) and in the normal
   appealing white matter (NAWM) of the patients were compared with
   respective WM areas of the controls. In RIHA, choline/creatine (Cho/Cr)
   was 17\% decreased (1.22 +/- 0.13 vs 1.47 +/- 0.16, p = 0.0027,
   significant (s), unpaired Student's t test with Bonferroni correction)

   difference in NAA/Cr (2.99 +/- 0.46 vs 3.16 +/- 0.32, p = 0.38).
   NAA(RIHA)/TAA(NAWM) was 25\% decreased (0.75 +/- 0.20 vs 1.00 +/- 0.12,
   p = 0.0043, s) and Cr-RIHA/Cho(NAWM) was 16\% decreased (0.89 +/- 0.15

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simplified formula that can be used to obtain the
   detailed heat transfer rate and temperature distribution on the surfaces
   of square and non-square cooling channels of a nozzle guide vane (NGV).
   Due to the three-dimensional shape of the internally cooling channels,
   the heat transfer rate can vary substantially between the different
   sides of the channels. This detailed heat flux and resulting temperature
   distribution on the walls are important to improve the design of the
   airfoil as well as to determine the expected usable life of the NGV.
   This detail heat transfer data is usually obtained by means of a complex
   three-dimensional simulation of the NGV configuration. Therefore, for
   design purposes, the heat transfer data on the channel surfaces is often
   assumed to be the average heat transfer rate on the channel walls. The
   average heat transfer rate can be obtained by using a simplified heat
   transfer equation, based on the average Reynolds number in the channel.
   The simplified formula presented in this paper can be used to obtain the
   derailed heat transfer rate and temperature distribution on the surfaces
   of square and non-square cooling channels of a nozzle guide vane (NGV).
   The simplified formula is based on results obtained from
   three-dimensional simulations of the heat transfer in the channels and
   was compared to simulated and experimental data over a range in flow
   rates and channel geometries. In general, it can be concluded that the
   formulation produces fast and accurate results over a wide range of
   applications. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The present study reviewed the occurrence of gall bladder
   carcinoma in patients who underwent a cholecystectomy for gallstone
   disease.
   Methods: A retrospective study of demographical and clinical information
   for patients who underwent a cholecystectomy and operative cholangiogram
   for gallstones predominantly in three major hospitals located in the
   northern area of Melbourne was carried out.
   Results: Gall bladder carcinomas were observed in 14 patients (3.2\%;
   95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.8-5.3\%) consisting of 11 women and
   three men of median age 78.5 years (interquartile range: 77-81)from a
   series of 439 patients with a male-to-female ratio of 1-2. The results
   of the present study show that primary carcinoma of the gall bladder in
   this descriptive retrospective cohort was always associated with single
   or multiple cholesterol gallstones that were impacting on the gall
   bladder wall. Cholesterol `solitaire' gallstones were ovoid in shape
   with diameters >3 cm along their longest axis, whereas multiple
   cholesterol gallstones varied in size and number from two or three large
   stones (1-2 cm), to numerous smaller stones (variable size to 0.5 cm).
   No patient with gall bladder carcinoma had either brown or black pigment
   gallstones.
   Conclusion: It is postulated that gall bladder carcinoma may be
   intimately associated with large or numerous cholesterol gallstones that
   in the first instance may interfere with the mechanical functioning of
   the gall bladder. The size as well as the number of gallstones present
   in the gall bladder may contribute significantly to the promotion of a
   gallstone filling defect of the gall bladder that may cause chronic
   mechanical damage to the gall bladder mucosa. The present report
   supports the hypothesis that gall bladder carcinoma is an age-dependent
   malignancy, present mostly in women, that may be intimately associated
   with long-standing benign gallstone disease of the gall bladder.}},

Abstract = {{The advantages of migrating from traditional monolithic business

   argued to be highly reliable since these components have been tested and
   used in many other business applications. However, all possible uses of
   components are not known at design and construction stage. Additionally,
   integration testing is needed as components are assembled to make
   business application systems. Component-based software development
   requires that testing issues be addressed adequately. In this paper, we
   explore testing related issues in business components and in particular,
   business application systems that are made by integrating these
   components. An integration test strategy for business component

Abstract = {{The respiratory burst in human granulocytes activated by 33 different
   congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was measured as
   luminol-amplified chemoluminescence. The selection of 20 (training set)
   compounds was based on multivariate chemical characterization, laying
   the groundwork for covering the whole chemical series of tetra- through
   hepta-chlorinated PCBs. In addition 6 congeners were used as a
   validation set, and 7 were monoto tri-chlorinated congeners representing
   low-chlorinated compounds not covered by the training set. Only
   ortho-substituted biphenyls activate respiratory burst. There is a
   correlation between activated respiratory burst and the total surface
   area of congeners up to 230 x 10(-20) m(2). Congeners of larger size
   show a reduced activity. There is also a correlation between respiratory
   burst activity and the number of ortho-substituents. Furthermore, there
   is also a correlation with parameters that describe absolute hardness of
   the molecule and respiratory burst activity. Congeners with a
   2,4,6-substitution on one biphenyl ring are optimal activators. In
   conclusion, all three factors, size, rotation, and electronic
   properties, which are not independent of each other, are important for
   the activity of the PCBs. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the processing parameters of thermoplastic elastomer
   compounds on their properties is studied. The compounds consist of
   ethylene-propylene rubber and high- or low-density polyethylene (HDPE or
   LDPE) mixed with extenders in equal amounts. The variations in the
   degree of crystallinity under different mixing modes are examined by
   means of differential scanning calorimetry. The variations in the
   molecular weight distribution (MWD) of polymeric constituents of the
   compounds are estimated based on the results of rheological tests. An
   increase in the mixing and extrusion rates affects, up to certain
   limits, the mechanical properties positively. The optimum preparation
   modes for HPDE - and LDPe-based compounds are different. A noticeable
   mechanical destruction of HDPE-based compounds, estimated from the MWD
   parameters, occurs when the work of mixing exceeds 3.4 kJ/g and is
   accompanied by cross-linking. Up to 7.1 kJ/g, the work of mixing
   improves the properties of LDPE-based compounds. The extrusion effects
   do not smooth out the mixing effects-both these effects add up.}},

   constants of the complex were measured. Chemiluminescence spectra of
   Ln(3+) beta-diketonates were recorded and relative luminescence quantum
   yields compared. Yb3+ chelates show higher luminescence yields compared
   to Nd3+, due to a different efficiency of non-radiative energy
   degradation. Chemiexcitation of Ln(3+) ions in the systems studied
   occurs by: (a) intermolecular singlet-singlet energy transfer: Ad =
   O-S{*} --> L-S{*} --> L-T{*} --> Ln(3+){*} (where L-S{*} and L-T{*} are
   the first singlet and triplet excited states of the beta-diketonate

Abstract = {{In prospective studies, Staphylococcus aureus small-colony variants
   (SCVs) have been linked to persistent and recurrent infections. SCVs are
   a naturally occurring subpopulation often defective in electron
   transport which may be identified in the microbiological laboratory as
   nonpigmented, nonhemolytic, slow-growing pinpoint colonies after
   incubation on rabbit blood agar. In addition, the often relatively
   unstable SCVs demonstrate a number of other characteristics that are
   atypical for S. aureus including reduced alpha -toxin production and
   delayed coagulase activity. A site-directed hemB mutant with a stable
   SCV phenotype provided strong evidence for the link between these
   electron transport defective strains and persistent infections. The hemB
   mutant was phagocytized by cultured endothelial cells, but did not lyse
   these cells, because the mutant produced very little alpha -toxin. Thus,
   SCVs can hide within the host cell, then revert to the highly virulent
   rapidly growing form and lyse the host cell, once the host immune
   response has abated and antibiotic therapy is completed. The
   intracellular position shields SCVs from host defenses and decreases
   exposure to antibiotics. This review discusses what is known of the
   biology of SCVs and describes the recovery and significance of
   Staphylococcus SCVs in clinical specimen.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW C}},

Abstract = {{Form factor measurements of M2 and M4 transitions to the lowest
   J(pi)=2(-) and 4(-) states, respectively, in Ca-48 with inelastic
   electron scattering at 180 degrees are reported for momentum transfers q
   similar or equal to 0.4-0.8 fm(-1). These form factors complement
   previous measurements at higher q which have been treated by Lallena
   {[}Phys. Rev. C 48, 344 (1993)], as a test case to derive information on
   in-medium modifications of the rho-meson mass. He deduced within the
   random-phase approximation (RPA) an effective mass m(rho)({*})similar or
   equal to 0.9-0.95 m(rho) assuming simultaneous scaling of the pi
   coupling constant (Brown-Rho scaling). The validity of the analysis is
   critically assessed by comparing the measured form factors to second
   random-phase approximation (SRPA) calculations with a pi+rho exchange
   interaction. The dependence of the form factors on the: choice of the
   interaction and corrections such as mesonic exchange currents (MEC) are
   found to be of comparable magnitude to effects from a dropping of
   m(rho), and in-medium effects hence cannot be clearly inferred from the
   data. To quantify the latter would require first the construction of an
   interaction which is capable of describing simultaneously and optimally
   a large variety of low-energy nuclear properties in Ca-48. Remaining
   discrepancies in such a description could then be studied with the aim
   to single out in-medium effects of the type advocated by Lallena.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To report the surgical management of leaking filtering blebs
   occurring after blebitis or persistent hypotony.
   Design: Retrospective, noncomparative case series.
   Participants: Twenty-two eyes of 20 patients with late bleb leak,
   blebitis or endophthalmitis, hypotony maculopathy, or bleb dysesthesia
   on presentation to the glaucoma service who required surgical bleb
   revision from 1990 through 1999.
   Intervention: Pedicle flap, partial excision, and advancement or free
   conjunctival autologous graft techniques for surgical bleb revision.
   Type of bleb revision was dependent on the dimensions of the bleb and
   quality. of surrounding conjunctiva.
   Main Outcome Measurer Preoperative and postoperative intraocular
   pressure (IOP), status of bleb leak, reoperation for glaucoma, or
   requirement for postrevision glaucoma medical therapy, with success
   defined as the need for two or fewer glaucoma medications after
   revision.
   Results: Eighty-six percent (19/22) of eyes that underwent surgical bleb
   revision had resolution of leak and IOP control using two or fewer
   medications after one or more bleb revisions. The preoperative IOP (mean
   +/- standard deviation) was 3.7 +/- 2.6 mmHg (range, 0-8 mmHg). After an
   average follow-up of 21 months (range, 8-108 months), the IOP was 11.0
   +/- 4.4 mmHg for patients taking 0.6 +/- 1.0 glaucoma medications.
   Eighteen percent (4/22) of eyes required two or more bleb revisions. In
   one eye, an IOP spike of 36 mmHg developed after revision, which
   required laser suture lysis on two occasions before the IOP was
   significantly lowered. The three failures were: one eye that required
   three or more medications for IOP control, a patient whose eye had a
   persistent leak after revision and who was not mentally competent to
   undergo repeat revision, and one eye that required combined glaucoma and
   cataract surgery after revision.
   Conclusions: Surgical bleb revision has a high success rate of closing
   late bleb leaks, maintaining glaucoma control, and preserving vision,
   with few postoperative complications. The appropriate surgical procedure
   for revision must be based on the individual clinical situation and can
   result in successful bleb revision. Ophthalmology 2000;107:1681-1687 (C)

   depth of focus decreases and focus control becomes more critical.
   Polarization effects on both the reticle and the resist film must be

   magnets have high resistance to thermal demagnetization because of their
   low temperature coefficients of (i)H(c) which result in a higher (i)H(c)
   at high temperature. Thermal stability of these magnets at 300-550
   degreesC has been studied, showing that the loss due to metallurgical
   changes is <2\% for new magnets at 550<degrees>C for 360 hr, Experiment
   confirms that coated magnets can be expected to have considerable life
   expectancy and relatively low magnetic losses at the intended T(M),
   Experiment also shows that, at high temperatures, the magnetic pinning
   strength in the magnets increases as the T(M) increases, TEM
   microstructures for some magnets have been studied. Magnets with higher
   T(M) have smaller cell sizes and larger volume of cell boundaries than
   conventional 2:17 magnets, It is believed that the large volume of cell
   boundaries plays a role in the high resistance to thermal
   demagnetization.}},

   on Au(111) substrates by thermal evaporation. Typically, the Au clusters
   are one atomic layer thick and plate-like, with a diameter of similar
   to2-10 nm. While most of the Au clusters are found at the SAM/Au(111)
   interface, a fraction of the clusters reside on top of the SAMs as
   evidenced by the existence of the Coulomb blockade and Coulomb staircase
   in the scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Using scanning tunneling
   microscopy under ambient conditions, we also investigated the stability
   of the gold clusters at the SAM/Au(111) interface. For a given nominal
   coverage of Au, the gold clusters on C-7 are larger and diffuse faster
   than those on C-10 and C-18. (C) 2000 American Vacuum Society.

Abstract = {{To examine temporal changes in population genetic structure, we compared
   the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of three populations that lived

   present day. Two indices were used to compare the genetic differences:
   the frequency distributions of the radiating haplotype groups and the
   genetic distances among the populations. The results indicate that the
   genetic backgrounds of the three populations are distinct from each
   other. Inconsistent with the geographical distribution, the
   2,500-year-old Linzi population showed greater genetic similarity to
   present-day European populations than to present-day east Asian
   populations. The 2,000-year-old Linzi population had features that were
   intermediate between the present-day European/2,500-year-old Linzi

Abstract = {{Fly-stiction is a special kind of stiction that occurs at the interface
   between a hard drive head and the hard disk. It can have very high
   values and has caused serious problems for the computer industry in the
   past. It is defined as that taken after a certain number of CSS cycles
   in the landing zone of a disk, followed by an extended period of time of
   sweep or track dwell in the data zone and finally an extended period of
   park time in the landing zone. This paper has studied the nature,
   mechanism and solutions of the high fly-stiction phenomenon. CSS
   testers, optical microscopes, an optical surface analyzer and a Fourier
   transform infrared spectrometer were used to measure fly-stiction values
   and analyze the rest surfaces of heads and disks. The results obtained
   indicate that the fly-stiction value is much higher than the
   corresponding park-stiction value. The fly-stiction value does not
   change with increasing number of CSS cycles, and may decrease slightly
   with increasing lubricant thickness. In addition, a high fly-stiction
   value may be caused by a contamination of spindle grease. Finally, a
   high fly-stiction value can be reduced by avoiding contamination or
   increasing the resistance to contamination of a disk. For instance, an
   ion-beam carbon overcoat can reduce the fly-stiction to half the value
   obtained with a sputter carbon overcoat. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Alterations in transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and its
   type II receptor (T beta R-II) have been implicated in the pathogenesis
   of a variety of human cancers and animal tumor models. We postulated
   that TGF-beta 1 and T beta R-II alterations may also be involved in
   mouse colon tumorigenesis induced by the chemical carcinogen,
   azoxymethane (AOM). In the present study, normal colon tissues and
   AOM-induced colon tumors from SWR/J mice were analyzed for mutational
   changes in the T beta R-II gene, and the expression and localization of
   TGF-beta 1 and T beta R-II were examined by reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and
   immunohistochemisty. Direct DNA sequencing of the coding sequence of the
   T beta R-II gene revealed no mutational changes in tumors induced by AOM
   when compared with the sequence from normal colon tissue. However,
   TGF-beta 1 and T beta R-II mRNA levels in tumor samples were increased
   1.8-fold (p<0.01) and 1.3-fold (p<0.01), respectively, when compared
   with control mouse colon tissue. The results of immunohistochemical
   analysis of TGF-beta 1 and T beta R-II were correlated with mRNA
   expression data. An increase in staining intensity of both TGF-beta and
   T beta R-II were observed in colon tumors. These findings suggest that
   alterations in the expression of TGF-beta 1 and T beta R-II may be
   involved in the pathogenesis of colon tumors induced by AOM in mice.}},

Abstract = {{The MELCOR code, developed by Sandia National Laboratories, is capable
   of simulating the severe accident phenomena of light water reactor
   nuclear power plants (NPPs). A specific large-break loss-of-coolant
   accident (LOCA)for Kuosheng NPP is simulated with the use of the MELCOR
   1.8.4 code. This accident is induced by a double-ended guillotine break
   of one of the recirculation pipes concurrent with complete failure of
   the emergency core cooling system. The MELCOR input deck for the
   Kuosheng NPP is established based on the design data of the Kuosheng NPP
   and the MELCOR users' guides. The initial steady-state conditions are
   generated with a developed self-initialization algorithm. The effect of
   the MELCOR 1.8.4-provided initialization process is demonstrated The
   main severe accident phenomena and the corresponding fission product
   released fractions associated with the large-break LOCA sequences are
   simulated. The MELCOR 1.8.4 predicts a longer time interval between the
   core collapse and vessel failure and a higher source term. This MELCOR
   1.8.4 input deck will be applied to the probabilistic risk assessment,
   the severe accident analysis, and the severe accident management study
   of the Kuosheng NPP in the near future.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{166}},

Abstract = {{Among the many responses to GH administration is suppression of
   voluntary feed intake (FI) in some species, attributed to improvement in
   the efficiency of nutrient utilization and, therefore, reduced need for
   Ingested substrates. Commercial broiler chickens have been generically
   selected for generations for rapid growth, realized largely via the
   major correlated response of increased voluntary tired consumption.
   Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and monoamines play very important roles in the
   central regulation of feeding. Preliminary studies from our laboratory
   suggest that the appetite-suppressive effect of GH may be independent of
   its actions as a repartitioning agent, and may involve alterations in
   NPY expression at the pre-translational level. The purpose of this
   investigation was to explore the dose-response nature of the
   appetite-suppressive effect of GH in juvenile broilers, and the possible
   involvement of NPY and monoamines in this process. A GH dose-response
   study was conducted using 8-week-old female broilers infused i.v. with
   CH in a pulsatile pattern for 7 days at 0, 10, 50, 100 or 200 mug/kg
   body weight per day. Hypothalamic NPY and epinephrine (EP)
   concentrations decreased in a dose-related manner with GH. At the
   highest dosage, voluntary FI decreased 19\% (P<0.05) and hypothalamic
   NPY mRNA decreased approximately 50\% in the infundibular nuclei and
   midline region (P<0.0001). In contrast, birds pairfed to the high-GH
   dosage group did riot differ from controls, verifying that changes in
   NPY and monoamines were not secondary to reduced FI. We conclude that
   hypothalamic NPY and EP are likely candidates to explore further as
   mediators of the appetite-suppressive effect of GH.}},

Abstract = {{GRB 980519 is characterized by its rapidly declining optical and X-ray
   afterglows. Explanations of this behaviour include models invoking a
   dense medium environment, which makes the shock wave evolve quickly into
   the subrelativistic phase, a jet-like outflow, and a wind-shaped
   circumburst medium environment. Recently, Frail et al. found that the
   latter two cases are consistent with the radio afterglow of this burst.
   Here, by considering the transrelativistic shock hydrodynamics, we show
   that the dense medium model can also account for the radio light curve
   quite well. The potential virtue of the dense medium model for GRB
   980519 is that it implies a smaller angular size of the afterglow, which
   is essential for interpreting the strong modulation of the radio light
   curve. Optical extinction arising from the dense medium is not important
   if the prompt optical-UV flash accompanying the gamma-ray emission can
   destroy dust by sublimation out to an appreciable distance. Comparisons
   with some other radio afterglows are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new type semiconductor gas sensor of p+n combined
   structure is reported. The combined structure semiconductor gas sensor
   is a novel gas sensor that is based on the complementary feedback and
   complementary multiplication principle (Wu XH. United States Patent 5,

   Beijing, China, 1998). The sensor is composed of two sensitive bodies A
   and B whose conductive types ale different. A is a p type material and B
   is an n type material. The results analyzed from a theoretical viewpoint
   showed that when A and B satisfied certain conditions, the sensor not
   only realized multiplication of sensitivity and selectivity, but also
   had better thermal stability. According to the sensor's structure and
   meeting conditions, we prepared the p+n type gas sensor for C2H5OH. The
   experimental results showed that they concurred with theoretical
   analysis very well. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A mass correlation of central black holes and their spheroids similar to
   0.002 (within a factor of three) is suggested by Hubble Space Telescope
   (HST) and various ground-based CCD photometries of early type galaxies.
   The near-IR images of quasar hosts and the emission line measurements of
   Broad Line Region for bright QSOs present a similar correlation, which
   supports the speculation of an evolutionary linkage between the early
   active QSO phase and the central black holes in normal galaxies. On the
   other hand, recent reverberation mapping of a sample of Seyferts shows a
   broad distribution of black hole to bulge mass ratio with a mean of
   similar to 10(-3.5), about one magnitude lower than the value in early
   type galaxies and bright QSOs. Adopting a simple unified formation
   scheme for QSOs and Seyferts, we will discuss in this letter the
   dependence of the black hole to bulge mass ratio in Active Galactic
   Nuclei (AGNs) on the environmental parameters of the host galaxies. We
   show a broad distribution of the mass correlation could be due to
   different velocity dispersion of the accreting gas from different
   Formation mechanism, and the mass ratio in normal galaxies and bright
   QSOs is probably a limit case of black hole evolution by merger enhanced
   accretion close to Eddington limit.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between resting energy expenditure (REE) and
   metabolically active fat-free mass (FFM) is a cornerstone in the study
   of physiological aspects of body weight regulation and human energy
   requirements. Important questions, however, remain unanswered regarding
   the observed linear REE-FFM association in adult humans. This led us to
   develop a series of REE-body composition models that provide insights
   into the widely used simple linear REE-FFM prediction model derived
   experimentally in adult humans. The new models suggest that the REE-FFM
   relationship in mammals as a whole is curvilinear, that a segment of
   this function within a FFM range characteristic of adult humans can be
   fit with a linear equation almost identical to that observed from a
   composite review of earlier human studies, and that mammals as a whole
   exhibit a decrease in the proportion of FFM as high metabolic rate
   organs with greater FFM. The present study thus provides a new approach
   for examining REE-FFM relationships, advances in a quantitative manner
   previously observed albeit incompletely formulated REE-body composition
   associations, and identifies areas in need of additional research.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to evaluate the performance of a
   new bioelectrical impedance instrument, the Soft Tissue Analyzer (STA),
   which predicts a subject's body composition. A cross-sectional
   population study in which the impedance of 205 healthy adult subjects
   was measured using the STA. Extracellular water (ECW) volume (as a
   percentage of total body water, TBW) and fat-free mass (FFM) were
   predicted by both the STA and a compartmental model, and compared
   according to correlation and limits of agreement analysis, with the
   equivalent data obtained by independent reference methods of measurement
   (TBW measured by D2O dilution, and FFM measured by dual-energy X-ray
   absorptiometry). There was a small (2.0 kg) but significant (P < 0.02)
   difference in mean FFM predicted by the STA, compared with the reference
   technique in the males, but not in the females (-0.4 kg) or in the
   combined group (0.8 kg). Both methods were highly correlated. Similarly,
   small but significant differences for predicted mean ECW volume were
   observed. The limits of agreement for FFM and ECW were -7.5-9.9 and
   -4.1-3.0 kg, respectively. Both FFM and ECW (as a percentage of TBW) are
   well predicted by the STA on a population basis, but the magnitude of
   the limits of agreement with reference methods may preclude its
   usefulness for predicting body composition in an individual. In
   addition, the theoretical basis of an impedance method that does not
   include a measure of conductor length requires further validation. (C)

Abstract = {{Models of the exercise hyperpnoea have classically incorporated elements
   of proportional feedback (carotid and medullary chemosensory) and
   feedforward (central and/or peripheral neurogenic) control. However, the
   precise details of the control process remain unresolved, reflecting in
   part both technical and interpretational limitations inherent in
   isolating putative control mechanisms in the intact human, and also the
   challenges to linear control theory presented by multiple-input
   integration, especially with regard to the ventilatory and gas-exchange
   complexities encountered at work rates which engender a metabolic
   acidosis. While some combination of neurogenic, chemoreflex and
   circulatory-coupled processes are likely to contribute to the control,
   the system appears to evidence considerable redundancy. This, coupled
   with the lack of appreciable error signals in the mean levels of
   arterial blood gas tensions and pH over a wide range of work rates, has
   motivated the formulation of innovative control models that reflect not
   only spatial interactions but also temporal interactions (i.e. memory).
   The challenge is to discriminate between robust competing control models
   that: (a) integrate such processes within plausible physiological
   equivalents: and (b) account for both the dynamic and steady-state
   system response over a range of exercise intensities. Such models are
   not yet available. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new solution is presented to the problem of relating source strength

   profiles based on profiles of the turbulent length and velocity scales.
   The matrix translates the effects of persistence (a temporal effect)
   into spatial coordinates and represents the change from near-field to
   far-field in a continuous fashion, successfully accounting for both
   regimes. A test of the new model using wind-tunnel data showed excellent
   quantitative agreement between model and measurements. A comparison was
   also made with M. R. Raupach's localized near-field theory, which
   underestimated the near-field effect in the wind-tunnel data and

   not the 1/3-octave passband, but the transition bands that were chiefly
   responsible for this high intelligibility: When the passband and
   transition bands were segregated using filter slopes of 1000 dB/octave,
   the isolated passband had an intelligibility score of only 24\%, while
   the pair of transition bands had a score of over 80\%. In the present
   study, experiment 1 examined the distribution of information along the
   transition bands' slopes by truncation at graded downpoints: Truncation
   at downpoints of 40 dB or more produced no significant change in
   intelligibility. Experiment 2 closed the gap separating the transition
   bands so that their slopes intersected at 1500 Hz. This triangular band
   had a negligible passband (as defined conventionally by 3-dB downpoints)
   and an intelligibility score of 60\%; truncation at downpoints of 50 dB
   or more produced no significant change in intelligibility. Experiment 3
   determined the intelligibilities of rectangular bands (1000-dB/octave
   slopes) centered on 1500 Hz. Their bandwidths ranged from 3 to 12
   semitones In 1-semitone steps, resulting in intelligibility scores
   increasing monotonically from 14\% to 94\%. Calculations based upon
   experiments 2 and 3 showed that the triangular band truncated at 30-dB
   downpoints had half the intelligibility of a rectangular band having the

   acid (ALA) was found to improve the salt tolerance of cotton seedlings.
   Cotton seedlings treated with ALA could grow in soil containing levels
   as high as 1.5\% (wt/wt) NaCl. The analyses of mineral compositions of
   plant parts revealed that the Na+ concentrations in the roots of the
   plants treated with ALA were suppressed to low concentrations. From
   these results, it can be presumed that the presence of ALA may cause a
   reduction of Na(p)lus uptake.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in deviation may occur following the correction of hyperopia in
   children with accommodative esotropia. We analyzed possible factors
   involving the development of changes in deviation. We examined 49
   children (23 boys and 26 girls) who had fully refractive accommodative
   esotropia at the age of 3 or 4 years. All children wore glasses to
   correct the fully cycloplegic refractive errors. At the age of 10 or 11
   years, 28 (57.1\%) of these children had good alignment, 12 (24.5\%)
   developed partial accommodative esotropia and 9 (18.4\%) developed
   consecutive exotropia. The age at onset of esotropia, age at initial
   visit, and refraction, deviation and presence of stereopsis, as
   determined by the Titmus test using a fly at the initial visit, were
   similar among the three groups. In the consecutive exotropia group,
   amblyopia at the initial visit was significantly higher (89\%) than that
   of the good alignment group (50\%). The age at the start of the
   correction, and the refraction, amblyopia and presence of fusion (10 or
   11 years) were almost equal among the three groups. We conclude that
   some children with fully refractive accommodative esotropia associated
   with amblyopia at the age of 3 or 4 years may be predisposed to
   developing consecutive exotropia. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG,

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We report that patterns of nonneutral DNA sequence evolution among
   published nuclear and mitochondrially encoded protein-coding loci differ
   significantly in animals. Whereas an apparent excess of amino acid
   polymorphism is seen in most (25/31) mitochondrial genes, this pattern
   is seen in fewer than half (15/36) of the nuclear data sets. This
   differentiation is even greater among data sets with significant
   departures from neutrality (14/15 vs. 1/6). Using forward simulations,
   we examined patterns of nonneutral evolution using parameters chosen to
   mimic the differences between mitochondrial and nuclear genetics (we
   varied recombination rate, population size, mutation rate, selective
   dominance, and intensity of germ line bottleneck). Patterns of evolution
   were correlated only with effective population size and strength of
   selection, and no single genetic factor explains the empirical contrast
   in patterns. We further report that in Arabidopsis thaliana, a highly
   self-fertilizing plant with effectively low recombination, five of six
   published nuclear data sets also exhibit an excess of amino acid
   polymorphism. We suggest that the contrast between nuclear and
   mitochondrial nonneutrality in animals stems from differences in rates
   of recombination in conjunction with a distribution of selective
   effects. If the majority of mutations segregating in populations are
   deleterious, high linkage may hinder the spread of the occasional
   beneficial mutation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{43}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: There are subgroups of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
   (SCC) that have a higher risk for both regional and distant metastasis.
   When cutaneous SCC does metastasize, it typically spreads first to local
   nodal groups. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) localization has been
   successfully used to evaluate nodal metastasis in breast carcinoma,
   melanoma, and other select tumors. It may also be useful in certain
   highrisk cutaneous SCCs. Currently, Mohs micrographic surgery is the
   treatment of choice for these tumors.
   Methods: A patient presented with a high-risk recurrent SCC on the
   forehead. The regional nodal groups were clinically negative and
   radiographically negative by computed tomographic scan. Sentinel
   lymphadenectomy was performed by moans of technetium 99m-radiolabeled
   sulfur colloid. The main tumor was resected with Mohs micrographic
   surgery.
   Results: A left preauricular SLN was localized by lymphoscintigraphy.
   The SLN was located intraoperatively by means of a gamma probe and
   excised. Subsequent pathologic evaluation of the SLN was negative for
   evidence of metastatic SCC by light microscopy with hematoxylin and
   eosin, and with immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratins AE1 and AE3.
   The day after SLN excision, the tumor was removed via Mohs micrographic
   surgery with clear surgical margins after a total of 8 stages.
   Aggressive subclinical spread by both subcutaneous ``skating{''} and
   perineural invasion was noted.
   Conclusion: The combination of Mohs micrographic surgery and sentinel
   lymphadenectomy is feasible and has theoretical utility in the
   management of a subset of cutaneous SCCs at high risk for metastasis.
   The ability of sentinel lymphadenectomy to identify regionally
   metastatic cutaneous SCC as well as the additive benefit of SLN and Mohs
   micrographic extirpation in the treatment of high-risk cutaneous SCC
   remain to be further clarified.}},

   above the average yield from C (2436 kg ha(-1)). Yields from DT2, DT3,
   and PT1 were virtually identical and averaged only 198 kg ha(-1) (56\%)
   less than the average yield from DT1, whereas yields from DT4 and DT5
   averaged 291 kg ha(-1) (9\%) and 613 kg ha(-1) (18\%) less. Net returns
   from DT1 (\$436 ha(-1)) averaged the highest, whereas returns from C
   (\$220 ha(-1)) were the lowest. Net returns from DT2 and DT3 were within
   5\% of the net returns from DT1, whereas net returns from the DT4, DT5,
   PT1, and MP treatments respectively averaged 9, 26, 9, and 31\% less
   than returns from DT1. Thus, fall deep tillage should be performed at
   least once every 3 yr to maximize and sustain higher yields and net
   returns from soybean grown on nonirrigated Tunica clay (clayey over
   loamy, smectitic, nonacid, thermic Vertic Haplaquept).}},

Abstract = {{As a simulation of the manufacturing of parabolic leaf springs a
   conventional heat treatment (CHT) and two variants of thermomechanical
   treatment (TMT) were applied on a group of CrV high strength steels,
   without and with Nb-microalloying. In a part of the steels the bulk
   concentration of phosphorus was increased above 0.02 \%. The aim of the
   study was to determine fatigue properties for various tempering
   temperatures theta (temp), especially of those steels contaminated with
   P. In a series of pretests the process parameters of CHT and TMT were
   optimized. After CHT a fatigue strength sigma (fat) of between 750 and
   825 MPa was established over a wide range of theta (temp) rather
   independent of P content. But for the highest strength values (R-m
   greater than or equal to 2100 MPa), produced at theta (temp) less than
   or equal to 280 degreesC, TMT performs the best fatigue properties
   (sigma (fat) = 900 MPa) superior to those after CHT. This study reveals
   that the advantageous effects of TMT can be reproduced even with
   impurity contaminated industrial grades.}},

Abstract = {{The view of pastures as a crop to be selected, sown, grown and harvested
   by grazing animals was common among scientists, government agency staff
   and livestock producers during the 1960s. Consequences of this view
   include the search for `magic bullet' pasture species and the
   indiscriminate introduction and widespread testing of introduced
   germplasm in Australia. A number of serious environmental weeds have
   resulted. Another consequence was the almost complete dependence on
   cultivation, sowing, fertiliser application and herbicides as the only
   means of manipulating species composition in pastures.
   The view that both the manager and the livestock are part of a complex
   grassland ecosystem has been gaining acceptance in recent years. The
   goals and perceptions of the manager as well as the activities of the
   livestock affect the functioning of this ecosystem in many ways. Further
   important consequences of this change in attitude have included the
   recognition of the power of grazing animals in manipulating the species
   composition of grasslands and a more sustainable approach to the
   management of grazing lands.}},

Abstract = {{Study objective-Determinants of leisure time physical activity (LTPA) in
   rural middle aged and older women of diverse racial and ethnic groups
   are not well understood. This study examined: (1) urban-rural
   differences in LTPA by sociodemographic factors, (2) urban-rural
   differences in LTPA determinants, and (3) the pattern of relations
   between LTPA determinants and LTPA.
   Design-A modified version of the sampling plan of the Behavioral Risk
   Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) was used. Zip codes were selected
   with 20\% or more of each of the following race/ethnic groups: African
   American, American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN), and Hispanic. A
   comparison group of white women were also surveyed using standard BRFSS
   techniques.
   Participants-Rural (n=1242) and urban (n=1096) women aged 40 years and
   older from the US Women's Determinants Study.
   Main results-Rural women, especially Southern and less educated women,
   were more sedentary than urban women. Rural women reported more personal
   barriers to LTPA, cited caregiving duties as their top barrier (compared
   with lack of time for urban women), and had greater body mass indices.
   Rural women were less likely to report sidewalks, streetlights, high
   crime, access to facilities, and frequently seeing others exercise in
   their neighbourhood. Multivariate correlates of sedentary behaviour in
   rural women were AI/AN and African American race, older age, less
   education, lack of enjoyable scenery, not frequently seeing others
   exercise, greater barriers, and less social support (p<0.05); and in
   urban women, older age, greater barriers, less social support (p<0.05),
   and less education (p<0.09).
   Conclusions-Rural and urban women seem to face different barriers and
   enablers to LTPA, and have a different pattern of determinants, thus
   providing useful information for designing more targeted interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Background The major emphasis on the safety of viral vectors for gene
   delivery has led to the generally accepted approach of disabling their
   ability to replicate and thus their potential capacity to spread
   throughout a tumor by consecutive rounds of infection and lysing
   neighboring cells.
   Methods In this study we evaluated three herpes simplex virus-1
   thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) carrying replication-competent adenoviral
   vectors with and without the Ad5 E1B 55-kDa gene, wild-type adenovirus
   type 5 (Ad5(wt)), and a prototypical replication-deficient adenovirus
   expressing HSV-tk (Ad. TK) for their cytoreductive effects in a
   peritoneal carcinomatosis model from human HT-29 colon cancer cells in
   nude mice.
   Results The survival of nude mice treated with the replication-defective
   adenoviral vector Ad.TK was enhanced when followed by GCV. In contrast,
   administration of GCV diminished the anti-tumor efficacy of the
   replication-competent HSV-tk expressing vectors. However, the intrinsic
   oncolytic effect of all replication-competent viruses was superior to
   that of Ad.TK+GCV. Furthermore, the oncolysis of the E1B 55-kDa-positive
   viruses was significantly greater than that of the E1B 55-kDa-deleted
   vector.
   Conclusions The more efficient diffusion of viral particles in the
   peritoneal cavity, when compared to the microenvironment of solid tumors
   and the virostatic effects of GCV, most likely antagonized the
   anticipated enhanced cytotoxicity of the replication-competent vectors
   from the use of its gene directed enzyme prodrug system. Nevertheless,
   in a clinical setting, the HSV-tk/GCV system allows efficient
   termination of viral replication in the case of a runaway infection. The
   results of this study warrant further evaluation of controllable viral
   replication as a treatment modality for cancer, especially in
   combination with conventional therapies (e.g. chemotherapy). Copyright

   nouns. Experiments 2 and 3, using ambiguous target words, indicated that
   except when a very infrequent sense of a word is required, titles
   provide a strong enough context to allow for ambiguous words to be

   increase in contrast sensitivity when higher order aberrations are
   corrected with an adaptive optics system. All these results suggest that
   many, though not all, observers with normal vision would receive
   worthwhile improvements in spatial vision from customized vision
   correction, at least over a range of viewing distances and particularly
   when the pupils are large. Keratoconic patients or patients suffering
   from spherical aberration as a result of laser refractive surgery as it

Abstract = {{The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) has recommended the
   introduction of dose-width product (DWP) for the measurement of patient
   dose in panoramic dental radiology and has proposed a reference level of
   65 mGy mm for adult exposures. This paper describes a method for
   measuring DWP and dose-area product (DAP) using thermoluminescent
   dosemeters (TLDs). The technique was used on 16 sets with a range of
   exposure settings. The mean value of DWP was 14\% higher than the mean
   value reported from a survey by the NRPB. This difference is most likely
   to be caused by systematic variations due to measurement method. The
   average DAP for a standard adult examination was shown to be 11.3 cGy
   cm(2). Data are presented so that the DAP can be derived from the
   exposure factors (tube current and operating potential) and beam area.
   Based on published data for effective dose, it is estimated that the DAP
   to effective dose conversion factor is approximately 0.06 mSv(Gy
   cm(2))(-1). The average DAP value (11.3 cGy cm(2)) can be compared with
   the average value for intraoral radiography (9.3 cGy cm(2)) based on the
   NRPB survey of entrance surface doses assuming 6 cm circular
   collimation.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A general formulation is developed for calculating the mean neutron flux
   in spatially random media. It is based upon Keller's first order
   smoothing approximation and starts from the integral form of the
   transport equation in which the number densities of the various nuclear
   species are considered as stationary random variables. The mean flux is
   shown to be described by a linear integral equation. In some special
   cases this has been solved. In particular for a purely absorbing medium
   we calculate the flux in the neighborhood of point, line and plane
   sources and demonstrate the importance of the degree of anisotropy in
   the correlation function, We also obtain an analytical expression for
   the collision probability in a spatially random medium and compare this
   with its deterministic analog.
   An explicit solution for the mean flux in an infinite medium is obtained
   in terms of a general source distribution using Fourier transforms.
   Using image pile theory we are able to calculate the effect of
   randomness on the critical size of a body. We can show that, for a
   fissile material, spatial randomness always increases the reactivity of
   the mixture.}},

Abstract = {{Di-(C-7-C-9 alkyl) phthalate (D79P) and di-(C-9-C-11 alkyl) phthalate
   (D911P), based on high-normality linear ore-alcohols, have been assessed
   for their impact upon reproductive performance in Sprague-Dawley rats.
   Rats were continuously exposed to either D79P or D911P at dietary levels
   of 0\%, 0.1\%, 0.5\%, or 1.0\% over two generations. Selected F-0
   offspring (F-1 generation) were exposed to the same dietary
   concentration of D79P or D911P as the respective F-0 animals, and were
   mated to produce F-1 offspring. Both D79P and D911P markedly reduced
   body weight gain in F-0 and F-1 adult males at the highest dose, but
   females were affected to a lesser extent. There was no impairment of
   fertility, fecundity, or development in either generation, but body
   weights of offspring in the 1.0\% D79P and 1.0\% D911P groups were
   slightly and transiently reduced over the weaning period. Although
   decreases in the weight of several organs were accounted for by
   depressed body weight, ovary weights were reduced in both generations
   exposed to 1.0\% D79P, and epididymidal weights were slightly reduced in
   adults of both generations exposed to 1.0\% D911P. However, ovarian
   function-assessed by the oestrus cycle and mating behaviour-and
   epididymidal sperm concentration, motility, and morphology were
   unaffected by either substance. Treatment resulted in liver changes,
   particularly in males, characterised by increased liver weight in young
   animals, histopathologic changes and reduced organ weight in mature
   animals, and an increase in palmitoyl CoA oxidase activity. In
   conclusion, neither D79P nor D911P impaired reproductive function in
   rats when administered in the diet at levels that induce systemic
   toxicity, and the NOAEL for effects on reproduction in the rat is 0.5\%
   for both D79P and D911P. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Aims: to investigate whether connective tissue laxity is associated with
   abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).
   Methods: a nested case control study in a population-based screening
   programme. The presence of pes planus, scoliosis, pectus deformities,
   flexible auricular cartilages and Gorling's sign were combined with the
   Beighton joint mobility score to form a connective tissue laxity score.
   The association between connective tissue laxity and the risk of AAA was
   investigated through a logistic regression model. Type III collagen
   turnover was assessed using a serum radio-immunoassay for type III
   procollagen (PIIINP).
   Results: data from 231 controls (aortic diameter <2.5cm) and 190 cases
   (AAA >2.9 cm) were analysed. Grids ratios (OX), adjusted for known
   confounders were 3.1 (95\% CI: 1.1-8.6)for the highest group of
   connective tissue scores and 2.4 (95\% CI: 1.0-5.4) for the middle
   group, compared with those with no signs of abnormal connective tissue
   function.
   There was no difference in mean collagen turnover between cases and
   controls, nor between those with a stable AAA >4 cm and those with an
   expanding AAA.
   Conclusion: connective tissue laxity is associated with a higher risk of
   having an AAA. The collagen turnover is similar in subjects with an AAA
   and controls. Aneurysms may be associated with abnormal connective
   tissue rather than an increased breakdown of normal collagen.}},

Abstract = {{In order to combine the effects of bone repair and eradication of
   infection, with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, the
   behaviour of a compound of bone graft and antibiotics was investigated.
   Samples of human and bovine bone, cancellous and cortical, were
   processed and incubated with vancomycin and tobramycin, respectively.
   The compound was placed in 5\% human albumin and the surrounding liquid
   was exchanged completely every 24 h. Concentrations of antibiotics in
   the fluid were measured over less than or equal to 28 days using high
   pressure liquid chromatography and a bioassay. All tested combinations
   eluted mainly in the initial phase with a logarithmic decrease over the
   testing period. The concentration of antibiotics in the albumin was well
   above the MIC for common pathogens throughout the investigation in all
   tested specimens. The highest initial concentrations were measured in
   the compound of bovine bone together with vancomycin (24395.8 +/- 1138.9
   mg/L), decreasing to 9.02 +/- 1.3 mg/L after 11 exchanges. Human and
   bovine bone did not have significantly different properties. The storage
   capability of cortical bone was generally lower than that of cancellous
   bone. Tobramycin concentrations were significantly lower in the initial
   phase; however, it eluted move steadily and over a longer period, so
   that from day 6 onwards, its concentration was greater than that of
   vancomycin. After 28 days, the tobramycin concentration was 18.09 +/-
   2.46 mg/L (bovine cancellous bone). In conclusion, bone, if processed
   adequately, is an excellent carrier for vancomycin and tobramycin.
   Cortical bone is as suitable as cancellous bone. The pharmacokinetics of
   human and bovine bone are comparable. Using an antibiotic-graft
   compound, eradication of pathogens and grafting of bony defects may be
   accomplished in a one-stage procedure.}},

   in goats experimentally immunosuppressed with dexamethasone. Eighteen
   goats in total were used. Blood samples were collected 24 h before
   immunomodulation and 5 and 10 days after immunomodulation. Animals in
   group I were immunostimulated with Baypamun(R) for 2 days and
   immunosuppressed with Dexafort for the next 2 days. Animals in group II
   received Dexafort first and then Baypamun(R). The number of leucocytes
   in total and in subpopulations was determined by flow cytometry.
   Application of Baypamun(R) before (group I) or after (group II)
   immunosuppression caused significant (P < 0.001) and lasting changes in
   the percentage of CD2+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Significant but transient
   changes were observed in CD19+ (B) and WC1-N2+ (null) cells. Results
   show that application of Baypamun(R) to modulate non-specific defence is
   advisable following immunosuppression (group I). When Baypamun was
   applied after immunosuppression (group II), although there was no
   reaction during the initial phase, an increase in the activity of cells
   responsible for non-specific immunity was noticeable after 10 days.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes and analyses the development of health promotion in
   Australia and New Zealand. It argues that health promotion has become an
   established approach to addressing public health problems in both
   nations over the past two decades. The paper documents the mixed
   progress both countries have made in improving the health of their
   populations and the challenges that remain for health promotion. The
   paper describes the health promotion infrastructure, investment in
   health promotion and collaboration that has occurred. It also describes
   innovations in structure and practice that have been implemented. The
   paper argues that while there has been considerable infrastructure
   development over the East decade there are still weaknesses in areas eg.
   workforce development and research and evaluation. While government has
   been the major investor in health promotion, investment has remained
   relatively small, in part because decision-makers have failed to be
   convinced of its value. Collaboration with the public, within the health
   sector and with other sectors has been a strength of health promotion
   activity in both nations. Overall, much has been learnt over the past
   two decades on which to build. Key features of health promotion include
   increasing use of intersectoral action, the use of public policy and the
   mass media as health promotion strategies, and the increasing control
   Maori have taken over the purchase and provision of health promotion
   services in New Zealand. Both countries still have significant
   weaknesses to address,e.g. increasing our focus on the determinants of
   health, implementing sustainable programs and appropriately engaging the
   personal health sector in health promotion. Above all, the next decade
   of development will require increasing emphasis on effective action to
   reduce inequalities in health, particularly between indigenous and
   non-indigenous people.}},

Abstract = {{Single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) by capillary
   electrophoresis was assessed as a screening and typing method for
   alleles of KIR2DL4. Exon 6 was investigated as this exon was reported to
   include three polymorphic nucleotides. Exon 6, intron 6 and exon 7 were
   amplified as a single polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product of 650 bp
   from genomic DNA. The PCR product was sequenced and analysed by SSCP.
   Exon 7 was found to be invariant. Only two nucleotides were found to be
   polymorphic in exon 6 and another three were found in intron 6. Strong
   linkage disequilibrium was found between the polymorphic nucleotides
   resulting in the presence of three alleles in a panel of 20 cell lines.
   Two alleles differed within intron 6 while the third allele differed at
   two nucleotides in exon 6. All six possible genotypes were
   distinguishable by SSCP providing information from both the forward and
   reverse primers was used. Exon 6 of one allele was one nucleotide
   shorter than that of the other alleles and the resulting frame shift is
   predicted to produce a truncated cytoplasmic tail due to a premature
   stop codon four codons into exon 7. SSCP was found to be an efficient
   method of typing exons 6 and 7 in a panel of 46 bone marrow donors. All
   three alleles were found to be common and one was in strong linkage
   disequilibrium with the presence of another KIR sequence KIR3DS1.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-Comparison of incidence and case-fatality rates
   for stroke in different countries may increase our understanding of the
   etiology of the disease, its natural history, and management. Within the
   context of an aging population and the trend for governments to set
   targets to reduce stroke risk and death from stroke, prospective
   comparison of such data across countries may identify what drives the
   variation in risk and outcome.
   Methods-Population-based stroke registers, using multiple sources of
   notification, ascertained cases of first in a lifetime stroke between
   1995 and 1997 for all age groups. The study populations were in
   Erlangen, Germany; Dijon, France; and London, UK. Crude incidence fates
   were age-standardized to the European population for comparative
   purposes. Case-fatality rates up to 1 year after the stroke were
   obtained, and logistic regression adjusting for age group, sex, and
   pathological subtype of stroke was used to compare survival in the 3
   communities.
   Results-A total of 2074 strokes were registered over the 3 years. The
   age-standardized rate to the European population was 100.4 (95\% CI 91.7
   to 109.1) per 100 000 in Dijon, 123.9 (95\% CI 115.6 to 132.2) in
   London, and 136.4 (95\% CI 124.9 to 147.9) in Erlangen. Both crude and
   adjusted rates were lowest in Dijon, France. The incidence rate ratio,
   with Dijon as the baseline comparison (1), was 1.21 (95\% CI 1.09 to
   1.34) in London and 1.37 (95\% CI 1.22 to 1.54) in Erlangen (P<0.0001).
   There were significant differences in the proportion of the subtypes of
   stroke between populations, with London having lower rates of cerebral
   infarction and higher rates of subarachnoid hemorrhage and unclassified
   stroke (P<0.001). Case-fatality rates varied significantly between
   centers at 1 year, after adjustment for age, sex, and subtype of stroke
   (35\% overall, 34\% Erlangen, 41\% London, and 27\% Dijon; P<0.001).
   Conclusions-The impact of stroke is considerable, and the risk of stroke
   varies significantly between populations in Europe as does the risk of
   death. The striking differences in survival require clarification but
   lend weight to the evidence that stroke management may differ between
   northern and central Europe and influence outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Patients with the omohyoid syndrome present with a transient
   lower neck swelling during swallowing. The mechanism of functional
   derangement has been hypothesized previously but never proven. Our aim
   is to show how this can be demonstrated real-time.
   Method and Patients: Five patients were studied. Serial photography,
   clinical videography, real-time ultrasonography, and simulated cine mode
   computed tomography were used. Findings were compared with the normal
   side. The literature was reviewed.
   Results: Very little literature experience is available. The swelling
   appears when the throat ascends and subsides with its descent in unison
   with omohyoid prominence. The sternomastoid is passively tented up by an
   abnormal underlying omohyoid. This latter appears to have lost its
   restriction to bowstring by the retaining deep cervical fascia.
   Conclusion: The described approach allowed for definite proof of the
   pathogenetic mechanism, provided a means of diagnosis, and suggested
   further insight into the management of these patients.}},

Abstract = {{The B6.Y-TIR mouse fails to develop normal testes despite transcription
   of Sry, the primary testis-determining gene on the Y chromosome.
   Consequently, B6.Y-TIR fetuses with bilateral ovaries develop into
   apparently normal but infertile females. This infertility can be mainly
   attributed to oocyte incompatibility for postfertilization development.
   In addition, abnormality in preovulatory follicles and rapid loss of
   oocytes have been observed in XY ovaries, This study examined the effect
   of gonadotropins on follicular development and atresia in B6.Y-TIR
   prepubertal females. The results show that untreated XY females had
   fewer late preantral follicles and their frequency of atresia was lower.
   No other difference was found when they were compared with XX females,
   After treatment with gonadotropins for 24 h, frequency of atresia
   decreased in both XX and XY ovaries, After 48 h, most preovulatory
   follicles in XY ovaries were nonatretic, but the oocytes often were
   denuded, Immunocytochemical staining for connexin 43 detected punctate
   foci along the oocyte plasma membrane, The density of these foci changed
   during follicular development, which was similar in XX and XY ovaries,
   in conclusion, follicular development and atresia under the control of
   gonadotropins is not influenced by defective oocytes until the
   preovulatory phase.}},

   Methods-A population-wide hospital discharge database in Singapore was
   used to identify all hospital admissions with a primary discharge
   diagnosis of PACG (International Classification of Disease-CM code:
   365.2). The Singapore census was used for denominator data.
   Results-Between 1993 and 1997 there were 894 hospital admissions for
   PACG. The mean annual rate of PACG admissions was 11.1 per 100 000 (95\%
   confidence interval (CI), 10.4, 11.8) among people aged 30 years and
   over. The annual rate was highest for Chinese (age and sex adjusted
   rate: 12.2 per 100 000), which was twice that of Malays (6.0 per 100

Abstract = {{The results of wind tunnel tests carried out on two semispan models,
   with sweep angles of 40 and GO deg, are presented. The planforms of the
   models have features consistent with likely configurations of future
   low-observable aircraft. An examination of pressure fluctuations over
   such aircraft is of particular importance because of the difficulties
   involved in altering such aircraft late in their design to address
   problems of excessive buffeting. The dynamic calibration of surface
   pressure tappings has allowed both mean and unsteady pressures to be
   measured. Unsteady pressure readings have been analyzed to derive both
   root-mean-square pressures and spectral information. Peaks in the
   spanwise root-mean-square pressure distribution are found inboard of the
   leading edge vortex for each wing. Two additional peaks are present over
   the more highly swept wing. One of these peaks is coincident with the
   secondary separation; another is found outboard of the leading edge
   vortex.}},

   k. In general, this kind of labelling is called the S(d, 1)-labelling.
   The sigma (d)-number of G, sigma (d)(G), is the minimum k of a k-S(d,
   1)-labelling of G. If the labelling is required to be injective, then we
   have analogous k-S'(d, 1)-labelling, S' (d, 1.)labelling and sigma
   (d)'(G). If the circular difference in the definition above is replaced
   by the absolute difference, then f is an L(d, 1)-labelling of G. The
   span of an L(d, 1)-labelling is the difference of the maximum and the
   minimum labels used. The lambda (d)-number of G, lambda (d)(G), is
   defined as the minimum span among all L(d, 1)labellings of G. In this
   case, we have the corresponding L'(d, 1)-labelling and lambda (d)'(G)
   for the labelling with injective condition.
   We will first study the relation between lambda (d) and sigma (d) as
   well lambda (d)' and sigma (d)'. Then we consider these parameters on
   cycles and trees. Finally we study the join of graphs and the

Abstract = {{Genetic immunization is a method for vaccination and laboratory antibody
   production where antigen-expressing plasmids are introduced into animals
   to elicit immune responses. Although genetic immunization works well for
   many antigens, problems can arise with protein sequences that (i) are
   toxic to host cells, (ii) are difficult to translate by mammalian cells,
   or (iii) evade immune presentation. We demonstrate here the ability to
   increase protein production and antigen secretion by the simple method
   of fusing poorly expressed sequences to well-expressed heterologous
   proteins. Proof-of-principle is demonstrated here using the poorly
   translated HIV-1 envelope whose protein production is rescued by fusing
   this antigen to the carboxy-termini of two well-expressed proteins: the
   cytoplasmic green fluorescent protein and the secreted human protein
   al-antitrypsin. This approach represents a simple and substantially less
   expensive method to increase protein and antigen production than
   codon-optimization strategies. It may therefore be more useful than
   whole gene codon replacement to enable inexpensive laboratory antibody
   production of poorly expressed antigens and for large-scale genomic
   protein or antigen screening efforts. Finally, we demonstrate a second
   benefit of this antigen fusion strategy in which the test antigen is
   ``sandwiched{''} between two positive control antigens. By this
   approach, we demonstrate the intrinsic lack of immunogenicity of HIV-1
   envelope under conditions when robust antibody responses are generated
   against its fusion protein partners, but not against this evasive
   antigen. These fusion protein vectors therefore represent a simple
   approach to not only increase antigen production, but also assess
   antigen production and immunogenicity in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{The track foundation is preloaded by multiple wheel loads due to the
   train weight and, as the pad and ballast are nonlinear, their stiffness
   depends upon the preload in them. Due to the influence of these
   resilient components of the track, the track vibration is affected by
   the wheel loads. It is also affected by the wheel/rail interactions. In
   this article the preloads in the pad and ballast are calculated by
   considering the nonlinear properties of the track foundation, and thus
   the preloaded pad and ballast stiffnesses are determined. The vibration
   properties are explored for the track under multiple wheel loads and
   multiple wheel/rail interactions by comparing the results from different
   track models with and without these effects. It is found that the point
   receptance of the track is reduced and the vibration decay rate is
   enhanced at low frequencies due to the wheel loads. The effects of the
   wheel/rail interactions are most significant for frequencies 400-2000
   Hz. Because of the wheel/rail interactions, the point receptance
   fluctuates and the vibration decay is enhanced in the regions around the
   wheels. (C) 2000 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract = {{Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is an important mediator of hepatocyte
   proliferation after hepatectomy. However, elevated IL-6 levels are found
   in patients with chronic liver disease. Therefore, it is unclear if
   hyperstimulation with IL-6 may have an influence on liver regeneration.
   We investigated whether a strong activation of IL-6-dependent pathways
   may change the course of hepatocyte proliferation after hepatectomy.
   Transgenic mice overexpressing the human soluble IL-6 receptor/gp80
   (hsgp80) in hepatocytes were stimulated with or without hepatectomy with
   human IL-6 (hIL-6). Nuclear extracts were prepared and activation of
   gp130-dependent pathways was studied by Western blot and gel shift
   experiments. Cell cycle progression of hepatocytes alter hepatectomy was
   investigated by monitoring cell cycle-specific factors. hIL-6 strongly
   activates Stat3 for more than 48 hours in human soluble hsgp80
   transgenic mice. In contrast, no major differences were evident in the
   regulation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway compared with wild-type (wt)
   mice. Also when hsgp80 mice were stimulated with hIL-6 3 hours before
   hepatectomy Stat3 is activated for more than 72 hours, whereas in
   unstimulated mice this event is restricted to the early hours. Strong
   activation of Stat3 resulted in a delay and inhibition of hepatocyte
   proliferation as measured by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) staining and
   Cyclin A and E expression. This observation directly correlates with the
   induction of the cell cycle inhibitor p21. In summary, strong
   IL-6-dependent activation of Stat3 before hepatectomy results in delay
   and inhibition of cell cycle progression after hepatectomy. Therefore
   our results suggest that hyperstimulation with IL-6 can inhibit liver
   regeneration.}},

   Specimens from the Atlantic (n = 102) and Gulf of Mexico (n = 22) coasts
   of the United States were examined. Ctenogobius boleosoma and C.
   shufeldti (formerly assigned to Gobionellus) have been placed in
   Ctenogobius by Pezold (1984). The present study describes larvae of C.
   boleosoma and G. oceanicus that are more developed than larvae in the
   same size range described in previous studies. Presence of a vertical
   internal streak of melanin in the caudal peduncle, between lateral and
   veneral midlines, distinguishes transformation larvae of C. boleosoma
   from those of G. oceanicus. Transforming C. boleosoma have greater
   relative head length, eye diameter, body depth, and least depth of
   caudal peduncle than G. oceanicus. Pectoral and pelvic fins of
   transforming C. boleosoma extend beyond a vertical through the anterior
   margin of the gas bladder, but they do not reach this vertical in G.
   oceanicus. Presence of an internal V-shaped spot on the nape
   distinguishes late transformation larvae and juveniles of C. boleosoma
   from those of G. oceanicus and C. shufeldti. Juvenile C. boleosoma and
   C. shufeldti have greater relative eye diameter, body depth, and least
   depth of caudal peduncle than G. oceanicus. A provisional key is
   presented to distinguish among early stages of these species of
   Ctenogobius and Gobionellus, and Evorthodus lyricus;, a sympatric goby
   with six spines. Moderate variation in morphometric characters was
   noted, but it was difficult to identify causes. Factors considered were
   geographic area, preservative, and variation in size at transformation.
   Occurrence of early stages and adults in the same intertidal habitats
   was noted for C. boleosoma and C. shufeldti. Based on occurrence of
   transformation larvae, C. boleosoma spawns during summer and fall along
   the Atlantic coast. Ctenogobius shufeldti has a more narrow range of
   temperature tolerance than C. boleosoma.}},

Abstract = {{In vitro studies were conducted to identify the hepatic enzyme(s)
   responsible for the oxidative metabolism of linezolid. In human liver
   microsomes, linezolid was oxidized to a single metabolite,
   hydroxylinezolid (M1). Formation of M1 was determined to be dependent
   upon microsomal protein and NADPH. Over a concentration range of 2 to
   700 mu M, the rate of M1 formation conformed to first-order
   (nonsaturable) kinetics. Application of conventional in vitro techniques
   were unable to identify the molecular origin of M1 based on the
   following experiments: a) inhibitor/substrates for various cytochrome
   P-450 (CYP) enzymes were unable to inhibit M1 formation; b) formation of
   M1 did not correlate (r(2) < 0.23) with any of the measured catalytic
   activities across a population of human livers (n = 14); c) M1 formation
   was not detectable in incubations using microsomes prepared from a
   baculovirus insect cell line expressing CYPs 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8,
   2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, 3A5, and 4A11. In addition, results obtained
   from an in vitro P-450 inhibition screen revealed that linezolid was
   devoid of any inhibitory activity toward the following CYP enzymes
   (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4). Additional in
   vitro studies excluded the possibility of flavin-containing
   monooxygenase and monoamine oxidase as potential enzymes responsible for
   metabolite formation. However, metabolite formation was found to be
   optimal under basic (pH 9.0) conditions, which suggests the potential
   involvement of either an uncharacterized P-450 enzyme or an alternative
   microsomal mediated oxidative pathway.}},

   script segmentation. First, connected components consisting of more than
   one character are split into sub-components based on their face-up or
   face-down background regions. Secondly, the over-segmented
   sub-components are merged into characters according to the knowledge of
   character structures and their joining characteristics. The algorithm
   achieved around 80\% correct segmentation on a difficult database of
   unconstrained handwritten words. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Title = {{Limited multiple-writer: An approach to dealing with false sharing in

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{453-460}},

Abstract = {{False sharing is one of the most important factors impacting the
   performance of DSM (distributed shared memory) systems. The
   single-writer approach is simple, but it cannot avoid the ping-pong
   effect of the data page thrashing, while the multiple-writer approach is
   effective for false sharing but with high cost. This paper proposes a
   new approach, called limited multiple-writer (LMW) to handling multiple
   writers in software DSM. It distinguishes two kinds of multiple-writer
   as lock-based form and barrier-based form, and handles them with
   different policies. It discards the Twin and Diff in traditional
   multiple-writer approach, and simplifies the implementation of
   multiple-writer in software DSM systems. The implementation of LMW in a
   CVM (Coherent Virtual Machine) software DSM system, which is based on a
   network of workstations, is introduced. Evaluation results show that for
   some applications such as SOR (Successive Over-Relaxation), LU (Lower
   triangular and Upper triangular), FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation), and
   IS (Integer Sorting), LMW provides a significant reduction in execution
   time (11\%, 16\%, 33\% and 46\%) compared with the traditional
   multiple-writer approach on the platform.}},

Abstract = {{To obtain a kind of functionally graded material (FGM) with a density
   gradient, the W-Mo-Ti-TiAl-Al system graded material was designed, and
   the powder metallurgy method was chosen for its fabrication. The
   sintering of W, W-Mo, and Mo-Ti alloys at low temperature was studied,
   and then the approximately wholly dense W-Mo-Ti-TiAl system FGM was
   achieved by one-step sintering at 1473 K for 1 hour under a pressure of
   30 MPa. It was found that through sintering at 1473 K, mainly the
   mechanical mixtures of W and Mo were formed in W-Mo alloys. In Mo-Ti
   alloys, the newly designed Fe-Al sintering aids not only have an
   important effect on the densification of the alloys, but also contribute
   to the formation of the (Mo, Ti) solid solution. However, the
   solid-solution reaction that occurred in Mo-Ti alloys was still
   insufficient. During the sintering of Ti + TiAl, the chemical reaction
   of Ti + TiAl - -> AlTi2 was induced within the sintered body. The
   W-Mo-Ti-TiAl-Al system FGM was finally fabricated by joining of the TiAl
   side of the sintered W-Mo-Ti-TiAl system FGM to metal Al with an
   Al-based brazing filler metal, and its density changed
   quasi-continuously within the large range from 17.15 to 2.70 g/cm(3).}},

Abstract = {{The nature of phase mixing in semi-interpenetrating polymer networks
   (SIPNs) of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC)/thermoset blends was studied by
   using both the glass transition temperature third power composition
   equation and DMTA modeling. From 5\% to 15\% by weight of an oligomeric
   MDI isocyanate or a low viscosity epoxy were blended separately with WC
   to make two series of SIPNs. The DMTA-derived T-g data were modeled by
   the T-g third power composition equation to characterize ``energy
   interaction{''} features of PVC/thermoset phase mixing. Fitting
   experimental T-g Values gave estimations of the characteristic
   parameters, K-1 and K-2 of the T-g power equation. K-1 and K-2 were each
   positive for the PVC/epoxy (K-1 = 1.1, K-2 = 7.2) and the PVC/isocyanate
   (K-1 = 29.9, K-2 = 38) blends, showing that binary hetero-interactions
   (enthalpic effects) and conformational redistributions (entropic
   effects) during the binary hetero-interactions both contributed
   favorably to phase mixing. Negative K-1 - K-2 values for both groups of
   blends indicate entropic contributions predominate. The thermoset
   dilution produced a lightly crosslinked thermoset network, which was
   locked into the amorphous WC, forming a mixed thermoset/PVC SIPN domain.
   Conformational redistributions of WC and thermoset segments continue to
   occur within the developing SIPN domain before phase separation can
   occur. The combined series-parallel Takayanagi coupling model, which
   assumed that a WC phase and a mixed PVC/thermoset SIPN phase coexisted,
   was employed to describe the viscoelastic behavior of PVC/thermoset
   blends, Reasonable fits between the experimental DMTA plots and modeling
   predictions were found. The predictions were not sensitive to the degree
   of series-parallel coupling. The modeled DMTA plots, like the
   experimental results, exhibited only a single E `` peak in the glass
   transition temperature range for both the PVC/PAPI and PVC/epoxy
   systems. Thus, very small PVC/thermoset SIPN domains (< 20 nm diameter)
   that are dispersed in separate domains of a WC-rich phase (despersive
   phase mixing characteristics) provide a reasonable explanation of the
   blends' phase structures.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines how family history affects the odds of private

   women, being single or divorced was associated with higher odds of
   pension receipt, and having children decreased their odds. After
   reanalyzing the effects of family history in the context of couples'
   joint pension receipt, the negative association between pension receipt
   and children becomes insignificant for women, and being single,

Abstract = {{A direct method for a real-time generation of near-optimal spatial

   three cues: high-order polynomials from the virtual are as a reference
   function for aircraft's coordinates, a preset history of one of the
   controls (thrust), and a few optimization parameters. The trajectory
   optimization problem is transformed into a nonlinear programming problem
   and then solved numerically using an appropriate algorithm in
   accelerated scale of time. A series of examples Is presented. Calculated
   near-optimal trajectory is compared with real Right data, and with the

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of conjugated
   linoleic acid on lipid accumulation in adipose tissue. Sprague-Dawley
   rats were fed a diet containing 2\% conjugated linoleic acid for 1, 3,
   6, and 12 weeks. In rats fed 2\% conjugated linoleic acid, the weight of
   perirenal white adipose tissue was comparable with that of rats fed a
   conjugated linoleic acid-free diet. For fatty acid composition of
   perirenal white adipose tissue, both 16:1/16:0 and 18:1/18:0 ratios were
   significantly lower in the conjugated linoleic acid-fed group than the
   control group. Although there was no remarkable difference in serum
   triglyceride, total cholesterol, and phospholipid levels between dietary
   groups, serum leptin level was significantly lower than the control
   group, and lipid content in the perirenal white adipose tissue exerted a
   tendency toward low compared to the control value at 1-week feeding. On
   the other hand, leptin level in perirenal white adipose tissue was
   significantly lower in the conjugated linoleic acid-fed group than the
   control group at 12-week feeding. In conclusion, these observations
   suggest dietary conjugated linoleic acid is an acute reducer of serum
   leptin level. This may afford an explanation of the mechanism of
   anti-obesity effect in conjugated linoleic acid. (J. Nutr. Biochem.

Abstract = {{Previous studies and animal evidence have suggested a relationship
   between parental tobacco or alcohol use and the risk of some childhood
   canters, including neuroblastoma. A case-control study was conducted to
   investigate the relationship between parental tobacco smoking, alcohol
   consumption, and risk of neuroblastoma. Cases were children diagnosed
   with neuroblastoma over the period 1992-1994 at Children's Cancer Group
   and Pediatric Oncology Group institutions throughout the United States
   and Canada. One matched control was selected using random-digit dialing.
   Information on parental smoking and drinking history was obtained from
   504 case and 504 control parents by telephone interview. Overall, there
   was no consistent pattern of association with parental smoking and
   alcohol consumption, For example, both maternal smoking and drinking
   during the period from 1 month before pregnancy through breastfeeding
   had adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.1 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI),
   0.8-1.4], There was no association with paternal smoking (OR, 1.2; 95\%
   CI, 0.8-1.6) or paternal drinking 1 month before conception (OR, 1.0;
   95\% CI, 0.7-1.4), There was no consistent increase in risk by the
   amount of smoking or drinking during any time period relative to
   pregnancy. There was no suggestion of an increased risk when only one
   parent smoked. Smoking or drinking among both parents did not jointly
   increase the risk of neuroblastoma in their offspring. The child's age
   at diagnosis, stage, or MYCN oncogene amplification status did not
   materially alter the OR estimates. it is concluded that the results from
   this study do not indicate any evidence for a relationship between
   neuroblastoma and parental tobacco or alcohol use.}},

Abstract = {{Optical damage of multi-layer mirrors used in an ultraviolet free
   electron laser (UV-FEL) resonator at linac-based FEL has been observed.
   The peak power of the UV-FEL at the linac-based FEL is about 100 times
   as large as that of the ring-based FELs. The mirror degradation
   mechanism in the linac-based FEL therefore is entirely different from
   that of the ring-based FEL which has been reported. Several 0.2 mm
   diameter craters have been found on both surfaces of upstream and
   downstream Ta2O5/SiO2 multi-layer mirrors of the resonator after 50 h
   UV-FEL oscillation at 310-370 nm. At each crater, several layers near
   the surface are crushed by ablation induced by the FEL. Results from
   both the X-ray micro-analysis (XMA) on the craters and luminescence
   analysis during ablation induced with the pico-second pulsed Nd:YLF
   laser, which is the same pulse format as the FEL, explain that the
   pico-second pulses of the laser affect the damages. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Non-small-cell carcinomas of the lung, especially adenocarcinomas, are
   characterized by a high degree of morphological heterogeneity, As
   carcinogenesis has been suggested to be a multistep process involving
   sequential accumulation of multiple genetic alterations, morphological
   heterogeneity may represent a cross-sectional view of genetic
   alterations within individual tumors. We therefore examined the
   topographical distribution of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events within
   10 non-small-cell lung cancers to investigate whether, and which,
   genetic alterations are accumulated in relation to morphological
   progression. LOH at the TP53, 17p13.3, and 3p loci was detected in six,
   eight, and six of 10 informative cases, respectively. In each case, all
   portions of the tumor shared concordant LOH despite morphological
   diversity. In contrast, distributions of LOH at 2q, 9p, and 22q, which
   have been reported to be associated with the advanced stages of tumors,
   were divergent in two of three, four of eight, and one of one cases with
   LOH, respectively. In these cases, presence of LOH was mostly related to
   the morphological tumor grades. These findings suggest the accumulative
   feature of genetic alterations in particular loci that can be seen even
   in individual tumors. Furthermore, the present study indicated that
   cross-sectional examination of individual tumors is also important for
   better understanding of molecular pathogenesis of lung cancers.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Postmortem and brain imaging studies that measured brain
   serotinin(2) (5-HT2) receptors in major depression reported an increase,
   decrease, and no change compared with controls. In this study, we
   assessed brain 5-HT2 receptors in 20 depressed patients (mean+/-SD age,
   40.1+/-9.5 years; range, 22-60 years) and 20 healthy controls similar in
   age (37.2+/-12.6 years, range, 19-59 years) using positron emission
   tomography and setoperone labeled with fluorine 18 ({[}F-18]setoperone).
   Methods: Patients with DSM-IV major depression and healthy controls
   underwent scanning with {[}F-18]setoperone. All study subjects were drug
   free for at least 2 weeks. The 5-HT2 binding images were created using
   region-to-cerebellum ratios. The differences in 5-HT2, receptor binding
   potential between the two groups were determined with statistical
   parametric mapping software and region of interest analysis.
   Results: There was a significant negative correlation between 5-HT2
   receptor binding potential and age in both patients and controls, and
   the magnitude of this correlation was similar in both groups, both
   statistical parametric mapping and region of interest analyses showed
   that, compared with healthy controls, depressed patients had
   significantly lower 5-HT2 receptor binding potential in frontal,
   temporal, parietal, and occipital cortical regions. Statistical
   parametric mapping analysis showed that the mean decrease in 5-HT2
   receptor binding potential for the entire cluster in these regions was
   22\%, and it ranged from 22\% to 27\% for local maxima within the
   clusters of significant voxels.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that brain 5-HT2 receptors are decreased
   in patients with major depression.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure measurements in flows of highly viscous and elastic fluids are
   of practical importance in polymer processing and rheology systems.
   Special problems arise during such pressure measurements. High fluid
   viscosity results in excessive dynamic response time (rise time) of the
   pressure measuring systems. This is true for systems that consist of
   manometers as well as pressure transducers attached to the base of a
   small hole at the wall. We model the dynamic response and examine
   related disturbing effects. These systematic errors in pressure
   measurements include hole-pressure effects, instabilities in cavity
   flow, and the time lag of the disturbance wave. We consider static and
   dynamic flow systems of a polymer solution (PIB/C14/PB Boger fluid) to
   study these problems and show that instantaneous pressure measurements
   in these systems can effectively be performed.

Abstract = {{Objective. To observe the suitability of different combinations of
   readily available tests to predict recovery from a neurosensory deficit
   after bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO).
   Study design. Thirty patients scheduled for BSSO were examined before
   surgery and 4 days, 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after
   surgery. At each follow-up, the patients self-evaluated the subjective
   neurosensory deficit of the lower lip and chin of both sides.
   Neurosensory function was also measured by tests consisting of light
   touch, 2-point discrimination, pin tactile discrimination, thermal
   discrimination, and sensibility testing of the mandibular molars. The
   positive predictive values (PPV) of each test for recovery from the
   neurosensory deficit were calculated, Furthermore, different tests were
   combined, and the PPVs for recovery from the neurosensory deficit of
   these combinations were analyzed.
   Results. A positive response to sensibility testing of the mandibular
   first and second molars 4 days and 3 weeks after surgery was related to
   a PPV of 100\% and 87\%, respectively, for full recovery from sensation
   loss at 1 year. However, none of the tests alone could reliably predict:
   recovery from the neurosensory deficit after BSSO. When 3 different
   tests were combined, the best results were achieved by the combinations
   of a light test or a 2-point discrimination test and a pin tactile test
   with the sensibility testing of mandibular molars.
   Conclusions. Sensibility testing of mandibular molars can be used to
   predict recovery from the neurosensory deficit after BSSO. The best
   positive predictive ability can be achieved by combining a
   mechanoceptive test, a nociceptive test, and sensibility testing of
   mandibular molars.}},

Abstract = {{Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and indirect fluorescent antibody
   technique (IFAT) were developed for the detection of Kudoa amamiensis
   (Multivalvulida: Myxozoa), which produces pseudocysts in the skeletal
   musculature of yellowtail Seriola quinqueradiata. A nested PCR derived
   from the 18SrDNA sequences of K. amamiensis proved to be highly specific
   and sensitive, detecting a single spore in a 20 mu L reaction mixture.
   In a periodic monitoring of yellowtail, the single-round and nested PCRs
   were conducted as well as conventional diagnostic techniques (visual
   inspection, wet-mount observation and histological examination). After
   one month culture of yellowtail in an endemic area, neither pseudocysts
   nor spores could be detected visually, whereas 53\% of the examined fish
   were positive for infection by the nested PCR. After 3 and 5 months,
   macroscopic pseudocysts were detected in 27\% and 60\% of the fish,
   respectively, while the nested PCR was more sensitive (93\% and 70\%
   were positive, respectively). Histologically, intracellular organisms
   with several internal cells were detected only in the muscle fibers of
   the samples which were positive by PCR tests. By the IFAT using a rabbit
   antiserum to sonicated K. amamiensis spores, both pre-spore and spore
   stages reacted, and intracellular plasmodia were positively identified
   as presporogonic stages of K amamiensis. In conclusion, we developed the
   IFAT and the nested PCR for the early diagnosis of K. amamiensis, and
   described for the first time its intracellular presporogonic stage in
   the muscle fiber of yellowtail.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To investigate the effects of inhibitors of chloride channels
   on lens volume and tissue architecture under isotonic conditions.
   METHODS. Rat lenses were maintained in organ culture under isotonic
   conditions in the presence of various putative chloride channel
   inhibitors. The effect of an inhibitor on lens wet mass and tissue
   morphology was determined by weighing and histologic examination,
   respectively.
   RESULTS. Exposure to 100 mu M of either 5-nitro-2- (3-phenylpropylamino)
   benzoic acid (NPPB) or 4,4 `-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic
   acid (DIDS) caused an increase in wet mass and severe tissue disruption
   in the lens equatorial region. Two distinctly different zones of tissue
   damage were evident: a peripheral zone of fiber cell swelling and an
   inner zone of extensive tissue breakdown. Extracellular space dilations
   caused the extensive tissue damage in the inner zone and preceded the
   peripheral fiber cell swellings. That the observed effects were a
   consequence of the inhibition of chloride channels was supported by (1)
   the effectiveness of NPPB at the lower dose of 10 mu M, (2) the absence
   of any NPPB effect in chloride-free medium, and (3) an identical effect
   after exposure to tamoxifen, an inhibitor of the chloride channel
   regulator p-glycoprotein.
   CONCLUSIONS. Study results indicate that chloride channels are active in
   the lens under isotonic conditions. The spatial and temporal pattern of
   morphologic changes that was observed is consistent with a steady state
   efflux of chloride ions and water from peripheral fiber cells and a
   corresponding influx into fiber cells deeper in the lens. These
   observations may therefore represent the first visualization of the
   chloride flux postulated by others to be a component of the lens
   internal circulation system.}},

Abstract = {{To explore the site and mechanism of the analgesic action of melatonin,
   the present study was designed to evaluate the analgesic effects of
   intraperitoneal (i.p.) and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)
   administration of melatonin, and to investigate the effect of i.c.v.
   naloxone on the analgesic effect induced by i.p. melatonin in rats.
   Antinociception was determined by tail-flick latency to hot water at 50
   degrees C. On i.p. administration, melatonin (30, 60 and 120 mg/kg)
   produced the antinociceptive effect in a dose-dependent manner, with an
   A(50) of 72.8 mg/kg. Administered i.c.v., melatonin (0.25, 0.5 and 1
   mg/kg) also resulted in dose-dependent antinociception, with an A(50) of
   only 0.693 mg/kg. Injected i.c.v, to rats, 10 mu g of naloxone
   antagonized significantly the antinociceptive effect induced by i.p.
   melatonin. It is concluded that melatonin has an analgesic effect in
   rats and the central nervous system (CNS) may be the primary site for
   melatonin to elicit the response, and the effect of melatonin is related
   to the central opioid system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Objectives of this study were (i) to incorporate short-chain fatty acids
   (SCFA) in vegetable oils to obtain a bland product that could be used as
   a milk fat substitute in cheese making and (ii) to improve the methods
   for fatty acid analysis of vegetable oils modified with SCFA.
   Short-chain triglycerides (SCTG) were synthesized by esterifying SCFA
   with glycerol, and using a toluene azeotrope to remove the water of
   esterification. SCFA from two sources were used: (i) commercial acids
   and (ii) acids isolated by double distillation of milk fat methyl
   esters. The SCTC had a bitter, unacceptable flavor, but after
   interesterification with high-oleic sunflower oil (HOSO) and
   deodorization, the flavor was quite acceptable. SCTG were incorporated
   into HOSO at 100 and 120\% of the levels found in the milk fat, by
   sodium methoxide-catalyzed interesterification. For fatty acid analysis,
   milk fat and simulated milk fat were converted to their decyl ester
   derivatives and analyzed by gas chromatography without further
   purification. The method was accurate and rapid for fatty acid analysis
   of fats containing a wide range of fatty acid chain lengths. All
   modified HOSO gave bland and acceptable flavors and had a SCFA
   composition close to that of milk fat. Results from using the modified
   HOSO in cheese making are reported in a later paper.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we have applied a perturbative expanding method to the
   hopping model, and studied the cross-talk between two pieces of phase
   gratings stored in one point of photorefractive material by angle
   multiplexing. The coupling equations and their steady solution have been
   derived. It has been found that the fundamental harmonic of the first
   grating is coupled with the second-order harmonic of the second grating
   and the second-order harmonic of the first gating is coupled with the
   fundamental harmonic of the second grating. The positions of maximums of
   the plots about the normalised fundamental and second-order harmonics of
   the space-charge field vs. the normalised grating vector (k/k(0)) are at
   k/k(0) = 1.414 and k/k(0) = 1.01 for Deltak/k(0) = 0, respectively,
   which are at k/k(0) = 1 and k/k(0) = 1/root2 for the case of storing
   single grating in one point. This kind of deviation has been confirmed
   by our two-wave coupling experiment with Ce:KNSBN crystal At the same
   time, we have found the degree of deviation of the second-order harmonic
   of the space-charge field strongly depends on the difference of
   normalised grating vector (k/k(0))between the two pieces of gratings,
   but that of fundamental harmonic weakly depends on it. In addition, it
   has been found that the degrees of deviation of both harmonics do not
   depend on the modulation depth. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{During slug flow, knowledge of the slug frequency is essential for the
   gas-liquid receiving facility design as well as for predicting various
   slug flow characteristics such as slug length and pressure drop. Various
   methods proposed in the Literature for predicting the slugging frequency
   in horizontal and inclined pipes were examined. These included both
   empirical correlations as well as mechanistic models. Slug flow
   frequency data taken with an air-water system in a laboratory flow loop
   together with data from the published literature were compared to the
   predictions of the various methods. A total of 399 data points were
   collected covering pipe diameters from 1 to 8 in. and inclinations from
   0 to 11 degrees above the horizontal. A total of eight published methods
   were compared to the data but none was found satisfactory. For this
   reason, the mechanistic slug frequency model of Taitel and Dukler(1) was
   investigated in detail as an alternative unbiased prediction method.
   This model required the solution of the unsteady-state equations for
   mass and momentum by a finite difference technique. This numerical model
   gave satisfactory results at the expense of considerable computer CPU
   time. For faster slug frequency calculations a new correlation was
   developed utilizing all 399 data points. This resulted in 0\% average
   error (bias) and 60\% average absolute error. This correlation
   represents a significant improvement in slug frequency prediction
   accuracy over the other methods studied.}},

Abstract = {{High-dose GH therapy, with GH doses 10-20 times the normal replacement
   dose for GH-deficient adults, has been used as an anti-catabolic agent
   in a number of different patient groups. A recent study, however, has
   shown an increase in mortality in critically ill patients treated with
   high-dose GH. The increased mortality was associated with multiorgan
   failure, septic shock, and uncontrolled infection, suggesting that GH
   may have altered the immune response. The GH receptor and GH are both
   expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); thus, GH could
   act as either an endocrine or an autocrine modulator of the immune
   response. We have examined the hypothesis that high-dose GH therapy may
   induce proinflammatory cytokines, which are implicated in septic shock.
   To do this we measured cytokine production by PBMCs incubated in
   conditions that simulated high-dose GH therapy, and we measured cytokine
   levels in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy who were
   randomized to receive either high-dose GH therapy (13 IU/m(2) day) or
   placebo.
   To confirm the biological activity of GH in our cell culture system we
   used a Stat5 functional assay. In this assay GH induced a bell-shaped
   curve, with a maximal response at GH levels between 100-1000 ng/mL.
   PBMCs from healthy volunteers were incubated with GH in doses from
   1-1000 ng/mL for 6-72 h under resting conditions and after activation
   with endotoxin and the mixed lymphocyte reaction. Studies were repeated
   with PBMCs from six individuals using a GH dose of 100 ng/mL (the level
   of GH found after high-dose GH therapy) and an endotoxin dose that gave
   a submaximal response (0.01 ng/mL). GH had no effect on cell
   proliferation or the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha
   (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), or interferon-gamma (IFN gamma). In
   patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy there was a
   time-related effect of surgery on cytokine levels. There was a rise in
   IL-6 and a fall in TNF alpha at 24 h after surgery; however, high-dose
   GH therapy had no effect on the cytokine response. We considered the
   possibility that endogenous GH production by PBMCs could influence the
   cytokine response in activated PBMCs; however, incubation of PBMCs in
   the presence of the GH receptor antagonist, B2036, had no effect on TNF
   alpha, IL-6, or IFN gamma production by PBMCs in either the mixed
   lymphocyte reaction or when activated by endotoxin.
   These results suggest that high-dose GH therapy does not alter the
   proinflammatory cytokine response to surgery or endotorrin. The results
   do not exclude an effect of GH on the immune response, but they suggest
   that the mortality seen in critically ill patients may be due to factors
   other than immune modulation.}},

   University of Beirut Medical Center during a 10-year period for
   treatment of aspiration of a foreign body into the tracheobronchial
   tree. All underwent rigid fiberoptic bronchoscopy for removal of the
   foreign body. Complications occurred in 42 patients (8\%) and were
   classified as intraoperative (7 patients), postoperative (25 patients),
   and failure to retrieve the foreign body by bronchoscopy (9 patients).
   These complications included respiratory distress necessitating
   tracheotomy and/or assisted ventilation, bronchial pneumonia,
   pneumothorax, bradycardia, and cardiac arrest. Variables that were
   examined were the age and sex of the patient, history of multiple
   previous bronchoscopies, delay in diagnosis and/or treatment, duration
   of the procedure, type and location of the foreign body, and use of
   corticosteroids during surgery. The most important variables that were
   of value in predicting the occurrence of complications were the history
   of previous bronchoscopy, the duration of the procedure, and the type

Abstract = {{The cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation (IR) has been associated with
   both the p53 pathway and with DNA mismatch repair (MMR). p53 mediates
   cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to X-ray damage, whereas the
   MMR complex is thought to recognize damaged bases and initiate a signal
   transduction pathway that can include phosphorylation of p53. To
   determine whether p53 and MMR mediate X-ray cytotoxicity via the same
   pathway, mice with targeted disruptions in either the p53 gene or the
   MutL homologue MMR gene Pms2 were interbred and primary fibroblasts were
   established from the progeny with genotypes of either wild type, p53
   null, Pms2 null, or double null. Cells with either p53 or Pms2
   separately disrupted showed reduced levels of apoptosis after IR in
   comparison with wild type, but the double null cells showed even lower
   levels, consistent with nonoverlapping roles for p53 and PMS2 in the
   X-ray response. In transformed cell lines established from the primary
   cells at early passage, similar differences in the apoptotic response to
   IR were seen, and clonogenic survival assays following low dose rate IR
   further showed that nullizygosity for Pms2 confers increased survival on
   cells in both wild-type and p53 null backgrounds. These results indicate
   that both p53 and MMR contribute to X-ray-induced apoptosis and that the
   role of MMR in the cytotoxicity of IR does not depend on p53.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the structural properties of the shock and
   rarefaction wave solutions of a nonequilibrium theory of vehicular
   traffic flow. It shows that this nonequilibrium theory has two families
   of characteristics: one is slower and the other is faster than vehicular
   speed. Corresponding to the slower characteristic arise 1-shock and
   I-rarefaction waves, whose behavior is similar to that of the shock and
   rarefaction waves in the LWR theory; corresponding to the faster
   characteristic there are 2-shocks (and 2-rarefaction waves) that behave
   as bores in rivers. The latter behavior does not accord with the
   generally held view that traffic is an anisotropic fluid. It is shown,
   however, those 2-shocks and 2-rarefactions in the studied nonequilibrium
   theory are transitory and their influence on traffic flow decays
   exponentially. It is further argued that as long as the 2-shocks and
   2-rarefactions do not persist, they can be allowed in a nonequilibrium
   theory. Apart from the behavioral aspects, the paper also derives the
   formulae for solving the Riemann problem associated with the

Abstract = {{Coupled with environmental factors, genes contribute to numerous human
   diseases and traits. While there are many epidemiological methods to
   assess the familial clustering of traits, few are flexible enough to
   accommodate interactions between covariates and familial factors. In
   this paper, pie propose and develop a frailty model that establishes an
   integrated framework to evaluate familial transmission of a disease by
   controlling for covariate effects and conveniently testing the
   interactions between covariates and familial factors. We also present a
   peeling algorithm that dramatically reduces the computational burden.
   This frailty model is employed to examine the familial transmission of
   major subtypes of alcoholism, namely, alcohol abuse and dependence. We
   conclude that alcohol dependence is strongly familial whereas alcohol
   abuse expresses a marginally significant pattern of familial
   transmission.;Moreover, females manifest alcoholism at a lower
   threshold, and there is no sex-specific familial transmission of
   alcoholism after adjustment for the threshold effect.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the role of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene (ACE)

   control group (NC, n=68), 2) isolated hypertension group (HT, n=45), 3)
   hypertensive patients with mild OSA group (MO, n=27), and 4)
   hypertensive patients with moderate to severe OSA group (MSO, n=34), The
   distribution of ACE gene I/D allele and genotypes were analyzed in the

   frequency of ACE gene I/D polymorphism differed significantly among the
   four groups, The frequency of I allele and II genotype were
   significantly higher in the MSO group than in the other groups (p<0.05).
   The distribution of I allele and II genotype showed no significant
   difference between any of the other groups (p>0.05, respectively),
   Meanwhile the higher frequency of I allele and II genotype was observed

   shear effects so that only two unknown functions for nonlinear analysis
   need to be treated to gain a precise insight into the complexities;
   otherwise high-order refined plate theories must be applied. An
   asymptotic series solution is constructed according to the Karman-type
   refined theory for postbuckling behavior of the plates with the boundary
   condition of four edges simply supported. Typical numerical examples are
   presented fur comparison with other nonlinear analytical and

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{213-220}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Apoptosis manifests in two major execution programs downstream of the
   death signal: the caspase pathway and organelle dysfunction. An
   important antiapoptosis factor, Bcl-2 protein, contributes in caspase
   pathway of apoptosis. Calcium, an important intracellular signal element
   in cells, is also observed to have changes during apoptosis, which maybe
   affected by Bcl-2 protein. We have previously reported that in
   Harringtonine (HT) induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells, there's a change of
   intracellular calcium distribution, moving from cytoplast especially
   Golgi's apparatus to nucleus and accumulating there with the highest
   concentration. We report here that caspase-3 becomes activated in
   HT-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells, which can be inhibited by
   overexpression of Bcl-2 protein. No sign of apoptosis or intracellular
   calcium movement from Golgi's apparatus to nucleus in HL-60 cells
   overexpressing Bcl-2 or treated with Ac-DEVD-CHO, a specific inhibitor
   of caspase-3. The results indicate that activated caspase-3 can promote
   the movement of intracellular calcium from Golgi's apparatus to nucleus,
   and the process is inhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHO (inhibitor of caspase-3),
   and that Bcl-2 can inhibit the movement and accumulation of
   intracellular calcium in nucleus through its inhibition on caspase-3.
   Calcium relocalization in apoptosis seems to be irreversible, which is
   different from the intracellular calcium changes caused by growth
   factor.}},

Abstract = {{With regard to substrate deformation, this work analyzed the

   two coupled springs; the spring compliances were related to the elastic
   compliances of the substrate, the support angle between the substrate
   and the microcantilever beam, and the beam thickness. Finite element
   analysis was conducted to calculate the spring compliances and verify
   the analytic formula. The results showed that the proportionality factor
   of the load to the deflection was a third-order polynomial of the length
   from the loading point to the fixed beam end. Examples are also given to
   indicate the relative error of Young's modulus when evaluated with the
   beam-bending theory without considering the substrate deformation.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to determine whether long-term potentiation
   (LTP) can be induced in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus
   (ICC) by electrical stimulation of the lateral lemniscus. If LTP can be
   induced, is it mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and/or other
   receptors? Brain slices of the ICC were obtained from 14-35 day old
   Wistar rats. The field potentials were recorded from the ICC after
   GABAergic and glycinergic inhibition was suppressed. Following tetanic
   stimulation (50 Hz, 20 s), the amplitude of the response was increased
   to about 146\% of control response for at least 30 min. LTP was observed
   in about 78\% of the cases tested. Induction of LTP in the ICC required
   activation of both NMDA and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(B) receptors.
   GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) were blocked by the
   GABA(A) receptor antagonist, but not by the GABA(B) receptor antagonist.
   The IPSPs were decreased by the GABA(B) receptor agonist, baclofen. The
   intrinsic postsynaptic membrane properties were not affected by
   baclofen. These results suggest that GABAergic inhibition in the ICC is
   mediated only by GABA(A) receptors, but that it is modulated by
   presynaptic GABAB receptors. The GABA(B) receptors in the ICC may
   suppress GABAergic inhibition and promote induction of LTP. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The induction of liquid crystal orientation through mechanical
   stretching was investigated for polymer dispersed liquid crystals
   (PDLCs) by means of infrared dichroism. Using a nematic liquid crystal
   BL006 and polyacrylic acid as the polymer matrix, it was possible to
   stretch the PDLC films with BL006 in either the isotropic or the nematic
   phase. After cooling the films under strain to room temperature, the
   molecular orientation of BL006 was found to be much higher for films
   that contained isotropic liquid droplets of BL006 at the time of
   stretching than for films that had nematic droplets. Stretching PDLC
   films with isotropic droplets results in no molecular orientation, but
   the orientation is induced during the subsequent cooling when BL006 goes
   through the isotropic-to-nematic phase transition. Interestingly for
   PAA/BL006, the nematic director orients along the long axes of the
   elongated droplets despite liquid crystal anchoring perpendicular to the

Abstract = {{A new PE model for solving three-dimensional, forward and backward sound
   propagation in a cylindrical coordinate system is presented. The model
   marches a wave field in the radial direction including the azimuthal
   diffraction effects, and solves for a backscattered field based on a
   three-dimensional, single scattering approach. A periodic sidewall
   boundary condition is applied for computations in a 360-degree sector,
   while an approximate sidewall boundary condition is used for calculation
   in a sector less than 360 degrees. These two sidewall boundary
   conditions are verified by the numerical results. The major drawback of
   using the cylindrical coordinate system, when the backscattering
   solution is valid within a limited area, is analyzed using a
   geometrical-optical interpretation. The model may be useful for studying
   three-dimensional backscattering, phenomena comprising azimuthal
   diffraction effects. (C) 2000 Acoustical Society of America.

   grains, to which they had very similar orientations. Therefore the
   misorientation angles between the nuclei and the deformation matrix were
   generally very low. The orientation and the misorientation distributions
   of the nuclei have very strong influence on the recrystallization
   process which could result in a very weak recrystallization texture. The

Abstract = {{A principle of opioid pharmacotherapy is that high medication doses

   during maintenance on 2 and 16 mg sublingual buprenorphine (BUP) liquid,
   and after detoxification (0 mg) under double-blind, placebo-controlled
   conditions, and once in matched controls. Binding measures were obtained
   with the mu OR-selective radioligand {[}C-11]carfentanil (CFN) and PET 4
   hrs after BUP administration. BUP induced dose-dependent reductions in
   mu OR availability, 36-50\% at 2 mg and 79-95\% at 16 mg relative to
   placebo. Heroin abusers also had greater mu OR binding potential in the
   inferofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate regions during placebo,
   compared to matched controls. Further studies are warranted to examine
   the relationship of mu OR availability with BUP therapeutic actions, and
   the clinical implications of increased mu OR binding during withdrawal.

Abstract = {{The role of polymorphism of some physicochemical characteristics of
   cellular features in cancer are discussed. Data in the literature and
   our previous observations indicate that the probability of oncogenesis
   depends on the variability of these characteristics and the host's
   homeostasis and is manifested as a conflict between stability and
   variability of these features. In addition, a high degree of genetic
   polymorphism was associated with tumorigenesis. Changes in
   ``behavior{''} of the p53 gene and an increase in the production of the
   soluble 51 kDa protein in cancer patients are examples of such changes.
   An organism and its cells can be considered as two interdependent
   systems which, in extreme situations become antagonistic and
   competitive. As such cancer develops mainly due to external effects. The
   last cause deep changes in the balance between stability and variability
   of physicochemical parameters of cellular features and result in some
   internal, including genomic, alterations. These culminate in cell death
   (apoptosis), or cause cells to being a new stage in their lives,
   sometimes leading to tumors. In this respect, cancer can be regarded as
   a rescuer of the cells although it brings about the death of the host.
   We suggest that the variability of physicochemical features of cells is
   one of important reasons for the development of cancer.}},

Abstract = {{The ultrastructural image of glycogen granules in the cytoplasm of
   rainbow trout phagocytes in sections stained by the conventional lead or

   Morphometry of samples processed for the detection of peroxidase or
   esterase activities (to specifically label neutrophils and macrophages,
   respectively), and simultaneously stained for the specific detection of
   glycogen, showed that inflammatory peritoneal neutrophils were richer in
   glycogen granules than resting neutrophils. This increase in glycogen
   content occurs after the migration from the haematopoietic tissues and
   peripheral blood to the inflamed foci. Glycogen granules could not be
   found in resting peritoneal macrophages but were found in inflammatory
   macrophages. The macrophage granules occurred in smaller amounts than in
   neutrophils, and consisted of granules identical to those of neutrophils
   together with significantly smaller granules. No evidence for the
   utilization of glycogen by neutrophils phagocytosing bacteria within the

Abstract = {{A thixoforging process has numerous advantages compared to die casting,
   squeeze casting, and conventional forging. For the thixoforging process,
   beside a co-existing solidus-liquidus interval, the reheating conditions
   to obtain a fine globular microstructure are very important. During
   reheating, the eutectic must be remelted completely in order to obtain
   good mechanical properties. The solid traction distribution over
   temperature, the phase distribution and the morphology of structure are
   important for the reheatability of SSM. Moreover. the reheating of the
   biller in the semi-solid state as quickly and homogeneously as possible
   is one of the most decisive aspect. To,obtain the globular
   microstructure in the cross-section of the biller, the optimal design of
   the induction coil for variations of alloys and specimen sizes Is
   necessary. Thus in this study, the optimal coil design of A356 (ALTHIX)
   and Al2024 with dxl=60 mmx90 mm to reduce the temperature gradient of
   the biller and to obtain a globular microstructure was theoretically
   proposed, and then the coil was manufactured The suitability of the coil
   design will be demonstrated by reheating experiments. The microstructure

Abstract = {{Photo-responsive behavior of an azobenzene surfactant is observed at the
   air-water interface in terms of the surface pressure modulation with 360
   and 420 nm wavelength light. The surface pressure response of the
   monolayer changes depends on the degree of compression of the Langmuir
   monolayer, expressed in terms of the area per molecule, as well as the
   light condition during the formation of the Langmuir layer. The
   azobenzene chromophore requires molecular space to undergo
   photoisomerization, which causes surface pressure changes at the
   air-water interface. Closely packed trans molecules do not fully convert
   to the cis state under 360 nm due to the steric hindrance and formation
   of H-aggregates. The bulky cis chromophores do convert to the trans
   state. Ultraviolet-visible spectra of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films are
   blue shifted 17 nm relative to the UV-visible spectra for the azobenzene
   surfactant in chloroform solutions, indicating formation of H
   aggregates. Langmuir-Blodgett films show different molecular
   conformation depending on the light wavelength during compression. (C)

Abstract = {{Morphology and phase behaviour of palmitoyl glycerol (PmGl) and
   hexadecyl glycerol (HdGl) monolayers on glucose, fructose and sucrose
   solution subphases is studied by means of surface pressure-area (pi-A)
   isotherms, Brewster Angle Microscopy (BAM) and Grazing Incidence X-ray
   Diffraction (GIXD). The presence of the sugars in the subphase shifts
   the pi-A isotherms to higher areas per molecule compared with those on
   water subphase and increases the pressure pi(t) and the latent heat
   Delta H-t of the main phase transition from the fluid to the condensed
   state. The monolayer expansion is greatest if the sucrose is used as a
   solute and decreases in the order sucrose > fructose > glucose. The
   addition of sugars in the subphase affects the morphology of the
   condensed phase domains of both PmGl and HdGl. The segment texture of
   the PmGl domains is distorted, the segment number is reduced and only
   small areas with different reflectivity appear on the periphery of the
   domain. Domains without inner structure are seen as well. In case of
   HdGl the segment texture is preserved, but domains are more compact and
   a certain number of circular domains exists. The differences in the
   morphology of the single domains are seen mainly in the coexistence
   region between the fluid and condensed monolayer state and vanish when
   the compact condensed phase is formed. The effect of the sugar type on
   domain morphology diminishes in the same order, as revealed by the
   isotherm measurements. At the same time, GIXD shows that the packing
   mode of the alkyl chains of PmGl and HdGl is not affected by the
   subphase composition. The expanding effect of sugars on the PmGl and
   HdGl monolayers is related to the strong tendency towards hydrogen bond
   formation between the sugar molecules and the head groups of the PmGl or
   HdGl. Monoglyceride-sugar interactions could reduce the electrostatic
   repulsion between the amphiphilic molecules, thus increasing the latent
   heat of fluid to condensed transition and the line tension at the
   contact line between the fluid and condensed phases in PmGl and HdGl
   monolayers. As a result, more compact domains with altered segment
   texture appear. However, the hydrogen bond formation in the head group
   region is not sufficient to change the crystal structure and the alkyl
   chains packing in the PmGl and HdGl condensed phase. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper provides a methodology to test existence, type, and strength
   of changes in the distribution of a sequence of hydrometeorological
   random variables. Unlike most published work on change-point analysis,
   which consider a single structure of change occurring with certainty, it
   allows for the consideration in the inference process of the no change
   hypothesis and various possible situations that may occur. The approach
   is based on Bayesian model selection and is illustrated using univariate
   normal models. Four univariate normal models are considered: the no
   change hypothesis, a single change in the mean level only, a single
   change in the variance only, and a simultaneous change in both the mean
   and the variance. First, inference analysis of posterior distributions
   via Gibbs sampling for a given change-point model is recalled. This
   scientific reporting framework is then generalized to the problem of
   selecting among different configurations of a single change and the no
   change hypothesis. The important operational issue of forecasting a
   future observation, often neglected in the literature on change-point
   analysis, is also treated in the previous model selection perspective.
   To illustrate the approach, a case study involving annual energy inflows
   for eight large hydropower systems situated in Quebec is detailed. (C)

Abstract = {{Mercury electroplated onto solid electrodes is widely used for
   electrochemical measurements. Depending on the substrate, the coating
   can take the form of either a uniform thin film or an assembly of
   microdroplets. It is interesting to ask the extent to which the
   morphological state can influence the nature of voltammetric responses
   from such electrodes. Accordingly, a general approach is developed for
   the numerical simulation of square wave anodic stripping voltammetry at
   hemispherical and uniform planar electrodes based on the backward
   implicit method. This is applied to the modeling of electrochemically
   reversible, irreversible, and quasi-reversible redox couples. Data from
   the simulations are validated by comparison of characteristic properties
   of the voltammograms with published work for the reversible limit of the
   planar electrode. The variation of these characteristic features with
   electrode geometry and electrode kinetics is studied, and a comparison
   between the planar and hemispherical geometry made. Last, experimental
   data is presented for the nature of mercury on the surface of both
   iridium and copper substrates, obtained by atomic force microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{An antagonist of cellular adhesion and motility,
   acetyl-C-{[}S-Acm]-VIGYSGDRC-{[}S-Acm]-NH2 (mEGF((33-42))), shares
   homology with the agonist sequence CDPGYIGSR-NH2. It has been proposed
   that the latter peptide binds to the high affinity 67 kDa laminin
   receptor. Both peptides have equal affinities for the receptor and
   similar conformations have been derived for both. We have examined the
   importance of individual non-homologous residues with respect to
   receptor binding and antagonistic properties of mEGF((33-42)). Alanine
   scanning of non-conserved residues in the N-terminal half of mEGF(33-42)
   caused loss of biological activity with respect to cell attachment,
   receptor binding and migratory response. Substitution of alanine for
   serine (position 6) caused loss of laminin-specific cell attachment and
   receptor binding activities. However, the peptide did stimulate
   migration suggesting that this peptide may be a non-specific stimulator
   of migration. In contrast, alanine substitution for the C-terminal
   Cys-S-Acm had no apparent effect on the attachment or receptor binding
   activities of the peptide but generated an agonist from the antagonist
   parent. Comparison of the modelled folds of the alanine containing
   peptides revealed the presence of significant helical content in those
   peptides capable of stimulating migration and suggests that a reduction
   in bulk in the N-terminal residues is not conducive to adopting a
   productive binding conformation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Microstructure and structure of cubic WNx compounds were investigated by
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron energy-loss
   spectroscopy (EELS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), and electron diffraction. The samples were thin films
   produced by reactive de magnetron sputtering of tungsten at various N-2
   partial pressures in an Ar-N-2 gas mixture. The composition and
   structure of the films were characterized by XPS, EELS, and XRD. It was
   found that a two-phase structure consisting of W2N and bcc W was formed
   in the 0.12 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 0.28 range and
   a single-phase structure of W2N was formed at higher values of x after
   annealing of as-deposited samples at 600 degrees C or above.
   Cross-sectional TEM studies showed that all crystalline WNx films had
   columnar microstructures. The average column width at stoichiometry of
   W2N was similar to 15 nm, whereas the column grains were larger with
   decreasing value of x. Using the electron scattering data collected from
   a range of crystalline samples for calculating the pair distribution
   function (RDF) by Fourier transformation in real space, structural
   details of W-N and W-W bonding in W2N have been obtained. (C) 2000

   spectra revealed the presence of different Al-relating species in the

   loading enhanced the replacement of framework silicon by phosphorus
   atoms, resulting in the alteration of the environment of aluminum nuclei
   in the zeolitic framework and leading consequently to a change of the
   acidic property of the catalyst. In correlation with reaction results of
   the relevant catalysts, it was concluded that the presence of

Abstract = {{The morphology and substructure of lath martensites formed in beta
   quenched dilute Zr-Nb alloys are described. The laths are arranged in a
   nearly parallel manner within any given colony or packet. Packets of
   alternately twin related laths and clusters of three mutually twin
   related lath martensite variants have been observed and the twinning
   plane is of \{1 (1) over bar 01\}(H) type. With increasing niobium
   content a continuous transition from large colonies of lath martensites,
   through smaller lath colonies, to individual plates of the acicular
   martensites occurs. The lath-lath interface consists of regularly spaced
   parallel arrays of dislocations of 2 (1) over bar (1) over bar 3> type.
   The habit plane traces of lath martensite lie close to \{334\} type
   poles and the operating lattice invariant shear mode is \{(1) over bar

   consistent with results predicted by the phenomenological theory. The

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to present a mathematical programming
   method developed to solve structural optimization problems involving
   discrete variables. We work in the following context: the structural
   responses are computed by the finite elements method and convex and
   separable approximation schemes are used to generate a sequence of
   explicit approximate subproblems. Each of them is solved in the dual
   space with a subgradient-based algorithm (or with a variant of it)
   specially developed to maximize the not everywhere differentiable dual
   function. To show that the application field is large, the presented
   applications are issued from different domains of structural design,
   such as sizing of thin-walled structures, geometrical configuration of
   trusses. topology optimization of membrane or 3-D structures and welding
   points numbering in car bodies. The main drawback of using the dual
   approach is that the obtained solution is generally not the global
   optimum. This is linked to the presence of a duality gap, due to the
   non-convexity of the primal discrete subproblems. Fortunately, this gap
   can be quantified: a maximum bound on its value can be computed.
   Moreover, it turns out that the duality gap is decreasing for higher
   number of variables; the maximum bound on the duality gap is generally
   negligible in the treated applications. The developed algorithms are
   very efficient for 2-D and 3-D topology optimization, where applications
   involving thousands of binary design variables are solved in a very
   short time. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   with multiple branches, multiple holes and cracks emanating from holes

   incorporating discontinuous fields through a partition of unity method.
   A methodology that constructs the enriched approximation based on the

   developed. Computation of the stress intensity factors (SIF) in
   different examples involving branched and intersecting cracks as well as

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction of Stat5 with
   hey effector proteins Erk2 and She after activation by growth hormone
   (GH), using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the wild

   experiments. we show GH-induced formation of complexes consisting of
   Stat5a and Erk?, and Stat5a and Stat5b association with the protein
   adaptor. She. In CI-IO cells treated with GH, a rapid association of
   tyrosine and serine phosphorylated Slat5a with activated Erk2 is
   observed. In contrast, She proteins interact with non-phosphorylated
   forms of Stat5. Using truncated and tyrosine mutants of the GI-TR, we
   identify a carboxy-terminal domain of the receptor, which is critical
   for serine phosphorylation of Stat5a and Stat5a/Erk2 complex Formation.
   In addition, tyrosine residues of this region of the GHR are not
   required for Stat5/Erk2 interaction but are essential for Stat5a serine
   phosphorylation, Moreover, we detect serine phosphorylated proteins
   associated with Erk2, She and Stat5: both Stat5 isoforms interact with
   ii serine phosphorylated protein of 63 kDa, which is shown to be related
   to the serine-threonine kinase Akt-1. Our results support the importance

Abstract = {{The application of landscape ecology in conservation biology has rarely
   occurred in the context of defined landscapes. Conservation planning has
   focussed on representation of species diversity patterns and assumed
   that ecosystems, landscapes and their associated processes will be
   equally protected. The long-term persistence of biodiversity in the face
   of land transformations and global change requires the representation
   and retention of all elements of biodiversity. This biodiversity
   includes landscapes, and the landscape structure and processes that
   maintain patterns of biodiversity. We developed a method of classifying
   landscapes for the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. The process
   entailed the use of 1 km(2) grid data from climate and terrain
   databases. Principal components analysis coupled with a cluster
   classification method and spatial overlay techniques were used to
   identify two hierarchical levels of landscapes. Validation analysis
   showed that landscapes are identifiable with a classification accuracy
   of 86.8\%. The derived landscapes can be combined separately with data
   on vegetation and soil to describe landscape ecosystems that potentially
   differ in species composition, successional dynamics, and potential
   productivity. The surrogate use of the landscapes in conjunction with
   other strategic data, for the identification of priority conservation
   areas, is demonstrated. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of two techniques of harvest (a direct versus two-phase)
   applied to five legume plants (peas, chickling vetch, lentils, and soya
   beans) on gross chemical composition and trypsin inhibitor activity
   (TIA) of their seeds was studied in field experiments, over a 3-year
   period. The chemical composition of legume seeds reflected only
   interspecies differences between the plants and was not affected by the
   treatments. In contrast, TIA of the seeds was significantly (P < 0.05)
   altered by the techniques of harvest. The two-phase technique reduced
   TIA of pea cultivars by 27 and 44\%, chickling vetch cultivars by 25 and
   18\%, a lentil cultivar by 8\%, and soybean cultivars by 4 and 2\%,
   respectively. It is concluded that improvements in nutritional value
   resulting from this agricultural practice are limited to pea and
   chickling vetch cultivars, whereas in the case of lentils and soya
   beans, the relative reduction of TIA is too small to consider the

Abstract = {{Binding processes of any kind can be characterized as an association of
   a given ligand with some binding factor. This includes macromolecules as
   well as supramolecular aggregates such as micelles or membranes. The
   underlying molecular binding mechanism may be more or less complicated
   due to various intermediate steps (involving for instance conformational
   changes, aggregation, cooperativity, etc.). A sensible discussion of
   possible binding models naturally calls for a model-independent access
   to basic thermodynamic properties. The present contribution will
   demonstrate how this can quite generally be accomplished by a pertinent
   processing of properly selected experimental data. The method requires a
   series of titration measurements comprising the use of variable amounts
   of both the ligand and the binding factor. It leads to a linear mass
   conservation plot (i.e. amount of the ligand vs. a matching amount of
   the binding factor) whose slope and ordinate intercept are equal to the
   binding ratio (i.e. bound ligand per binding factor) and the free ligand
   concentration, respectively. This establishes the specific binding
   isotherm. The approach also reveals latent structurally determined
   features of the applied physical measuring signal. A number of examples
   including specific binding, unspecific adsorption and insertion in
   two-dimensional molecular films will illustrate the methodology. (C)

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{122}},

Pages = {{125-133}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Despite the basic differences in their underlying biological targets,
   prenatal exposure to heroin or phenobarbital produces similar syndromes
   of neurobehavioral deficits, involving defects in septohippocampal
   cholinergic innervation-related behaviors. At the cellular level, these
   deficits are associated with cholinergic hyperactivity, characterized by
   increased concentrations of muscarinic receptors and enhanced second
   messenger activity linked to the receptors. In the present study, we
   determined whether the cellular changes are mechanistically linked to
   altered behavior, using two different approaches: neural grafting and
   correlations between behavior and biochemistry within the same
   individual animals. Mice were exposed transplacentally to phenobarbital
   or heroin on gestation days 9-18 and, as adults, received fetal
   cholinergic grafts or were sham-operated. Prenatal drug exposure
   resulted in deficits in behavioral performance tested in the eight-arm
   radial maze, accompanied by increases in hippocampal M-1-muscarinic
   receptor expression and muscarinic receptor-mediated IP formation.
   Neural grafting reversed both the behavioral deficits and the muscarinic
   hyperactivity. In the drug-exposed offspring, there was a significant
   correlation between maze performance and carbachol-induced inositol
   phosphate (IP) formation. These studies indicate that deficits of
   cholinergic function underlie the neurobehavioral deficits seen in the
   hippocampus of animals exposed prenatally to heroin or phenobarbital,
   and consequently that the observed cholinergic hyperactivity is an
   unsuccessful attempt to compensate for the loss of cholinergic function.
   The fact that the damage can be reversed by neural grafting opens up
   novel approaches to the restoration of brain function after prenatal
   insults. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   IL-1/Toll-like receptor (TLR) superfamily of receptors, which have a key
   role in innate immunity and inflammation. When expressed in mammalian
   cells, the protein products of both ORFs were shown to interfere
   specifically with IL-1 signal transduction. A46R partially inhibited
   IL-1-mediated activation of the transcription factor NF kappa B, and
   A52R potently blocked both IL-1- and TLR4-mediated NF kappa B
   activation. MyD88 is a TIR domain-containing adapter molecule known to
   have a central role in both IL-1 and TLR4 signaling. A52R mimicked the
   dominant-negative effect of a truncated version of MyD88 on IL-1, TLR4,
   and IL-18 signaling but had no effect on MyD88-independent signaling
   pathways. Therefore, A46R and A52R are likely to represent a mechanism
   used by vaccinia virus of suppressing TIR domain-dependent
   intracellular-signaling.}},

Abstract = {{The spike structure of bacteriophage PRDL is comprised of proteins P2,
   P5, and P31. It resembles the corresponding receptor-binding structure
   of adenoviruses. We show that purified recombinant protein P5 is an
   elongated (30 x 2.7 nm; R-h = 5.5 nm), multidomain trimer which can
   slowly associate into nonamers. Cleavage of thr 340 amino acid long P5
   with collagenase yields 2 fragments. The larger, 205 amino acid long
   C-terminal fragment appears to contain the residues responsible for the
   trimerization of the protein, whereas the smaller N-terminal part
   mediates the interaction of P5 with the pentameric vertex protein P31
   (24 x 2.5 nm, R-h = 4.2 nm), In addition, the presence of the N-terminal
   sequence is required for the formation of the P5 nonamer. The results
   presented here suggest that P5 and P31 form an elongated adaptor complex
   at the 5-fold vertexes of the virion which anchors the adsorption
   protein P2 (21 x 2.5 nm; R-h = 4.1 nm). Our results also suggest that
   the P5 trimer forms a substantial part of the viral spike shaft that was
   previously thought to be composed exclusively of protein P2.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of 117 titration experiments in the murine scrapie model is
   presented. The experiments encompass 30 years' work and a wide range of
   experimental conditions. To check that the experimental designs were
   reasonably consistent over time, comparisons were made of size,
   duration, source of inoculum, etc., in each experiment. These
   comparisons revealed no systematic trends that would render invalid
   comparisons across experiments. For 114 of the experiments it was
   possible to calculate the dose at which half of the challenged animals
   were infected (the ID50). These 114 experiments were then combined on
   the basis of relative dose (i.e. tenfold dilution relative to the ID50)
   This created a data set in which over 4000 animals were challenged with
   doses of scrapie ranging from four orders of magnitude below to five
   orders of magnitude above the ID50. Analysis of this data reveals that
   mean incubation periods rise linearly with logarithmic decreases in
   dose. A one unit increase in relative dose (i.e. a tenfold increase in
   actual dose) will, on average, decrease the incubation period by 25
   days. At ID50 the average incubation period in this data set is 300
   days. Within a single dose, in a single experimental model, incubation
   periods have a distribution close to normal. Variability in incubation
   period also rises linearly as dose decreases. There is no age or sex
   effect upon the probability of infection, but female mice have
   incubation periods that are, on average, nine days shorter than their
   male counterparts and young mice have incubation periods that are longer
   by seven days. Although many of these patterns are apparent in the
   results of single titration curves, they can be more rigorously
   investigated by considering the outcome for thousands of mice.}},

   concept of hydropathic complementarity to search for sequences whose
   amino acid sidechains display a reciprocal pattern of hydropathicity to
   those of the deletion junction of EGFRvIII. The resulting peptide
   (PEPHC1) was synthesized and tested for binding to EGFRvIII and EGFR. In
   in vitro assays, PEPHC1 bound the recombinant EGFRvIII extracellular
   domain or full-length EGFRvIII solubilized from cell membranes in

Abstract = {{Employing the nonabelian duality transformation {[}A. Dubin,
   hep-th/9910264], I derive the gauge string form of certain D greater
   than or equal to 3 lattice Yang-Mills (YMD) theories in the strong
   coupling (SC) phase. With the judicious choice of the actions, in D
   greater than or equal to 3 our construction generalizes the Gross-Taylor
   stringy reformulation of the continuous YM2 on a 2d manifold. Using the
   Eguchi-Kawai model as an example, we develop the algorithm to determine
   the weights w{[}M] for connected YM-flux worldsheets (M) over tilde
   immersed into the 2d skeleton of a D greater than or equal to 3
   base-lattice. Owing to the invariance of w{[}M] under a continuous group
   of area-preserving worldsheet homeomorphisms, the set of weights
   (w{[}(M) over tilde]) can be used to define the theory of the smooth
   YM-fluxes which unambiguously refers to a particular continuous YMD
   system. I argue that the latter YMD models (with a finite ultraviolet
   cut-off) for sufficiency large coupling constant(s) are reproduced, to
   all orders in 1/N, by the smooth gauge string thus associated. The
   asserted YMD/String duality allows to make a concrete prediction for the
   `bare' string tension sigma(0) which implies that (in the large N SC
   regime) the continuous YMD systems exhibit confinement for D greater
   than or equal to 2. The resulting pattern is qualitatively consistent
   (in the extreme D = 4 SC limit) with the Witten's proposal motivated by
   the AdS/CFT correspondence. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The nonlinear mixed effects model provides a framework for inference in
   a number of applications, most notably pharmacokinetics and
   pharmacodynamics, but also in HIV and other disease dynamics and in a
   host of other longitudinal-data settings. In these models, to
   characterize population variation, individual-specific parameters are
   modeled as functions of fixed effects and mean-zero random effects. A
   standard assumption is that of normality of the random effects, but this
   assumption may not always be realistic, and, because the random effects
   are not observed, it may be difficult to verify. An additional issue is
   specifying the form of the function relating individual-specific
   parameters to fixed and random effects. Again, because this relationship
   is not observed explicitly, it may be difficult to specify. Popular
   methods for fitting these models are predicated on the normality
   assumption, and past studies evaluating their performance have assumed
   that normality and the form of the model are correct specifications. We
   investigate the consequences for population inferences using these
   methods when the normality assumption is inappropriate and/or the model
   is misspecified. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we demonstrate a new UV irradiation technique for covalent
   coupling of bacterial polysaccharides derived from lipopolysaccharides
   to microtiter plates and the use of such plates in an enzyme linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Lipopolysaccharides were cleaved by mild
   acid hydrolysis into the lipid A part and the polysaccharide part. The
   polysaccharide was conjugated regiospecifically to a photochemically
   active compound, anthraquinone, resulting in a
   polysaccharide-anthraquinone conjugate. Anthraquinones forms active
   radicals when exposed to soft UV irradiation (350 nm) permitting the
   formation of stable covalent bonds to polymers e.g, microtiter plates.
   By this technique the polysaccharides are bound through the
   anthraquinone part of the polysaccharide-anthraquinone conjugates to the
   microtiter plates. This minimizes denaturation of O-antigen epitopes
   during binding to the microtiter plates and avoids cross-reactivity due
   to conserved domains in the lipid A. Furthermore, the covalent binding
   of the polysaccharide antigens are compatible with harsh assay
   conditions, such as extensive washing procedures and buffers with high
   salt concentrations with no risk of antigen leakage. Here we describe
   the use of this technique for the immobilization of Lipopolysaccharide
   derived polysaccharides from Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella
   Choleraesuis lipopolysaccharides, representing the O-antigens 1, 4, 5,
   6, 7, and 12, The functional polysaccharide surface gave similar ELISA
   results to plates coated passively with the corresponding unmodified
   lipopolysaccharide antigens. The plates were highly reproducible, showed
   very low inter-and intra-plate variation and were stable at room
   temperature for more than 8 months. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   accelerated during formation of selenite cataract, and (2) to determine
   the role of calpains and caspases in lens apoptosis. Evidence for
   apoptosis in selenite-injected rats included: approximately 7-8\% of
   epithelial cells in germinative zone were positive, disappearance of the
   nuclear membrane, condensation of the chromatin, and breakdown of PARP.
   Activation of calpairas was indicated by characteristic limited
   proteolysis of crystallins, breakdown of alpha-spectrin to 150/145 kDa
   fragments, hydrolysis of vimentin, and autolytic breakdown of m-calpain.
   Selenite cataract did not have an appreciable effect on the mRNA levels
   for caspase-3, calpains, and calpastatin. This indicated the increased
   enzyme activity of m-calpain and caspase-3 in selenite cataract occurred
   at the enzyme level rather than by upregulation of mRNAs. Increased
   calpain and caspase activity may be linked to the selenite-induced
   apoptosis. Such data are important because they indicate that apoptosis
   may be a fairly early event in selenite cataract. (C) 2000 Academic

Volume = {{93}},

Abstract = {{Although asthma has a significant heritable component, the mode of
   inheritance remains controversial because of the complexity of the
   disease and the influence of environmental factors. Segregation analysis
   for asthma are performed with and without a history of atopic diseases
   (dermatitis and rhinitis) after adjusting for environmental factors. To
   investigate whether asthma may be inherited through a major gene with
   two alleles, the REGD program of the Statistical Analysis for Genetic
   Epidemiology (SAGE) package was conducted in 1,990 individuals from 227
   families with at least one asthmatic child in a cross-sectional study of
   respiratory diseases in Southern Taiwan, Other covariates adjusted for
   included age, sex, current smoking, and environmental tobacco smoking.
   The hypothesis of Mendelian model and no parent-offspring transmission
   was rejected. However, when the variables of atopic disease and
   environmental factors were included in the model as covariates, the
   models for a two-allele gene with a recessive or codominant inheritance
   could not be rejected, and Akaike's Information Criterion was smaller
   (1,377.13) for the recessive model than all of the other models tested,
   assuming a major gene with a population frequency of 0.56 +/- 0.04,
   However, Mendelian model without family effect was rejected. In
   conclusion, a history of asthma in parents is a strong risk factor for
   asthma in offspring. Under the assumptions of the applied segregation,
   at least one major gene exists that could be a gene involved also in
   allergy. However, the data suggest that a single Locus gene explains a
   portion of asthma that is related to the history of atopic diseases. In
   addition, a polygenic/multifactorial (genetic and environmental factors)
   influence with a recessive component inheritance may be involved in the
   pathogenesis of asthma, (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Background, Whether the twin aims of alleviating organ shortage and of
   increasing justice of organ allocation necessarily conflict with each
   other or can be simultaneously furthered while the autonomy of patients
   is respected is an important question in organ transplantation. It is
   shown. that very minor reforms of existing schemes of organ. allocation
   could increase the scope for justice, autonomy, and beneficence
   simultaneously,
   Method, Willingness to donate discriminates between patients of
   comparable medical status in the elective category by preferring
   potential donors over nondonors, High urgency patients as well as
   children have priority over patients in the elective category. The
   proposed solidarity model can easily be implemented, for example, as a
   sixth ranking scale added to the existing allocation algorithm of
   Eurotransplant,
   Results, 1, More justice and more beneficence. It is excluded that of
   two recipients of equal medical suitability, a patient who is unwilling
   to donate is unjustly preferred to one who is willing to donate, whereas
   enhanced solidarity with donors will increase the number of donations
   and, thereby, the scope for beneficence. 2, Enhanced involvement of
   individuals and hospitals. More people are induced to declare actively
   their willingness to donate which in turn enhances the moral obligation
   of hospitals to participate in transplantation. 3, Fair treatment of
   dissenting minorities, local residents, and nonresidents, The solidarity
   model favors altruistic contributors to the organ. pool over
   noncontributors without discriminating against groups.
   Conclusion, A solidarity rule for organ allocation should be gradually
   introduced.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPLANTATION}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{640-648}},
Month = {{AUG 27}},
Abstract = {{Background Although HLA typing and matching have been used for 3
   decades, that practice has been poorly implemented in corneal
   transplantation, mainly because of inconclusive or contradictory
   analytical results. Consequently, we studied the immune response of
   corneal transplant recipients to HLA histoincompatibilities in a large
   homogeneous study.
   Methods. All corneal transplantations performed by a single surgeon
   between 1976 and 1996 were studied. HLA-AB matching was used for
   recipient selection. All HLA typings were performed by a single
   experienced laboratory. Population genetic techniques were used to
   assess the validity of the HLA typings. Mono- and multivariate analyses
   were performed to identify the factors which significantly influence the
   survival of corneal allografts. Simulation studies were carried out to
   demonstrate the effects of mis-typed donor and recipient HLA-DR typings
   on analytical results.
   Results. Retransplantation, degree of vascularization, HLA-AB and DR
   matching, endothelial cell count, graft size, recipient gender, and
   storage method were identified as significant factors by our monovariate
   analyses. A Cox proportional hazards survival analysis model identified
   degree of vascularization and HLA-AB and DR matching as significant
   prognostic factors when all immunological rejection episodes were used,
   P=0.000001. When only irreversible immunological rejection episodes were
   used, panel reactive antibodies, retransplantation, and number of
   rejection events were also identified, P=0.000001. Simulation studies
   showed that the effects of HLA-DR matching are abrogated by poor HLA-DR
   typings,
   Conclusions. Corneal allograft recipients have a normal alloimmune
   response to histoincompatibilities. Demonstration of that fact requires
   accurate HLA typings.}},

   not critically dependent on TIMP-2, Lack of functional TIMP-2, however,
   dramatically altered the activation of proMMP-2 both in vivo and in
   vitro. Fully functional TIMP-2 is essential for efficient activation of
   proMMP-2 in vivo, No evidence of successful functional compensation was
   observed. The results illustrate the duality of TIMP-2 function, i.e. at
   low concentrations, TIMP-2 exerts a ``catalytic{''} or enhancing effect
   on cell-mediated proMMP-2 activation, whereas at higher concentrations,
   TIMP-2 inhibits the activation and/or activity of MMP-2.}},

Abstract = {{We have determined the kinetic scheme and the reaction rates of binding
   to microtubules of two fluorescent taxoids,
   7-O-{[}N-(4'-fluoresceincarbonyl)-L-alanyl]Taxol (Flutax-1) and
   7-O-{[}N-(2,7-difluoro-4'-fluoresceincarbonyl)-L-alanyl]Taxol
   (Flutax-2). Flutax-1 and Flutax-2 bind to microtubules with high
   affinity (K-a approximate to 10(7) M-1, 37 degrees C), The binding
   mechanism consists of a fast bimolecular reaction followed by at least
   two monomolecular rearrangements, which were characterized with
   stopped-flow techniques. The kinetic constants of the bimolecular
   reaction were 6.10 +/- 0.22 x 10(5) M-1 s(-1) and 13.8 +/- 1.8 x 10(5)
   M-1 s(-1) at 37 degrees C, respectively. A second slow binding step has
   been measured employing the change of fluorescence anisotropy of the
   probe. The reversal of this reaction is the rate-limiting step of
   dissociation, A third step has been detected using small angle x-ray
   scattering and involves a 2-nm increase in the diameter of microtubules.
   It is suggested that the first step entails the binding of the Taxol
   moiety and the second a relative immobilization of the fluorescent
   probe. The equilibrium and some kinetic measurements required the use of
   stabilized cross-linked microtubules, which preserved taxoid binding.
   The results indicate that the Taxol binding site is directly accessible,
   in contrast with its location at lumen in the current model of
   microtubules. An alternative structural model is considered in which the
   binding site is located between protofilaments, accessible from the
   microtubule surface.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations of equilibrium thermal and epithermal neutron flux spectra
   for the Moon have been studied to determine their chemical information
   content, Most of this information resides in a single parameter, the
   ratio of macroscopic absorption to energy-loss cross sections. Although
   this parameter cannot specify the chemistry of lunar soils uniquely, it
   provides an index that can be used to quantitatively separate
   anorthositic from mafic chemistries. Hydrogen abundances can best be
   derived from measurements of the epithermal neutron flux, which is
   strongly related to its macroscopic energy-loss cross section. The ratio
   of thermal to epithermal neutron flux measured by Lunar Prospector is
   shown to agree quantitatively with simulations, This agreement is used
   to show that the highlands terrane on the farside of the Moon is
   anorthositic, containing high percentages of plagioclase and possibly a
   range of Mg-suite minerals with a high Mg/(Mg + Fe) atomic ratio. Our
   best estimate of the abundance of FeO is 2\%, with an upper limit of
   5\%.}},

Abstract = {{Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistors (ISFETs) are currently produced
   commercially and promise to become the platform sensors for important
   biomedical applications. The drift in ISFETs is still an important
   inherent problem that prevents its application to accurate in vivo
   measurements. The present paper presents measurements of the drift and
   the drain current power spectral density (PSD) of pH ISFETs in the very
   low frequency range from 5 mHz to 10 kHz. The measurements have been
   performed in buffer solutions with pH 4, 7 and 10, at room temperature.
   Above a corner frequency, the measured spectra correspond to 1/f noise
   introduced by fluctuations at the channel current. Below this corner
   frequency that depends on the magnitude of the drift, the measured
   spectra correspond to 1/f(2). The observed corner frequency is similar
   to 1 Hz for a drift of 2 mV/h and shifts to frequencies below 0.01 Hz
   for a drift of 0.1 mV/h. The measured drift is correlated to leakage
   currents as well as temperature fluctuations and the inherent behaviour
   of the ISFET. A method for quality evaluation based on frequency
   behaviour is introduced. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights

Abstract = {{Interferometry that detects the phase of a beam reflected under surface
   plasmon resonance (SPR) has been developed for bio and chemical sensing.
   The conditions have been found, under which the phase reveals abrupt
   jumps in response to a minute increase in the effective thickness of a
   receptor layer that binds analyte particles on the sensor surface. This
   forms the basis for biosensing with sensitivity much higher as compared
   to traditional SPR sensors. Besides, SPR interferometry (SPRI) provides
   spatial resolution at the micron scale. The enhanced sensitivity
   attributed to the phase jump and interferometric imaging of variations
   of the phase over the surface are demonstrated, which open up new
   avenues for micro-array biosensing. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a characterization of structures fabricated by
   electrochemical etching in hydrofluoric acid (HF) using different types
   of initial pits. An initial pit has been thought to require a sharp tip
   in order to collect electronic holes generated by illumination.
   Therefore, the initial pits have been formed by etching in a KOH
   solution, which suffers from crystal orientation dependence. We
   successfully demonstrate the structures fabricated by the
   electrochemical etching with the initial pits, which have flat or round
   base. These pits are: formed by isotropic wet etching or reactive ion
   etching (RIE), which are free from crystal orientation of silicon
   substrate. Furthermore, regular hole patterns can be achieved without
   initial pits. This makes the electrochemical etching process mon simple.
   The electric field in the silicon is calculated and the calculated
   results support the experimental results. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

Abstract = {{In this work, it was found that exposure of TIN to ammonia (400 ppb-100
   ppm) in wet synthetic air at room temperature leads to a reversible
   decrease of Delta Phi. Then is a change of the work function of -30
   meV/decade of increasing ammonia concentration at room temperature. The
   response time (t(90)) to 1 ppm is less than or equal to 1 min. The
   sensitivity is a typical room temperature effect as it decreases at
   higher temperatures up to 100 degrees C. The reaction has a low cross
   sensitivity to humidity, as - first - the sensitivity to ammonia does
   not depend on the relative humidity and - second - the work function
   change due to humidity changes is as low as -2 meV for an increase of
   10\% in relative humidity. The Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier
   Transform Spectra (DRIFT-spectra) indicate that the adsorption of
   ammonia is correlated with a decrease of OH species on the surface. All

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the penetration of topical and
   oral ofloxacin into aqueous humor and vitreous humor in post-traumatic
   endophthalmitis model in rabbits. Methods: A standardized intraocular
   infection after penetrating injury was made in the right eyes of 16
   rabbits. Intraocular infection was induced by intravitreal injection of
   a suspension of Staphylococcus aureus. The intact left eyes were
   maintained as controls. The animals were divided randomly into two
   groups. (1) In the topical group, two drops of offloxacin 0.3\% eyedrops
   were instilled to both eyes every 30 min for 4 h. (2) In the
   topical-oral group, two doses of 25 mg/kg of ofloxacin at 12-h intervals
   were given orally, then the protocol of the first group was applied.
   Aqueous and vitreous humor samples were taken 30 min after the last
   drop. Ofloxacin concentrations were measured by using HPLC. Results:
   Mean aqueous levels of ofloxacin in control eyes were: 3.25 +/- 2.55 mu
   g/ml in topical group, 4.58 +/- 5.39 mu g/ml in topical-oral group. Mean
   aqueous levels in inflamed eyes were: 5.21 +/- 4.55 mu g/ml in topical
   group, 10.34 +/- 8.88 mu g/ml in topical-oral group. Mean vitreous
   levels of ofloxacin in control eyes were: 0.17 +/- 0.07 mu g/ml in
   topical group, 1.30 +/- 1.23 mu g/ml in topical-oral group. Mean
   vitreous levels in inflamed eyes were: 0.35 +/- 0.22 mu g/ml in topical
   group, 3.48 +/- 2.69 mu g/ml in topical-oral group. There was no
   significant difference among the groups (P > 0.05), however.
   Conclusions: The result of this study suggests that oral supplementation
   of ofloxacin to topical instillation increased the ocular levels of
   ofloxacin in the post-traumatic endophthalmitis model. Mean drug
   concentrations in aqueous and vitreous humors were above the 90\%
   minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC90) for most of the common
   microorganisms causing endophthalmitis in all eyes, except in the
   vitreous humors of the intact eyes instilled topically. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The majority of breast carcinomas show reduced or no expression of the
   transcription factor, HOXA5. Recently, we have shown that HOXA5 is a
   potent transactivator of p53 in breast cells and thus may affect the
   response of breast cancer cells to DNA damage. To determine whether
   HOXA5 played a role in growth and homeostasis in breast cells, we
   studied its interaction with the progesterone receptor. The progesterone
   receptor (PR) belongs to the superfamily of nuclear receptors whose
   members co-ordinate morphogenesis of the mammary gland in response to
   binding to their cognate ligands. An increased expression of the
   endogenous PR gene was seen in MCF-7 cells following induced expression
   of an exogenously transfected HOXA5 gene. HOXA5, but not HOXB4, -B5, or
   -B7 activated the PR promoter in two breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and
   Hs578T. Deletion and mutation analysis of the promoter identified a
   single HOXA5-binding site required for transactivation of the PR gene by
   HOXA5. HOXA5 binds directly to this site in the PR promoter. Thus, HOXA5
   may behave as a transcriptional regulator of multiple target genes, two
   among which are p53 and the progesterone receptor.}},

Abstract = {{Protease inhibitor 10 (PI10) is a member of the ovalbumin family of
   serine protease inhibitors (ov-serpin) that is expressed at elevated
   levels in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and chronic
   myelomonocytic leukemia. Based upon the ability of the related serpin
   plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-8) to protect cells against tumor
   necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha)-induced cell death, this study was
   initiated to investigate the potential cytoprotective activity of PI10,
   Two different expression systems (i.e. plasmids encoding either PI10
   alone or PI10 fused to the tag: enhanced green fluorescent protein,
   EG;FP) were utilized to stably transfect an eukaryotic model cell system
   (i.e. HeLa cells) that neither expresses PAI-2 nor PI10. The level of
   PI10 expression in the stable transfectants was found to correlate with
   their resistance to TNF alpha-induced cell death.
   Immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that PI10 is
   able to form SDS-stable complexes (i.e, M-r >100,000) with a cytosolic
   protein(s). Increased levels of the PI10-containing complexes can be
   detected by TNF alpha treatment by preventing intracellular degradative
   activities with the proteasome inhibitor
   N-carbobenzyloxy-leucine-leucine-norvalinal. PI10-containing complexes
   are dissociated with conditions known to separate classical
   protease-serpin complexes (i.e., 1.5 hz ammonium hydroxide in the
   presence of SDS). These data support a role for the regulation of
   intracellular protease activities by ov-serpins.}},

Abstract = {{We have used representational difference analysis (RDA) to identify
   up-regulated genes in skin fibroblasts from fibrotic lesions obtained
   from patients with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). RDA of cDNA
   libraries derived from fibroblasts from involved and uninvolved skin
   detected several differentially expressed genes. One such gene
   consistently up-regulated in scleroderma cells coded for human
   connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Other studies described here
   show that the CTGF protein is readily detected in cultures of systemic
   sclerosis fibroblasts but was not detected in comparable normal cells.
   High levels of CTGF are also evident in biological fluids from patients
   with systemic sclerosis, TGF ss stimulates CTGF production in both
   normal and systemic sclerosis fibroblasts with the latter found to be
   higher producers. Moreover, an analysis of constitutive and TGF
   ss-induced CTGF gene activation showed altered and elevated
   transcriptional responses in systemic sclerosis cells compared with
   controls. CTGF stimulated a two-to threefold increase in proal(I)
   collagen and fibronectin synthesis by both dermal and lung fibroblasts
   in culture and promoted significant matrix remodeling of
   fibroblast-populated three-dimensional collagen lattices. A direct
   relation between the overexpression of CTGF and elevated collagen
   synthesis was suggested by the observation that transfection of a
   CMV-CTGF cDNA construct and protein expression in fibroblasts increased
   the transcription of a Col 1 alpha 2 promoter-reporter construct to
   levels seen in systemic sclerosis fibroblasts. Using Col 1 alpha 2
   promoter deletion constructs the CTG;F responsive element was localized
   to the first 379 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. These
   data indicate that there is an overexpression of CTGF in the systemic
   sclerosis cells, probably due to increased gene transcription, and
   suggest that the dysregulation of CTGF production is an important factor
   in fibroblast activation and the excessive deposition of collagen in
   systemic sclerosis, (C) 2000 academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. To describe the reasons for, and rates of, hospital admissions for
   Pacific children, compared with Maori and `Other' (non Maori, non
   Pacific) children in Auckland over the six year period 1992 to 1997.
   Method. Analysis was carried out of the New Zealand National Health
   Information Service database for Auckland domiciled children to show
   diagnostic codes and hospital admission rates for 0-14 year old
   children, using the 1996 Census population as the denominator
   population. Age standardised rates were calculated using the `Other'
   group of children as the standard population.
   Results. All-cause admission rates were higher among Pacific Children,
   compared with Maori and `Other' children. Pacific Children were
   over-represented in admissions for acute respiratory infections,
   pneumonia and asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, compared
   with both Maori and `Other' children.
   Conclusion. Pacific children had the highest hospital admission rates,
   the main reason being preventable respiratory tract conditions. These
   findings suggest that Pacific children should be a priority group for
   intervention at various levels. Improvements in socio-economic
   circumstances, access to early primary health care and community
   education supported by comprehensive ambulatory paediatric services
   (particularly with respect to respiratory conditions) need to be
   implemented urgently. Qualitative research is needed to determine why
   ethnic differences exist and to identify effective interventions for

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. Epithelioid angiosarcoma (EA) is an uncommon neoplasm
   readily mistaken for carcinoma. In contrast to the histopathology of
   this tumor, the cytopathology as obtained using fine-needle aspiration
   (FNA) biopsy has rarely been described.
   METHODS. Three patients with histologically and immunohistochemically
   proven EA each underwent FNA using standard technique before surgical
   resection.
   RESULTS. Aspirate smears were obtained from 3 males (ages 47, 63, and 15
   years) each of whom presented with a solitary palpable soft tissue mass,
   1 from the left calf and 2 from the right popliteal region. No patient
   had a history of malignancy or had been exposed to prior radiation
   therapy. Smears were relatively hypocellular due to the dilutional
   effects of abundant blood. Cells were scattered on slides primarily in a
   single cell dissociated pattern; small aggregates were present in a
   fraction of the slides. Malignant cells generally monotonous in size and
   averaging three to four times the dimension of a mature lymphocyte had a
   rounded so-called epithelioid configuration. Cells possessed primarily
   rounded, single nuclei often eccentrically placed, with some
   anisokaryosis, and smooth nuclear borders. Binucleated cells with
   mirror-image nuclei were much less frequent, and cells with three or
   four nuclei were even more scarce. Cells contained large single nucleoli
   or more often multiple misshapen smaller nucleoli. Cytoplasm was
   abundant and finely granular in virtually all cells. In some, the
   cytoplasm acquired a central spheric density thus producing a
   ``rhabdoid{''} appearance that was only seen with air-dried Diff-Quik
   (Fisher Scientific, Biochemical Sciences, Inc., Swedesboro, NJ) stained
   smears. Mitoses were readily found. Immunostaining of the cell block in
   one case permitted a specific diagnosis of EA before subsequent surgical
   excision.
   CONCLUSIONS. Epithelioid angiosarcoma may display a rhabdoid morphology
   in FNA biopsy smears, and this cytopathology can closely mimic that of
   nonsmall carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and other epithelioid types of
   soft tissue tumors. Immunophenotyping is essential for definitive
   diagnosis. Cancer (Cancer Cytopathol) 2000;90:245-51. (C) 2000 American

Abstract = {{NF-kappa B plays a critical role in coordinating the control of gene
   expression during monocyte/macrophage activation. In this report we
   describe our investigation of the mechanisms of LPS-induced NF-kappa B
   activation and IL-12 expression in murine peritoneal suppressor
   macrophages. Treatment of these macrophages with LPS induced I kappa B
   alpha degradation and NF-kappa B activation. EMSAs demonstrated that
   NF-kappa B bound to a cis-acting element located in the murine IL-12 p40
   promoter. LPS signal transduction has been shown to involve a variety of
   signal pathways. The results in this paper indicate that LPS-induced
   NF-kappa B binding activity was independent of PKC, PHA, ERK, and p38
   MAPK, but was regulated by proteasome. Furthermore, Proteasome Inhibitor
   I abolished the LPS-induced mRNA expression of IL-12 p35 and p40, and
   SB203580 reduced these mRNA levels, whereas the blockade of PKC, PKA,
   and ERK had little effect. These data demonstrate that the LPS-induced

Abstract = {{In this paper the following formulation of the linear quadratic optimal
   control problem for dynamical systems in the behavioral setting is
   proposed: given a linear, time-invariant, and complete system, nd the
   set of trajectories of the system that optimize a quadratic-type cost
   function and that satisfy some linear static constraints. This
   formulation provides a unifying framework, where several generalized
   versions of the classical LQ optimal control can be stated and solved.
   The existence of solutions is rst discussed. It is shown that a
   necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of solutions may be
   obtained as a by-product of a reduction procedure translating the
   problem into an equivalent one of minimum complexity. Such a procedure
   is based on the theory of l(2)-systems in the behavioral setting. Once
   the complexity is reduced, a parametrization of the set of optimal
   solutions is obtained by employing a behavioral realization technique
   and a two-step optimization procedure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies various algorithmic issues in reconstructing a
   species tree from gene trees under the duplication and the mutation cost
   model. This is a fundamental problem in computational molecular biology.
   Our main results are as follows.
   1. A linear time algorithm is presented for computing all the losses in
   duplications associated with the least common ancestor mapping from a
   gene tree to a species tree. This answers a problem raised recently by
   Eulenstein, Mirkin, and Vingron {[}J. Comput. Bio., 5 ( 1998), pp.
   135-148].
   2. The complexity of finding an optimal species tree from gene trees is
   studied. The problem is proved to be NP-hard for the duplication cost
   and for the mutation cost. Further, the concept of reconciled trees was
   introduced by Goodman et al. and formalized by Page for visualizing the
   relationship between gene and species trees. We show that constructing
   an optimal reconciled tree for gene trees is also NP-hard. Finally, we
   consider a general reconstruction problem and show it to be NP-hard even
   for the well-known nearest neighbor interchange distance.
   3. A new and efficiently computable metric is defined based on the
   duplication cost. We show that the problem of finding an optimal species
   tree from gene trees is NP-hard under this new metric but it can be
   approximated within factor 2 in polynomial time. Using this
   approximation result, we propose a heuristic method for finding a
   species tree from gene trees with uniquely labeled leaves under the
   duplication cost. Our experimental tests demonstrate that when the
   number of species is larger than 15 and gene trees are close to each
   other, our heuristic method is significantly better than the existing
   program in Page's GeneTree 1.0 that starts the search from a random
   tree.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids and a-tocopherol
   supplementation on erythrocyte lipid peroxidation and immunocompetent
   cells in mice was studied comparatively using seven dietary oils (15\%
   oil/diet, w/w) including fish oil rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA,
   20:5, n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, n-3). A 43\% increase in
   spleen weight, about twice as many spleen cells and no change in the
   subpopulations of spleen cells, as well as a significant depression of
   mitogen-induced blastogenesis of both T and B cells in the spleen were
   observed in mice fed fish oil for 30 days in comparison with soybean oil
   diet-fed mice. In the fish oil diet-fed mice, membranous lipid
   hydroperoxide (hydroperoxides of phosphatidylcholine and
   phosphatidylethanolamine) accumulation as a marker of oxidative
   senescence in red blood cells (RBC) was 2.7-3.5 times higher than that
   in mice fed soybean oil, although there was no difference in the plasma
   phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide concentration. In spite of the
   supplementation of alpha-tocopherol to up to 10 times the level in the
   basal diet, the degeneration of spleen cells and the stimulated
   oxidative senescence of RBC found by the fish oil feeding could not be
   prevented. The results suggest that oral intake of excess
   polyunsaturated fatty acids, i.e. EPA and DHA, in a fish oil diet can
   lead to acceleration of membrane lipid peroxidation resulting in RBC
   senescence linked to the lowering of immune response of spleen cells,
   and that supplementation of alpha-tocopherol as antioxidant does not
   always effectively prevent such oxidative degeneration as observed in
   spleen cells and RBC in vivo. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Research into the protection of the human head calls for accurate
   modelling of both the protection system and the head. This study
   proposes a model incorporating both lumped parameters of the helmet and
   the head and their coupling during impact. The mechanical
   characteristics of the shell and of the helmet liner are determined by
   modal analysis and dynamic compression tests respectively. The coupling
   of these two components of the helmet is explored using numerical
   optimization methods based on impact tests which are also used to
   validate the model. A new dummy head, developed in a previous study and
   capable of simulating the relative brain-skull displacement was used in
   the parametric study of the helmet to optimize the density of the
   polystyrene liner. The ultimate purpose of the study is to devise
   methods of evaluating the protective aspects of the helmet and then to
   provide less-expensive methods for optimizing new products on the basis
   of biomechanical criteria. So far, the study has shown that the optimum
   density of the liner can be determined not only empirically but also
   theoretically. It has also shown that optimum helmet parameters depend
   on the mechanical properties of the dummy head used. (C) 2000 Academic

Abstract = {{For reaction centers of photosynthetic bacteria reconstituted with
   low-potential quinones in the QA site, the state P(+)Q(A)(-) formed by
   light activation decays to the ground state via a thermally activated
   route through the P+H- state. The rate of charge recombination by this
   thermal pathway is proportional to the equilibrium constant between
   P(+)Q(A)(-) and P+H-. Thus, the free energy difference between
   P(+)Q(A)(-) and P+H- can be determined by measuring the charge
   recombination rate via the uphill route. The enthalpy and entropy change
   of the reaction can then be deduced from the temperature dependence of
   the charge recombination kinetics. The free energy, entropy, and
   enthalpy changes between P(+)Q(A)(-) and P+H- were determined at
   temperatures from 40 to 318 K for several low-potential quinones. From
   200 K to room temperature, Delta H degrees approximate to Delta G
   degrees, so the entropy changes are small. However, in the temperature
   range 80-200 K, a significant entropy change is observed, and the free
   energy becomes strongly temperature-dependent. The newly formed
   P(+)Q(A)(-) State lives for milliseconds. On this time scale at low
   temperature, the P(+)Q(A)(-) State appears to be trapped prior to charge
   recombination in a state similar to 200 meV (10 K) higher in free energy
   than the relaxed form found at room temperature.}},

   gamma-alumina membranes was investigated as a function of re diameter,

   magnitude differences between experimental and theoretical diffusion
   rates for the membranes can be explained in terms of electrostatic
   interactions between the cations and the positively charged membrane
   surface. The rates of Am3+ and Tb3+ transport across the alumina
   membranes were greatly increased by raising the ionic strength from
   10(-3) to 0.1 M in both the feed and permeate solutions; however, EU3+
   diffusion rates were only slightly affected in this range of ionic
   strength. Trivalent cation transport rates at total salt concentrations
   greater than 0.1 M were slower than divalent cations due to enhanced
   electrostatic interactions between the alumina surface and the higher

   Ti-IV-transferrin by cancer cells: Understanding the mechanism of action
   of the anticancer drug titanocene dichloride}},

Abstract = {{The organometallic anticancer agent titanocene dichloride, Cp2TiCl2, is
   now in phase II clinical trials as an anticancer drug, but its mechanism
   of action is poorly understood. We show here that the interactions of
   Cp2TiCl2 with human serum transferrin (hTF) and that of Ti-2-hTF with
   adenosine triphosphate (ATP) have characteristics that could allow;
   transferrin to act as a mediator for titanium delivery to tumor cells.
   Such reactions may therefore be important to the anticancer activity of
   this new class of drugs. Cp2TiCl2 reacts rapidly with human
   apo-transferrin under physiological conditions (100 mM NaCl, 25 mM
   bicarbonate, and 4 mM phosphate, pH 7.4) with carbonate as a synergistic
   anion. The Cp ligands are released from the drug. Two-dimensional
   {[}H-1, C-13] NMR studies of epsilon-{[}C-13]Met-hTF show that Ti-IV
   loads the C-lobe first followed by the N-lobe and binds in the specific
   Fe-III sites. The protein conformational changes induced by Ti-IV appear
   to be similar to those induced by Fem. Carbonate can act as a
   synergistic anion in Ti-2-hTF but does not appear to be essential. A
   specific Ti-IV-hTF adduct is formed even in the absence of bicarbonate.
   When the pH of Ti-2-hTF solutions is lowered, no Ti-IV is released at
   the endosomal pH of ca. 5.0-5.5, but one Ti-IV dissociates between pH
   4.5-2.0. In contrast, in the presence of 1 mM ATP, all Ti-IV is readily
   released from both lobes when the pH is lowered from 7.0 to 4.5.
   Moreover, FeIII displaces Ti-IV rapidly from the C-lobe of Ti-2-hTF (<5
   min) but only slowly (days) from the N-lobe. Thus, the species
   FeCTiN-hTF might also provide a route for Ti-IV entry into tumor cells
   via the transferrin receptor. Ti-2-hTF effectively blocked cell uptake
   of radiolabeled Fe-59-hTF into BeWo cells, a human placental
   choriocarcinoma cell line in culture. These results imply that titanium
   transferrin might be recognized by the transferrin receptor and be taken
   up into cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{We present for a polyatomic reaction system a reaction-path Hamiltonian
   described with a reaction coordinate and quasirectilinear vibrational
   coordinates that are constructed from a nonlinear combination of
   curvilinear internal coordinates. To determine the vibrational
   coordinates we use a quasipotential-energy expression in which, in a
   Taylor-series expansion of the potential energy around the reaction
   path, the usual derivatives with respect to the internal coordinates are
   replaced by the corresponding covariant derivatives. The vibrational
   coordinates are determined so that (1) when the angular momentum is
   assumed to be zero, the respective expressions for the quasipotential
   energy and the kinetic energy have diagonal forms in the second-order
   terms and the first-order terms with respect to the vibrational
   coordinates in the internal configuration subspace perpendicular to the
   reaction path, and (2) the covariant second derivatives of the potential
   energy with respect to the vibrational coordinates coincide with the
   usual second derivatives. The reaction and vibrational coordinates
   determined presently not only are separated from rotations but are also
   invariant under the transformation of the original internal coordinates.
   The present reaction-path Hamiltonian is expected to be of advantage for
   obtaining an appropriate picture of the reaction-path dynamics under the
   zero-angular momentum assumption. (C) 2000 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the prognosis of patients with symptomatic
   intracranial atherosclerosis who fail antithrombotic therapy.
   Background: The outcome of patients with symptomatic intracranial
   atherosclerosis who fail antithrombotic therapy is unknown. These
   patients may represent the target group for investigation of more
   aggressive therapies such as intracranial angioplasty. Methods: The
   authors performed a chart review and telephone interview of patients
   with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis identified in the Stanford
   Stroke Center clinical database. A Cox regression model was created to
   identify factors predictive of failure of antithrombotic therapy. The
   authors generated Kaplan-Meier survival curves to determine the timing
   of recurrent TIA, stroke, or death after failure of antithrombotic
   therapy. Results: Fifty-two patients had symptomatic intracranial
   atherosclerosis and fulfilled entry criteria. Twenty-nine of the 52
   patients (55.8\%) had cerebral ischemic events while receiving an
   antithrombotic agent (antiplatelet agents {[}55\%], warfarin {[}31\%],
   or heparin {[}14\%]). In a Cox regression model, older age was an
   independent predictor of failure of antithrombotic therapy, and warfarin
   use was associated with a decrease in risk. Recurrent TIA (n = 7),
   nonfatal/fatal stroke(n = 6/1), or death (n = 1) occurred in 15 of 29
   (51.7\%) of the patients who failed antithrombotic therapy. The median
   time to recurrent TIA, stroke, or death was 36 days (95\% CI 13 to 59).
   Conclusions: Patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis who
   fail antithrombotic therapy have extremely high rates of recurrent
   TIA/stroke or death. Recurrent: ischemic events typically occur within a
   few months after failure of standard medical therapy. The high
   recurrence risk observed warrants testing of alternative treatment
   strategies such as intracranial angioplasty.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of the hydrophobic contact in the C-capping motif of
   the alpha-helix to the thermodynamic stability of the ubiquitin molecule
   has been analyzed. For this, 16 variants of ubiquitin containing the
   full combinatorial set of four nonpolar residues Val, Ile, Leu, and Phe
   at C4 (Ile30) and C `` (Ile36) positions were generated. The secondary
   structure content as estimated using far-UV circular dichroism (CD)
   spectroscopy of all but Phe variants at position 30 did not show notable
   changes upon substitutions. The thermodynamic stability of these
   ubiquitin variants was measured using differential scanning calorimetry,
   and it was shown that all variants have lower stability as measured by
   decreases in the Gibbs energy. Since in some cases the decrease in
   stability was so dramatic that it rendered an unfolded protein, it was
   therefore concluded that, despite apparent preservation of the secondary
   structure, the 30/36 hydrophobic contact is essential for the stability
   of the ubiquitin molecule. The decrease in the Gibbs energy in many
   cases was found to be accompanied by a large (up to 25\%) decrease in
   the enthalpy of unfolding, particularly significant in the Variants
   containing Ile to Leu substitutions. This decrease in enthalpy of
   unfolding is proposed to be primarily the result of the perturbed
   packing interactions in the native state of the lie --> Leu variants.
   The analysis of these data and comparison with effects of similar amino
   acid substitutions on the stability of other model systems suggest that
   ne --> Leu substitutions cannot be isoenergetic at the buried site.}},

   and electrochemical stability of azobenzene SAMs are highly related to
   the structural nature of the azobenzene alkanethiols. In particular, the
   longer the alkyl chains in the azobenzene alkanethiols, the more stable
   and closely packed are the monolayers. A potential-induced orientational
   switching of the terminal ethoxy group was observed for C2AzoC4S-Au,
   which is different from the intermolecular hydrogen-bonding ``fixed{''}
   alkyl chain below the azobenzene moiety.}},

Abstract = {{A computational bottleneck is often imposed by the volume of image data
   generated in disciplines such as remote sensing and medical imaging,
   especially in situations where automatic analysis or interpretation is
   required. Segmentation and classification tasks that utilize
   multivariate data can be impeded by this dimensionality. A
   general-purpose unsupervised image segmentation system is presented here
   for the automatic detection of image regions exhibiting different visual
   texture properties. A suboptimal feature selection procedure is proposed
   to automatically select the set of texture features best suited for the
   particular application. Results are presented for the segmentation of
   ground-penetrating radar images for generating automatic subsurface
   reports. The reduction in the size of the feature set both reduces the
   computation time and improves the accuracy. (C) 2000 American Institute

   the time evolution of damage formation and the evolution of gray-track

Abstract = {{We present a high-resolution millimetre interferometric image of the
   brightest SCUBA-selected galaxy from the Canada-UK Deep SCUBA survey
   (CUDSS). We make a very clear detection at 1.3 mm, but fail to resolve
   any structure in the source. The interferometric position is within 1.5
   arcsec of the SCUBA 850-mu m centroid, and also within 1.5 arcsec of a
   44-mu Jy radio source and a very faint, extremely red galaxy which we
   had previously identified as the submillimetre source. We also present
   new optical and infrared imaging, and infrared spectroscopy of this
   source. We model the overall spectral energy distribution and conclude
   that it lies within the redshift range 2 < z < 4.5. The
   submillimetre/far-infrared luminosity of CUDSS14A is very weakly
   dependent on redshift within the constrained range, and is roughly
   4x10(12) L. (for H-0=75 km s(-1) Mpc(-1) and an assumed Arp 220-like
   spectrum), which implies a star formation rate similar to 1000 M.
   yr(-1). We derive an approximate gas mass of similar to 10(10) M. which
   would imply that the current star-forming activity cannot be sustained
   for longer than about 10(7) yr. With the present data, however, we are
   unable to rule out a significant AGN contribution to the total
   luminosity.}},

Abstract = {{In a depleted lymphoid compartment, naive T cells begin a slow
   proliferation that is independent of cognate antigen yet requires
   recognition of major histocompatibility complex-bound self-peptides. We
   have followed the phenotypic and functional changes that occur when
   naive CD8(+) T cells undergo this type of expansion in a lymphopenic
   environment. Naive T cells undergoing homeostasis-driven proliferation
   convert to a phenotypic and functional state similar to that of memory T
   cells, yet distinct from antigen-activated effector T cells. Naive T
   cells dividing in a lymphopenic host upregulate CD44, CD122 (interleukin
   2 receptor beta) and Ly6C expression, acquire the ability to rapidly
   secrete interferon gamma, and become cytotoxic effecters when stimulated
   with cognate antigen. The conversion of naive T cells to cells
   masquerading as memory cells in response to a homeostatic signal does
   not represent an irreversible differentiation. Once the cellularity of
   the lymphoid compartment is restored and the T cells cease their
   division, they regain the functional and phenotypic characteristics of
   naive T cells. Thus, homeostasis-driven proliferation provides a
   thymus-independent mechanism for restoration of the naive compartment

Abstract = {{High systemic levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG) in OPG transgenic mice
   cause osteopetrosis with normal tooth eruption and bone elongation and
   inhibit the development and activity of endosteal, but not periosteal,
   osteoclasts. We demonstrate that both intravenous injection of
   recombinant OPG protein and transgenic overexpression of OPG in OPG(-/-)
   mice effectively rescue the osteoporotic bone phenotype observed in
   OPG-deficient mice. However, intravenous injection of recombinant OPG
   over a 4-wk period could not reverse the arterial calcification observed
   in OPG-/- mice. In contrast, transgenic OPG delivered from mid-gestation
   through adulthood does prevent the formation of arterial calcification
   in OPG(-/-) mice. Although OPG is normally expressed in arteries, OPG
   ligand (OPGL) and receptor activator of NF-kappa B (RANK) are not:
   detected in the arterial walls of wild-type adult mice. Interestingly,
   OPGL and RANK transcripts are detected in the calcified arteries of
   OPG(-/-) mice. Furthermore, RANK transcript expression coincides with
   the presence of multinuclear osteoclast-like cells. These findings
   indicate that the OPG/OPGL/RANK signaling pathway may play an important
   role in both pathological and physiological calcification processes.
   Such findings may also explain the observed high clinical incidence of
   vascular calcification in the osteoporotic patient population.}},

   calculated from the activation parameters showed the structural
   dependency. Thus, the rearrangement was facilitated in the order

   polymerisability of the allyl phenols due to the presence of substituent
   groups on the phenyl ring that can stabilise the free radical formed by

   The non-competitive NMDA antagonist MK-801 faciliates food intake in

   infused IM solution of sucrose (by 113+/-9 and 132+/-11\%, respectively)

   jugular vein infusion of MK-801 fails to increase sucrose intake but
   induces forward locomotion, indicating activation of a central
   mechanism. These data suggest that MK-801 can stimulate food intake by
   acting peripherally on hepatic vagal afferents. (C) 2000 Lippincott

   a specific deficit in dorsal stream function in autism. To examine the
   possibility of a neural basis for the perceptual and motor related
   abnormalities frequently cited in autism we tested 23 children diagnosed
   with autistic disorder, on two tasks specific to dorsal and ventral
   cortical stream functions. The results provide evidence that autistic
   individuals have a specific impairment in dorsal stream functioning. We
   conclude that autism may have common features with other developmental
   disorders and with early stages of normal development, perhaps

Abstract = {{The time and temperature-dependent changes in the structural properties
   of tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) films were accessed continuously
   by Raman spectroscopy. It has been found that a film of 70-nm thickness
   remains structurally stable after annealing in air at up to 300 degrees
   C for 4 h. Although some degree of graphitization was observed on a film
   annealed at 400 degrees C, the film begins to oxidize and lose thickness
   only after annealing at 500 degrees C for more than 2 h. This reflects
   the high thermal stability of the films. In general, annealing results
   in a narrowing and an upshifting of the G-band together with an increase
   in the I-D/I-G ratio. Most of these changes were observed during the
   first 2 h of annealing, after which the structure of the film appears to
   stabilize, with the exception at 500 degrees C in which the film
   deteriorates further as oxidation occurs. It was also observed that thin
   film has better thermal stability against graphitization than thick
   film. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The operational characteristics of ash-agglomerating fluidized bed
   gasifiers are analyzed through a simplified approach. Based on the
   simple theoretical analysis, true steady state operations in
   ash-agglomerating fluidized bed gasifiers require that the ash
   concentration in the bottom ash withdrawal be equal to the steady state
   ash concentration dictated by the kinetics of coal combustion and
   gasification, and other process variables in the fluidized bed
   gasifiers. There are only three steady state operational modes possible
   depending on the coupled effects of ash agglomeration rate and the
   particle separation efficiency of char and ash agglomerates. Without
   precise knowledge of the ash agglomeration rate, the combustion and
   gasification kinetics, and the rate and degree of particle separation
   between char and ash agglomerates, experimental trial and error is
   required to approach the true steady state. Locating the true steady
   state or the lack of it may seem unimportant in a pilot plant operation,
   where solids samples are obtained hourly so that correctional steps can
   be implemented quickly, its implication for the commercial operation can
   be serious. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.}},

   observed in a TPPS4 solution (pH 4.0), whereas reverse saturated
   absorption occurred for all pH values from 4.0 to 7.0 when BSA was added
   to TPPS4. The presence of BSA also initiates an increase in the
   saturation intensity and a reduction of the nonlinear absorption
   coefficient. The interpretation of the results based on the binding of
   TPPS4 to BSA is corroborated by linear absorption, fluorescence, light

   pump power and reveal the pump-power penalty incurred in implementing
   gain control with minimal transients to power disturbances. The effect
   on the transients of varying the laser cavity feedback coupling is also
   presented. Model accuracy is verified by the excellent quantitative
   agreement with dynamic measurements over a range of operating
   conditions. Results show how an increase in pump power can effectively
   suppress both the dynamic and the steady-state signal power transients

Abstract = {{The specific molecular interactions of alpha-helical peptide, human
   glucagon (i.e., intermolecular self-association and specific
   receptor-binding affinity) provided a rationale for using the glucagon
   as the fusion expression partner to achieve high productivity of foreign
   proteins both in vivo (in bacterial fusion-expression system) and in
   vitro (in affinity column chromatography). The fusion of glucagon
   peptide(s) effectively promoted homogeneous aggregate formation of
   recombinant proteins while avoiding intermolecular crosslinking by
   disulfide bridges. High sensitivity of the self-aggregation to sequence
   effects resulted from two distinct nonpolar domains of glucagon,
   determining specificity of molecular interaction and aggregate size of
   recombinant proteins. An N-terminal domain of glucagon molecule
   (Phe6-Tyr10-Tyr13) could be a certain hydrophobic moiety involved in
   intermolecular self-association (probably, via helix-helix docking),
   while a C-terminal domain (Phe22-Trp25-Leu26) seems to critically affect
   the oligomer size in the off-pathway aggregation of synthesized fusion
   proteins. An N-terminal extracellular domain of human glucagon receptor
   was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli, immobilized to a
   chromatography column, and efficiently renatured to a conformation that
   attains high specificity in interaction with N-terminus glucagon
   molecules of recombinant fusion proteins. Through column chromatography
   employing the receptor fragment as affinity ligand, the recombinant
   proteins were efficiently purified from total intracellular proteins,
   and the long-term ligand stability was evidently proven through multiple
   cyclic-purification experiments. Major scaffolds for using protein
   ligands are large-scale production in a low-cost expression system and
   long-term stable operation with selective-binding affinity. From this
   point of view, the extracellular fragment of human glucagon receptor
   used in this study seems to be a new potent ligand for fusion
   protein-based affinity chromatography. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

   analysis of (CO)-C-13 J = 5 --> 4 and J = 1 --> 0 suggests that the gas
   temperatures in the northern part of OMC-1. (north of Delta delta =
   -20') are similar to 45 K and are, on average, at least 20 K higher than
   those to the south. The average (CO)-C-13 column density is log
   (N/cm(-2)) = 16.4 +/- 0.3 and is fairly constant throughout the cloud,
   even in the low-temperature region south of BN/KL. LVG modeling of the
   {[}C I] emission shows a typical C-0 column density of 2 x 10(17)
   cm(-2), which yields a C/CO abundance ratio in the cloud of similar to
   0.1 (rising to levels in excess of 0.5 at the cloud edges). Comparison
   of the Delta-variance (which measures spatial structure in a manner
   similar to a power spectrum) of the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy

Abstract = {{The implementation and application of a portable fiber-coupled trace-gas
   sensor for the detection of several trace gases, including CO2, CH4, and
   H2CO, are reported. This particular sensor is based on a cw
   fiber-amplified near-infrared (distributed Bragg reflector) diode laser
   and an external cavity diode laser that are frequency converted in a
   periodically poled lithium niobate crystal to the mid-IR spectroscopic
   fingerprint region (3.3-4.4 mu m). A continuous absorption spectrum of
   CH4 and H2CO from 3.37 to 3.10 mu m with a spectral resolution of 40 MHz
   (similar to 0.0013 cm(-1)) demonstrated the spectral performance that
   can be achieved by means of automated wavelength tuning and phase
   matching with stepper motor control. Autonomous long-term detection of
   ambient CO2 and CH4 over a 3- and 7-day period was also demonstrated.

   largely failed in its role as an advocate of the health of the

Abstract = {{The forging of spur gears has been investigated by means of upper-bound

   spur gears has been newly proposed; especially, a neutral surface has
   been introduced into the forging of gears by using hollow billets with a
   flat punch. The half pitch of the gear has been divided into seven
   deformation regions. By using the kinematically admissible velocity
   field, the power requirements and suitable conditions for the forging of
   spur gears were successfully calculated by a numerical method. As a
   result, (i) for reducing the forging load, the use of a hollow billet is
   more effective than a solid billet; (ii) for increasing the dimensional
   accuracy of forged gears, punch with a mandrel is desirable; (iii) the
   radius of the neutral surface and the inner radius approach zero as the
   height reduction increases; (iv) a suitable number of teeth for the
   forging of a spur gear was found to be between 15 and 20; (v) for the

Abstract = {{Rho family GTPases play roles in cytoskeletal organization and cellular
   transformation. Tiam1 is a member of the Dbl family of guanine
   nucleotide exchange factors that activate Rho family GTPases. These
   exchange factors have in common a catalytic Dbl homology and adjacent
   pleckstrin homology domain. Previous structural studies suggest that the
   pleckstrin domain, a putative phosphoinositide-binding site, may serve a
   regulatory function. We identified ascorbyl stearate as a compound that
   binds to the pleckstrin domain of p120 Ras GTPase-activating protein.
   Furthermore, ascorbyl stearate appears to be a general pleckstrin domain
   ligand, perhaps by mimicking an endogenous amphiphilic ligand. Tiam1
   nucleotide exchange activity was greatly stimulated by ascorbyl
   stearate. Certain phosphoinositides also stimulated Tiam1 activity but
   were less potent than ascorbyl stearate. Tiam1 contains an additional
   N-terminal pleckstrin domain, but only the C-terminal pleckstrin domain
   was required for activation. Our results suggest that the pleckstrin
   domains of Dbl-type proteins may not only be involved in subcellular
   localization but may also directly regulate the nucleotide exchange
   activity of an associated Dbl homology domain. In addition, this paper
   introduces ascorbyl stearate as a pleckstrin domain ligand that can
   modulate the activity of certain pleckstrin domain-containing proteins.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents an experimental and theoretical study of MAO-silica
   interaction. Several adsorption farms and proposed final species of MAO
   on silica support are considered. The reaction of
   silica-methylaluminoxane is thought to occur with OH from the surface,
   with CH4 evolution due to the reaction of the CH3 groups of MAO. Two
   forms of MAO are considered: linear and non-linear, taking account of
   the latest experimental evidence regarding MAO structures. It is known
   that nonextractable TMA remains from the preparation step in MAO.
   Therefore, TMA is considered in the modelling. The CH4 evolution was
   evaluated with chromatographic techniques during the preparation step of
   the support MAO-pre-treated silica. Silica was pre-treated at 300
   degrees degrees C before use. The conclusion of this work is that OH
   from a silica surface reacts with MAO and probably with TMA during the
   MAO treatment. The most probable final species is one where the MAO
   molecule is fixed to the surface by several points, mainly in a linear
   form. TMA would be associated to MAO on the surface when MAO{*}TMA is
   supported. The reaction of TMA with the surface would be possible when
   MAO{*}TMA is supported.}},

Abstract = {{From Li+ well-solvating solvents or complex ligands such as THE
   {[}12]crown-4, amines etc., lithium cuprates R2CuLi((LiX)-Li-.)
   crystallise in a solvent-separated ion pair (SSTP) structural type (e.g.
   10). In contrast, solvents with little donor qualities for Lit such as
   diethyl ether or dimethyl sulfide lead to solid-state structures of the
   contact ion pair (CIP) type (e.g. II). H-1,Li-6 HOESY NMR investigations
   in solutions of R2CuLi((LiX)-Li-.) (15, 16) are in agreement with these
   findings: in THF the SSIP 18 is strongly favoured in the equilibrium
   with the CTP 17 and in diethyl ether one observes essentially only the
   CLP 17 Salts LiX (X = CN, Cl, Br, I, SPh) have only a minor effect on
   the ion pair equilibrium. These structural investigations correspond
   perfectly with Bertz's logarithmic reactivity profiles (LRPs) of
   reactions of R2CuLi with enones in diethyl ether and THF, the faster
   reaction in diethyl ether is due to the predominance of the CIP 17 in
   this solvent, which is the reacting species: in THF only little CIP 17
   is present in a fast equilibrium with the SSIP 18. A kinetic analysis of
   the LRPs quantifies these findings. Recent quantum-chemical studies are
   also in agreement with the CIP 17 being the reacting species. Thus a
   uniform picture of structure and reactivity of lithium cuprates emerges.}},

Title = {{Local inhibitory effects of dynorphin A-(1-17) on capsaicin-induced

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{402}},

Month = {{AUG 18}},
Abstract = {{Although dynorphin A-(1-17) has been characterized in vitro as a high
   efficacy kappa-opioid receptor agonist, functional studies of dynorphin
   A-(1-17) following central or systemic administration indicate the
   involvement of both opioid and non-opioid components. The aim of this
   study was to investigate whether local administration of
   dynorphin-related analogs can attenuate capsaicin
   (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide)-induced nociception and what type of
   opioid receptor mediates the local action of dynorphin A-(1-17) in
   monkeys. Capsaicin (100 mu g) was used to evoke a nociceptive response,
   thermal allodynia, which was manifested as a reduced tail-withdrawal
   latency in normally innocuous 46 degrees C warm water. Co-administration
   of dynorphin A-(1-17) (0.3-10 mu g) with capsaicin in the tail
   dose-dependently inhibited thermal allodynia; however, both non-opioid
   fragments dynorphin A-(2-17) (10-300 mu g) and dynorphin A-(2-13)
   (10-300 mu g) were ineffective. Local antiallodynia of dynorphin
   A-(1-17) was antagonized by a small dose (100 mu g) of an opioid
   receptor antagonist, quadazocine, applied s.c. in the tail. Pretreatment
   with a selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine
   (nor-BNI), s.c. 320 mu g in the tail also reversed local antiallodynia
   of dynorphin A-(1-17). Both locally effective doses of antagonists, when
   applied s.c. in the back, did not antagonize local dynorphin A-(1-17),
   indicating that peripheral kappa-opioid receptors selectively mediated
   the local action of dynorphin A-(1-17) in the tail. In addition, a much
   larger dose of dynorphin A-(1-17) (1000 mu g), when administered s.c, in
   the back or i.m. in the thigh, did not cause sedative or diuretic
   effects. These results suggest that in vivo opioid actions of
   dynorphin-related peptides can be differentiated locally in this
   procedure. They also indicate that local application of peptidic ligands
   may be a useful medication for localized pain. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

   types, as well as in normal vessels associated with wound healing and

   injury in an embolic model in rats. Tiagabine, injected at 1 h after
   embolization, significantly reduced brain infarction volume, measured
   with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) histological assay. There
   were varying degrees of neuroprotective effect exhibited in the other
   experimental groups however this did not reach significance. These
   results suggest that tiagabine is neuroprotective when administrated at
   an early period after the ischemic brain injury. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We have devised and implemented in PrISM (protein informatics system for
   modeling) a new measure of protein structural relationships, the protein
   structural distance (PSD). The PSD is designed to describe relationships
   between protein structures in quantitative rather than descriptive terms
   and is applicable both when two structures are very similar, and when
   they are very different. It is calculated with a structural alignment
   procedure that uses double dynamic programming to align secondary
   structure elements and an iterative rigid body superposition that
   minimizes the root-mean-square deviation of C-alpha atoms. The alignment
   algorithm, as implemented on a modest workstation, is computationally
   efficient, allowing for large-scalestructural comparisons. PSD scores
   for more than one and a half million pairs of proteins were calculated
   and compared to the discrete classification of proteins in the SCOP
   database. The PSD scores, which were obtained automatically, are in
   large part consistent with the manually derived classifications in SCOP.
   Discrepancies do arise, however, due, in part, to the fact that SCOP
   uses criteria other than structural similarity to derive classifications
   while the PrISM procedure is exclusively structure based. Analysis of
   PSD scores suggests that there is a continuous aspect of protein
   conformation space, even though various classification schemes are
   extremely useful. The use of a continuous measure for structural
   distance between all pairs of proteins allows us, as described in the
   two accompanying papers to derive sequence/structure relationships in a
   more quantitative way than has previously been possible. An important
   strength of the approach implemented in PrISM is its ability to address
   many different kinds of queries interactively, making its structural
   comparison procedure a convenient computational tool that complements
   structural classification databases such as SCOP and CATH. (C) 2000

   from the systematic combination of the three minima associated with the
   flexible dihedral angles phi, psi, and chi(1) The energies of the
   resulting minima were computed at the MP2/6-31+G(d) level. Selected
   minima were used as starting points for geometry optimization at the
   MP2/6-31+G(d) level. The conformational behavior of this compound was
   markedly different from that of the model dipeptides composed of common

Abstract = {{The aggregation patterns of sodium taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC) and
   tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) in an isotonic sodium chloride solution are
   investigated by frontal chromatography on Sephadex G-10 columns at 298.2
   K and are quantitatively analyzed on the basis of stepwise aggregation
   models. The micellar aggregation numbers, critical micelle
   concentrations (cmc's), stepwise aggregation constants, and micelle size
   distributions of TCDC and TUDC are determined and compared to those of
   sodium taurocholate and taurodeoxycholate. The logarithms of gel-water
   partition coefficients, dimerization constants, and reciprocal cmc
   values for the four bile salts exhibit linearity with their hydrophobic
   molecular surface areas, and the slopes are close to that of the
   logarithms of reciprocal cmc values against the hydrophobic molecular
   surface areas of lecithins. This fact shows that the gel adsorption,
   dimerization, and micellization of bile salts are driven mainly by
   hydrophobic interactions and that the Small model for the micellization
   of bile salts is better than models based on hydrophilic interactions.
   The micelle of TUDC grows less cooperatively than that of TCDC, an
   epimer of TUDC. This result suggests that the 7 beta-hydroxyl group of
   TUDC inhibits micellar growth because of increased intermolecular
   mismatching contact with the hydrophobic surface and decreased
   intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the micelle.}},

Abstract = {{Mycobacterium tuberculosis claims more human lives each year than any
   other bacterial pathogen. Infection is maintained in spite of acquired
   immunity and resists eradication by antimicrobials(1,2). Despite an
   urgent need for new therapies targeting persistent bacteria, our
   knowledge of bacterial metabolism throughout the course of infection
   remains rudimentary. Here we report that persistence of M. tuberculosis
   in mice is facilitated by isocitrate lyase (ICL), an enzyme essential
   for the metabolism of fatty acids(3,4). Disruption of the icl gene
   attenuated bacterial persistence and virulence in immune-competent mice
   without affecting bacterial growth during the acute phase of infection.
   A link between the requirement for ICL and the immune status of the host
   was established by the restored virulence of Delta icl bacteria in
   interferon-gamma knockout mice. This link was apparent at the level of
   the infected macrophage: Activation of infected macrophages increased
   expression of ICL, and the Delta icl mutant was markedly attenuated for
   survival in activated but not resting macrophages. These data suggest
   that the metabolism of M. tuberculosis in vivo is profoundly influenced
   by the host response to infection, an observation with important
   implications for the treatment of chronic tuberculosis.}},

Abstract = {{Transient absorption signal delayed by a magnitude of 100 mu s with
   respect to the exciting laser shot is observed after UV laser flash
   photolysis of degassed benzene, acetone, and acetonitrile solutions of
   an interface probe complex, i.e., gold(I) complex
   {[}\{Au{[}P(C6H4OMe-p)(3)]\}(2)-(mu-C=C)]
   ({[}mu-ethynylene-bis\{tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-phosphine\}gold]). Chemical
   reactions leading to the transient absorbance change are confirmed to be
   occurring at the solid-liquid interface, and the delay time is believed
   to arise from the photogenerated intermediate species in the bulk
   solution crossing the diffusion layer, which ultimately undergo
   interfacial reactions resulting in the observed transient absorbance
   change. The delay time is suggested as a direct measure for the
   thickness of the diffusion layer. The thickness of the diffusion layer
   around 0.2 mu m, estimated by this method, is comparable to that from
   the sonovoltammetric study. Oscillations in transient absorbance
   kinetics are also observed, which can be attributed to the coupling
   between the interfacial chemical reactions and a photoacoustic effect;
   oscillation due to a single physical process arising from the schlieren
   effect under certain condition is also discussed. Similar transient
   phenomena are observed in another luminescent complex, i.e., a
   hexanuclear Cu(I) cluster Cu-6(t-NS)(6) (t-NS =
   4-tert-butylpyridine-2-thiolate). The characterization of the
   photochemical reaction processes of the Cu(I) complex by means of
   transient absorbance difference spectra reveals that a consecutive
   biphotonic ionization process occurs after the laser flash. The
   intermediate species with a lifetime of 65 mu s responsible for the
   interfacial reaction is tentatively assigned as a charge separation
   pair. A reaction scheme involving surface-assisted ionization of the
   charge separation pair is proposed to account for the coupling between
   the interfacial chemical reaction and the photoacoustic effect.}},

Abstract = {{The extent of physico-chemical changes induced by irradiation of
   cefazolin sodium was investigated. The methods used were potency
   determination, impurity profile, colour measurements and pH
   measurements. The potency of irradiated samples at 25 kGy was 4 +/- 2\%
   lower than that of the non irradiated ones. The total amount of related
   substances increased from 0.72 +/- 0.01\% in the non irradiated samples
   to 4.9 +/- 0.7\% in the samples irradiated at 25 kGy. Most of the peaks
   showed trace amounts (< 0.01\%), the largest one represented 1.2 +/-
   0.5\% of the total related substances. Only two peaks were identified by
   chromatography: the methyl-1,2,3-thiazol-2 thiol-5 and the
   7-aminocephalosporanic acid. The latter related substance is only
   produced by the irradiation of cefazolin sodium. The pH values of the
   samples were within the specifications of the European Pharmacopoeia.
   The colour of the cefazolin sodium powder changed from white to yellow
   upon irradiation. The yellow colour persisted after the dissolution of
   the powder. Most of the tests carried out met the Pharmacopoeia's
   specifications, except the one concerning the colour of the solution.

Abstract = {{The key to understanding the link between climate variability and the
   biosphere are feedbacks of the ocean and land surfaces to atmospheric
   variability. Generalizations of the Hasselman random forcing model
   continue to provide a framework for much of the observed climate
   variability. Zero dimension ocean-atmosphere and land-atmosphere coupled
   models reveal the timescales of mutual adjustment and hence the
   amplitude of variability for a given forcing. The coupling in both
   models introduces longer timescales than in any uncoupled model and
   hence illustrates how the coupled systems act to amplify climate
   variability. The common feature of both models is a quantity that is
   conserved between the surface and the atmosphere. For the
   atmosphere-ocean model, this is energy, whereas for the atmosphere-land
   model, the conserved quantity is water. These conservative quantities
   represent the projection of climate variability onto the slowest system
   mode, an inference that readily generalizes to modes of climate
   variability with spatial structure and hence they provide a useful focus
   for diagnosis of observations and complex model simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Size-resolved aerosol mass and gas concentrations were measured during
   the European Arctic Aerosol Study (EAAS). A thermodynamic equilibrium
   model was applied to the data in order to (1) test whether gas-aerosol
   equilibrium appeared to be obtained by NH3, HNO3, HCl, HCOOH, and
   CH3COOH, and (2) test the sensitivity of gas-aerosol equilibrium to
   several nonvolatile organic acids that were measured. Model results
   indicated that all submicrometer, accumulation-mode aerosols appeared to
   be near equilibrium with NH3. Supermicrometer, coarse-mode aerosols of
   recent marine origin appeared to be out of equilibrium with HNO3 and
   closer to equilibrium with HCl, while continentally influenced aerosols
   sometimes appeared to be near equilibrium with both HNO3 and HCl.
   However, the observed gas-aerosol partitioning of HCOOH and CH3COOH
   could not be explained by effective Henry's law partitioning, consistent
   with other studies. Nonvolatile organic acids measured were
   methanesulfonate, oxalate, succinate, and glutarate. Sensitivity tests
   indicated that methanesulfonate retained similar to 30\% of NH4+ under
   marine conditions but had <3\% impact on other species and under other
   conditions. Whereas oxalic acid was predicted to be similar to 15-30\%
   dissociated in the aerosol solution, succinic and glutaric acids were
   predicted to be <10\% dissociated, limiting their ability to influence
   gas aerosol partitioning. Together, the three dicarboxylic acids were
   responsible for retaining 0-2\% of predicted NH4+ and displacing 0-6\%
   of predicted Cl- and NO3-. Model results were sensitive to the assumed
   mixing state of the aerosols, as well as the degree of aerosol size
   resolution represented by the model.}},

Abstract = {{Firms naturally want to hire workers who are fast-learners and committed

   hiring to do using a ``careful{''} but expensive agency. Agencies may
   provide discounts to firms who do most of their hiring through them.
   Workers differ in their learning curve and in their (random) length of
   stay in the job/firm. We provide sufficient conditions for using only
   one agency. We also explore the relations between turnover and
   productivity, which at times turn out to be quite counterintuitive. For
   example, reduced turnover may adversely effect productivity even in the
   presence of learning with experience. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{During the past four years, a substantial amount of structural
   information has been accumulated on the molybdoenzyme dimethyl sulfoxide
   (DMSO) reductase from purple bacteria. This enzyme contains a
   mononuclear Mo coordinated by two molybdopterin guanine dinucleotides as
   its single cofactor. Crystallographic studies on the enzyme from
   Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodobacter capsulatus revealed substantial
   differences in the Mo coordination environment in the oxidized Mo(VI)
   state, despite a close structural similarity in the overall fold of the
   protein. The crystal structure of DMSO reductase from R. sphaeroides
   identified a Mo environment with a mono-ore Ligation and an asymmetric
   coordination by the two molybdopterins, with three short and one very
   long Mo-S bond. In contrast, two independent crystallographic studies of
   the enzyme from R. capsulatus revealed two additional Mo coordination
   environments: a pentacoordinated dioxo metal ligation sphere in which
   one molybdopterin is completely dissociated from the Mo and a
   heptacoordinated environment with symmetrical metal coordination by both
   molybdopterins and two oxo ligands. In all three structures the side
   chain of a serine was a ligand to the Mo. Adding to the controversy,
   EXAFS studies on the R. sphaeroides enzyme suggested a hexacoordinated
   active site geometry, whereas the same technique indicated seven ligands
   for the R. capsulatus enzyme. The 1.3 Angstrom resolution crystal
   structure of oxidized DMSOR from R. sphaeroides presented here reveals
   plasticity at the active site. The Mo is discretely disordered and
   exists in a hexacoordinated and a pentacoordinated ligation sphere. The
   hexacoordinated model reconciles the existing differences in active site
   coordination of R. sphaeroides DMSO reductase as studied by
   crystallographic and EXAFS techniques. In addition, the pentacoordinated
   structure closely resembles one of the reported R. capsulatus crystal
   structures. In retrospect, the active site geometry in the previously
   reported 2.2 Angstrom crystal structure of R, sphaeroides DMSO reductase
   appears to represent an average of the two conformations described here.
   Thus, structural flexibility at the active site appears to give rise to
   the observed differences in the Mo coordination environment.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple realizations of the 1969-1998 time period have been simulated
   by the GISS AGCM to explore its responsiveness to accumulated forcings,
   particularly over sensitive agricultural regions. A microwave radiative
   transfer postprocessor has produced the AGCM lower tropospheric,
   tropospheric, and lower stratospheric brightness temperature (T-b) time
   series for correlations with microwave sounding unit (MSU) time series.
   AGCM regional surface air temperature and precipitation were also
   correlated with GISTEMP temperature data and with rain gage data. Seven
   realizations by the AGCM were forced solely by observed sea surface
   temperatures. Subsequent runs hindcast January 1969 through April 1998
   with an accumulation of forcings: observed sea surface temperatures
   (SSTs), greenhouse gases, stratospheric volcanic aerosols, stratospheric
   and tropospheric ozone, and tropospheric sulfate and black carbon
   aerosols. Lower stratospheric T-b correlations between the AGCM? and the
   MSU for 1979-1998 reached as high as 0.93 globally given SST, greenhouse
   gases, volcanic aerosol, and stratospheric ozone forcings,
   Midtropospheric T-b correlations reached as high as 0.66 globally and
   0.84 across the equatorial, 20 degrees S-20 degrees N band. Oceanic
   lower tropospheric T-b correlations were less high at 0.59 globally and
   0.79 across the equatorial band. Of the sensitive agricultural areas
   considered, Nordeste in northeastern Brazil was simulated best with
   midtropospheric T-b correlations up to 0.80. The two other agricultural
   regions, in Africa and in the northern midlatitudes, suffered from
   higher levels of non-SST-induced variability. Zimbabwe had a maximum
   midtropospheric correlation of 0.54, while the U.S. Corn Belt reached
   only 0.25. Hindcast surface temperatures and precipitation were also
   correlated with observations, up to 0.46 and 0.63, respectively, for
   Nordeste. Correlations between AGCM and observed time series improved
   with addition of certain atmospheric forcings in zonal bands but not in
   agricultural regions encompassing only six AGCM grid cells.}},

Abstract = {{Bromobenzene (BB) and furosemide (FS) are two hepatotoxicants whose
   bioactivation to reactive intermediates is crucial to the development of
   liver injury. However, the events which lead to hepatocellular toxicity
   following metabolite formation and covalent binding to cellular
   macromolecules remain unknown. The present study was undertaken to
   investigate the effect of administered BE and FS on mitochondrial total
   glutathione (GSH + GSSG, henceforth referred to as glutathione) content
   and respiratory function as potential initiating mechanisms of the
   hepatotoxicity of these compounds in the mouse. Bromobenzene (2 g/kg
   i.p.) significantly decreased mitochondrial glutathione to 48\% of
   control at 3 h post administration, and to 41\% at 4 h. This decrease in
   mitochondrial glutathione was subsequent to a significant decrease in
   cytosolic glutathione to 64 and 28\% of control at 1 and 2 h,
   respectively. Oxygen consumption supported by complex I
   (glutamate-supported) of the respiratory chain was not inhibited by BE
   until 4 h, where state 3 (active) respiration was reduced to 16\% of
   control. This resulted in a decreased respiratory control ratio (RCR)
   for complex I-supported respiration. Complex II (succinate)-supported
   state 3 and state 4 respiration were unaffected by BE until 4 h, at
   which time they were reduced to 57 and 48\% of control, respectively.
   However, the similar reductions in state 3 and state 4 respiratory rates
   did not alter the corresponding RCR for complex II. Overt hepatic injury
   was detected at 4 h, with plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity
   increasing significantly at this time point. In contrast to the effects
   of BE, FS administration (400 mg/kg i.p.) did not alter mitochondrial or
   cytosolic glutathione, and had no effect on respiration supported by
   complex I or II for up to 5 h following dosing. However, ALT activity
   was significantly increased 5 h following FS administration. These
   results suggest that inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory function
   coinciding with a decrease in mitochondrial glutathione content may be
   crucial to the initiation of BE-induced hepatotoxicity, while such
   events are not required for the initiation of FS-induced hepatotoxicity.

Abstract = {{One class of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs),
   AUF1/hnRNP D, consists of four isoform proteins (p45, p42, p40, and p37)
   which are generated by alternative splicing. The present study was
   therefore undertaken to clarify any isoform-specific differences in
   terms of their functions and nucleocytoplasmic localization. All
   isoforms primarily localized in the nucleus. However, heterokaryon
   analysis and a study using RNA polymerase II inhibitor revealed that
   p40/p37 exhibited a continuous shuttling between the nucleus and
   cytoplasm, Constant nuclear retention activity was mapped to the
   p45/p42-specific sequence at the C-terminal region, which is retained by
   alternative splicing. Using this domain as a probe, we performed a yeast
   two-hybrid screening and me found that scaffold attachment factor B
   (SAF-B), a nuclear matrix-associated protein, exhibits protein-protein
   interaction to this region, Colocalization of p45/p42 and SAF-B was
   observed as a speckle in the nucleus, Interestingly, p45/p42 isoforms
   appeared to act as a negative regulator in gene expression by forming a
   complex with SAF-B, Thus, the present study revealed that the
   isoform-specific functions of AUF1/hnRNP D are defined by intracellular
   shuttling capacity (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Title = {{First steps in analysing NHS waiting times: avoiding the `stationary and

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the effect of excluding
   incomplete observations and competing events when calculating
   cross-sectional measures of NHS waiting times, and to obtain a more
   accurate estimate of the `time-to-admission' of those listed on NHS
   waiting lists using lifetable methods. The official
   `times-since-enrolment' of all elective `admissions' in England, 1 July
   to 31 December 1994 inclusive, were extracted from Hospital Episode
   Statistics. The official `times-to-census' of all those on a waiting
   list in England at 30 September 1994 were obtained from aggregated KH07
   data. The percentage waiting at least three months, at least six months
   etc., was calculated separately for each data set and compared with a
   period lifetable derived from the combined data. The cumulative
   likelihood of elective admission is markedly overestimated across the
   whole range of waiting times. The experience of those still waiting,
   those removed from the list, those suspended or deferred and those put
   to the back of the queue is not taken into account in the calculation of
   official waiting times. The Department of Health currently presents the
   `time-since-enrolment' of those admitted as though it indicates how long
   all patients can expect to wait for admission. The consequent bias in
   published summary statistics incorrectly quantifies the real experience
   of patients. It is recommended that calculation of waiting times from
   KH07 census counts and Hospital Episode Statistics be reconsidered in
   the light of what patients, clinicians, managers and politicians need to
   know about treatment delay. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Heparan sulfate sulfamidase (HSS) is a lysosomal exohydrolase that, when
   deficient, results in intralysosomal accumulation of heparan sulfate and
   the clinical phenotype of Sanfilippo syndrome type A. The first animal
   disease homolog of human Sanfilippo syndrome type A has been recently
   indentified in Dachshund littermates. To identify the molecular defect,
   the nucleotide sequences of the normal canine HSS gene and cDNA were
   determined using PCR-based approaches. The coding region showed 87\%
   nucleotide homology, and 89\% amino acid sequence homology, with human
   HSS. All exon-intron borders were conserved. Sequence analysis of the
   entire coding region with exon-intron boundaries was performed in the
   propositus, a healthy littermate, and six unrelated normal dogs.
   Comparison revealed a 3-bp deletion, 737-739delCCA, resulting in the
   loss of threonine at position 246 in both alleles of the propositus and
   in one allele of a healthy littermate. Prediction of the
   three-dimensional structure of canine HSS, based on homology with human
   arylsulfatases A and B, suggested the pathogenic effect of this
   deletion. Six other sequence variations in exons, and 10 in introns,
   appear to be benign polymorphisms. This study supports the potential
   development of a canine model of Sanfilippo syndrome type A to evaluate
   gene therapy for this disorder, (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Jurkat leukemia cells induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with an
   antibody against the Pas receptor have two annexin V (AV)-binding
   subpopulations: (a) single-positive cells that bind AV but not propidium
   iodide Bn; and (b) double-positive cells that bind AV and PI. The
   single-positive population is thought to represent an early stage of
   apoptosis. We have examined the relationship between AV binding and a
   classical characteristic of apoptosis, DNA fragmentation. Time course
   studies with Jurkat cells treated for 1, 2, or 4 h with anti-Fas
   indicated that the proportion of AV-binding cells was increased after 2
   h, A significant increase in DNA fragmentation was observed only at 4 h
   as measured by the mean tail moment determined with the alkaline single
   cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. This correlation suggests a
   temporal relationship between the two parameters, but does not provide
   direct evidence of what happens in individual cells. We developed a
   method to measure fluorescent markers of cellular structure or function
   with a laser scanning cytometer and then perform the comet assay on the
   same cells. Cells in each AV-binding subpopulation were re-examined
   before and after electrophoresis, Most AV(-)/PI- cells had no DNA
   damage, although a few cells showed a pattern of damage characteristic
   for apoptosis, Double-positive cells all had damaged DNA; approximately
   half had the apoptotic pattern, and the rest had a pattern typical for
   necrosis, Nearly all of the single-positive cells had damaged DNA with
   the apoptotic pattern, Both AV-positive populations contained cells with
   little or no detectable DNA after electrophoresis, indicating that the
   DNA was highly fragmented, These results indicate that AV binding is an
   excellent marker for apoptotic cells, but that these cells already have
   fragmented DNA.}},

Abstract = {{The unprecedented growth of Internet Protocol (IP) traffic is leading
   Internet Service Providers and network operators worldwide to
   investigate architectural alternatives for cost effective, reliable,
   scalable and flexible multi-terabit IP backbones. In this paper, several
   overlay, service and transport layer networking architectures, which
   employ IP, multiprotocol label switching, synchronous optical
   network/synchronous digital hierarchy and dense wavelength division
   multiplexing technologies, are proposed and analysed. Multiple
   parameters, such as network capacity, cost, restoration strategy,
   reconfigurability and accommodation of pre-emptable traffic; are
   considered for the architectural comparison. Detailed network design and
   economic analysis are provided for the different alternatives
   considering a typical nationwide US backbone with projected IP traffic
   in ca. 3 years. Several sensitivity analysis results are also shown, to
   evaluate the effect of cost changes in some of the critical
   technological factors in these architectures, such as 10 Gb s(-1) optics
   cost or IP router cost. The results show the value of transport layer
   networking architectures for multi-terabit IP backbones, and how, when
   compared with service layer architectures, they provide additional
   desirable features such as wavelength reconfigurability and restoration
   scalability.}},

Abstract = {{The Lambert W is a transcendental function defined by solutions of the
   equation W exp(W) = x. For real values of the argument, x, the
   W-function has two branches, W-0 (the principal branch) and W-1 (the
   negative branch). A survey of the literature reveals that, in the case
   of the principal branch (W-0), the vast majority of W-function
   applications use, at any given time, only a portion of the branch viz.
   the parts defined by the ranges -1 less than or equal to W-0 less than
   or equal to 0 and 0 less than or equal to W-0. Approximations are
   presented for each portion of W-0, and for W-1. It is shown that the
   present approximations are very accurate with relative errors down to
   around 0.02\% or smaller. The approximations can be used directly, or as
   starting values for iterative improvement schemes. (C) 2000 IMACS.

Abstract = {{A simplified methodology for development of calibrations for binary
   powder mixtures using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is presented. It
   is demonstrated that multivariate calibration can be performed using
   only a small calibration dataset of two to five samples. The intrinsic
   heterogeneity of the powder mixtures at the sample size effectively
   measured using standard fibre-optic probes prevents the assignment of a
   true reference content value to each obtained spectrum. Instead, the
   nominal mixture content of the sample is used as reference value. To
   obtain a spectrum more representative of each sample, a mean spectrum is
   computed from several spectra collected from different sample
   sub-fractions. Two principally different powder mixtures were used in
   this study: one composed of two fine powders (d<300 mu m) and the other
   mixture composed of one fine (d(50)=170 mu m) and one coarse (d(50)=590
   mu m) powder. In the case of mixing fine powders, the calibration model
   is obtained by PLS regression using two PLS components after spectral
   data pre-treatment with multiplicative signal correction (MSC).
   Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the powder content variation
   determined by NIR is wavelength dependent due to the dependence of
   effective sample size on radiation wavelength.
   In the case of mixing one fine and one coarse powder, the large
   difference in particle size between the two powder components cause a
   non-linear X-Y relationship, which can be handled by means of spectral
   averaging and a non-linear (QPLS) regression. In both cases, the first
   PLS loading vector was interpreted as describing the difference between
   the spectra of the two pure components. The presented methodology should
   be useful for applications of NIR spectroscopy in processes involving
   powder mixtures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Galectin-1, S-type beta-galactosyl-binding lectins present in vertebrate
   and invertebrate species, are dimeric proteins that participate in
   cellular adhesion, activation, growth regulation, and apoptosis, Two
   high-resolution crystal structures of B. arenarum galectin-1 in complex
   with two related carbohydrates, LacNAc and TDG, show that the
   topologically equivalent hydroxyl groups in the two disaccharides
   exhibit identical patterns of interaction with the protein. Groups that
   are not equivalent between the two sugars present in the second moiety
   of the disaccharide, interact differently with the protein, but use the
   same number and quality of interactions.
   The structures show additional protein-carbohydrate interactions not
   present in previously reported lectin-lactose complexes. These contacts
   provide an explanation for the enhanced affinity of galectin-1 for TDG
   and LacNAc relative to lactose, Galectins are in dimer-monomer
   equilibrium at physiological protein concentrations, suggesting that
   this equilibrium may be involved in organ-specific regulation of
   activity. Comparison of B. arenarum with other galectin-1 structures
   shows that among different galectins there are significant changes in
   accessible surface area buried upon dimer formation, providing a
   rationale for the variations observed in the free-energies of
   dimerization.
   The structure of the B, arenarum galectin-1 has a large cleft with a
   strong negative potential that connects the two binding sites at the
   surface of the protein. Such a striking characteristic suggests that
   this cleft is probably involved in interactions of the galectin with
   other intra or extra-cellular proteins. Proteins 2000;40:378-388. (C)

Abstract = {{Glucocorticoids (GCs) are potent anti-inflammatory agents that block
   cytokine production. We investigated whether GCs also block cytokine
   signaling via the Janus kinase (Jak)-signal transducer and activator of
   transcription (STAT) pathway. Dexamethasone inhibited IL-2-induced DNA
   binding, tyrosine phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation of Stat5 in
   primary T cells. Inhibition of Stat5 correlated with inhibition of
   expression of IL-2-inducible genes and T cell proliferation, The
   mechanism of inhibition involved suppression of IL-2 receptor and Jak3
   expression. Signaling by IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15, which use IL-2 receptor
   components, also was inhibited. indicating a block in T cell responses
   similar to that seen in immunodeficient patients lacking the IL-2
   receptor gamma chain or Jak3, IL-2 signaling also was blocked in
   patients after treatment with GCs, suggesting that inhibition of
   cytokine signaling contributes to the clinical efficacy of these agents.
   These results identify inhibition of lak-STAT signaling by IL-2 and
   related cytokines as a novel mechanism of GC action and suggest that
   inhibition of both cytokine production and signaling contribute to their
   therapeutic potency.}},

   Design-Retrospective study.
   Animals-29 cats confirmed to have severe sepsis at necropsy.
   Procedure-Pertinent history, physical examination findings, and results
   of hematologic and biochemical testing were extracted from medical
   records.
   Results-Clinical diagnoses included pyothorax, septic peritonitis,
   bacteremia secondary to gastrointestinal tract disease, pneumonia,
   endocarditis, pyelonephritis, osteomyelitis, pyometra, and bite wounds.
   Physical examination findings included lethargy pale mucous membranes,
   poor pulse quality, tachypnea, hypo- or hyperthermia, signs of diffuse
   pain on abdominal palpation, bradycardia, and icterus. Clinicopathologic
   abnormalities included anemia, thrombocytopenia, band neutrophilia,
   hypoalbuminemia, low serum alkaline phosphatase activity, and
   hyperbilirubinemia. Necropsy findings included multiorgan necrosis or
   inflammation with intraiesional bacteria.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results suggest that severe sepsis in
   cats is characterized by lethargy, pale mucous membranes, signs of
   diffuse abdominal pain, tachypnea, bradycardia, weak pulses, anemia,
   hypoalbuminemia, hypothermia, and icterus. Recognition of this

Abstract = {{Crystals of cytochrome bos ubiquinol oxidase from E. coli diffract
   X-rays to 3.5 Angstrom and the structure determination is in progress.
   The limiting factor to the elucidation of the structural detail is the
   quality of the crystals; the diffraction spots from the crystals are
   diffused which leads to difficulties in processing the data beyond 4.0
   Angstrom. Weak protein-protein contacts within the crystal lattice is
   assumed to be the cause of this problem. To improve these contacts, we
   have introduced protein Z to the C-terminal end of the subunit IV of
   cytochrome bo(3) and expressed both proteins as a single fusion. We have
   successfully obtained crystals of this fusion protein. The spot shape
   problem has clearly been solved in the crystals of the fusion protein
   although further optimization is necessary to obtain higher resolution.

Abstract = {{Departmental status for geriatrics offers many advantages, all of which
   are related to strengthening academic and clinical programs in aging.
   The training programs and the content of medical school curriculum in
   geriatrics remain inadequate under the current structures. A department
   of geriatrics can provide a stronger faculty base and allow effective
   interaction with other departments (including but not limited to
   internal medicine) that need geriatric training.
   A department of geriatrics also focuses on a model of care that involves
   working closely with other disciplines, such as nursing and social work.
   This interdisciplinary model helps expert providers work efficiently
   throughout the spectrum of care, strengthening continuity. The
   department can include other medical specialists, such as family
   practitioners, psychiatrists, and physiatrists, who work with caregivers
   and patients throughout a course of treatment to manage chronic illness
   and help maintain and enhance function and independence as long as
   possible.
   Comprehensive care and proper care management also substantially benefit
   institutions by expanding the patient population, reducing length of
   stay, and avoiding unnecessary hospitalization of older patients through
   effective discharge planning and transitional care. This requires strong
   relationships with long-term care providers, a characteristic strength
   of geriatricians.
   Although not all research in aging needs to be housed in a department of
   geriatric medicine, the presence of a critical mass of basic and
   clinical researchers creates an environment that can stimulate new
   initiatives and attract external funding. Additional research bridging
   basic translational and clinical phases relevant to the elderly
   population is best encouraged by maintaining relationships with other
   basic science and clinical departments.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},

Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{A slow-rolling scalar field (Q=quintessence) with potential energy
   V(Q)similar to(3 x 10(-3) eV)(4) has been proposed as the origin of an
   accelerating universe at present. We investigate the effective potential
   of Q in the framework of a supergravity model including the quantum
   corrections induced by generic (nonrenormalizable) couplings of Q to the
   gauge and charged matter multiplets. It is argued that the Kahler
   potential, superpotential, and gauge kinetic functions of the underlying
   supergravity model are required to be invariant under the variation of Q
   with an extremely fine accuracy in order to provide a workings
   quintessence potential. Applying these results for string or M theory,
   we point out that the heterotic M theory or type-I string axion clin be
   a plausible candidate for quintessence if (i) it does not couple to the
   instanton number of gauge interactions not weaker than those of the
   standard model and (ii) the modulus partner Re(Z) of the periodic
   quintessence axion Im(Z)=Im(Z)+1 has a large vacuum expectation value:
   Re(Z)similar to(1/2 pi)ln(m(3/2)(2)M(Planck)(2)/V-Q). It is stressed
   that such a large Re(Z) gives the gauge unification scale at around the
   phenomenologically favored value 3 x 10(16) GeV. To provide an
   accelerating universe, the quintessence axion should be near the top of
   its effective potential at present, which requires severe fine tuning of
   the initial condition of Q and (Q)over dot in the early universe. We
   discuss a late time inflation scenario based on the modular and CP
   invariance of the moduli effective potential, yielding the required
   initial condition in a natural manner if the Kahler metric of the
   quintessence axion superfield receives a sizable nonperturbative
   contribution.}},

Title = {{The low-affinity monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 is adapted to the
   export of lactate in highly glycolytic cells}},
Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{350}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{219-227}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Transport of lactate and other monocarboxylates in mammalian cells is
   mediated by a family of transporters, designated monocarboxylate
   transporters (MCTs). The MCT4 member of this family has recently been
   identified as the major isoform of white muscle cells, mediating lactate
   efflux out of glycolytically active myocytes {[}Wilson, Jackson, Heddle,
   Price, Pilegaard, Juel, Bonen, Montgomery, Hutter and Halestrap (1998)J.
   Biol. Chem. 273, 15920-15926]. To analyse the functional properties of
   this transporter, rat MCT4 was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and
   transport activity was monitored by flux measurements with radioactive
   tracers and by changes of the cytosolic pH using pH-sensitive
   microelectrodes. Similar to other members of this family,
   monocarboxylate transport via MCT4 is accompanied by the transport of H+
   across the plasma membrane. Uptake of lactate strongly increased with
   decreasing extracellular pH, which resulted from a concomitant drop in
   the K-m value. MCT4 could be distinguished from the other isoforms
   mainly in two respects. First, MCT4 is a low-affinity MCT: for L-lactate
   K-m values of 17+/-3mM (pH-electrode) and 34+/-5mM (flux measurements
   with L-{[}U-C-14]lactate) were determined. Secondly, lactate is the
   preferred substrate of MCT4. K-m values of other monocarboxylates were
   either similar to the K-m value for lactate (pyruvate,
   2-oxoisohexanoate, 2-oxoisopentanoate, acetoacetate) or displayed much
   lower affinity for the transporter (beta-hydroxybutyrate and short-chain
   fatty acids). Under physiological conditions, rat MCT will therefore
   preferentially transport lactate. Monocarboxylate transport via MCT4
   could be competitively inhibited by alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate,
   phloretin and partly by 4,4'-di-isothiocyanostilbene- 2,2'-disulphonic
   acid. Similar to MCT1, monocarboxylate transport via MCT4 was sensitive
   to inhibition by the thiol reagent p-chloromercuribenzoesulphonic acid.}},

Journal = {{CANCER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{The mutant epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) has
   been found on gliomas and other tumors but not on normal tissues,
   including those that express the wild-type receptor. Monoclonal
   antibodies (mAbs) specific for EGFRvIII are rapidly internalized and
   degraded after binding to EGFRvIII-expressing cells. If anti-EGFRvIII
   mAbs are to be useful for radioimmunotherapy, then methods for trapping
   radionuclides in target cells after mAb processing are required, Because
   lysosomes are known to retain positively charged molecules, we have
   evaluated a new reagent for this purpose that uses a polycationinc
   peptide composed of D-amino acids (D-Lys-D-Arg-D-Tyr-D-Arg-D-Arg;
   D-KRYRR). D-KRYRR was first labeled using Iodogen and then coupled to
   the murine anti-EGFRvIII mAb L8A4 via maleimido bond formation in 60\%
   yield. In vitro assays with the U87 Delta EGFR cell line indicated that
   internalized and total cell-associated activity for the I-125-labeled
   D-KRYRR-L8A4 conjugate were up to 4 and 5 times higher, respectively,
   than for L8A4 labeled with I-131 using Iodogen, Paired-label comparisons
   in athymic mice with s,c, U87 Delta EGFR xenografts demonstrated up to
   5-fold higher tumor uptake for mAb labeled using D-KRYRR. Higher levels
   of radioiodine activity also were observed in kidney when L8A4 was
   labeled using KRYRR. Another paired-label study directly compared L8A4
   labeled using radioiodinated D-KRYRR and L-KRYRR, and confirmed the role
   of D-amino acids in enhancing tumor uptake. These results suggest that
   D-KRYRR is a promising reagent for the radioiodination of internalizing
   mAbs, such as the anti-EGFRvIII mAb L8A4.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental and theoretical results of Mg-doped superlattices
   consisting of uniformly doped AlxGa1-xN, and GaN layers are presented.
   Acceptor activation energies of 70 and 58 meV are obtained for
   superlattice structures with an Al mole fraction of x=0.10 and 0.20 in
   the barrier layers, respectively. These energies are significantly lower
   than the activation energy measured for Mg-doped bulk GaN. At room
   temperature, the doped superlattices have free-hole concentrations of
   2x10(18) cm(-3) and 4x10(18) cm(-3) for x=0.10 and 0.20, respectively.
   The increase in hole concentration with Al content of the superlattice
   is consistent with theory. The room temperature conductivity measured
   for the superlattice structures is 0.27 S/cm and 0.64 S/cm for an Al
   mole fraction of x=0.10 and 0.20, respectively. X-ray rocking curve data
   indicate excellent structural properties of the superlattices. We
   discuss the origin of the enhanced doping, including the role of the
   superlattice and piezoelectric effects. The transport properties of the
   superlattice normal and parallel to the superlattice planes are
   analyzed. In particular, the transition from a nonuniform to a uniform
   current distribution (current crowding) occurring in the vicinity of
   contacts is presented. This analysis provides a transition length of a
   few microns required to obtain a uniform current distribution within the
   superlattice structure. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Background: Dysfunction of serotoninergic transmission could predispose
   to excessive alcohol consumption and dependence, The functional
   polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) has been
   associated with different disorders, including alcoholism Considering
   the likelihood of heterogeneity in the ``alcohol dependence{''}
   phenotype, 5-HTTLPR may be more specifically implicated in subsamples of
   patients or in related traits of alcoholism, such as impulsivity,
   Methods: We analyzed the role of this functional polymorphism in the
   risk for suicide attempt in a population of male alcohol-dependent
   subjects. One hundred ten male alcohol-dependent patients (DSM-III-R
   criteria), French for at least two generations, were personally
   interviewed with the Diagnostic Interview for Generic Studies and
   compared with 61 unaffected blood donors.
   Results: The ``short{''} (S) allele of the 5-HTTLPR appeared to be
   unrelated to alcohol dependence and comorbid depression in our sample,
   bur was found associated with an increased risk for suicide attempts.
   This association was predominantly observed in severe and repetitive
   suicide attempts, with a significant dose effect of the S allele (0, 1,
   or 2) on the number and the severity of suicide attempts.
   Conclusions: Mood disorders and alcohol dependence may interact with a
   genetic (relative) deficiency in serotonin reuptake, thereby increasing
   the risk for aggressive/impulsive behaviors such as suicide attempts.

Abstract = {{Stochastic precipitation generators can produce synthetic daily rainfall
   series with statistical characteristics similar to those of historical
   data. Typically, parameters of precipitation generators have been fit
   using all historical data for a given period. This approach, however,
   fails to capture differences in the precipitation process associated
   with an El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signal. Stochastic
   precipitation generators conditioned on the ENSO phase were developed to
   address this problem. Precipitation models with a range of
   parameterization schemes were tested in six locations in central-eastern
   Argentina and western Uruguay (southeastern South America), an important
   agricultural region with a clear ENSO precipitation signal in
   October-March. Conditional precipitation models (occurrence, intensity,
   or both) were superior to simple models in 24 of the 36 locations/
   months analyzed. Graphic diagnostics showed that conditional occurrence
   models successfully captured differences in the number and persistence
   of wet days among ENSO phases. Similarly, conditional intensity models
   improved noticeably the agreement between theoretical and empirical
   distributions of daily rainfall amounts. Conditional precipitation
   generators can be linked to other process models (e.g., crop models) to
   derive realistic assessments of the likely consequences of ENSO-related
   variability. Conditional stochastic precipitation generators, therefore,
   can be useful tools to translate ENSO forecasts into likely regional
   impacts on sectors of interest.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. Experimental design.
   Objectives. To examine the influence of pain reduction after facet joint
   injections on isokinetic back muscle performance
   Summary of Background Data. Methods for evaluating the effect of facet
   joint injections vary. Recent studies based their results solely on the
   patient's subjective opinion and suggest a need for more objective,
   concrete, and reliable measurements.
   Methods. Eighty-seven patients with a degenerative low back disorder (49
   women and 38 men; mean age, 48 years; range, 22-79) who had facet joint
   injections as a part of preoperative evaluation participated; The mean
   duration of symptoms was 12.3 years (range, 1-45). The patients
   underwent isokinetic trunk flexor and extensor muscle strength testing
   at angular velocities of 60 deg/sec and 120 deg/sec. They perform two
   tests before the facet joint injections(to eliminate learning effect);
   All patients had bilateral facet joint injections at L5-S1. Those who
   did not report pain relief had additional injections at L4-L5. The
   flexion-extension test was repeated 15 minutes after each injection.
   Pain and fear were registered on visual analog scales,
   Results. All 87 patients could perform the isokinetic tests. For
   extension at deg/sec, a significant improvement was found between the
   two pretests (P < 0.05). Pain increased significantly from the first to
   the second pretest (P = 0.02); and a significant decrease in pain was
   found after the first injection (P = 0.0001) Fear decreased between each
   test, with a significant decrease after the first injection. No
   significant change was found for the muscle strength measurements after
   facet joint anesthesia, There were only weak correlations between
   decrease in pain and alteration in muscle performance, ranging from 0.06
   to 0.37.
   Conclusion. Pain reduction after facet joint injections did not
   influence isokinetic muscle performance in patients with degenerative
   low back disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Background Recent reports suggest that hypertension may be less common
   after simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation than after kidney
   transplantation alone. However, the mechanisms for this beneficial
   effect have not been delineated. We hypothesize that lower blood
   pressures may result from chronic volume depletion in patients with
   bladder-drained pancreatic allografts,
   Methods. We compared the incidence and severity of hypertension 12
   months after transplantation in 79 bladder-drained pancreas-kidney
   recipients and 46 diabetic kidney-only recipients. These two groups were
   compared with a smaller group of enterically drained pancreas-kidney
   recipients. Blood pressure was also compared before and after surgical
   conversion from bladder to enteric drainage in 10 patients.
   Results. Hypertension was significantly less common and less severe
   after pancreas-kidney transplantation than after kidney transplantation
   alone, but the benefit of the pancreas transplant was evident only in
   bladder-drained patients, Logistic regression analysis of the
   bladder-drained pancreas-kidney patients confirmed the independent
   impact of the pancreatic allograft on the presence of hypertension,
   indicated an independent association with serum creatinine concentration
   and donor age, but suggested no correlation with recipient age, race, or
   number of rejection episodes. A comparison of blood pressures before and
   after pancreatic conversion from bladder to enteric drainage indicated
   no significant change in the prevalence or severity of hypertension,
   Conclusions. We conclude that the beneficial effect of a pancreas
   transplant on the prevalence and severity of hypertension after
   simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation is limited to
   bladder-drained patients. Although it is possible that the effect is
   mediated by chronic volume depletion, the observation that blood
   pressure does not increase after conversion from bladder to enteric
   drainage suggests that other factors may be involved.}},

Abstract = {{The foaming behaviour of liquorice extract was investigated using

   Results suggest that concentration had a significant effect (P less than

   with concentration and whipping time. However, the effect of whipping
   time on O was less pronounced. Foam stability was enhanced with the
   increase in concentration. The foam decay rate was observed to be mainly
   dependent on the concentration of sample (P less than or equal to 0.01)
   and decreased with the increase in concentration. The effect of whipping

   or close to the membrane moiety. There is one Cys residue in the single
   TM segment of beta-subunit (H beta). Previously, the crosslinking
   products containing the beta-subunit and two fragments of alpha-subunit
   (the N-terminal containing H1-H2 helices and the C-terminal containing
   H7-H10 helices) have been identified in experiments with membrane-bound
   or detergent-solubilized preparations of the membrane moiety of
   trypsin-digested Na,K-ATPase {[}Sarvazyan, N. A., Modyanov, N. N., and
   Askari, A. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 26528-26532 and Sarvazyan, N. A.,
   Ivanov, A., Modyanovl N. N., and Askari, A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272,
   7855-7858]. Here, we have shown that Cu2+-phenanthroline treatment of
   digitonin-solubilized preparation provides the most efficient formation
   of intersubunit cross-linked product that is predominantly a dimer of
   beta-subunit and a 22-kDa C-terminal alpha-fragment containing H7 -H10
   helices. This cross-linked product was isolated and subjected to CNBr
   cleavage. The resulting fragments were electrophoretically separated and
   sequenced. A 17-kDa peptide composed of ne853-Met932 alpha-fragment and
   AIa5-Met56 beta-fragment was identified as a product of intersubunit
   disulfide cross-link between Cys44 of H beta and either Cys911 or
   Cys930, located in H8. This provides the first direct experimental
   evidence of the juxtaposition of HP and H8 within the Na,K-ATPase
   molecule. The second detected cross-linked product was composed of
   ct-fragments Lys947-Met963 and Tyr974-Tyr1016 linked by induced
   disulfide bridge between Cys964 (H9) and Cys983 (H10). The spatial
   proximity of these Cys residues defines the mutual orientation of H9 and
   H10 helices of alpha-subunit.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a novel method to study the neurochemical nature of a
   specific neuronal pathway by using conjugated WGA-apoHRP as a retrograde
   tracer and non-isotopic in situ hybridization histochemistry to examine
   the expression of mRNA. The technique was developed to eliminate the
   reduction of retrograde tracer during the rigorous procedures involved
   in in situ hybridization. The tracer was injected stereotaxically into
   the brainstem of Macaca fascicularis monkeys. Sections through the
   central nucleus of the amygdala were processed for the visualization of
   the retrogradely transported WGA-apoHRP-gold using a silver enhanced
   reaction, followed by cion radioactive in situ hybridization for the
   mRNA encoding glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67). Numerous retrogradely
   labeled cells were observed in the central nucleus of the amygdala.
   Comparison of double-labeled sections with sections processed for the
   retrograde tracer alone indicated that there was relatively little loss
   of the retrograde tracer during the in situ hybridization processing.
   This method provides a relatively simple and reliable tool to study the
   molecular phenotype of identified projection neurons. (C) 2000 Published

Abstract = {{Humans encounter and form memories for multiple types of experiences
   that differ in content, novelty, and memorability. Critical for
   understanding memory is determining (1) how the brain supports the
   encoding of events with differing content and (2) whether neural regions
   that are sensitive to novelty also influence whether stimuli will be
   subsequently remembered. This event-related functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) study crossed content (picture/word), novelty
   (novel/repeated), and subsequent memory (remembered/forgotten) to
   examine prefrontal and temporal lobe contributions to encoding. Results
   revealed three patterns of encoding-related activation in anatomically
   connected inferior prefrontal and lateral temporal structures that
   appeared to vary depending on whether visuospatial/visuoobject,
   phonological/lexical, or semantic attributes were processed. Event
   content also modulated medial temporal lobe activity; word encoding
   predominately activated the left hemisphere, whereas picture encoding
   activated both hemispheres. Critically, in prefrontal and temporal
   regions that were modulated by novelty, the magnitude of encoding
   activation also predicted whether an event would be subsequently
   remembered. These results suggest that (1) regions that demonstrate a
   sensitivity to novelty may actively support encoding processes that
   impact subsequent explicit memory and (2) multiple content-dependent
   prefrontal-temporal circuits support event encoding. The similarities
   between prefrontal and lateral temporal encoding responses raise the
   possibility that prefrontal modulation of posterior cortical
   representations is central to encoding.}},

Abstract = {{A new protein, salmorin, that inhibits fibrinogen clotting was purified
   to homogeneity from the snake venom of Agkistrodon halys brevicaudus.
   Salmorin was characterized to be a heterodimeric protein composed of 15
   kDa and 14 kDa subunits. Purified salmorin inhibited not only
   thrombin-induced fibrinogen clotting but also factor Xa-induced
   prothrombin activation. Experimental evidence indicated that the
   hetero-dimeric protein does not bind to the thrombin catalytic site but
   binds to thrombin and prothrombin exosites. Analyses of the cDNA
   sequences encoding the two separate polypeptide chains revealed that the
   mature subunits are composed of 131 and 122 amino acids, respectively.
   In the isolated cDNAs, N-termini of both chains are preceded by
   hydrophobic signal peptides of 23 residues. The deduced amino acid
   sequence exhibited considerable identity with other snake venom C-type
   lectin-like proteins derived from various snake venoms. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Transient expression of the maize streak geminivirus virion-sense
   proteins V1 and V2 (movement protein, MP, and coat protein, CP,

   inter- and intracellular movement. Bombardment of a construct directing
   expression of a V1:green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion product
   resulted in significantly increased spread of fluorescence from the
   bombarded cell to adjacent cells compared to that obtained following
   expression of free GFP. A mutant V1:GFP fusion product exhibited
   markedly less movement than the V1:GFP protein. Thus, the MSV V1 protein
   moves from cell to cell in the absence of other viral proteins. However,
   V1:GFP did not localize to plasmodesmata in maize or tobacco leaves
   although a tobacco mosaic virus MP:GFP fusion protein was shown to do so
   in tobacco. The CP:GFP fusion product targeted exclusively to the
   nucleus and did not move from cell to cell or exit the nucleus when
   expressed alone. When coexpressed with V1, some CP:GFP fluorescence was
   seen at the cell periphery in a proportion of cells, but in no case was
   cell-to-cell movement of CP:GFP detected. The likely roles of V1 and CP
   in MSV movement are discussed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Using reflectivity measurements from the Total Ozone Mapping
   Spectrometer (TOMS), we show that over the months when stratocumulus
   clouds are prominent off the Peru Coast, the ultraviolet (UV)
   reflectance of two marine sites is consistently higher than that of the
   surroundings. The regions of reflectivity enhancement coincide with
   large anthropogenic sulfate aerosol emission sources, and the magnitude
   of the enhancement has a strong seasonal dependence that is related to
   the seasonal cloud movement. We propose the indirect aerosol effect as a
   plausible explanation for the reflectivity observations.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was conducted to compare the structure and properties
   of conventional and so-called ``high-crystallinity{''} (hcr)

   latter that are responsible for its superior thermal and mechanical
   performance. Moreover, structure-properties relationships of her PP
   blends with metallocene-catalyzed, linear low-density polyethylene
   (mLLDPE) were compared with those of conventional PP/mLLDPE blends. In
   Part 1, relationships between rheological behavior (viscosity and melt
   density) and thermal (transition temperatures and level of
   crystallinity) and mechanical properties (impact strength and Young's
   modulus) were analyzed with reference to composition. The rheological
   and MDSC tests showed that both types of the blends were miscible at the
   processing temperatures, whereas immiscible in the solid state and in
   vicinity of the PP melting point. It was found that the improved
   mechanical properties and the extraordinary high crystallization
   temperature of her PP land, correspondingly, her PP/mLLDPE blends) are
   not due to the assumed high level of crystallinity but due to alteration
   of internal structure of this polypropylene. (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{We report the results of nb initio molecular-dynamics simulations of
   liquid GaxAs1-x alloys at five different concentrations, at a
   temperature of 1600 K, just above the melting point of GaAs. The liquid
   is predicted to be metallic at all concentrations between x=0.2 and
   x=0.8, with a weak resistivity maximum near x=0.5, consistent with the
   Faber-Ziman expression. The electronic density-of-states is finite at
   the Fermi energy for all concentrations: there is, however, a
   significant pseudogap especially in the As-rich samples. The Ga-rich
   density-of-states more closely resembles that of a free-electron metal.
   The partial structure factors show only a weak indication of chemical
   short-range order. There is also some residue of the covalent bonding
   found in the solid, which shows up in the bend-angle distribution
   functions of the liquid state. Finally, the atomic diffusion
   coefficients at 1600 K are calculated to be 2.1 X 10(-4) cm(2)/s for Ga
   ions in Ga0.8As0.2 and 1.7 x 10(-4) cm(2)/s for As ions in

Abstract = {{Major histocompatibility class I-peptide tetramer technology and simian
   immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac)-infected rhesus monkeys were
   used to clarify the distribution of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
   virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in secondary lymphoid
   organs and to assess the relationship between these CTL and the extent
   of viral replication in the various anatomic compartments. SIVmac Gag
   epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells were evaluated in the spleen, bone
   marrow, tonsils, thymus, and 5 different lymph node compartments of 4
   SIVmac-infected rhesus monkeys. The average percentage of CD8(+) T
   lymphocytes that bound this tetramer in all the different lymph node
   compartments was similar to that in peripheral blood lymphocytes in
   individual monkeys. The percentage of CD8(+) T cells that bound the
   tetramer in the thymus was uniformly low in the monkeys. However, the
   percentage of CD8(+) T cells that bound the tetramer in bone marrow and
   spleen was consistently higher than that seen in lymph nodes and
   peripheral blood. The phenotypic profile of the tetramer-binding CD8(+)
   T lymphocytes in the different lymphoid compartments was similar,
   showing a high expression of activation-associated adhesion molecules
   and a low level expression of naive T-cell-associated molecules.
   Surprisingly, no correlation was evident between the percentage of
   tetramer-binding CD8+ T lymphocytes and the magnitude of the
   cell-associated SIV RNA level in each lymphoid compartment of individual
   monkeys. These studies suggest that a dynamic process of trafficking may
   obscure the tendency of CTL to localize in particular regional lymph
   nodes or that some lymphoid organs may provide milieus that are
   particularly conducive to CTL expansion. (Blood. 2000;96:1474-1479) (C)

Abstract = {{We have investigated the quantum dynamics of photodetachment of an
   electron from closed-shell anions by pulsed light in the presence of
   perturbation produced by a neighboring solvent dipole. The anion is
   modeled by a suitable one-dimensional potential and assumed to interact
   with the dipolar solvent molecule through ion-dipole and ion-induced
   dipole interactions. The dynamics is followed by invoking the
   time-dependent Fourier grid Hamiltonian method to solve the relevant
   Schrodinger equation. The detachment rates in the presence of random
   fluctuations in the binding energy of the anion-electron and orientation
   of the dipole (with respect to the anion) have been computed and
   compared with the rates observed for an anion with fixed binding energy
   and a fixed orientation of the dipole. The possibility of the detached
   electron being captured by the perturbing dipole is also considered. The
   capture probability and rate are studied as functions of important
   system parameters. The possibility of using the model to understand the
   evolution of the charge-transfer-to-solvent spectrum is explored. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective-To identify the perceived market or client demand for dairy
   on-farm food safety services by veterinarians, the need for a food
   safety continuing education program, and the educational issues that
   might be addressed in an on-farm food safety curriculum.
   Design-Survey.
   Study Population-Consulting dairy veterinarians, government
   veterinarians located in California, and meat packers slaughtering cull
   dairy cows in California,
   Procedure-Results of a questionnaire supplied to veterinarians and
   telephone interviews with meal packer representatives were analyzed by
   use of univariate and multivariate logistic regression procedures.
   Results-Some meat packers considered the quality of incoming cull dairy
   cattle as a control point for food safety hazards. More than 50\% of
   dairy and government-employed veterinarians believed that a current
   market for on-farm food safely services exists; > 85\% believed that a
   potential market exists. Duration since graduation was negatively
   correlated with belief in a current market. Government-employed
   veterinarians were more likely to believe in a current marker.
   Veterinarians were more likely to express a strong interest in offering
   on-farm food safety services if they believed a current market exists,
   indicated that they already offer such services, or listed residues and
   pathogens as the most important issues facing the dairy industry.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Although a potential market for
   on-farm food safety services is perceived, veterinarians are unsure of
   their role in this area. New demands of meat packers slaughtering cull
   dairy cows may be the motivation practitioners need to broach the
   subject of food safety with clients.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal motoneurons (MNs) in the chick embryo undergo programmed cell
   death coincident with the establishment of nerve-muscle connections and
   the onset of synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction.
   Chronic treatment of embryos during this period with nicotinic
   acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) blocking agents {[}e.g., curare or
   alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BTX)] prevents the death of MNs. Although this
   rescue effect has been attributed previously to a peripheral site of
   action of the nAChR-blocking agents at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ),
   because nAChRs are expressed in both muscle and spinal cord, it has been
   suggested that the rescue effect may, in fact, be mediated by a direct
   central action of nAChR antagonists. By using a variety of different
   nAChR-blocking agents that target specific muscle or neuronal nAChR
   subunits, we find that only those agents that act on muscle-type
   receptors block neuromuscular activity and rescue MNs. However,
   paralytic, muscular dysgenic mutant chick embryos also exhibit
   significant increases in MN survival that can be further enhanced by
   treatment with curare or alpha-BTX, suggesting that muscle paralysis may
   not be the sole factor involved in MN survival. Taken together, the data
   presented here support the argument that, in vivo, nAChR antagonists
   promote the survival of spinal MNs primarily by acting peripherally at
   the NMJ to inhibit synaptic transmission and reduce or block muscle
   activity. Although a central action of these agents involving direct
   perturbations of MN activity may also play a contributory role, further
   studies are needed to determine more precisely the relative roles of
   central versus peripheral sites of action in MN rescue.}},

Abstract = {{An indirect electrochemical method, which is very efficient for the
   degradation of organic pollutants in water, is described. The method,
   named electro-fenton, is based on electrocatalytical generation of
   Fenton's reagent to produce hydroxyl radicals, which are very active
   toward organic compounds. An industrial pollutant p-nitrophenol (PNP),
   was chosen for this study and was eventually mineralized. The major
   intermediary degradation products such as hydroquinone, benzoquinone,
   4-nitro-catechol, 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene and
   3,4,5-trihydroxy-nitrobenzene were unequivocally identified by HPLC and
   GC-MS methods. The rate constants of the hydroxylation reactions were
   determined. The mineralization of the initial pollutant and the
   intermediates formed during electro-Fenton treatment was followed by
   total organic carbon (TOC) analyses. Dependence of mineralization on the
   amount of electrical energy consumed is shown by the relative decrease
   of TOC values. A mineralization reaction mechanism is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{DDC2 is a novel component of the DNA integrity checkpoint pathway, which
   is required for proper checkpoint response to DNA damage and to
   incomplete DNA replication. Moreover, Ddc2 overproduction causes
   sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and checkpoint defects. Ddc2
   physically interacts with Mec1 and undergoes Mec1-dependent
   phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo. The phosphorylation of Ddc2
   takes place in late S phase and in G(2) phase during an unperturbed cell
   cycle and is further increased in response to DNA damage. Because Ddc2
   phosphorylation does not require any other known tested checkpoint
   factors but Mec1, the Ddc2-Mec1 complex might respond to the presence of
   some DNA structures independently of the other known checkpoint
   proteins. Our findings suggest that Ddc2 may be the functional homolog
   of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rad26, strengthening the hypothesis that
   the mechanisms leading to checkpoint activation are conserved throughout

Abstract = {{The monofunctional alkylating agent N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine
   (MNNG) is a widespread environmental carcinogen that causes DNA lesions,
   leading to cell death. However, MNNG can also trigger a cell-protective
   response by inducing the expression of DNA repair/transcription-related
   genes. We demonstrate that the urokinase-type plasminogen activator
   (uPA) gene product, a broad spectrum extracellular protease to which no
   DNA repair function has been assigned, is transcriptionally induced by
   MNNG in C2C12 and NIH3T3 cells. This induction required an AP1-enhancer
   element located at -2.4 kilobase (kb), because it was abrogated by
   deletion of this site. MNNG was found to induce the activation of
   JNK/SAPK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), Accordingly,
   we attempted to assess the contribution of each of these MNNG-inducible
   MAPKs to uPA gene induction by this alkylating agent. Coexpression of
   dominant negative versions of kinases of the JNK pathway, such as
   catalytically inactive forms of MEKK1, MKK7, and JNKK, and of
   cytoplasmic JNK-inhibitor JIP-1, as well as treatment of cells with
   curcumin (which blocks JNK activation by MNNG), inhibited MNNG-induced
   uPA transcriptional activity. In contrast, neither dominant negative
   MKK6 nor SB203580, which specifically inhibit p38 MAP kinase activation,
   abrogated the MNNG-induced effect. Taken together, our results show that
   the JNK signaling pathway links external MNNG stimulation and
   AP1-dependent uPA gene expression, providing the first functional
   dissection of a transcription-coupled signal transduction pathway for
   MNNG. (Blood. 2000;96:1415-1424) (C) 2000 by The American Society of

Abstract = {{Catalytic oxidation of glucose and cellulose has been demonstrated in a
   monolith reactor, a novel contacting device for the oxidation of
   carbohydrate feedstocks that allows the processing of nonsoluble
   components without reactor plugging. Catalytic enhancement is observed
   for glucose oxidation, and the catalyst promotes selectivity to
   two-carbon carboxylic acids. It is proposed that catalytic oxidation of
   glucose occurs through parallel pathways: thermal oxidation to a wide
   range of organic acids and selective catalytic oxidation to low
   molecular weight acids. On the other hand, cellulose oxidation was not
   always enhanced by the presence of the catalyst. Here, the effect of the
   catalyst was to enhance the conversion of the organic acids produced
   during thermal oxidation. However, these organic acids also catalyzed
   the primary conversion of cellulose, thus the conversion of cellulose
   decreased as the reaction temperature was increased. A kinetic model is
   provided that is consistent with the inverse temperature effect observed
   for the cellulose oxidation experiments.}},

Abstract = {{A series of Cu1-xZnxFe2O4, spinel ferrites with x=0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75
   and 1.0, respectively were prepared by standard ceramic method to study
   the relationship between structural parameters and concentration of the
   substituted non-magnetic (Zn) ion. Determination of crystal structure
   oxygen positional parameter and cation distribution using X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and R-factor method revealed that these ferrites
   belong to the family of mixed or partially inverse spinels. The magnetic
   interaction has been calculated from ac susceptibility measurements
   using mutual inductance technique as a function of concentration of the
   substituted ions in these mixed ferrites. The dominant interaction in
   all ferrite samples is A-B interaction which is due to the negative
   values of paramagnetic Curie temperature theta (K) and the distribution
   of cations among A and B sites showing that the magnetic ordering is
   antiferromagnetic. The Curie temperature (T-c) rises up to x=0.75
   possibly due to increase in exchange interaction and magnetic moments.
   For x>0.75, T-c decreases due to cation distribution (normal) on A and
   B-sites resulting in the weakening of A-B interaction due to the
   presence of triangular spin arrangement of Y-K type on B-sublattice. (C)

Abstract = {{A series of mouse lines has been produced by 19 generations of
   restricted index selection for fate of development during early and late
   ontogeny. The selection program was based on an index with the following
   four replicated selection treatments: E+ and E- were selected to alter
   birth to 10-day body weight gain while holding late gain for both
   selection lines constant; correspondingly, L+ and L- were selected to
   alter 28- to 56-day body weight gain holding early gain for both lines
   constant. Herein, we characterize response to selection for growth rate
   by analyzing age-specific mouse body weight and tail lengths and for
   growth curves using a logistics model. Selection on developmental rate
   has resulted in divergence in both age-specific and growth curve traits.
   E+ and L+ lines reached identical weights during the late selection
   interval, then diverged to unique mature weights. E- and L- lines
   similarly achieved identical weights during late selection and diverged
   to unique mature weights. However, the shapes of early and late growth
   curves were significantly divergent, and at least two distinct growth
   patterns are shown to result from selection. Response in body weight
   gain was accompanied by similar, though less pronounced, change in tail
   length traits. Significant response during intervals of restricted
   growth was also found, especially in lines selected for late gain. The
   evolution of the growth trajectory under restricted index selection is
   discussed in terms of drift and available additive genetic variation and
   covariation. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for quantifying
   relative amounts of active caspase 3 in apoptotic cells. Covalent
   modification of caspase 3 active sites with a biotinylated inhibitor
   differentiates active from latent caspases. Capture on an ELISA plate
   with an antibody specific for caspase 3 makes the assay specific for
   caspase 3. Detection is with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
   streptavidin that binds to the biotinylated inhibitor covalently bound
   to caspase 3. Using the assay we detected 6.6 ng active caspase 3 per
   10(6) apoptotic staurosporine-treated Jurkat cells. Specificity of the
   assay for caspase 3 was demonstrated by lack of signal with purified
   caspases 2, 7, 8, and 10 that were modified by a biotinylated inhibitor.
   Specificity was also demonstrated by lack of signal with apoptotic MCF-7
   cells which do not express caspase 3. The ability to discriminate
   between active and latent caspase 3 was shown by Western blotting with
   HRP-streptavidin and anti-caspase 3. Although latent caspase 3 was
   captured it was not covalently modified with the biotinylated inhibitor.
   The basic principle of using a covalent inhibitor to identify active
   enzymes and an antibody to differentiate between enzymes with similar
   activities has potential for quantifying active members of many classes

Abstract = {{Mitochondria from all plants, many fungi and some protozoa contain a
   cyanide-resistant, alternative oxidase that functions in parallel with
   cytochrome c oxidase as the terminal oxidase on the electron transfer
   chain. Characterization of the structural and potential regulatory
   features of the alternative oxidase has advanced considerably in recent
   years. The active site is proposed to contain a di-iron center belonging
   to the ribonucleotide reductase R2 family and modeling of a four-helix
   bundle to accommodate this active site within the C-terminal two-thirds
   of the protein has been carried out. The structural features of this
   active site are conserved among all known alternative oxidases. The
   post-translational regulatory features of the alternative oxidase are
   more variable among organisms. The plant oxidase is dimeric and can be
   stimulated by either alpha-keto acids or succinate, depending upon the
   presence or absence, respectively, of a critical cysteine residue found
   in a conserved block of amino acids in the N-terminal region of the
   plant protein. The fungal and protozoan alternative oxidases generally
   exist as monomers and are not subject to organic acid stimulation but
   can be stimulated by purine nucleotides. The origins of these diverse
   regulatory features remain unknown but are correlated with sequence
   differences in the N-terminal third of the protein. (C) 2000 Elsevier

   It leads to a nonlinear three-dimensional integro-differential equation
   for the enhancement amplitude. This equation is solved for two cases in
   which it reduces to one dimension and also for a model. The relation
   between the results obtained in this way for the annihilation rate and
   the predictions of the local density approximation and other approaches

Abstract = {{Upconversion by Yb3+ sensitization in Er3+-doped YVO4 crystals has been
   studied under excitation with a 976 nm laser diode. In addition to the
   previously observed upconverted 526 and 554 nm Er3+ emission bands,
   three weak upconverted Er3+ emission bands are observed at 490, 660, and
   670 nm at room temperature. From the quadratic pump-power dependence, it
   is confirmed that the upconversion is induced by a two-photon excitation
   process involving excited-state absorption from the I-4(11/2) state of
   Er3+. In addition to these emission bands, downconverted Yb3+ and Er3+
   emission bands are simultaneously observed at 1010 and 1470-1630 am.
   respectively. It is observed that the infrared Er3+ emission intensity
   increases linearly with pump power, while the Yb3+ emission intensity
   saturates gt higher pump powers.}},
