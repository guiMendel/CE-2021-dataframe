Abstract = {{The possibility of obtaining useful scintigrams of secondary lymphoid
   organs after infusion of syngeneic lymphocytes labelled with
   technetium-99m (Tc-99m) was explored in a rat model.  Thoracic duct
   lymphocyte (TDL) accumulation in various organs was measured with both
   Tc-99m and Cr-51 labelled cells, the latter processed with a method that
   has been shown not to damage lymphocytes.  Tc-99m labelled TDL did not
   localize properly in the lymph nodes and spleen.  We could not visualize
   lymph nodes in scintigrams, neither could we demonstrate any difference
   between normal and hyperplastic spleens.  Our conclusion is that
   radiation from the Tc-99m label readily influences lymphocyte migration
   so that useful scintigraphy in rats and other small experimental animals
   becomes impossible.  This was supported by results from culture
   experiments with Tc-99m labelled, radiosensitive mouse haemopoietic
   progenitor cells.  Theoretical considerations, including the
   calculations of lymphocyte self-irradiation and signal/noise ratios
   during scintigraphy of rat tissues, supported our conclusion that
   scintigraphy in small animals, to disclose the physiological migration
   of lymphocytes, may be impossible with the present sensitivity of gamma
   cameras.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the front-tracking method using marker points for the
   numerical solution of a class of moving boundary problems, which arise
   in connection with certain two-dimensional electrochemical machining
   problems. The numerical method is expressed as a system of N nonlinear,
   autonomous, ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for describing the
   movement of N marker points on the moving boundary. The system has been
   analysed, in some cases, with respect to the local stability of
   equilibrium solutions and to the global stability of nonequilibrium
   solutions. The linearised local stability of the equilibrium solution is
   investigated in terms of the Jacobi matrix for the system of ODEs.
   Closed-form expressions for the eigenvalues and the Jacobi matrix have
   been derived. Part of the method comprises the solution of a Dirichlet
   boundary value problem. This is carried out using various boundary
   collocation methods, which are investigated. The mathematical-numerical
   model has features which are in accordance with those of the physical
   problem. This has also been demonstrated by actual computation of some
   examples.}},

   However, the instanton approximation is not valid at such high energy

Abstract = {{Anguis fragilis were filmed while traversing plane surfaces, fields of
   nails and pins at different spacings, and channels of different
   diameter.  Lizards can move slowly on rough surfaces by lateral
   undulation, but with increased speed (and on smoother surfaces) they
   shift to slide-pushing accomplished by wide swings of the tail.  The
   lizards undulate through fields of pins, often pushing at a few bends
   and pulling and pushing the trunk among these.  In channels, they
   utilize continuous bend concertina, forming the initial bend anteriorly
   and adding posterior ones, either to the level of the cloaca or also
   onto the tail.  Specimens respond to very tight pin arrangements (but
   not tight channels) as hiding sites, wedging themselves in place.  The
   cloacal region often forms a site of discontinuity, with curves changing
   here;  however, the trunk and tail seem to have equal capacity for bend
   formation without obvious deficits in autotomized specimens.  Velocities
   of adults were relatively low, 1 cm/sec for slide-pushing, 4 cm/sec for
   lateral undulation, and 1 cm/sec for concertina.}},

Abstract = {{Relationships describing the dependence of the height equivalent to a
   theoretical plate (HETP) on the linear velocity u contain a term that is
   traditionally called the eddy dispersion term.  In some theories, this
   term is independent of velocity, in others it results in a curved
   relationship with velocity.  Both have been observed experimentally.  In
   this paper, we advocate a theory which is capable of explaining both. 
   This theory is based on the mass-transfer between sections of the mobile
   phase that move at different velocities.  The equation obtained is
   formally identical to the equation derived by Giddings.  However, the
   meaning of the coefficients in both theories is different.  In our
   approach, the coefficients are related to structural parameters of the
   packed bed and can be assessed quantitatively.  This is helpful in the
   interpretation of eddy dispersion terms obtained in column packing
   experiments.
   The mathematical approach used here allows the calculation of all
   moments of the peak and therefore a prediction of the peak-shape. 
   Although a relationship exists between structural parameters of the
   packed bed and the experimental observations of peak width and peak
   symmetry, this relationship can only be expressed in the form of the
   product of velocity difference with a characteristic distance.  This
   term cannot be deconvoluted further.  Thus, large velocity differences
   over small distances result in the same peak-width and -shape as small
   velocity differences over large distances.}},

   proteins or the products of recombinant gene technology.  The
   recognition of oligopeptides, separated by reversed-phase liquid
   chromatography, is limited by the conventional reliance on the
   correlation of retention times with standards, supported by
   dual-wavelength chromatograms.  It has been reported that the
   recognition of phenolic compounds can be achieved by a novel technique,
   based on computer-aided photodiode-array detection of the pH-shifted
   solutes after post-column continuous-flow analysis.  This work describes
   how the generation of the pH-shifted difference spectra for dipeptides,
   containing a tyrosyl residue, may be used to enhance peak recognition,
   when used in conjunction with absorbance ratios.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical study of weak molecular complexes of methane interacting
   with hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride has been carried out.
   Geometries were optimized at the MP2/6-311G(d.p) level of MO theory
   while binding energies were determined at MP4/6-311 + + G(d,p).
   Calculated results show the formation of a non-conventional (HCH3...HCl)
   complex in which methane acts as a proton acceptor (as in the
   earlier-discussed (HCH3...HCN) system) versus a more conventional
   (H3CH...FH) dimer in which methane plays the role of a proton donor.
   These results are in agreement with those derived from both vibrational
   and rotational spectrometries. An attempt to rationalize this
   contrasting behaviour of HF and HCl in complex formation with methane is
   presented in the framework of an electrostatic model. The
   non-conventional structure of (CH4, HCl) or (CH4, HCN) is attributable
   to the anisotropy of the short-range forces which allows a closer
   approach in (HCH3...HX) than in (H3CH...XH).}},

Abstract = {{The pattern of clearance of intravenously administered heparin suggests
   the participation of a saturable mechanism which has been ascribed to
   heparin binding to the endothelium.  Another potential site of heparin
   binding which may contribute to the saturable mechanism is the red blood
   cells.  We have examined this possibility using unfractionated heparin
   together with a chemically-modified low affinity heparin labelled with
   tritium as tracer.  Unfractionated heparin and the radioactive tracer
   were added to pooled plasma at a fixed concentration.  The heparinized
   plasma was mixed with red cells to reconstitute whole blood.  After
   centrifugation, the radioactivity, APTT, anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities
   were measured in the resultant plasmas.  No evidence of significant
   binding to red cells could be detected even when the hematocrits of the
   reconstituted whole blood were increased.  These results are at variance
   with those of a previously published report.  We conclude that red cell
   binding does not contribute to the saturable mechanism of heparin
   clearance.}},

Abstract = {{3'(2')-O-(4-Benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP (Bz2ATP) was used as a photoaffinity
   label of the ATP binding site of unphosphorylated chicken gizzard
   myosin.  Specific photolabeing of the active site of 6 S myosin was
   assured by forming a stable myosin.Co(II)Bz2ADP.orthovanadate complex
   (termed trapping) prior to irradiation.  Co2+ was used in place of Mg2+
   to prevent the known photoreaction of vanadate with myosin which
   destabilizes the trapped complex.  {[}H-3] Bz2ADP.P(i) was also stably
   trapped on gizzard myosin by forming the 10 S folded conformation of the
   protein in the presence of {[}H-3]Bz2ATP and Mg2+.  Irradiation of 6 S
   myosin containing orthovanadate trapped {[}H-3] Bz2ADP or 10 S trapped
   {[}H-3]Bz2ADP.P(i) gave 32 and 30\% covalent incorporation,
   respectively.  The 50-kDa and precursor 68-kDa tryptic peptides of the
   subfragment-1 heavy chain derived from both forms of myosin were found
   to contain essentially all of the covalently attached {[}H-3]Bz2ADP. 
   Parallel experiments with untrapped {[}H-3]Bz2ADP showed extensive
   nonspecific labeling of all of the major tryptic peptides and the light
   chains.  Eight labeled peptides, isolated from 6 and 10 S photolabeled
   myosin, contained the sequence G319-H-V-P-I-X-A-Q326, where X
   corresponds to labeled proline 324.  {[}C-14]Bz2ADP was previously shown
   to label serine 324 in skeletal subfragment-1 (Mahmood, R., Elzinga, M.,
   and Yount, R. G. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 3989-3995), which corresponds
   to alanine 325 in the gizzard sequence.  Thus, this region of the 50-kDa
   tryptic fragment, near the nucleotide binding site, in both skeletal and
   smooth muscle myosins, must fold in essentially the same manner.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the mechanism of the electrophoresis-driven
   chromatin aggregation which had been described by Weintraub (1984, Cell
   38, 17 - 27) as a putative mean for propagation of genetic repression in
   eukaryotes.  We show that the oligonucleosmoe aggregates are assembled
   de nova at the starting zone of DNP electrophoresis.  A new system of
   native two-dimensional DNP electrophoresis has been worked out to
   separate the oligonucleosome aggregates ('A' particles) and the
   freely-migrating oligonuclesomes ('B' particles).  The  `B' particle
   fraction which is derived from transcriptionally-active chromatin
   regions undergoes an extensive nuclease degradation of its DNa termini
   during the nuclease digestion.  This fraction is partially depleted of
   histone H1 and H5 and is enriched in HMG nonhistone proteins.  `A'
   particles comprise the repressed chromatin DNa fragments which are about
   60 b.p. longer than the corresponding DNA oligomers of `B' particles. An
   oligonucleosome preparation containing the elongated DNA oligomers has
   been also isolated by means of sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation.
   Exonuclease III mapping reveals that the two chromatin fractions differ
   by an extent of terminal linker DNA trimming during the Micrococcal
   nuclease digestion rather than by the nucleosome repeat length.  The
   complex character of nuclease digestion is not observed when the
   chromatin is digested in solution after the nuclear lysis.  We argue
   that the protection of terminal oligonucleosome linkers is due to
   selective condensation of inactive chromatin in chicken erythrocyte
   nuclei and that the terminal DNA tails together with linker histones
   bound to them mediate the aggregation of repressed chromatin fragments.}},

   reagent specific for lysine residues in the nucleotide-binding site of
   several enzymes {[}Tagaya, M., \& Fukui, T. (1986) Biochemistry 25,
   2958-2964; Yagami, T., Tagaya, M., \& Fukui, T. (1988) FEBS Lett. 229,
   261-264], was used to identify the ATP-binding site of Escherichia coli
   methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS).  Incubation of this enzyme with
   AP3-PL followed by reduction with sodium borohydride resulted in a rapid
   inactivation of both the tRNA(Met) aminoacylation and the
   methionine-dependent ATP-PP(i) exchange activities.  Complete
   inactivation corresponded to the incorporation of 0.98 mol of AP3-PL/mol
   of monomeric trypsin-modified MetRS.  ATP or MgATP protected the enzyme
   from inactivation.  The labeling with AP3-PL was also applied to E. coli
   valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS).  Both the tRNA(Val)aminoacylation and the
   valine-dependent ATP-PP(i) exchange activities were abolished by the
   incorporation of 0.91 mol of AP3-PL/mol of monomeric ValRS.  AP3-PL was
   found attached to lysine residues 335, 402, and 528 in the primary
   structure of MetRS.  In the case of ValRS, the AP3-PL-labeled residues
   corresponded to lysines 557, 593, and 909.  We therefore conclude that
   these lysines of MetRS and ValRS are directed toward the ATP-binding
   site of these synthetases, more specifically at or close to the subsite
   for the gamma-phosphate of ATP.  AP3-PL-labeled Lys-335 of MetRS and
   Lys-557 of ValRS belong to the consensus tRNA CCA-binding
   Lys-Met-Ser-Lys-Ser sequence {[}Hountondji, C., Dessen, P., \& Blanquet,
   S. (1986) Biochimie 68, 1071-1078].  This indicates that, in the case of
   the two studied enzymes, the ATP-dependent activation of the amino acid
   and its subsequent transfer to the 3'-adenosine of tRNA take place in
   the same region.  Furthermore, comparison of the primary structure of
   MetRS around Lys-402 to that of ValRS around Lys-593 reveals little
   significant similarity, with four identities and two conservative
   replacements out of 11 amino acid residues.}},

Abstract = {{The entire rat P-450scc gene has been cloned, positions/sequences of the
   exon-intron boundaries (I-IX) are described and 940 base pairs (bp) of
   5'-flanking DNA have been sequenced, compared to mouse, bovine and human
   genes, and analyzed by functional assays.  Primer extension analysis
   mapped the transcription start site 32 bp upstream of the initiator
   methionine codon.  The rat P-450scc promoter was ligated to the human
   growth hormone (GH) gene yielding p-940RsccGH.  This rat P-450scc fusion
   gene and a mouse gene (p-1500MsccGH) were transiently transfected into
   primary cultures of rat granulosa cells and Y1 adrenal cells.  In the Y1
   cells primer extension analysis showed that the rat P-450sccGH gene was
   expressed at lower basal levels than that of the mouse gene but showed
   greater stimulation (4-8-fold) in response to 8-bromo-cyclic AMP than
   the mouse (3-4-fold).  Similar results were obtained when the fusion
   genes were transfected into primary cultures of rat granulosa cells and
   production of GH was measured in the media of the cells stimulated with
   forskolin.  Furthermore, we document that gonadotropins
   (follicle-stimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone) can induce
   luteinization of granulosa cells in vitro, that this process is
   associated with constitutive maintenance of P-450scc mRNA in the absence
   of hormones/cAMP, that these events associated with luteinization are
   differentiation-stage specific and occur only in granulosa cells of
   preovulatory follicles but not in small antral follicles, that the
   process can be inhibited by cycloheximide if the protein synthesis
   inhibitor is present during the first 6 h of exposure to luteinizing
   hormone but not if added for short durations (3-5 h) later, and that
   once luteinization is induced P-450scc mRNA expression and progesterone
   biosynthesis are not strictly dependent on cAMP.  Thus, the P-450scc
   gene is regulated by both cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent
   mechanisms, each of which are associated with a specific stage of
   granulosa cell differentiation.  The DNA domains involved in regulating
   these two diverse processes remain to be determined.  Although there was
   remarkable sequence homology among rat, mouse, bovine, and human genes
   within 70 bp of the transcriptional start site, no other sequence
   similarities revealed conserved functional domains among the four genes.
   Although some cAMP-responsive element-like sequences are present in the
   rat gene, these were not conserved in the other species; including the
   mouse which showed high sequence homology with the rat throughout 900 bp
   of 5'-flanking DNA.  Thus, the cAMP domains specific to this and other
   steroidogenic genes remain to be clearly identified.}},

Abstract = {{The transcription unit of the gene for the variant specific glycoprotein
   (VSG) AnTat 1.3A of Trypanosoma brucei contains several associated genes
   (ESAGs, for Expression Site-Associated Genes), 7 of which have already
   been described (1).  We report here the characterization of a further
   ESAG, which we term ESAG 8, present 1 kb downstream from the putative
   adenylate cyclase gene ESAG 4.  ESAG 8 encodes a 70 kd protein whose
   sequence indicates that it is probably not exposed at the cell surface.
   With the exception of the N-terminal domain which contains a presumptive
   DNa-binding zinc finger, the ESAG 8 protein consists exclusively of
   leucine-rich repeats of 23 amino acids, typical of protein-interacting
   domains such as the RAS-interacting region of the yeast adenylate
   cyclase.  ESAG 8 transcripts are only found in bloostream forms, and
   their level is particularly low, suggesting a high rate of degradation.
   The ESAG 8 protein may be involved in stage-specific regulatory
   processes, such as gene expression control or adenylate cyclase
   activation.}},

Abstract = {{The revival of interest in nuclear ground-state octupole deformations
   that occurred in the 1980's was stimulated by observations in 1980 of
   particularly large deviations between calculated and experimental masses
   in the Ra region, in a global calculation of nuclear ground-state
   masses.  By minimizing the total potential energy with respect to
   octupole shape degrees of freedom in addition to epsilon-2 and epsilon-4
   used originally, a vastly improved agreement between calculated and
   experimental masses was obtained.  To study the global behaviour and
   interrelationships between other nuclear properties, we calculate
   nuclear ground-state masses, spins, pairing gaps and beta-decay
   half-lives and compare the results to experimental quantities.  The
   calculations are based on the macroscopic-microscopic approach, with the
   microscopic contributions calculated in a folded-Yukawa single-particle

Abstract = {{On the basis of classical nucleation theory, the question ``What
   quantities does the two-dimensional nucleation of adsorbed molecules

   formation of the critical nucleus and the Zeldovich factor, each of them
   being a function of the line tension and the change in the Gibbs energy
   in the adsorbate phase transition, DELTA-G\#.  It is shown how DELTA-G\#
   and the initial surface concentration of adsorbate monomers affect the
   2D steady-state nucleation rate considering the Zeldovich factor and
   different kinds of impingement of molecules on the edge of the critical
   nucleus.  The model derived is specified for the 2D nucleation of
   organic substances at the metal/electrolyte interface.  From that,
   predictions have been derived concerning DELTA-G\# and the steady-state
   nucleation rate as functions of the potential, the concentration of the
   adsorbate in solution and the temperature.}},

   polarized-photon-scattered-ion coincidence technique.  The energy is
   1.5-12 keV and scattering angles-theta are less than 1.5-degrees.  For
   large impact parameters a strong propensity for orientation is observed,
   with the sense of electron orbiting in the same direction as the
   rotation of the internuclear axis being favored by more than a factor of
   2 compared to the opposite orientation.  This is in qualitative

Abstract = {{To explore the multioscillator nature of the neurohumoral circuitry
   controlling the expression of circadian rhythmicity, rats' wheel running
   circadian activity rhythms were compared following sagittal knife cuts
   in the region of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SSCN), following
   pinealectomy (PX) and following the combination of SSCN and PX.  25\% of
   animals with knife cuts that passed through one SCN had disturbed
   running activity under constant illumination; rhythmic disturbances were
   seen neither in animals with sham knife cuts nor in rats with knife cuts
   on the midline or lateral to the SCN.  Animals with both SSCN and PX
   were twice as likely to show severe rhythmic disruptions under
   free-running conditions as rats with SSCN and sham PX.  Rats with PX and
   sham SSCN did not display disrupted activity rhythms.  When animals with
   PX alone or SSCN alone when first observed under free-running conditions
   and then subjected to a second surgical procedure so that all animals
   underwent both PX and SSCN, all PX and most SSCN animals demonstrated
   coherent activity rhythms after the first operation, but 35\% showed
   disruptions in circadian activity patterns only following the second
   surgery.  The activity rhythms of rats with knife cuts placed either on
   the midline or lateral to the SCN did not deteriorate when combined with
   PX.  Rats with coherent rhythms following knife cuts damaging one SCN
   had rhythm disruptions after the addition of PX.  The effects of
   pinealectomy may indicate that the pineal gland plays a role in
   maintaining the coupling relationships in the multioscillator system
   controlling circadian activity rhythms.  The results of this study also
   suggest that neither the direct commissural connection of the SCNs nor
   the humoral output of the pineal gland is indispensable for the
   expression of coherent circadian activity rhythms in the rat.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a genetic model for conditional strategies which places such
   strategies in the context of phenotypic plasticity. The model, which
   treats conditional strategies as polygenic threshold traits, indicates
   that, given requisite genetic variation in reaction norms, conditional
   strategies will evolve to their optimum level and be maintained by
   stabilizing selection, provided environmental variation results in a
   fitness trade-off for the alternative conditional phenotypes. The
   precise value for the evolutionary optimum is found to depend primarily
   on the probability density function of the environmental variation that
   influences the production of the conditional phenotypes and the
   magnitude of the fitness trade-offs of the conditional phenotypes across
   such environmental variation. The model is tested by application to
   three well-studied conditional strategies. In each case the predictions
   of the model are in good agreement with the results of these studies.}},

   Chlorella (3N813A) released ammonium at pH 4; no ammonium was released
   by a low maltose-releasing strain (NC64A). Ammonium release by 3N813A
   was markedly stimulated in darkness and was sustained over 48 h. Release
   in light was enhanced in the presence of methionine sulphoximine, an
   inhibitor of glutamine synthetase, but there was only a minor increase
   in darkness. Amino acids, in particular alanine and glutamine, increased
   ammonium release in light. Ammonium release in darkness was markedly
   decreased in the presence of acetate and inhibitors of the Krebs cycle
   and gluconeogenesis. It is suggested that ammomium release by high
   maltose-releasing strains is due to deamination and an inability to
   reassimilate ammonium because of a limited supply of 2-oxoglutarate. It
   is further suggested that the carbon skeletons of the amino acids are

Abstract = {{Shock-wave delivery and focal size of three different generators -
   electrohydraulic, electromagnetic and piezoelectric - were compared.
   Pressure measurements were uniformly made by needle hydrophone
   (piezoelectric transducer).  The smallest focus, 17 x 3 x 3 mm, was
   achieved with the piezoelectric system (50\% isobars), while the focus
   with the electromagnetic generator was much larger (50 x 7 x 4 mm). With
   the electrohydraulic generator the focal size of the 60\% isobars was 20
   mm in the longitudinal axis.  The highest pressure, 1512 bar, was
   achieved with the piezoelectric lithotriptor (mean shock-wave pressure
   in focus:  electrohydraulic 1000 + 100, electromagnetic 1000 + 25,
   piezoelectric 1400 + 27 bar).  The rapid positive pressure rise was
   followed by a slower pressure fall and a small negative wave.  In the
   focal region the negative pressure wave was between 112 and 200 bar with
   the electrohydraulic system, 100-146 bar with the electromagnetic one,
   and 134 bar with the piezoelectric one.  The significance of the
   negative wave is not clear; perhaps it contributes to the development of
   the cavitation effect and facilitates stone fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{The rotational spectra of the two isotopomers (CH2)2O...H79Br and
   (CH2)2)...H81Br of a dimer formed between oxirane and hydrogen bomide
   have been detected with a pulsed-nozzle, Fourier-transform microwave
   spectrometer.  A fast mixing nozzle was used to form and then isolate
   the observed species before the rapid ring-opening reaction could occur.
   Rotational constants, centrifugal distortion constants, and Br nuclear
   hyperfine (quadrupole and spin-rotation) coupling constants were
   determined.  The following constants in particular were used to diagnose
   the nature of the observed species:
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   A detailed analysis of the observed rotational constants allows the
   conclusion that the dimer has C(s) symmetry with a pyramidal arrangement
   at oxygen and an oxirane geometry essentially unperturbed on dimer
   formation.  When H of HBr is assumed to lie between O and Br the
   distance r(O...Br) = 3.2623 (12) angstrom and the angle theta = 78.45
   (9)-degrees are determined.  Diagonalization of the complete Br nuclear
   quadrupole coupling tensor leads to Xzz = -202.457 MHz and Xyy = 205.527
   MHz, indicating that the presence of the oxirane molecule only slightly
   perturbs the cylindrical symmetry of the HBr subunit.  The angle of
   rotation of (alpha-za)x = 23.3-degrees required to diagonalize the x
   tensor is ca.  10-degrees larger than the angle (alpha-za)struct implied
   by the determined geometry.   This suggests that the angle O...H-Br
   might be correspondingly less than 180-degrees, i.e. the hydrogen bond
   might be slightly bent.}},

   systematic study of available detectors indicated the advisability of a
   high-Z scintillator.  The raster-scanning camera uses a lead-shielded
   bismuth germanate (BGO) scintillator (1.25 cm x 1.25 cm right-circular
   cylinder) coupled to a photomultiplier tube (PMT) operated in pulse
   mode.  Measurements yielded an angular resolution of 2.5-degrees and
   energy resolution of 12.9\% at 662 keV.  The camera motion is totally
   automated and controlled by stepping motors connected to a remote
   computer.  Several 2D images of radioactive sources have been acquired
   in fields of up to 400 mR/h and energies up to 2.75 MeV.  Some of the
   images demonstrate the ability of the camera to image a polychromatic

Abstract = {{During experiments to calibrate a radon-in-air counter, some unexpected
   diurnal variations have been observed.  Inside the sealed
   stainless-steel chamber of a nominal volume of 3 litres, ionised Po-218
   atoms from the alpha-decay of Rn-222 are attracted by an electric field
   to a ZnS(Ag) scintillation screen via which subsequent alpha-decay
   events are detected.  Results for this configuration are presented and
   also for a modified version in which the scintillation screen is
   replaced by a high-resolution-alpha-detector.  Ambient temperature
   changes were suspected to be responsible for the observed
   counting-efficiency variation and this has been confirmed by operating
   the wall of the chamber at various temperatures between 0-degrees-C and
   about 40-degrees-C, which revealed a positive temperature coefficient of
   approximately 1\%/degrees-C at 25-degrees-C.  Possible reasons for this
   effect are considered.}},

Abstract = {{The behaviour of mineral particles and water in the froth phase of
   large-scale flotation cells has been studied by means of a mathematical
   model.  The model considers the distribution of air over the pulp-froth
   interface, and accounts for the fact that only a certain fraction of the
   total volume of froth is utilized efficiently for the transport of
   mineral particles from the pulp to the concentrate.
   On-site testwork was carried out on a rougher and a cleaner cell at a
   pyrite flotation plant.  It was found that the ratio of solids to water
   decreased significantly with increasing height in the rougher froth, but
   increased in the cleaner froth.  While the behaviour of the floating
   fractions of the coarse particle sizes in the rougher cell was similar
   in the main body of the froth and in the region bordering the
   concentrate weir, results indicated that the recovery of fines was
   largely due to their transportation in the froth close to the weir.  In
   the cleaner froth, however, the fine particles were affected more
   adversely by the froth conditions in the region next to the concentrate
   weir than the coarser particles.}},

Abstract = {{The vestibular cell type affected by congenital hypothyroidism (CH) was
   investigated by measuring the activity of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)
   and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), synthesizing enzymes of putative
   afferent (GABA) and efferent (acetylcholine, ACh) neurotransmitters and
   thus, respectively, hair cell I and II (HC-I, HC-II), and efferent
   terminal (ET) marker enzymes, in vestibular homogenates of control,
   congenitally hypothyroid rats (CHR) and in thyroxine-replaced CHR
   (CHR-T4) whose postnatal age ranged from 20 to 60 days old. In the
   vestibule, CH-II and its efferent cholinergic contacting bouton mature
   prior to thyroid function whereas HC-I-differentiation and its efferent
   synapse arrival are the latest events in vestibular maturation.
   Therefore, a differential effect of CH upon GAD and ChAT in CHR could be
   anticipated. In control rats as in CHR the magnitude of GAD was the same
   with time starting on the 20th day. In CHR, ChAT gradually diminished
   beginning on day 28 to become 45\% decreased with respect to control on
   the 60th postnatal day. Prevention of ChAT decrease in CHR by early
   administration of thyroxine (T4), a striking diminution of T4 and
   triiodothyronine (T3) in CHR serum and a normal level of these hormones
   found in CHR-T4 corroborated thyroid involvement. These results confirm
   the preference of hypothyroidism to affect cholinergic cell types (or
   compartments) of late maturation (HC-I-containing ET and hence 45\% ChAT
   decrease) leaving HC-I, HC-II and HC-II-connecting ET untouched,
   supported by a 55\% remanent ChAT and a constant GAD activity regardless
   of time and treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetic properties of the Na+/H+ exchanger in human platelets were
   investigated by direct measurements of pH(i) as detected with the
   fluorescent dye, BCECF.  In acid-loaded cells, the antiporter displayed
   a hyperbolic dependence regarding external Na+ with an apparent K(m) of
   38+/-4 mM (pH-omicron 7.2 at 25-degrees-C) whereas its pH(i)-dependent
   activation between 7.3 to 6.4 did not obey a Michaelian model.  External
   acidification from 7.7 to 6.5 decreased significantly the initial rate
   of Na+-dependent H+ efflux.  The amiloride derivative,
   ethylisopropylamiloride blocked this exchanger and exerted a
   non-competitive inhibition with respect to Na+-omicron (K(i) = 17 nM). 
   The cation selectivity of the external site of the antiporter was Na+ >
   Li+ > K+ and choline.  These results indicate that the BCECF technique
   allows to evaluate the main features of the Na+/H+ exchanger in human
   platelets, which possesses kinetic properties similar to those reported
   in other cell types.}},

Abstract = {{Liposomal encapsulation of the individual light and heavy chain of
   botulinum neurotoxin A was used to investigate their intra-cellular
   effects on synaptic transmission at the murine neuromuscular junction. 
   Bath-application to phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragms of liposomes containing
   heavy chain (up to 75 nM) caused no alternation in neurally-evoked
   muscle tension.  In contrast, liposomes with entrapped light chain (9-20
   nM final concentration) gave a pre-synaptic blockade of neuromuscular
   transmission that could be relieved temporarily by 4-aminopyridine, as
   for the dichain toxin.  Any contribution from contaminating intact toxin
   was excluded both by the purity and minimal toxicity in mice of the
   light chain preparations used, and by the lack of neuromuscular
   paralysis seen with liposomes containing the maximum amount of native
   toxin that could have been present in the light chain liposomes.  As
   bath-application of high concentrations of light chain in the absence of
   liposomes failed to affect neurotransmiter release, it is concluded that
   this chain alone can mimic the action of the whole toxin inside
   mammalian motor nerve endings, its predominant site of action.  Thus,
   light chain could provide a more effective probe for an intra-cellular
   component concerned with Ca2+-dependent secretion.}},

Abstract = {{A brief description is given of the various mechanisms that may lead to
   impulse formation in cardiac cells. Automaticity is based on spontaneous
   diastolic depolarization of specialized cells. Atrial and ventricular
   myocardial cells may become automatic when their resting membrane
   potential is partially depolarized and this may result in ectopic
   impulse formation. Triggered activity is another form of impulse
   generation which depends on the presence of afterdepolarizations which
   occur either during repolarization of a propagated action potential or
   when repolarization is complete. Factors determining conduction velocity
   such as cell diameter, coupling resistance and inward current are
   discussed and examples are provided showing the influence of some of
   these parameters on conduction.}},

Abstract = {{Of 686 hemophiliacs who are being treated at our institution, 402 (59\%)
   are HIV-seropositive.  Onehundredseventy-eight heterosexual partners of
   HIV-infected hemophiliacs have been serologically examined; 19 (11\%)
   are HIV-positive.  So far none of the seropositive partners suffers from
   ARC or AIDS.  The rate of heterosexual transmission of HIV is
   statistically significantly correlated with the CD4+ count of the
   HIV-infected index patient.  No such correlation was found with the
   index patient's clinical stage or the isolation of HIV from the index
   patient's blood.  Of 39 seronegative female partners who were
   investigated clinically and immunologically, 17 showed pathologically
   increased numbers of CD8+ counts.  In one case, HIV was transmitted from
   a female patient with von Willebrand's disease to her husband.  As
   compared to other groups at risk for AIDS, the rate of heterosexual HIV
   transmission is comparatively low in hemophiliacs.  The exact reason for
   this difference is not yet known.  The relevance of the
   immunopathological findings in seronegative sexual partners of
   hemophiliacs also remains to be determined.}},

Abstract = {{We have analyzed the brain pattern and time-course of c-fos-like
   proteins expression in kainic acid-induced seizures in the rat. 
   C-fos-like immunoreactivity increased initially in the hippocampus,
   notably in the dentate gyrus, at the time of the first limbic motor
   seizure (90 min after kainate).  C-fos-like labelling progressively
   involved different structures of the limbic system when the rats
   manifested a permanent epileptic state (3-6 h).  The labelling was still
   conspicuous 12 h after kainate treatment and progressively declined to
   reach control levels 48 h after kainate.  This time-course is similar to
   that produced by kainic acid on 2-deoxyglucose consumption and
   correlates with the electrographic changes previously described,
   supporting the idea that c-fos-like immunostaining may provide a useful
   marker of neuronal activity, with a cellular resolution.  Since
   anoxic-ischemic treatment produces a very slight and transient increase
   in c-fos-like immunostaining restricted to the fascia dentata,
   c-fos-like expression is seizure-related and not due to a local hypoxia
   or ischemia.}},

Abstract = {{Peroxisome proliferators have been suggested to induce liver
   carcinogenesis as a result of increased peroxisomal hydrogen peroxide
   production and cellular oxidative stress.  Primary monolayer cultures of
   hepatocytes isolated from male F344 rats were incubated in medium
   containing one of three different peroxisome proliferators and examined
   for the induction of peroxisomal CoA oxidase activity and lipid
   peroxidation.  The latter parameter was determined by measuring levels
   of conjugated dienes in lipid fractions extracted from harvested cells. 
   The peroxisome proliferators used in these studies were nafenopin and
   clofibric acid (two hypolipidemic drugs) and mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate
   (MEHP), the primary metabolite of the industrial plasticizer,
   di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP).  The relative specific activity of
   peroxisomal acyl CoA oxidase was increased by about 300\% after
   incubation for 44 h with 200-mu-M nafenopin; lower levels of induction
   were observed with clofibric acid or MEHP.  Relative to controls, the
   level of conjugated dienes was increased approximately 2-fold after
   incubation with 200-mu-M nafenopin; there was no apparent increase in
   conjugated dienes after incubation with up to 200-mu-M MEHP or 400-mu-M
   clofibric acid.  The increase in conjugated dienes with 200-mu-M
   nafenopin was inhibited by co-incubation with the antioxidant,
   N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine.  Thus, peroxisomal enzyme induction by
   nafenopin can result in membrane lipid peroxidation and monolayer
   cultures of rat hepatocytes may provide a useful model system for
   studying relationships between peroxisome proliferation, enhanced
   hydrogen peroxide production and cellular changes due to hepatic
   oxidative stress.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work in high-mobility quantum wires suggests that electron
   waveguide behavior is relevant for transport at low temperature. We
   therefore study transport in ideal electron waveguides in paying
   particular attention to their multimode properties. In order to address
   four-probe measurements, junctions between waveguides must be included
   and we consider systems with both one and two junctions. We find, first,
   that the junctions strongly filter the electrons, changing the
   distribution of the electrons among the modes of the waveguides. Second,
   the junctions give rise to both substantial longitudinal resistance and
   bend resistances which can be either local or nonlocal. The latter
   effect is a direct result of the filtering properties and decays on the
   length scale of the mean free path in a system with disorder. In a
   system where the disorder is smooth, the decay of the nonlocal bend
   resistance occurs over a distance much smaller than the transport mean
   free path but close to the total mean free path. Third, interference in
   scattering from two junctions leads to an oscillatory dependence on the
   transmission on the length between the junctions. The period of this
   oscillation is surprisingly low, being determined by mixing of the
   various modes in the waveguide, and shows up strongly in the nonlocal
   resistance. Finally, throughout this work we compare the quantum results
   to classical calculations in order to separate classical size effects
   from effects which require coherence. The classical transmission
   coefficient approach is derived from the Boltzmann equation with
   suitable boundary conditions. The basic trends are present in the
   classical calculations; however, there are large quantum deviations in
   certain cases as well as some phenomena which are strictly quantum
   mechanical, especially in a few-mode regime.}},

   viscosity and the self diffusion constants of the two species are
   reasonably well correlated via the Stokes-Einstein relation over a wide

Abstract = {{An explanation is proposed for the observed enrichment of the symmetric
   isomer OXO of heavy ozone (X being used to denote a heavy O atom).  This
   is that the energized complex may undergo a flip in which one of the end
   atoms ceases to be effectively bound to the central atom and becomes
   effectively bound to the other end atom.  The measured {[}OXO]:{[}OOX]
   ratio is reproduced if the flip frequency is the same as the
   dissociation frequency.  Calculations are carried out on the variation
   of the enhancement with the ambient gas density.  It is reasoned that
   the enhancement observed in the stratosphere is that arising in
   termolecular association and that the lower values obtained in
   laboratory experiments are artifacts.  The measured isotopic enrichment
   of carbon dioxide may arise from termolecular association O + CO +
   CO-->CO2 + CO, from enriched OXO{*} that is generated in another
   association process or from both.  The apparent scatter in the results
   is much greater than would be expected from the precision of the
   measurements.  It is suggested that this may be an artifact (similar in
   origin to those for ozone).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examined in detail the ability of anti-1 F7 to
   modulate 1F7 (CD26) surface expression as well as analyzed the
   functional relationship between the surface expression of CD3, CD2, and
   CD26 and human T cell activation.  We showed that anti-1 F7-induced
   modulation is an energy-dependent process that occurs via capping and
   internalization of the Ag-antibody complex.  Although the recovery rate
   for Ag reexpression of 1F7 following optimal modulation is relatively
   delayed, reexpression of 1F7 is greatly accelerated following phorbol
   ester treatment.  Most importantly, we demonstrated that modulation of
   the CD26 Ag leads to an enhancement in the proliferative activity of
   modulated human T cells treated with anti-CD3 or anti-CD2, which is
   preceeded by an enhancement in Ca2+ mobilization.  CD26 modulation also
   led to an increase in anti-CD3- or anti-CD2-mediated T cell clone
   proliferation.  Finally, whereas modulation of the CD26 Ag has an effect
   on CD3- or CD2-induced T cell activation, modulation of the CD3/TCR
   complex inhibits the proliferative response of T cells incubated with
   anti-CD3 plus anti-1F7 or anti-CD2 plus anti-1F7.  However, modulation
   of the CD2 structure does not affect anti-CD3-plus anti-1F7-induced
   human T cell activation.  The above results thus provide additional
   evidence that the CD26 Ag plays an integral role in the regulation of
   human T cell activation.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss a new general method to obtain the Tolman-Hawking wormhole
   instanton by simply providing the Robertson-Walker manifold with an
   extra three-sphere with a minimum radius equal to the Planck length. 
   This topology change does not imply any unphysical value of the
   effective gravitational constant and requires a total energy which is no
   longer zero.  It is argued that, even for wormholes with zero total
   energy, there is no loss of quantum coherence in the observable matter
   sector of flat spaces.  The possibility that wormholes can induce
   chaotic behavior of space-time is discussed by using a quantum-optical
   interpretation for wormhole interactions.  Also discussed in the light
   of this interpretation is the Coleman mechanism for the vanishing of the
   cosmological constant and the fixing of physical coupling constants.  A
   value zero is kept as the most probable value of the cosmological
   constant for large universes, but it is argued that the Coleman
   mechanism should be reinterpreted for small universes or the fixing of
   the coupling constants.  It is also shown that the Wheeler-DeWitt
   equation for wormholes or little baby universes is reducible to a
   Klein-Gordon wave equation and that some of the solutions should be
   associated with antiwormholes, i.e., nontrivial topological changes with
   negative energy.}},

Abstract = {{Rare earth-transition metal alloy thin films are currently the primary
   media for magnetooptic data storage.  Although they possess very good
   magnetic properties they also have several undesirable qualities.  In
   order to enhance their performance we have concentrated on attempting to
   allow the as-sputtered film structure to relax by use of pulsed laser
   beam irradiation.  This technique has several advantages over thermal
   annealing, in particular the ability to tune the laser wavelength to a
   region which is absorbing in only one layer of the disc, in order to
   confine the effects of the anneal to that layer.  By tuning a laser to
   an absorbing wavelength in Tb-Fe-Co media we have been able to produce
   local transient temperatures approaching 3000-degrees-C, modifying the
   magnetic behaviour of the samples yet without significantly affecting
   their macroscopic layer structure.  The structure has been probed by use
   of neutron and X-ray reflectivity measurements.  In analysing the
   structure of samples which had corroded severely in the atmosphere, we
   have shown the power of complementary neutron and X-ray techniques to
   remove some of the ambiguity often present in the analysis of data from
   one of the techniques alone.}},

Abstract = {{Spin-polarized photoelectron diffraction (SPPD) has previously been
   proposed as a technique for studying short-range magnetic order in
   magnetic materials, and the first experimental study of this kind was
   performed on the ionic antiferromagnetic KMnF3 {[}B. Sinkovic, B.
   Hermsmeier, and C.S. Fadley, Phys. Rev. Lett. 55, 1227 (1985)].  We
   present here a much more detailed study of SPPD for the
   antiferromagnetic transition-metal oxide MnO with a (001) surface
   orientation.  The Mn 3s and Mn 3p multiplets have been studied using
   both low-energy (192.6 eV) and high-energy (1486.7 eV) x-ray excitation
   and the intensity ratios I(5S(up))/I(7S(down)) and I(5P(up))/I(7P(down))
   have been measured as a function of both direction and temperature. Data
   obtained with the lower excitation energy and resulting in kinetic
   energies of 50-100 eV show an abrupt change or step in both the
   I(5S(up))/I(7S(down)) and I(5P(up))/I(7P(down)) intensity ratio at
   almost-equal-to 530 +/- 20 K or almost-equal-to 4.5 times the Neel
   temperature T(N).  This change is interpreted to be a new type of
   short-range-order transition occurring at what is denoted T(SR).  Also,
   these same quintet or septet intensity ratios show a weak peak at T(N),
   suggesting for the first time that SPPD has sensitivity to long-range
   magnetic order.  Data obtained for the I(5S(up))/I(7S(down)) intensity
   ratio with the higher excitation energy show no such effects, a result
   consistent with the much weaker exchange scattering expected to such
   energies.  Additional x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra and
   azimuthal scans of Mn and O core-level intensities are considered and
   these establish that (i) the sample surface had good stoichiometry and
   was very clean and well ordered, (ii) the SPPD effects observed at T(SR)
   are not due to any surface structural change, and (iii) a
   single-scattering cluster (SSC) theoretical model is at least a
   qualitatively reasonable starting point for describing such effects.  We
   also compare experimental results for the magnitudes of these steps with
   calculations based upon exchange scattering in the spin-polarized SSC
   model {[}B. Sinkovic and C.S. Fadley, Phys. Rev. B 31, 4665 (1985)], and
   conclude that there is at least qualitative agreement.  A final aspect
   of our data concerns the temperature dependence of the Mn3d-dominated
   valence-band spectra:  These spectra are found to show no measurable
   change in crossing T(SR), but by contrast exhibit a large 0.4-eV
   increase in width in going below T(N), which is in contradiction to
   recent theoretical predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Charged alkali halide clusters from a He-cooled laser vaporization
   source have been used to investigate two distinct cluster states
   corresponding to the excess-electron and excess-hole states of the
   crystal.  The production method is UV-laser vaporization of an alkali
   metal rod into a halogen-containing He flow stream, resulting in
   variable cluster composition and cooling sufficient to stabilize weakly
   bound forms.  Detection of charged clusters is accomplished without
   subsequent ionization by pulsed-field time-of-flight mass spectrometry
   of the skimmed cluster beam.  Three types of positively charged sodium
   fluoride cluster are observed, each corresponding to a distinct physical
   situation:  Na(n)F(n-1)+ (purely ionic form), Na(n+1)F(n-1)+
   (excess-electron form), and Na(n)F(n)+ (excess-hole form).  The purely
   ionic clusters exhibit an abundance pattern similar to that observed in
   sputtering and fragmentation experiments and are explained by the
   stability of completed cubic microlattice structures.  The
   excess-electron clusters, in contrast, exhibit very strong abundance
   maxima at n = 13 and 22, corresponding to the all-odd series (2n + 1 =
   jxkxl; j, k, l odd).  Their high relative stability is explained by the
   ease of Na(0) loss except when the excess electron localizes in a
   lattice site to complete a cuboid structure.  These may correspond to
   the internal F-center state predicted earlier.  A localized electron
   model incorporating structural simulation results can account for the
   observed pattern.  The excess-hole clusters, which had been proposed as
   intermediates in the ionization-induced fragmentation of neutral AHCs,
   exhibit a smaller variation in stability, indicating that the hole might
   not be well localized.}},

Abstract = {{We report results from a 1-year (September 1987 to September 1988)
   moored current meter array spanning the continental margin off French
   Guiana near 8-degrees-N in the western tropical Atlantic. Current
   profiles were recorded at three sites: at the shelf break, over the
   mid-continental slope, and at the base of the continental rise. Upper
   level mean currents showed a northwestward flowing North Brazil Current
   (NBC) and offshore retroflection of this flow into the North Equatorial
   Countercurrent from late summer through about January. Generally weak
   upper level mean flows were observed during the spring (February-June).
   Persistent northwestward mean flow was observed at 900 m depth over the
   continental slope, indicating northward transport of Antarctic
   Intermediate Waters in a subsurface boundary flow at speeds of 10-15 cm
   s-1. Deep currents over the continental rise showed a strong
   southeastward Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) extending from 2500 m
   to the bottom, with mean core speeds of nearly 30 cm s-1 at 4300 m
   depth. Transport estimates based on these data and a few geostrophic
   sections suggest a DWBC transport of 20-40 x 10(6) m-3 s-1 at this
   location. Low-frequency current fluctuations were dominated by a
   well-defined 40- to 60-day oscillation with peak-to-peak meridional
   velocity amplitudes of > 1 m s-1 during the fall. Analysis of historical
   coastal zone color scanner imagery suggests that these oscillations are
   related to quasi-periodic generation and subsequent westward movement of
   almost-equal-to 400 km diameter eddies from the NBC retroflection. These
   results contrast sharply with earlier indications of a quasi-permanent
   ``Demerara Eddy{''} in this region, and suggest that this commonly
   observed feature is in fact a transient phenomenon associated with the
   time-dependent behavior of the NBC retroflection.}},

Abstract = {{Data are presented describing the incorporation of Si in locally
   laser-melted Al(x)Ga(1-x)As-GaAs quantum well heterostructures from a
   thin-film dielectric source.  The composition of the melted material,
   the effects of the Si source (SiO2 or Si3N4) on impurity incorporation,
   and the doping behavior are examined via secondary-ion mass
   spectroscopy, electron dispersion x-ray spectroscopy, transmission
   electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy.  The data
   indicate that upon melting, a (Si)y(Al(x)Ga(1-x)As)1-y alloy is formed
   from which impurity-induced layer disordering may be effected.  After
   annealing the melt region is found to contain crystalline segregates,
   which are attributed to rapid thermal quenching of the melt. 
   Applications of these results to the fabrication of
   buried-heterostructure lasers by laser-assisted disordering are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Observational evidence is presented for planetary scale (zonal wave
   number 1-2) mixed Rossby-gravity (MRG) waves in the equatorial upper
   stratosphere (35-50 km).  These waves are detected in Limb Infrared
   Monitor of the Stratosphere (LIMS) measurements as coherently
   propagating temperature maxima of amplitude 0.1-0.3 K, which are
   antisymmetric (out of phase) about the equator, centered near
   10-degrees-15-degrees north and south latitude.  These features have
   vertical wavelengths of order 10-15 km, periods near 2-3 days, and zonal
   phase velocities close to 200 m s-1.  Both eastward and westward
   propagating waves are found, and the observed vertical wavelengths and
   meridional structures are in good agreement with the MRG dispersion
   relation.  Theoretical estimates of the zonal accelerations attributable
   to these waves suggest they do not contribute substantially to the zonal
   momentum balance in the middle atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Over an unusally brief three-day period in early August 1989,
   spectacular twilight effects indicative of a stratospheric volcanic
   cloud were seen at Salt Lake City, Utah.  Concurrent polarization lidar
   observations detected an aerosol layer at altitudes between 14 and 16 km
   in the vicinity of the tropopause.  Trajectory analyses indicate that
   the aerosol source was the relatively minor 19 July volcanic eruption of
   Santiaguito in Guatemala.  Materials injected into the lower
   stratosphere by this eruption were transported initially by tropical
   easterlies and then by a subtropical jet stream to the locale.  The
   sulfuric acid droplet cloud that formed during transport was affected
   locally by tropopause folds that promoted stratospheric-tropospheric
   exchanges.  Although lidar depolarization analysis suggests that the
   ensuing cloud microphysical processes were usually dominated by acid
   droplet crystallization effects caused by ammonia gas absorption
   (yielding 0.1-0.2 linear depolarization ratios), there is also evidence
   for ice crystal at the coldest temperatures (approximately
   -64-degrees-C) and for homogeneous deoplets.  Cloud optical thickness
   estimates are 0.01-0.02.  Mesoscale cloud bands were observed visually
   near sunset and also occasionally during daylight, another unusual
   characteristic for volcanic clouds.}},

Abstract = {{An electron-beam probe has been used to make time- and space-resolved
   measurements of the electric field in a parallel plate rf discharge. 
   Measurements were taken at a time resolution of 5 ns and a field
   resolution +/- V/cm at increments of 0.32 cm from the powered electrode.
   The detection method provides the weighted average of the electric field
   along the beam trajectory.  Measurements of fields less than 20 V/cm
   were made throughout the entire discharge.  Data were obtained for
   13.6-MHz argon discharges at 2.3 and 20 mTorr, and at rf voltage
   amplitudes of 100 and 600 V at each pressure.  The data for the
   2.3-mTorr, 600-V case show (1) that a propagating double layer forms
   during the collapse of the sheath, (2) that the field near the electrode
   points in toward the plasma at the the extreme collapse of the sheath,
   (3) that the collapse and expansion of the sheath proceeds
   asymmetrically for measurable field values, and (4) that the trajectory
   averaged electric field in the plasma has an anomalous phase shift and
   magnitude.  Similar phenomena are observed for the remaining three
   discharge cases.}},

Abstract = {{We study a two-level system linearly interacting with a set of
   quantum-mechanical oscillators, referred to at the ``bath{''}. This
   system is formally equivalent to a magnetic dipole, with spin 1/2,
   precessing with the Larmor frequency omega-o around a fixed magnetic
   field along the z axis and undergoing the influence of a fluctuating
   field along the chi-axis. These bath fluctuations are not independent of
   the state of the spin, and the crucial problem to be studied in this
   paper is precisely how to take the reaction field, i.e., the influence
   of the bath on the system, into account. We find a general result based
   on neglecting a contribution to the reaction field proportional to
   sigma-x(t) - < sigma-x(t) >, where the angle brackets denote averaging
   on both the spin and the bath space, with a density matrix corresponding
   to the spin polarized along the chi-axis. We show that under the special
   condition that the spin does not significantly depart from its initial
   state, our general result turns out to coincide with the
   noninteracting-blip approximation (NBA) of Leggett and co-workers
   {[}Rev. Mod. Phys. 59, 1 (1987)]. When we make the assumption that both
   quantum and thermal fluctuations of the bath can be neglected and that
   the time scale of the bath is virtually zero (adiabatic assumption), our
   general result turns out to coincide with the prediction of the discrete
   nonlinear Schrodinger equation (DNSE) of Davydov and Kislukha (Phys.
   Status Solidi B 59, 465 (1973){[} and Davydov ]Biology and Quantum
   Mechanics (Pergamon, Oxford, 1982)] in the two-sites case. This mean
   that the nonlinear effects proven by Kenkre and co-workers {[}Phys. Rev.
   B 34, 4959 (1986); 35, 1473 (1987)] to accompany a significant departure
   of the spin from the initial state are lost by the NBA. On the other
   hand, our approach provides a rigorous evaluation of the effects of the
   oscillator fluctuations on the predictions of the DNSE. It is shown that
   the quantum fluctuations might have a significant role also in the
   region of high temperature to which the nonadiabatic corrections of
   Kenkre and co-workers apply. Finally, it is shown that a still more
   accurate approximation would be that of neglecting a reaction field
   proportional to sigma-x(t) - < sigma-x(t) > x, where < sigma-x(t) > x
   denotes an average carried out only on the spine space. This
   approximation leads our approach to coincide with the exact result in
   the special case where both the spin and its bath are replaced by their
   classical counter-parts. Under this approximation, the detrapping would
   be equivalent to an Arrhenius-like thermal-activation process. When the
   coupling strength between the system and its bath is decreased, the spin
   is expected to depart from the initial trapped state. The dynamics of
   this process is expected to be influenced by the joint action of the
   bath fluctuations (both thermal and quantum mechanical) and of the
   nonlinearity stemming from the reaction field, and ignored by the NBA.
   This intriguing problem should be the subject of further investigations.}},

Title = {{CORRECTION OF ABNORMAL SMALL INTESTINAL CYTOSOLIC PROTEIN-KINASE-C

Abstract = {{Diabetes was induced in rats by administration of a single
   intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg body wt).  After 7
   days, one group of diabetic animals was treated with insulin for an
   additional 5 days.  Control, diabetic and diabetic + insulin rats were
   then killed, their distal small intestines were removed and the
   epithelial cells were examined and compared with respect to
   polyphosphoinositide turnover, total protein kinase C activity and
   cellular distribution, and 1,2-diacylglycerol mass and production.  The
   results of these experiments demonstrated that, compared with their
   control counterparts, the intestines from diabetic rats had a decreased
   turnover of polyphosphoinositides, but an increase in 1,2-diacylglycerol
   mass which was a result, at least in part, of an increase in the
   synthesis of this lipid de novo.  Total protein kinase C activity was
   decreased in the diabetic rats due to a decrease in cytosolic activity,
   with no significant change in particulate activity.  Moreover, insulin
   administration for 5 days to diabetic animals did not affect their
   lowered intestinal polyphosphoinositide turnover, but did further
   accentuate their increased 1,2-diacylglycerol mass and synthesis de
   novo; this treatment also corrected total protein kinase C activity by
   increasing the cytosolic activity of this enzyme.  These results
   indicate that signalling mechanisms involving polyphosphoinositides,
   1,2-diacylglycerol and protein kinase C are abnormal in the intestines
   of diabetic rats and that some of these biochemical parameters can be
   modulated by insulin administration in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied in a crossed-beam experiment under optically thin
   conditions the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum of argon produced by
   electron impact excitation.  The most prominent features of the EUV
   spectrum between 40 and 110 nm are the resonance lines of ArI at 104.8
   nm and 106.7 nm and of ArII at 91.96 nm and 93.21 nm.  Absolute cross
   sections of these lines at 200 eV are measured by the relative-flow
   technique and compared with previous estimates.  The measured emission
   cross section values at 200 eV for the ArI lines at 104.8 nm and 106.7
   nm are 23.1 X 10-18 cm2 and 9.32 X 10-18 cm2, respectively, with an
   uncertainty of 14\%.  When compared with electron energy loss estimates
   of the direct excitation cross section these values establish that
   cascading is larger for the ArI resonance lines than previous emission
   experiments have indicated.  In addition all the emission cross sections
   for the ArI, II Rydberg series in the EUV spectral interval are measured
   at 0.5 nm resolution.  The far ultraviolet (FUV) spectrum of Ar is also
   surveyed for the first time and is found to consist of ArII multiplets
   from simultaneous ionization-excitation.}},

Title = {{EFFECTS OF DIMETHYLSULFOXIDE AND MERCURIAL SULFHYDRYL-REAGENTS ON WATER
   AND SOLUTE PERMEABILITY OF RAT-KIDNEY BRUSH-BORDER MEMBRANES}},

Abstract = {{The effects of dimethylsulfoxide, DMSO, and mercurial sulfhydryl
   reagents have been studied on water and small solute permeability of rat
   renal brush border membrane vesicles.  Water and solute permeability was
   measured by mixing membrane vesicles with hypertonic solutions in a
   stopped-flow apparatus and following osmotically-induced changes in
   vesicular volume via changes in scattered light intensity.  The rate
   constant of the fast osmotic shrinkage is proportional to the osmotic
   water permeability, while the rate constant of the slow reswelling phase
   is proportional to the solute permeability.  Using mannitol as the
   osmotic agent, the osmotic shrinkage of rat renal brush border membrane
   vesicles followed a biphasic time course.  80\% of the vesicles shrunk
   with a rate constant of approx. 50 s-1 and 20\% with a rate constant of
   approx. 2 s-1.  DMSO decreased dose-dependently the amplitude of the
   fast osmotic shrinkage, without affecting its rate constant.  In
   contrast to DMSO, HgCl2 decreased the rate constant but not the
   amplitude of the fast osmotic shrinkage of renal brush border vesicles.
   Between 40-50-mu-M HgCl2, the inhibition of the fast osmotic shrinkage
   was completed.  DMSO and HgCl2 increase the activation energy of water
   permeation in renal membranes from 3 to 12-15 kcal/mol.  DMSO and HgCl2
   did not affect the rate constant of the slow osmotic shrinkage of renal
   membrane vesicles and were also without effect on osmotic shrinkage of
   small intestinal brush border and pure phospholipid vesicles.  In renal
   brush border membranes, HgCl2 at low concentrations (< 10-mu-M)
   increased by 15-fold the permeability to NaCl and urea but not to
   mannitol, an effect which precedes the inhibition of water permeability
   at higher HgCl2 concentrations.  The increase in small solute
   permeability was irreversible while the inhibition of water permeability
   could be reversed with cysteine and dithiothreitol.  We conclude that
   water and small solute pathways in rat renal brush border membranes are
   completely separate entities, which are effected differently by DMSO and
   HgCl2.  These pathways for water and solutes must be membrane proteins
   since neither DMSO nor HgCl2 affect the permeability properties of pure
   phospholipid vesicles.}},

   analyse the functional implications of the deviations from the
   consensus, these positions have been reverted to the canonical
   configuration.  The following results were obtained:  (i) inversion of
   the purine/pyrimidine pair at position 11/24 and change of the purine at
   position 8 into the universally conserved U had no functional
   consequence whereas replacements of U9 by G9 and of U14 by A14 decreased
   the efficiency of selenocysteine insertion as measured by translation of
   the fdhF message; (ii) deleting one basepair in the aminoacyl acceptor
   stem, thus creating the canonical 7 bp configuration, inactivated
   tRNA(Sec); (iii) replacement of the extra arm by that of a
   serine-inserting tRNA abolished the activity whereas reduction by 1 base
   or the insertion of three bases partially reduced function; (iv) change
   of the anticodon to that of a serine inserter abolished the capacity to
   decode UGA140 whereas the alteration to a cysteine codon permitted 30\%
   read-through.  However, the variant with the serine-specific anticodon
   efficiently inserted selenocysteine into a gene product when the UGA140
   of the fdhF mRNA was replaced by a serine codon (UCA).  Significantly,
   none of these changes resulted in the non-specific incorporation of
   selenocysteine into protein, indicating that the mRNA context also plays
   a major role in directing insertion.  Taken together, the results
   demonstrate that the 8-basepair acceptor stem and the long extra arm are
   crucial determinants of tRNA(Sec) which enable decoding of UGA140 in the
   fdhF message.}},

Abstract = {{Pontine parabrachial neurons have been suggested to play a regulatory
   role in both respiratory and sleep cycle control.  Encouraged by the
   finding that microinjections of the cholinergic agonist carbachol into
   the medial pontine reticular formation (mPRF) of the cat produced
   respiratory changes paralleling those observed during rapid eye movement
   (REM) sleep (Neurosci. Lett., 102 (1989) 211-216), this study tested the
   hypothesis that cholinergic mechanisms in the mPRF can also cause
   state-dependent changes in the discharge of parabrachial neurons.  This
   paper describes extracellular recordings of parabrachial neurons during
   REM sleep and during the carbachol-induced REM sleep-like state (DCarb).
   Cells which were activated (REM-on) or inactivated (REM-off) during REM
   maintained these same state-dependent firing patterns during the DCarb
   state.  These results support the hypothesis that cholinergic mechanisms
   in the mPRF can cause state-dependent changes in the discharge of
   parabrachial neurons.}},

   Gold sputter or ion plating deposited films were used to reduce friction

   lubicating films to prevent diffusion of the substrate into the gold at
   high temperature.
   The friction and wear of the unlubricated specimens were unacceptable. 
   Friction coefficients were generally greater than 1.0.  The ion-plated
   gold films when used with a rhodium diffusion barrier reduced friction
   by almost a factor of 2.  Wear was also substantially reduced.  The
   sputter-deposited films were not adherent unless the substrate was
   sputter cleaned immediately prior to film deposition.  Palladium did not
   function as a diffusion barrier.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional single pass and unidirectional multipass scratch testing
   has been used to study the contact mechanical strength of reactive
   magnetron sputtered AISI 310 SS deposited on construction steel and high
   speed steel substrates (AISI 4137 and M2). The coatings, doped with
   different amounts of carbon for microstructure modifications, are shown
   to be perfectly adhered to their substrates. At the high contact
   pressures used in scratch testing surface damage is, above all, ductile
   plastic deformation related to a system scratch hardness essentially
   controlled by the substrate. Surface cracking, especially brittle and
   tensile, through thickness cracks is detrimental with respect to wear
   behaviour.
   Owing to transfer layer build-up, cemented carbide indenters which allow
   more realistic adhesive friction enhance surface crack formation.
   Multipass scratch testing under constant low and medium loads in
   conjunction with damage volume assessment using three dimensional
   profilometry yields detailed information on the surface damage
   mechanisms under contact mechanically more realistic conditions. This
   leads to considerably better prediction of system strength with respect
   to wear. For the high friction, cemented carbide indenter system
   strength optimization has been obtained for a 2 wt.\% carbon-doped mixed
   (microcrystalline and amorphous) coating corresponding to a mechanical
   compromise between high composite hardness and toughness.}},

Abstract = {{A sampling and analysis method for airborne dibutyltin and dioctyltin
   dichlorides was developed.  The air samples were collected on
   glass-fibre filters.  The chlorides were desorbed with n-hexane and
   converted into hydrides using sodium borohydride.  The hydride
   derivatives were analysed by capillary gas chromatography with flame
   ionization detection (FID).  The identity of dibutyltin and dioctyltin
   dihydrides in standard solutions was confirmed by gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and GC-Fourier transform
   infrared spectrometry.  The presence of tin compounds in the fumes
   released from heated PVC plastics (at 225-degrees-C) was shown by GC-MS.
   The detection limit of the method was 0.02 mu-g/ml (for tin),
   corresponding to a concentration of 0.0003 mg/m3 in an air samples of
   120 1.  The sensitivity of the method was about 50 times better with FID
   compared with optimum electron-capture detection conditions.  This

   MBP underwent mono-and multi-(ADP-ribosyl)ation by cholera toxin and
   thus modified MBP migrated on the gel as several discrete protein bands,
   the molecular masses of which were apparently larger by 500-2000 daltons
   than that of the corresponding untreated MBP. On average, 1.1 mol of
   ADP-ribosyl residue was incorporated into 1 mol of MBP. Four types of
   purified MBPs were also ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin dependent on

   dynamics emerges from a globally consistent lagrangian.  The canonical
   formulation leads to a non-Sugawara hamiltonian that can be exactly
   quantised to generate a Virasoro algebra with nontrivial central
   extension.}},

Abstract = {{An active-site peptide from maize (Zea mays L.) phosphoenolpyruvate
   carboxylase has been isolated, sequenced and identified in the primary
   structure following chemical modification/inactivation of the enzyme by
   pyridoxal 5' -phosphate and reduction with sodium borohydride.  The
   amino acid sequence of the purified dodecapeptide is
   Val-Gly-Tyr-Ser-Asp-Ser-Gly-Ly{*}s-Asp-Ala-Gly-Arg, which corresponds
   exactly to residues 599-610 in the deduced primary sequence of the
   maize-leaf enzyme.  Comparative analysis of the deduced amino acid
   sequences of the enzyme from Escherichia coli, Anacystis nidulans and
   C3, C4 and Crassulacean acid metabolism plants indicates that they all
   contain this specific lysyl group, as well as a high degree of sequence
   homology flanking this species-invariant residue.  This observation
   suggests a critical role for Lys-606 during catalysis by maize
   phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase.  This represents the first
   identification of a specific, species-invariant active-site residue in
   the enzyme.}},

   observation is in contrast with topotaxial relationships obtained
   between Al2O3 particles formed by internal oxidation of NbAl alloys
   where close-packed planes are parallel:  (0001)s parallel-to (110)Nb. 
   The atomistic structure of the interface was identified by high

Abstract = {{The ectoparasitic dinoflagellate Apodinium floodi n. sp. is reported
   from the pelagic tunicate Oikopleura labradoriensis (Phylum Chordata,
   Subphylum Urochordata, Class Larvacea).  The trophozoite of A. floodi,
   which reaches 890 mu-m in length, is encased by a membranous envelope
   and is attached to the tail of the host.  Divisions of the young
   trophozoite produce an elongate, single file of sporogenic cells. 
   Later, divisions perpendicular to the long axis of the trophozoite occur
   in distal sporogenic cells, and ultimately dinospores are produced.  An
   attachment organelle or peduncle penetrates the host's musculature,
   crosses the hemocoel and reaches the notochord; at that level, 2
   principal rhizoids, each provided with a condyle, a dense lining, and an
   absorptive outer layer of tubules, diverge from the peduncle and invade
   the outer region of the notochord.  Tumor-like growths in the lumen of
   the notochord, and other abnormal proliferations of the host's cells,
   occur.}},

   of 10 and 40 channels at the center frequencies of 167 and 500 MHz,
   respectively, and a frequency resolution of 5.5 MHz have been
   accomplished.  The diffraction efficiencies of 11.5 and 4.0\% per watt
   of RF drive power at the center frequencies of 167 and 500 MHz,
   respectively, and a dynamic range larger than 16 dB was measured. 
   Further integration of this IOSA with a laser source, a photodetector
   array, and electronic driving circuits could produce a monolithically
   integrated optic RF spectrum analyzer.}},

   was measured in vitro using milk samples enriched with Ca-42 and

   all milks.  The least equilibration with micellar casein was found with
   premature infant formula, for which the ratio of slopes of the

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the tolerance of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L)
   Millsp. ICPL 316) to low-P conditions in relation to the utilization of
   P among the major biochemical fractions, soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr
   cv. Tamahomare) was used as a reference crop. Pigeon pea and soybean
   were cultured hydroponically in a glasshouse for 28 days with three
   levels of orthophosphate (P(i)). Low, control, and high-P plants were
   supplied with 0.1, 1.0, and 10 ppm P respectively. In another
   experiment, pigeon pea seedlings were grown in a solution culture for 48
   days with four levels of P(i) concentrations ranging from 0 to 30 ppm.
   Results of the two experiments indicated that pigeon pea requires
   relatively low concentrations of external P(i) for growth compared to
   soybean. Low-P treatment significantly reduced leaf area, leaf dry
   weight, and shoot weight in both species but the reduction was more
   pronounced in soybean than in pigeon pea. Low-P treatment did not
   significantly affect the root dry weight in both species. Dry matter
   partitioning to soybean leaves at the low-P treatment was far lower than
   that to pigeon pea leaves. These results suggest that the decrease in
   dry matter partitioning to leaves led to a greater reduction in total
   dry weight in soybean compared to pigeon pea. Although the reduction in
   the total lipid-P amount associated with the low-P treatment was similar
   in both species, the low-P treatment led to a 40 and 64\% reduction in
   residue-P (protein-P, nucleic acid-P, and phytin-P) in pigeon pea and
   soybean respectively. For the soluble-P (mainly P(i)) fraction, the
   reduction was more severe in soybean than pigeon pea. The proportion of
   the soluble-P fraction did not increase much with increasing P supply in
   pigeon pea whilst in soybean, a greater proportion of P was present as
   soluble-P at the high P levels. The results suggest that the ``pool
   size{''} of inorganic-P fraction in pigeon pea may be smaller than that
   of soybean. Our results suggest that pigeon pea is more tolerant to
   low-P treatment compared to soybean because it maintains relatively low
   concentration of inorganic-P at the low-P conditions, presumably due to
   the efficient incorporation of the external P(i) into residue-P.}},

   scans of Mg K-alpha excited Al2s emission from linear atomic Al chains,
   and compared to corresponding scans of Cu LVV Auger emission from linear

   importance of multiple-scattering effects in substrate emission along
   low-index directions.  Intensity reductions in forward scattering due to
   MS defocusing effects are seen for both Al and Cu.  However, for Al they
   are found to be significantly slower in turning on with distance along
   the chain.  A systematic investigation revealed that this difference

   This material dependence should be important in analyzing such

Abstract = {{Effect of subacute insecticide exposure was studied in male albino mice
   treated with phosphamidon, propoxur or aldrin at 1/40 LD50 dose
   intraperitoneally daily for 8 wk.  The parameters studies included body
   weight, pentobarbitone (50 mg/kg) sleeping time, chlorpromazine (6
   mg/kg) induced motor incoordination and convulsions induced by leptazol
   (100 mg/kg) and electrical stimulation (18 mA for 0.2 msec).  While body
   weight and electrically induced convulsions were not affected, the
   effect of various drugs was significantly decreased.  The observed
   changes may be due to the induction of hepatic drug metabolising enzymes
   by the insecticides.  The study suggests that certain dose adjustment of
   drugs may be necessary in those exposed to insecticides over long
   periods.}},

Abstract = {{Black beans with 10\% moisture content were stored for one year in
   different packaging materials under simulated tropical conditions of 30
   +/- 3-degrees-C, 70-80\% RH.  Due to improved moisture control, beans
   stored in impermeable packages (polypropylene/polyethylene and aluminum
   foil laminate) hardened at a lower rate than beans kept in conventional
   woven polypropylene bags.  Beans stored underground in impermeable
   packages hardened even less due to lower temperatures.  Modified
   atmospheres of CO2 and N2 did not have a major effect on hardness of
   roasted and untreated beans.  Optimal moisture content for storage is
   10-14\% which is adequate for delaying hardening and minimizing
   mechanical damage during the handling of beans.}},

Abstract = {{A nobel modulatory site on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor that
   is sensitive to sulfhydryl redox reagents was recently described.  Here
   we report that this redox modulatory site is susceptible to oxidation by
   reactive oxygen species endogenous to the CNS.  Oxygen free radicals
   generated by xanthine and xanthine oxidase were observed to decrease
   NMDA-induced changes in intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations and
   NMDA-evoked cation currents in cortical neurons in culture.
   Additionally, a sublethal production of free radicals by xanthine and
   xanthine oxidase reversed a dithiothreitol-induced enhancement of
   NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity in vitro.  These results show that NMDA
   receptor function is modulated at its redox site by endogenous
   substances that normally accompany tissue reperfusion following an
   ischemic event.  This novel mechanism for NMDA receptor regulation may
   have profound implications in the outcome of glutamate neurotoxicity in
   vivo.}},

Abstract = {{In field trials conducted at Samaru, Nigeria in 1983, 1984 and 1985,
   damage to dauro millet by the millet stem borer, Coniesta igenfusalis
   Hampson (Lepidoptera:  Pyralidae), varied between years and dates of
   planting.  The crop was almost completely destroyed by the stem borer
   during 1984.  Based on 1983 and 1985 data, the period between 10 July
   and 2 August appears to be best for planting dauro millet at Samaru for
   least stem borer damage while planting between 11 and 30 July appears to
   be optimum for grain yields.
   The direct sown crop suffered more damage than the transplanted crops in
   all years but only in 1985 was the difference significant.  There was no
   significant difference between slant and upright transplanting in terms
   of stem borer damage and grain yield.  It is concluded, therefore, that
   the choice of planting method would depend on its convenience to the
   farmer.}},

Abstract = {{The antiatherogenic effect of high density lipoprotein (HDL) has been
   attributed to either an inhibition of cholesterol uptake or to reversed
   cholesterol transport from peripheral cells.  In order to determine
   whether HDL competitively blocks receptor-mediated low density
   lipoprotein (LDL) binding and uptake, bovine aortic enothelial cells
   (BAECs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles Medium (DMEM)
   containing 10\% LDL-free fetal bovine serum, and incubated with
   I-125-LDL in concentrations of either 10 or 25-mu-g protein/mL.  Varying
   amounts of HDL (0-200-mu-g/mL) were added to the media.  Following a
   twenty-four hour incubation period at 37-degrees-C, I-125-LDL binding
   and uptake were measured.
   At the lower concentration of I-125-LDL, which represents high-affinity
   receptor binding, there was no significant difference in either binding
   or uptake within the range of HDL concentrations studied.  At the higher
   concentration of LDL, however, there was a marked inhibition of
   I-125-LDL binding (p < .006) and uptake (p <, 001; ANOVA), which did not
   saturate at the highest HDL concentrations used.  These data suggest
   that HDL does not influence high-affinity, receptor-mediated binding and
   uptake of LDL but that its effect is seen at a concentration of LDL
   representing nonspecific binding.  The lack of saturation at increasing
   concentrations of HDL also indicates that HDL-receptor interaction is
   not essential for the effect.}},

Abstract = {{Traumatic head injury is the principal cause of death and serious
   physical disability in adolescents and young adult.  Hearing loss is a
   common sequela of head trauma.  The results of pure tone and auditory
   brainstem response (ABR) assessment of minor head injury revealed that
   20 per cent of these cases showed impairment of hearing including both
   conductive and sensorineural hearing loss mostly in the high frequencies
   loss.
   ABR findings showed a significant difference of absolute wave V latency
   and interwave (III-V) latencies at repetition rate 11.1 click/sec., and
   a highly significant difference at a repetition rate of 51.1 click/sec.,
   compared with the control group.
   In severe head injury, conductive hearing loss was found in only one
   case, in which a longitudinal fracture of the temporal bone was
   identified radiologically.  No ABR could be recorded at a repetition
   rate of 11.1 click/sec. in either ear of this case; this patient died a
   few days later.
   Three cases were found with a mixed sensorineural hearing loss; one of
   them showed a longitudinal fracture radiologically.  ABR findings in two
   cases showed prolongation of wave V and I-V interwave latencies, and the
   third case showed absence of ABR recording.
   In comatose patients, an ABR grading system is a more sensitive index of
   brainstem dysfunction than the simple division of normal versus abnormal
   ABR waves and interwave latencies.  Presence or prolongation of wave V
   and interwave latency I-V even in one ear is of good prognostic value in
   the comatosed patient.}},

Abstract = {{We studied whether regular treatment with tranquilizing and hypnotic
   drugs among 30,344 twins in Sweden 15-47 years old was associated with
   robust indicators of poor health.  Longitudinal psychiatric diagnoses
   and subsequent suicides were analyzed with data from cross-sectional
   health questionnaires.  Women were almost twice as likely to report
   medication, even those with psychiatric inpatient diagnoses.  Within
   each of mental, somatic, and lifestyle domains, medication was more
   frequent among those with multiple problems.  The partial odds for
   medication for those with a diagnosis of psychosis were 11.81, affective
   disorder 10.94, neurotic or personality disorder 11.09, alcoholism 5.00,
   and drug addiction 13.92.  We conclude that reported regular treatment
   with tranquilizing and hypnotic drugs in young Swedish adults was
   significantly associated with diagnosed and subjective somatic and
   mental health problems, and thus largely in agreement with current peer
   guidelines.  The reasons why women were more often treated than men

Abstract = {{The impact of a pulp and paper mill effluent on periphytic algae growing
   under controlled conditions in experimental streams was manifested as a
   drop in species richness and diversity, and changes in the taxonomic
   structure of the algal community.  The decrease in diatom density was
   compensated by the relative contribution of Chlorophyceae, which
   increased with increasing effluent concentration (0.5\%, 2.5\% and 10\%
   v/v).  The presence of effluent also led to a rise in heterotrophic
   biomass and activity.  However, the stream with the highest effluent
   concentration (10\% v/v) showed a greater autotrophic biomass, and had
   the lowest photosynthetic efficiency, suggesting that algal species
   which develop under such conditions exhibit important heterotrophic
   activity.  This hypothesis was supported by micro-autoradiographic
   studies, which showed that Chlamydomonas sp. cells were very strongly
   marked after incubation in the presence of amino acids, while diatoms
   showed little or no radioactivity.  This suggested that the dissolved
   organic carbon in the effluent acted as a eutrophication factor for
   periphytic algal communities.}},

   VICTORIAN BROWN COAL}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{1990}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{The nature of the depositional environments which led to the formation
   of the very extensive Victorian Brown Coal deposits located in
   Southeastern Australia, has been the subject of numerous publications. 
   Previous publications on this subject have suggested that these coals
   were laid down in an extensive series of peat swamps similar to the
   Florida Everglades (U.S.A.).  One of the central premises of this
   depositional model has been that lithotype formation is dependent on the
   degree of inundation of the original peat-forming environment. 
   Specifically, it proposes an inverse relationship between the degree of
   inundation and the ``lightness{''} (of colour) of the resulting
   lithotype, with the light and pale lithotypes being deposited in fully
   inundated environments.
   In this manuscript, the evidence on which this depositional model is
   based, and other data, from a variety of disciplines, relevant to the
   question of the nature of the depositional environments of these coals,
   is reviewed.  The resulting synthesis of data has led the present
   authors to conclude that previous depositional models cannot fully
   account for the observed chemical, physical and geological
   characteristics of these coals.
   Therefore, a new depositional model is proposed which seeks to account
   for these observed characteristics.  It is concluded by the present
   authors that deposition of these coals probably took place in an
   extensive and long-lived series of ombrogenous (raised or domed)
   forested peat swamps, structurally analogous to modern peat
   accumulations in SE Asia.
   Further it is suggested that lithotype formation is governed not by the
   degree of inundation of the original peat-forming environments, but
   rather by the degree of aerobic degradation experienced by the initial
   peat accumulations, with pale and light coals representing the products
   of the most severely degraded peats.}},

Abstract = {{Ample evidence demonstrates that many chemicals, at some concentration,
   affect the nervous system.  Disastrous incidents resulting from food
   adulteration, medical experiments and pharmaceutical errors, and
   industrial and environmental exposures warn of the serious potential for
   neurotoxicants to affect human health.  This article identifies the
   approximately 185 epidemiological behavioral neurotoxicology studies
   published through 1989 of extended workplace exposures to chemicals.
   Approximately 250 different tests have been administered to exposed
   workers in primarily cross sectional studies, and statistically
   significant decrements were reported in 43\% of the approximately 1100
   test/population administrations (virtually all 185 studies employed
   several of the 250 tests).  In this research, 28 different chemicals as
   well as multiple chemical exposures have been studied.  The most
   extensive findings are seen in research on carbon disulfide, lead,
   mercury, and multiple solvent exposures, although three or more
   independent studies also have been reported on workers exposed to
   styrene and organophosphates.  Analyzing the consistent findings in
   these studies, they reveal a broad spectrum of cognitive, motor and
   affective or personality changes.  The most frequently reported
   functional deficits are in tests of intelligence, memory, spatial
   relations, coordination, and speed plus coordination.  Individual
   behavioral measurement methods and significant test batteries that have
   been employed to assess changes in human nervous system functions to
   determine the degree of risk posed by new and established chemicals are
   described; two of those human behavioral test batteries are predicted to
   dominate research at the onset of the 1990's.
   There is a lack of parallelism between the human test methods found in
   these batteries and the US Environmental Protection Protection Agency
   (EPA) and Food and Drug Agency (FDA) guideline methods for
   pre-production screening of chemicals and food additives in animals, and
   it appears unlikely that the widely employed human and animal behavioral
   test batteries, as currently evaluated, could identify disease complexes
   newly suspected of having a chemical etiology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper treats the detection and recovery from transient faults that
   cause errors in microprogrammed control units.  Error detection is based
   upon a particular form of signature analysis, viz, the run-time
   computation of a value (the signature) that depends strictly on the
   microprogram path (the sequence) under execution.  The microprogram is
   statically segmented (sequences are defined in a fixed way, at design
   time), and an anticipated signature is associated with each sequence. 
   At run time, at the start of each sequence the computation of the
   signature is restarted, whereas at the end the computed signature is
   compared with the anticipated signature of that sequence.
   If the check is passed, the status of the control unit is saved in
   suitable registers, and the previously saved status is discarded.  If
   the check fails, the last-saved status is restored (rolled back) and
   microprogram execution restarts from this last-saved point.  The failed
   microprogram sequence is thus executed again (error recovery).
   This error recovery technique covers (detect and recover) transient
   faults that corrupt the right sequencing in conventional microprogrammed
   units (eg, improper jumps from one sequence to another one).  This
   technique is evaluated by determining the relation between the obtained
   error coverage capability and the necessary cost increases (added
   circuit area).  The user defines the values of the number of
   signature-field bits.
   The method is characterized by low costs; the solution can be tailored
   to application specific requirements by choosing the number of
   signature-field bits appropriate to the foreseen fault rates, fault
   characterization, and failure costs.  The method is particularly suited
   to low fault rates where the probability that all the micro-instructions
   of a segment are affected by a fault is very low, so that the
   probability that the same microprogram segment must be repeated more

Abstract = {{The boundary region of the ETA BETA II RFP experiment has been
   investigated by movable instrumented limiters equipped with Langmuir
   probes, heat flux probes, and surface collectors.
   Edge plasma temperature and density are of the order of 10 eV and 0.5-1
   X 10(19) m-3.  The heat deposition on the movable limiter is asymmetric
   between the electron and the ion drift side, and a power flux of the
   order of 300 MW/m2 is measured on the electron drift side.  This high
   value has been explained by the presence of current carrying electrons
   coming from the hotter region of the plasma, through a stochastic region
   extending into the plasma.
   Surface collectors have been inserted in the plasma and analyzed by RBS
   and ERD techniques.  The implanted impurities are mainly oxygen and
   metallic elements of the liner, both showing a quite linear build up as
   a function of the exposure time, whereas the amount of trapped deuterium
   tends to a stationary value after a few discharges.  The deuterium flux
   incident on the wall has been inferred, the impurity yield estimated,
   and the generation mechanisms discussed.
   The deposition radial profiles give information on the screening
   capability of the boundary region.  The estimate of the transmitted
   impurity flux appears in agreement with what is expected in terms of the
   known impurity content in the discharge.  The stochastic behaviour of
   the magnetic field in a wide portion of the plasma near the wall is
   suggested to improve an uniform thermal load, and a more effective
   screening of heavy impurities.}},

Abstract = {{The short-wavelength-prime (SWP) detector of the International
   Ultraviolet Explorer should operate near the photon-counting limit, but
   the noise levels in flat-field images are several times higher.  The
   exaggerated noise can be traced to the incomplete removal of the
   pixel-to-pixel granularity of the television frames by the prevailing
   Spectral Image Processing System.  An empirical noise model for the
   current-epoch photometric linearization strategy and one for a
   hypothetical processing system that achieves complete flat fielding of
   the raw images are derived.  A formula is then proposed to predict the
   signal-to-noise ratio in the measured flux of an emission line-possibly
   superimposed on a smooth continuum-in an IUE low-dispersion (5 angstrom
   resolution) far-ultraviolet (1150 angstrom-1950 angstrom) spectrum as
   recorded with the SWP camera.  For illustration, I specialize the
   formula to the important C IV-lambda-1549 feature of F-K stars.  The S/N
   relation permits one to determine sensitivity limits, upper limits in
   faint exposures, and optimum exposure times.}},

Abstract = {{The intelligent Monitoring System (IMS) is a computer system for
   processing data from seismic arrays and simpler stations to detect,
   locate, and identify seismic events.  The first operational version
   processes data from two high-frequency arrays (NORESS and ARCESS) in
   Norway.  The IMS computers and functions are distributed between the
   NORSAR Data Analysis Center (NDAC) near Oslo and the Center for Seismic
   Studies (Center) in Arlington, Virginia.  The IMS modules at NDAC
   automatically retrieve data from a disk buffer, detect signals, compute
   signal attributes (amplitude, slowness, azimuth, polarization, etc.),
   and store them in a commercial relational database management system
   (DBMS).  IMS makes scheduled (e.g., hourly) transfers of the data to a
   separate DBMS at the Center.  Arrival of new data automatically
   initiates a ``knowledge-based system (KBS){''} that interprets these
   data to locate and identify (earthquake, mine blast, etc.) seismic
   events.  This KBS uses general and area-specific seismological knowledge
   represented in rules and procedures.  For each event, unprocessed data
   segments (e.g., 7 min for regional events) are retrieved from NDAC for
   subsequent display and analyst review.  The interactive analysis modules
   include integrated waveform and map display/manipulation tools for
   efficient analyst validation or correction of the solutions produced by
   the automated system.  Another KBS compares the analyst and automatic
   solutions to mark overruled elements of the knowledge base.  Performance
   analysis statistics guide subsequent changes to the knowledge base so it
   improves with experience.
   The IMS is implemented on networked Sun workstations, with a 56 kbps
   satellite link bridging the NDAC and Center computer networks.  The
   software architecture is modular and distributed, with processes
   communicating by messages and sharing data via the DBMS.  The IMS
   processing requirements are easily met with major processes (i.e.,
   signal processing, KBS, and DBMS) on separate Sun 4/2xx workstations. 
   This architecture facilitates expansion in functionality and number of
   stations.
   The first version was operated continuously for 8 weeks in late-1989. 
   The Center functions were then transferred to NDAC for subsequent
   operation.  Later versions will be distributed among NDAC, Scripps/IGPP
   (San Diego), and the Center to process data from many stations and
   arrays.  The IMS design is ambitious in its integration of many new
   computer technologies, but the operational performance of the first
   version demonstrates its validity.  Thus, IMS provides a new generation
   of automated seismic event monitoring capability.}},

Abstract = {{We have validated an established animal model of acute inflammatory
   bowel disease in indomethacin-treated rats. Studies in both in vitro and
   in vivo chromium-51-labelled ethylenediamine tetra-acetate (Cr-51-EDTA)
   permeability and tissue myeloperoxidase activity, a marker of
   inflammatory cell invasion, showed increased permeability and enzyme
   levels, respectively, in treated animals compared to controls (in vitro
   Cr-51-EDTA permeability: (mean (SE)) control 0.10 (0.02)-mu-l/mg per
   tissue, experimental 0.17 (0.02) (p < 0.01, 2 way analysis of variance);
   in vivo Cr-51-EDTA permeability: control 3.9 (1.3) (\% dose recovered),
   experimental 12.1 (1.5) (p < 0.01); tissue myeloperoxidase: control 10.8
   (0.4) mU/mg, experimental 17.2 (0.5) (p < 0.01). Pretreatment or
   simultaneous treatment of indomethacin-treated animals with
   glucocorticoids, sulphasalazine, or tetracycline reduced the
   permeability changes and the tissue inflammatory response (in vitro
   CR-51-EDTA permeability: (mean (SE)) sulphasalazine+indomethacin 0.11
   (0.2)-mu-l/mg tissue (p < 0.01), prednisolone +/- indomethacin 0.12
   (0.02) (p < 0.01), tetracycline+indomethacin 0.12 (0.02) (p < 0.01)).
   Glucocorticoids and sulphasalazine, but not tetracycline, administered
   after the indomethacin also partially corrected the permeability and
   inflammatory changes induced by indomethacin (in vitro Cr-51-EDTA
   permeability: sulphasalazine 0.15 (0.02)-mu-l/mg, p < 0.02; prednisolone
   0.12 (0.02)-mu-l/mg, p < 0.01). This approach was used to investigate
   the effects of two different thromboxane synthetase inhibitors in
   indomethacin-treated animals. Simultaneous treatment with thromboxane
   synthetase inhibitors and indomethacin prevented the Cr-51-EDTA
   permeability and tissue myeloperoxidase increases induced by
   indomethacin alone (in vitro Cr-51-EDTA permeability: thromboxane
   synthetase inhibitors+indomethacin 0.11 (0.1) mu-l/mg (p0.01); tissue
   myeloperoxidase: 11 (0.4) mU/mg, (p < 0.01). Thromboxane synthetase
   inhibitors administered after the indomethacin also partially corrected
   the permeability and inflammatory changes induced by indomethacin (in
   vitro Cr-51-EDTA permeability: thromboxane synthetase inhibitors 0.12
   (0.02) mU/mg (p < 0.01); tissue myeloperoxidase 13.8 (0.5) (p < 0.01).
   These studies indicate that thromboxane synthetase inhibitors partially
   correct the intestinal lesion nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
   enteropathy, and may therefore be of use in inflammatory bowel diseases
   in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Autoxidation of dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC) bilayers
   photoinitiated by benzophenone takes place by a free radical chain
   mechanism according to product studies of the cis,trans and
   trans,trans-9-and-13-linoleate hydroperoxides formed and kinetic studies
   of the reaction order as a function of light intensity. The absolute
   rate constant for hydrogen abstraction from DLPC bilayers by peroxyl
   radicals is found to be 36.1 M-1 s-1 at 37-degrees-C. Preliminary
   measurements of activities of phenolic antioxidants, alpha-tocopherol
   (alpha-T), 2,2,5,7, 8-pentamethyl-6-hydroxychroman (PMHC), 2,5,7,
   8-tetramethyl-6-hydroxychroman-2-carboxylate (Trolox), and
   2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) by oxygen uptake studies during
   inhibition periods using photoinitiation gave uncorrected inhibition
   rate constants, k(inh), for alpha-T, PMHC, and Trolox several orders of
   magnitude lower than observed earlier in chlorobenzene. Three series of
   phenolic antioxidants, (a) polyalkyl-6-hydroxychromans, (b)
   polyalkyl-4-methoxyphenols, and (c) trialkylphenols, were examined for
   their antioxidant activities in DLPC membranes during thermally
   initiated autoxidation by azobis-2, 4-dimethylvaleronitrile (DMVN). The
   corrected inhibition rate constants, k(inh), observed in (a), alpha-T
   (5.8 x 10(3)), PMHC (17.8 x 10(3)),
   2,2-dimethyl-5,7-diisopropyl-6-hydroxychroman, 4a (55 x 10(3)), and
   2,2,5-trimethyl-7-tert-butyl-6-hydroxychroman, 5a (61 x 10(3)) M-1 s-1,
   are dramatically lower, by several orders of magnitude, than those
   measured earlier in chlorobenzene and significantly lower (about
   1/40-1/10) than those measured in solution in tert-butyl alcohol and
   less than k(inh) measurements (1/2-1/5) in aqueous SDS micelles. The
   k(inh) values for series (b) were 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-4-methoxyphenol
   (TTMMP) (2.1 x 10(3)), 2,3,6-trimethyl-4-methoxyphenol (TMMP) (10.4 x
   10(3)), and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenol (DBHA) (27.5 x 10(3)) M-1
   s-1 and for (c) were 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) (3.7 x
   10(3)) and 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (TMP) (0.56 x 10(3)) M-1 s-1. The
   results show an overall leveling and depression of antioxidant
   activities in DLPC membranes in the series (a), (b), (c) compared to
   those reported in solution in chlorobenzene, where large differences
   were attributed to steroelectronic effects of the para ether oxygen
   stabilizing the derived phenoxyl radicals in (a) and (b) types. The
   results in aqueous micellar and membrane systems are interpreted in
   terms of polar solvation effects. Hydrogen bonding by water at both the
   ether and phenolic groups decreases the activity of the (a) series.
   Hydrogen bonding at the phenolic hydroxyl appears to be the more
   significant factor since steric hindrance to H-bonding at hydroxyl
   allows 4a and 5a to be the most active antioxidants of the
   alpha-tocopherol series (a) and DBHA to be the most active antioxidant
   of the (b) series.}},

Abstract = {{Psychological approaches to panic disorder with agoraphobia have
   concentrated on agoraphobic avoidance behavior associated with panic
   attacks through use of exposure-based methods.  These have proven
   reasonably successful but few patients are ``cured,{''} and a number
   continue to experience anxiety and panic.  More recently, treatments
   with the goal of reducing panic attacks directly have been developed. 
   These are based on a new psychobiological model of panic disorder that
   suggests some people are predisposed to panic, particularly when under
   stress.  A minority develop anxiety about the possibility of another
   panic attack and become sensitive to sensations that signal an attack. 
   The treatment developed at our center emphasizes systematic exposure to
   the somatic events associated with panic, breathing training, correcting
   misinformation about attacks, and the catastrophic cognitions associated
   with panic.  Both initial and long-term outcome of early studies of this
   treatment are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The gene that is defective in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies
   is expressed in the muscle and brain.  However, the 5' ends of the 14 kb
   mRNA in these tissues are derived from two different exons, indicating
   the involvement of at least two promoters in the regulation of the
   cell-type and developmental specificities of expression of this gene. In
   the study presented here, we used the polymerase chain reaction and
   RNAase protection methods and various cell cultures to investigate the
   specificities of expression of these promoters.  The results indicate a
   very stringent control of expression of the two promotors.  In cloned
   rat myogenic cells, only the muscle-type dystrophin transcript was
   detected, and its presence was correlated with the formation of
   multinucleated fibers.  In neuronal cell cultures, the brain-type
   transcript was detected.  However, glial cell cultures expressed the
   muscle transcript only.  Some cell lines derived from brain cells
   expressed both isoforms.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic polycations bind to glomerular polyanions (GPA) and increase
   permeability to macromolecules and immune complexes.  Platelet factor 4
   and other platelet cationic proteins also bind to GPA and may play a
   role in immune complex deposition.  Here we examine the potential of
   locally released cationic proteins to bind to GPA after immune
   complex-induced platelet activation within the renal microvasculature.
   Rabbits were immunized against bovine serum albumin (BSA), and BSA (2 or
   4 mg/ml in buffered saline) was infused into the left renal artery to
   deliver 8 or 16 mg of BSA over 20 minutes.  Thirty minutes later,
   kidneys were removed and tissue processed for light, immunofluorescence,
   and electron microscopy for the assessment of glomerular alterations and
   the localization of immune complexes (IgG and BSA), platelet factor 4,
   and platelet cationic proteins.  GPA was measured by quantitative
   ultrastructural assessment of polyethyleneimine binding sites.
   Glomerular capillaries contained large intraluminal immune complexes and
   platelet aggregates.  Also numerous deposits were observed within
   subendothelial and subepithelial aspects of the glomerular basement
   membrane (GBM).  Immunofluorescence and immunocytochemistry revealed
   prominent localization of platelet factor 4, platelet cationic proteins,
   IgG and BSA within peripheral capillary walls of glomeruli concomitant
   with a reduction of GPA.  Glomeruli of controls or contralateral kidneys
   did not show GBM localization of immune complexes or platelet proteins.
   Thus, nascent formation of immune complexes in capillaries was
   associated with platelet activation and deposition of endogenous
   cationic proteins in the GMB.  This mechanism may be involved in
   neutralization of GPA and mediation of increased permeability, which
   leads to GBM deposition of immune complexes.}},

Abstract = {{A predetermined set of 22 sociodemographic, psychosocial, clinical,
   neurocognitive and biochemical potential predictor variables was tested
   in 98 schizophrenic patients admitted for relapse.  The patients were
   treated with neuroleptics, mostly with haloperidol, for 28 d.  Ten of
   the 22 variables correlated significantly with the neuroleptic response.
   Using stepwise multiple regression analyses, an optimal combination of 5
   predictors was found to be in hierarchical order:  disturbances of
   premorbid adjustment, intensity of positive symptoms at admission,
   family history of schizophrenia, working ability during the year before
   admission and serum dopamine-beta-hydroxylase.  The 5 best predictors
   explained 29\% of outcome variance, and all 22 variables together
   explained 35\%.  Such neurological characteristics as neurological soft
   signs, handedness, abnormal voluntary movements, spontaneous blink rate
   and cognitive impairment did not predict the treatment response. 
   Several psychopathological, psychosocial and clinical predictors known
   from the literature could also be confirmed by cross-validation.}},

   transition in the same formalism are also analysed.}},

Volume = {{38A}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{270-281}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Micro-frac, Mini-frac and Leak-off test records from 41 wells on and
   around the Peace River Arch give indications of the magnitudes of
   S(Hmin), the smaller horizontal principal stress.  The magnitudes at
   constant depth appear to be laterally variable, with a tendency to be
   larger in the western part of the area.  S(Hmin) magnitudes suggest that
   the eastern part of the area is subject to an extensional stress regime
   where S(V) > S(Hmax) > S(Hmin).  To the west, the stress regime is
   compressional with S(Hmax) > S(V) > S(Hmin).  If this interpretation is
   correct, a first order implication is that fluids contained in low
   permeability reservoirs could be underpressured.  This may account for
   the sub-hydrostatic pressures in the Deep Basin.
   Breakout orientations measured in 38 wells in northern Alberta and
   British Columbia show that the principal horizontal stresses are
   deflected over the Peace River Arch.  Instead of the regional
   northeast-southwest azimuth for S(Hmax), the larger horizontal principal
   stress is directed north-northeast-south-southwest.  In a previous
   study, two-dimensional finite element modelling of this stress
   refraction has shown that the cause could be lateral heterogeneity in
   the elastic properties of the rocks.  Whatever the reason, the
   deflection is real and suggests that induced hydraulic fractures will be
   vertical and trend north-northeast-south-southwest over much of the
   Peace River Arch.}},

Volume = {{221}},

Abstract = {{Thermocapillary convection arising in small-depth layers (long
   horizontal cavities) subject to a horizontal temperature gradient is
   studied numerically.  A broad range of values of the Reynolds-Marangoni
   number, Re, is considered for three values of the aspect ratio (A =
   length/height).  For the largest aspect ratio considered, A = 25, the
   fully developed Poiseuille-Couette solution is reached, but only for
   moderate Re.  The limiting Re value for the observability of such a
   fully developed solution is derived as a function of A(Re
   less-than-or-equal-to 20A).  For Re less-than-or-equal-to 20A, the flow
   exhibits three distinct regimes, in the upwind, central and downwind
   regions, respectively.  The Poiseuille-Couette solution (when it exists)
   fills the central region, and the flow is accelerated, in the upwind
   region, to reach this Poiseuille-Couette solution at a distance that is
   proportional to Re.  In the downwind region, where the flow is deflected
   by the endwall, a multi-roll structure is exhibited for Re
   greater-than-or-equal-to 1330.  The number of rolls increases with Re. 
   When Re > 20A, the upwind and downwind regions coalesce and some of the
   downwind rolls can be suppressed.  Most of the computations concern
   interfacial conditions (with fixed temperature distribution) for which
   the dynamical solution is decoupled from the thermal one.  A few thermal
   solutions are given herein, for Pr = 0.015 only.}},

   habitual smokers.  The program included toothbrushing with an electric
   toothbrush for 12 months.  Oral cleanliness was evaluated according to a
   percentage with the oral hygiene program according to the percentage of
   bleeding sites.  The compliance with the oral hygiene program was very
   high among smokers and non-smokers.  Plaque index at baseline was very
   similar in smokers and non-smokers and remained so during the course of
   the investigation.  Following the introduction of the oral hygiene
   program, plaque index decreased in both groups, and there were no
   statistically significant differences between the two groups.  In spite
   of the similarity in plaque index, gingival bleeding was significantly
   lower in smokers than non-smokers.  The results suggest that smokers and

Volume = {{121}},

Abstract = {{Over 150 groundwater samples from the Lincolnshire Limestone have been
   analysed for pH, major ions and delta-13C ratios.  Where possible, field
   E(h) and iodide concentrations were measured and methane concentrations
   were determined for 12 samples.  Stable isotope ratios were determined
   for soil and rock carbonate samples.
   A system of zonation allows the division of hydrogeochemical processes
   occurring in the aquifer.  The use of hydrochemical and isotope data in
   modelling exercises enables the re-evaluation and possible enhancement
   of the understanding of hydrogeochemical processes.
   The carbonate chemistry of outcrop groundwaters is explained by calcite
   saturation being achieved under open-system conditions in the soil zone.
   delta13C ratios in the range - 15.99 to -10.57\% may be generated from a
   stoichiometric reaction with possible additional partial and/or
   simultaneous exchange with soil CO2 or carbonate.  The isotopic
   composition of soil carbonate shows the effects of precipitation from
   soil waters.  The incongruent dissolution of primary depositional
   limestone carbonate results in increasing magnesium and strontium
   concentrations and increasing delta-13C ratios for the groundwaters with
   flow down the hydraulic gradient.  As a result of incongruent
   dissolution, secondary calcite may be precipitated onto fissure
   surfaces.  Significant nitrate and sulphate reduction in non-saline
   groundwaters is not supported by the results of hydrochemical and
   isotope modelling exercises.  However, sulphate reduction and methane
   fermentation may be affecting the isotopic and chemical compositions of
   saline groundwaters.  Sodium-calcium ion exchange leads to limited
   calcite dissolution deep in the aquifer, but the evolution of these
   groundwaers is confused by the uncertain effects of oxidation of organic
   carbon and mixing with a saline end-member solution.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed nine sera from persons unlikely to be HIV infected which had
   an IgG reactivity directed against HIV-1 p24, and in two cases also to
   its precursor p55, but to no other HIV proteins, nor to proteins of the
   H9 host cell, in electrophoretic immunoblots (EIB).  These sera are also
   referred to as having an indeterminate HIV EIB pattern or as HIV
   antibody false positive sera.  Seven of nine sera reacted with longer
   (61-77 amino acids) and none with shorter (17-25 amino acids)
   p24-derived peptides in enzyme immunoassays (EIAs).  This is compatible
   with a conformational (discontinuous) nature of the epitopes involved in
   many false positive HIV-1 p24 antibody reactions.  Four sera reacted
   with an N-terminal, one with an internal, and two with a C-terminal
   fragment.  Each of the seven sera thus only reacted with one of the long
   p24 peptides.  The specificity and singularity of the reaction was
   further demonstrated by competition and/or absorption experiments with
   synthetic peptides.  In contrast, 18 of 20 confirmed HIV-1+ sera with
   p24 reactivity in EIB reacted with at least one and often several of the
   longer peptides, most frequently the C-terminal one.  Thus, the
   distribution of peptide reactivity of true HIV-1 antibody-positive sera
   was different from that of the falsely reactive sera.  According to two
   of several explanations, these antibodies may have arisen because of (1)
   molecular mimicry by chance or by functional selection, (2) immunization
   by activation, noninfectious exposure, or infection involving non-HIV
   endogenous or exogenous retroviral antigens.  The latter gains some
   support from our finding of antibody reactions with capsid proteins of
   the simian viruses, simian sarcoma-associated virus (SSAV), and
   Mason-Pfizer monkey retrovirus in some of the p24 +/- p55 reactive sera.}},

Abstract = {{The structural elements required for normal maturation and assembly of
   the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha-subunit were investigated by
   expression of mutated subunits in transfected fibroblasts.  Normally,
   the wild-type alpha-subunit acquires high affinity alpha-bungarotoxin
   binding in a time-dependent manner; however, mutation of the 128 and/or
   142 cysteines to either serine or alanine, as well as deletion of the
   entire 14 amino acids in this region abolished all detectable high
   affinity binding.  Nonglycosylated subunits that had a serine to glycine
   mutation in the consensus sequence also did not efficiently attain high
   affinity binding to toxin.  In contrast, mutation of the proline at
   position 136 to glycine or alanine, or a double mutation of the
   cysteines at position 192 and 193 to serines had no effect on the
   acquisition of high affinity toxin binding.  These data suggest that a
   disulfide bridge between cysteines 128 and 142 and oligosaccharide
   addition at asparagine 141 are required for the normal maturation of
   alpha-subunit as assayed by high affinity toxin binding.  The
   unassembled wild-type alpha-subunit expressed in fibroblasts is normally
   degraded with a t1/2 of 2 h; upon assembly with the delta-subunit the
   degradation rate slows significantly (t1/2 > 13 h).  All mutated
   alpha-subunits retained the capacity of assemble with a delta-subunit
   coexpressed in fibroblasts; however, mutated alpha-subunits that were
   not glycosylated or did not acquire high affinity toxin binding were
   rapidly degraded (t1/2 = 20 min to 2 h) regardless of whether or not
   they assembled with the delta-subunit.  Assembly and rapid degradation
   of nonglycosylated acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunits and subunit
   complexes were also observed in tunicamycin-treated BC3H-1 cells, a
   mouse musclelike cell line that normally expresses functional AChR.
   Hence, rapid degradation may be one form of regulation assuring that
   only correctly processed and assembled subunits accumulate, and
   ultimately make functional receptors in AChR-expressing cells.}},

   activation showed that the maximum value was observed 2 h after insulin

   associated with a decreased tyrosine hydroxylase activation between 4

   increased activation between 6 and 30 days.  While tyrosine hydroxylase
   from saline-treated rats exhibits two different forms (with two apparent
   K(m) values for the cofactor), enzyme from insulin-treated animals was

Abstract = {{Epitaxial semiconductive superconducting (SC) superlattices (SL) of
   PbTe-PbS/(001) KCl with two-dimensional ordered misfit dislocation (MD)
   networks across hetero-boundaries (HB) are studied.  The results are
   compared with those for YBaCuO.  Analysis of the fluctuation region
   suggests that the electron pairing in the SL occurs at the dislocation
   network nodes.  A metal-insulator transition is found to exist in the
   region of superconducting fluctuations in the I - V curve derivatives
   for point contacts (PC) based on SL and HTSC.  The transition can be
   attributed to a delocalization of carriers from the vicinity of
   structural elements responsible for the appearance of SC.  The critical
   current density in the superlattice is estimated.  A mechanism of
   generation of an excess current in the I - V curves of the SL-and
   HTSC-based PCs is proposed.  The values of energy gaps at low
   temperatures DELTA-0 in kT(c) units for the SL and HTSC are abnormally
   high.  For anisotropic three-dimensional SLs with a strong coupling
   between two-dimensional SC planes of MDs, one can observe two gaps.  For
   quasi-two-dimensional SLs with a weak coupling between two-dimensional
   SC planes, the dependence DELTA (T) is nonmonotonic.  A gap essentially
   independent on temperature is found to exist in the fluctuation region
   for these SLs and the HTSC.  The I - V curve derivatives of a Cu-SL
   point contact display an oscillation structure which is bounded by an
   energy of 90 meV and seems to be related to the electron-phonon
   interaction.  The mehanisms of superconducting transition in the SL and
   HTSC are assumed to be similar.}},

Abstract = {{A technique for recanalization of femoral and popliteal arterial
   occlusions by intentional subintimal dissection is described. 
   Recanalization with this technique was attempted in 71 occlusions of the
   femoro-popliteal segment with a mean length of 11.4 cm.  Primary
   technical success was achieved in 54 (76\%) cases, with complications
   occurring in 4 (5.6\%).  Of 44 successful cases reviewed at a mean
   follow up of 6 months, 37 (84\%) were either asymptomatic or improved. 
   The technique has proved to be an effective method of treating
   occlusions of the femoral and popliteal arteries with an acceptable
   complication rate.  It may allow successful angioplasty where the
   standard intraluminal method fails, particularly when reconstructive
   surgery is the only option.}},

Abstract = {{MRI of the head is routinely performed with spin-echo sequences whereas
   gradient-echo sequences are still uncommon.  Certain features of fast
   imaging sequences make them a promising tool for clinical
   investigations.  The relative high signal-to-noise ratio/unit time
   demonstrates the usefulness of GE imaging as localising images.  The
   extremely high contrast-flexibility is sometimes superior to SE imaging
   and may help to characterise structures and lesions.  Flow dynamics are
   more clearly depicted than with SE sequences and lead to the dynamic
   evaluation of intracranial motion (CSF flow, blood flow).  This
   information may be used in a special mode to achieve MR angiograms.  Due
   to the very short repetition-times, GE sequences are excellently suited
   to 3D application.  This enables to reduce slice thickness to less than
   1 mm with optional reconstructions in any virtual direction.  In view of
   present developments in MR, GE-imaging will be accepted in clinical
   diagnostic imaging in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{Extracellular matrices can be important in disease. Glomerulonephritis
   is an inflammation of the kidney that is characterized by the
   accumulation of extracellular matrix within the damaged glomeruli. We
   have shown that transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGF-beta-1) is unique
   in regulating the production of proteoglycans and matrix glycoproteins
   by glomerular cells in vitro. In an experimental model of
   glomerulonephritis in rats, we found increased proteoglycan and
   fibronectin synthesis by cultured nephritic glomeruli, which was greatly
   reduced by the addition of antiserum to TGF-beta-1. Conditioned media
   from glomerular cultures, when added to normal cultured mesangial cells,
   induced elevated proteglycan synthesis. The stimulatory activity of the
   conditioned media was blocked by addition of TGF-beta-1 antheserum.
   Glomerular histology showed mesangial matrix expansion in a time course
   that roughly paralleled the elevated proteoglycan synthesis by the
   nephritic glomeruli. At the same time there was an increased expression
   of TGF-beta-1 mRNA and TGF-beta-1 protein in the glomeruli.
   Administration of anti-TGF-beta-1 at the time of induction of
   glomerulonephritis suppressed the elevated extracellular matrix
   production and dramatically attenuated histological manifestations of
   the disease. A small proteoglycan, decorin, also inhibits the activity
   of TGF-beta, potentially providing an alternative format for the
   prevention of TGF-beta activity. Our results provide direct evidence for
   a causal role of TGF-beta-1 in the pathogenesis of the experimental
   disease and suggest a new approach to the therapy of glomerulonephritis.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment schedules were investigated for in vivo induction of
   lymphokine-activated killer cells in the rat liver.  Treatment of rats
   with continuous systemic or regional infusion of recombinant human
   interleukin-2 with a dose of 4 to 8 x 10(4) U/day during 7 days,
   resulted in an increase in number of large granular lymphocytes or pit
   cells in the liver up to 43 times normal.  Kupffer cells, nongranular
   lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils also increased in number, but
   with a maximal fivefold increase this was much less pronounced than for
   large granular lymphocytes.  Kupffer cells showed morphological signs of
   activation and were frequently seen in mitosis.  Frequent mitoses were
   also observed for large granular lymphocytes, but not for other
   leukocytes.  This indicates that the effect of interleukin-2 treatment
   on hepatic (sinusoidal) cells was primarily directed to large granular
   lymphocytes and Kupffer cells.  The large granular lymphocyte
   accumulation occurred mainly intrasinusoidally, but they were also
   frequently observed in the space of Disse where they are not found in
   control rats.  This may be explained partly by the observed damage or
   gaps in the endothelial lining.  The intrasinusoidal large granular
   lymphocytes adhered to the endothelium and to Kupffer cells.  Higher
   responses, for all cell types, were found when interleukin-2 was
   administered regionally, that is, through the hepatic artery rather than
   through the systemic route (jugular vein), although the differences were
   not statistically significant.  Doses below 4 x 10(4) U/day did not
   result in significant increases of large granular lymphocytes in the
   liver.}},

Abstract = {{The management of gastro-oesophageal reflux still presents a
   considerable problem mostly because of its multifactorial pathogenesis.
   In this study, we tested the response to treatment with famotidine for 8
   weeks in patients with reflux oesophagitis, taking into consideration,
   however, only cases with pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux of the
   acidic type.  All the patients participating in the multicentre study
   underwent gastro-oesophageal 24-hr pH-metry.
   The results show a good response to the H2 antagonist treatment with
   regards to both symptomatology (improvement/healing in 98\% of cases,
   asymptomatic in 68\%) and the endoscopic and histological picture.  In
   fact, endoscopy showed complete remission of the lesions in 60\% of
   cases and an improvement in 21\%.  The histological picture of
   oesophagitis improved in 64\% of cases, 36\% of which were completely
   healed, with no modifications in the remaining 36\%.
   These data, which are globally better than those reported in the
   literature, can probably be attributed to the original selection of
   patients treated by means of prolonged gastro-oesophageal pH-metry, who
   had exclusively pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux of the acidic
   type.  For these patients the use of the H2 antagonist drug is more
   appropriate even as monotherapy, than it is for those patients who have
   combined or isolated alkaline gastro-oesophageal reflux.}},

   developed, and it is shown that they are not independent of age.  It is

Abstract = {{Laser Doppler anemometer measurements in a fully pulsed, subsonic air
   jet with a significant no-flow period between pulses have been conducted
   and show much higher entrainment than steady or partially pulsed jets of
   the same mass flow.  The mean centerline velocity decay is linearly
   related to the inverse of the effective distance from exit for some 50
   diameters, but centerline velocity decay is much slower than for steady
   jets due to domination by the periodic component and its associated
   pressure field, which affects jet momentum.  For larger distances, the
   decay changes to the steady jet rate.  Reynolds stresses are
   considerably larger than for a steady jet and are considered to be
   responsible for the increased entrainment.  Results are, except for a
   small increase in the constant of proportionality, consistent with
   Taylor's entrainment hypothesis.  Phase averaged results through a cycle
   show the ratio of shear stress to turbulent kinetic energy to be in the
   range of 0.2-0.3 for the bulk of the flow.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a new class of oriented polymers is introduced:  highly
   crosslinked polymer networks obtained by photopolymerization of oriented
   liquid crystalline (LC) monomers.  Orientation of these monomers can be
   induced in the same manner as usual for conventional LCs applied in
   LCDs: with the aid of an electric or a magnetic field, or using surface
   orientation.  Photopolymerization offers the advantage that a
   temperature can be chosen right within the LC temperature region.
   The resulting polymer networks show a high degree of ordering which is
   somewhat dependent on the polymerization temperature, as demonstrated by
   the amount of birefringence.  This ordering is maintained over a wide
   temperature region, contrary to that in LC side-chain polymers.  Apart
   from their optical properties, uniaxially ordered polymer networks show
   anisotropy also in other physical properties, such as the thermal
   expansion coefficient and modulus.}},

Abstract = {{Forty seven free-ranging, adult, male koalas were captured and
   administered an intramuscular injection of the dissociative anaesthetic,
   Telazol(R) (tiletamine HCI plus zolazepam HCI), at dose rates of 5.0 to
   7.7 mg/kg body weight.  Anaesthesia induction was rapid and smooth and
   resulted in a surgical plane of anaesthesia lasting 30 to 45 min.  There
   was no depression of heart rate or respiration.  Mild salivation
   occurred in most animals, but was not a problem because the swallowing
   reflex was retained.  There was no mortality or morbidity and the
   anaesthesia level was sufficient to allow electroejaculation and
   multiple blood sampling with no apparent animal discomfort.  For 10 of
   19 males in which anaesthesia was required for a 90 min protocol, a
   supplementary Telazol injection (average, 2.5 mg/kg) was necessary.  All
   koalas recovered completely within 3 to 4 h of the initial injection. 
   The results suggest that the optimal Telazol dosage for the adult male
   koala is 7.0 mg/kg body weight.
   The retrospective analysis of 259 anaesthesia records involving 14
   species indicated that Telazol was equally effective and safe in other
   captive marsupials.}},

   will result from increasing levels of tropospheric CO2.  We have
   investigated the potential effects of climate change on the primary
   productivity of Castle Lake, a mountain lake in Northern California. 
   Annual algal productivity was modeled empirically using 25 years of
   limnological data in order to establish predictive relationships between
   productivity and the climatic variables of accumulated snow depth and
   precipitation.  The outputs of monthly temperature and precipitation
   from three general circulation models (GCMs) of doubled atmospheric CO2
   were then used in the regression model to predict annual algal
   productivity.  In all cases, the GCM senarios predicted increased algal
   productivity for Castle Lake under conditions of doubled atmospheric
   CO2.  The primary cause of enhanced productivity was the increased
   length of the growing season resulting from earlier spring ice-out.}},

Title = {{UV OBSERVATIONS OF HERBIG-HARO OBJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH BIPOLAR MOLECULAR
   OUTFLOWS - HH-7, HH-11, AND HH-29}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{1990}},
Volume = {{240}},

Pages = {{409-428}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We present IUE observations of the shock excited visible nebulae HH7,
   HH11, and HH29. These Herbig-Haro objects were selected because they
   share the property of being physically associated with the two most
   prominent bipolar molecular outflows from young low luminosity stars and
   yet they show widely different states of excitation (ionization) in
   their optical emission line spectra. In order to study the time
   dependence of the radiation processes we have collected several
   spectorgrammes in the wavelength range 1200 to 3000 angstrom over a
   period of almost three years.
   The individual UV observations of these objects made with the IUE all
   appear very faint and we have developed an alternative extraction method
   different from that commonly used for the reduction of IUE data. Our
   simple method is applied to the data in image space, therefore not
   violating the photometry, and its reliability is demonstrated.
   We introduce a UV colour index for Herbig-Haro objects which is
   extinction-free for dust constituents giving rise to theta-Orionis
   extinction curves and compare our observed values with those calculated
   for a recombining hydrogenic plasma. With the possible exception of HH
   11, we find large deviations from the 2(2)S-1(2)S two photon decay
   continuum of atomic hydrogen, which was predicted to dominate the
   emission at short wavelengths particularly in low excitation HH objects.
   We also find that the H2+ free-bound emission does not offer a solution
   to the UV continuum problem in HH objects.
   The continuum of HH 29 has varied considerably in both intensity and
   spectral slope, although it retained roughly is substructural shape,
   during the three years of observation. Comparison of the accompanying
   high ionization line fluxes with theoretical shock wave models
   marginally indicates a variation of the shock speed. To explain both
   continuum and line changes with time we propose a model invoking the
   clumpiness of the interstellar medium at the position of HH 29.
   In no object are we able to detect any lines due to fluorescent H-2
   emission which are seen in other low excitation HH objects. For HH 7-11,
   which emit strongly in the infrared quadrupole lines, we find that dust
   extinction alone can account for the lack of the UV lines in the IUE
   spectra of these objects.
   For HH 11 we are able to determine the (total) radiative loss rate from
   the far ultaviolet to the infrared. The major losses occur through the
   emission of continuum photons from this low excitation nebula. However,
   radiative losses are of little importance for HH 11. Furthermore, the
   enigmatically low shock velocity of only approximately 20 to 30 km s-1
   is confirmed in this high velocity object (approximately 200 km s-1). We
   estimate a mass loss rate of M approximately 1-3 10(-6) M. yr-1 from SSV
   13, the stellar wind from which is thought to excite the HH object. This
   value of the mass loss rate is close to that derived from HI and CO
   observations and indicates that the wind from SSV 13 is not very well
   collimated even at the distance of only approximately 0.02 pc from the
   central source.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROCYTOLOGY}},
Year = {{1990}},

Abstract = {{B-50/GAP43, a neuron-specific phosphoprotein, is highly expressed in
   developing nervous tissue. Monospecific polyclonal affinity-purified
   B-50 antibodies were used to document the ultrastructural distribution
   of B-50 in the hippocampus of 90-day-old (P90) and 1-day-old (P1) rats.
   Double-labelling immunoprocedures were performed to compare the
   localization of B-50 and synaptophysin (p38), a protein specific for
   synaptic vesicles. By immunofluorescence light microscopy B-50 and p38
   were similarly distributed in the CA1 neuropil of P90 rats. In contrast,
   in P1 rats B-50 was more widely distributed than p38. By electron
   microscopy of P90 rat hippocampus, B-50 was located at the plasma
   membranes of axon shafts and of p38-immunoreactive axon terminals. Some
   B-50 was found in the cytosol of axon terminals. B-50 was absent at the
   plasma membranes of apical dendrites and of pyramidal cells. In the P1
   rat hippocampus, B-50 was detected at the plasma membrane of growth
   cones, axon terminals and axon shafts, but not in their cytosol. The
   plasma membranes of pyramidal cell bodies and their processes extending
   into the stratum radiatum were without B-50. B-50-immunoreactive
   organelles of the lysosomal family were found in the cytosol of
   pyramidal cells of the hippocampus of P1 and P90 rats. This
   ultrastructural study shows that during development of the stratum
   radiatum in the hippocampal field CA1, the localization of B-50 persists
   at the plasma membrane of axons and axon terminals in P1 and P90 rats.
   This localization of B-50 is consistent with the suggestion that B-50
   acts as a regulator of neurotransmitter release and intracellular
   messengers.}},

Abstract = {{The Edinburgh Lung Cancer Group prospectively registered 651 new
   patients presenting with lung cancer during 1981; only 47 survived five

   of disease, and possibly to Karnofsky performance score (not
   statistically significant).  By comparison with non-surgical patients
   these 116 patients undergoing surgery were highly selected in terms of
   age, favourable histological type, stage of disease, and performance
   score.  Forty two of the 535 non-surgical patients were given radical
   radiotherapy alone and seven (17\%) survived five years.  The remaining
   493 received palliative radiotherapy, chemotherapy (alone or combined
   with radiotherapy), or symptomatic treatment alone; only five (1\%)
   survived five years.  Median survival was related to cell type
   (adenocarcinoma 2.6 months, squamous cell carcinoma 6.2 months), stage

   index (greater-than-or-equal-to-90 9.3 months,

   stopped ( day 0) and at different time intervals during refeeding of a
   ND.  Four subunits (1,2,3 and 4) and activities of glutathione
   S-transferases (GSTs) toward five different substrates, {[}styrene oxide
   (STOX), 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (DCNB), 1-chloro-2-4-dinitro benzene
   (CDNB), sulfobromophthalein (BSP) and benzalacetone (PBO)] were
   determined.
   There were no significant differences between young and old rats in the
   liver enzyme activities before the PFD.  The PFD caused significant
   decreases in activities for three substrates (DCNB, BSP and STOX) in
   both age groups, with no significant differences between young and old
   rats at day 0.  During recovery from the PFD, activities for the three
   substrates exceeded basal levels in young rats but a different time
   intervals (STOX, day 2; BSP, day 5; DCNB, day 9), while enzyme values in
   old rats tended to return slowly to basal values with no ``
   overshoot.{''} Concentrations of subunits 3 and 4 in young rat livers
   that were depressed by the PFD did not recover until day 9 of the ND,
   while subunits 2 and especially 1 increased during the ND refeeding,
   overshooting the basal levels.  In contrast, in old rat livers the only
   change was a reduction of subunit 1 by the PFD and its gradual recovery
   during ND refeeding.  These results demonstrate that our previous
   observation of overshooting of enzyme activities in mice is reproducible
   in rats but with certain substrate specificities.  Furthermore, changes
   in subunit concentrations caused by aging and a PFD are more complex
   than what was predicted from changes in enzyme activities of GSTs.}},

Abstract = {{With the recent successful operation in JET, beryllium must be
   considered a leading plasma-facing material. However, little is known
   about beryllium's hydrogen isotope retention and migration properties.
   This paper presents the results of a coordinated experimental program
   performed to characterize the hydrogen isotope retention and release in
   beryllium. In the first set of experiments, measurements of the
   plasma-driven permeation of deuterium through beryllium membranes were
   conducted. No detectable permeation was obtained for temperatures below
   670 K, and the higher temperature results were strongly affected by the
   oxide layers on the samples. In the second set of experiments, samples
   were exposed to a D-T plasma in the Tritium Plasma Experiment. The
   samples were subsequently removed for dissolution tritium counting. The
   retention was seen to initially decrease with increasing exposure
   temperature, but reached a local maximum at 770 K.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new method of seismogram synthesis for
   multi-layered media with irregular interfaces due to an arbitrary
   source.  This method can be viewed as either an extension of the T
   matrix method for an inclusion to multi-layered media by introducing the
   global generalized R/T matrices, or an extension of the generalized R/T
   coefficients method for horizontally layered media to irregular layered
   ones by incorporating the T matrix method.  The formulation obtained in
   this paper is expressed in terms of the global generalized R/T matrices.
   These global generalized R/T matrices can be determined from integrals
   along each interface and integral over source area via a recursive
   relation.  This formulation provides an efficient scheme of computation,
   especially when the number of layers increases.  Also, this formulation
   can be applied to any finite frequency, although for higher frequency it
   needs more computation time than for lower frequency.  As examples, we
   give solutions of three specific problems, namely, horizontally layered
   media, irregular topography, and an irregular layer over a half-space.}},

   sensitive to different levels of calcium intake; the values increased
   linearly as calcium intake increased from 2 to 4.5 g/day (WB = 316 to
   403; CB = 479 to 571; MB = 133 to 213).  Bone-breaking force (BBF),
   bone-bending moment (BBM), bone stress, and BBF/100 g body weight were
   equally sensitive in indicating bone mineral reserves due to different
   levels of calcium intake.  Regression equations showed that AW/VOL alone
   (true for WB, CB, and MB) was capable of predicting BBM well (all with
   R2 > .82).  However, AW/FFDM did not have predictive power over BBM
   (CB-AW/FFDM:R2 < .001).  Using daily calcium intake as the predictor,
   regression lines for BBM, WB-AW, WB-AW/VOL, CB-AW/VOL, and MB-AW/VOL
   yielded significant slopes of 1.24 kg-cm, .01 g, 17.11 mg/mL, 16.34
   mg/mL, and 16.42 mg/mL, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Animals on pasture do not always have the opportunity for ad libitum
   consumption. Our objectives were to determine effects of intake level on
   digestibility of 12 grass hays, and to relate differences in intake and
   digestibility to proportions of leaf blade, leaf sheath and stem. In
   each of two periods, 24 wethers were offered one of 12 hays at three
   consecutive levels of feeding: (L1) ad libitum, allowing 15\% refusal;
   (L2) restricted to 100\% of hay consumed ad libitum by individual wether
   during L1; and (L3) 1.8\% of BW on a DM basis. Hays offered included two
   sorghum-sudan, four barley, four oat and two pearl millet. Hays were
   similar in NDF concentration but differed in morphological composition.
   Organic matter intake averaged 1.99 +/- .04, 1.79 +/- .04 and 1.52 +/-
   .01\% of BW for L1, L2 and L3, respectively. Organic matter
   digestibilities averaged 71.8 +/- .55, 72.4 +/- .60 and 72.3 +/- .65\%
   for L1, L2 and L3, respectively. Intake SEM within hays were lower with
   restricted intakes (L3), whereas the opposite was observed for the SEM
   for digestibility. Forage morphological composition within feeding level
   influenced intake and digestibility by altering diet selection
   capabilities of wethers. Wethers did not consume equal NDF amounts,
   ranging from .95 to 1.47\% of BW, because hays differed in morphological
   composition. Ash-free ADF and 72\% sulfuric acid lignin were higher (P <
   .01) in stem than in blade or sheath. In vivo digestibilities measured
   under restricted feeding conditions were related more closely (P < .05)
   to in vitro estimates of digestibility than were digestibilities
   measured under ad libitum conditions (r = .72, .79 and .85 for L1, L2
   and L3, respectively). This study demonstrates that variation in
   morphological characteristics of forages may account for part of the
   difference in voluntary intake of forages of similar chemical
   composition. New knowledge in this area will be valuable in developing
   improved forage quality prediction procedures.}},

   enhanced with glass additives.  The temperature coefficient of threshold

   the undoped sample.  The change in the temperature dependence of the
   field-current density characteristics is more related to the barrier
   height change than the refractory behavior of the glass employed.  Heat
   treatment is very effective in recovering the degraded samples by
   providing the activation energy for the diffusion of Zn interstitials.

Abstract = {{Using a conformal mapping technique, a procedure for calculating the
   irrotational flow about a two-dimensional airfoil of arbitrary shape in
   unsteady motion is developed.  The two-dimensional form with a sharp
   trailing edge is transformed into a unit circle by two successive
   transformations.  The latter of the two is a modified version of the
   Gershgorin integral equation, which yields solutions much more accurate
   than those obtained with panel methods.  The change in circulation
   around the airfoil due to unsteadiness is modeled by discrete vortices
   that are shed from the trailing edge and allowed to move freely with the
   local stream.  The strength of these vortices is determined by the Kutta
   condition that, at each time step, the velocity be zero at the trailing
   edge in the circle plane.  The procedure is efficient since the integral
   equation is solved only once.  Numerical examples are presented for a
   sinusoidal heaving motion and for an impulsively started airfoil.}},

Abstract = {{Protoplasts derived from cell suspensions of alfalfa (Medicago sativa
   L.) responded to treatment with fungal elicitor (FE) by an increase in
   endogenous chalcone synthase (CHS) activity but were unresponsive to
   reduced glutathione (GSH).  Preexposure of protoplasts to polyethylene
   glycol and electroporation resulted in strong responsiveness to GSH but
   little change in responsiveness to FE.  Protoplasts from suspension
   cultures which had been subcultured more than 12 times lost
   responsiveness to GSH, but not FE, as assessed by measuring expression
   of a chimeric gene containing a bean CHS promoter linked to a bacterial
   chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene.  In protoplasts
   in which putative cis-acting CHS promoter sequences had been
   coelectroporated in trans with the intact CHS promoter-CAT construct,
   the extent of CAT expression depended upon the elicitor used (FE or
   GSH), the age (number of times subcultured) of the cells from which the
   protoplasts were isolated, and the nature of the coelectroporated CHS
   promoter sequence.  For example, a region of the CHS promoter from -326
   to -141 behaved as a trans-activator when coelectroporated with the CAT
   construct into unelicited protoplasts isolated from newly initiated cell
   suspensions, but the same region acted as a trans-silencer in the same
   protoplasts in the presence of FE.  This silencer activity was much
   reduced in GSH-treated protoplasts.  The results suggest that there are
   differences in the signal transduction pathways for elicitation of CHS
   transcription by Fe and GSH, which involve previously identified
   cis-elements in the CHS promoter.}},

Abstract = {{Many problems in applied mathematics can be abstracted into finding a
   common point of a finite collection of sets.  If all the sets are closed
   and convex in a Hilbet space, the method of successive projections
   (MOSP) has been shown to converge to a solution point, i.e., a point in
   the intersection of the sets.  These assumptions are however not
   suitable for a broad class of problems.  In this paper, we generalize
   the MOSP to collections of approximately compact sets in metric spaces. 
   We first define a sequence of successive projections (SOSP) in such a
   context and then proceed to establish conditions for the convergence of
   a SOSP to a solution point.  Finally, we demonstrate an application of
   the method to digital signal restoration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a numerical method for solving the fully nonlinear
   equations of motion for gravity waves propagating over an irregular
   rigid bed, in two dimensions.  The scheme is based on a
   boundary-integral method developed by Dold and Peregrine1, and extended
   by Tanaka et al.2.  The method quickly and accurately computes the
   position of the free surface of an inviscid, incompressible fluid in
   irrotational motion.  The schemes of Dold and Peregrine1, and Tanaka,
   Dold, Lewy and Peregrine2, describe waves in a flat-bottomed domain.  In
   this paper the method is extended to describe wave propagation over an
   irregular bed contour, and follows2, in that the domain is unbounded in
   the horizontal, with static flow at infinity.  A conformal
   transformation is used to map the irregular bed at each time-step to a
   flat-bedded domain.  In the transformed plane symmetry is used so that
   discretization points need only be used on the free surface.  The
   conformal map is a relatively small contribution to the run-time of the
   computer program.  The method is more efficient than schemes which use
   discretization points to describe the bed contour.  The method's
   capability is demonstrated with computations of a wave breaking on a
   submerged elliptical shoal.}},

Abstract = {{A specific teratogenic response is elicited in the mouse as a result of
   exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD; dioxin).  The
   characteristic spectrum of structural malformations induced in mice
   following exposure to TCDD and structurally related congeners is highly
   reproducible and includes both hydronephrosis and cleft palate.  In
   addition, prenatal exposure to TCDD has been shown to induce thymic
   hypoplasia.  These three abnormalities occur at doses well below those
   producing maternal or embryo/fetal toxicity and are thus among the most
   sensitive indicators of dioxin toxicity.  In all other laboratory
   species tested, TCDD causes maternal and embryo/fetal toxicity but does
   not induce a significant increase in the incidence of structural
   abnormalities even at toxic dose levels.  Developmental toxicity occurs
   in a similar dose range across species; however, mice are particularly
   susceptible to development of TCDD-induced terata.  Recent experiments
   using an organ culture were an attempt to address the issue of species
   and organ differences in sensitivity to TCDD.  Human palatal shelves
   examined in th is in vitro system were found to approximate the rate in
   terms of sensitivity for induction of cleft palate.  Investigators have
   suggested that altered regulation of growth factors and their receptors
   may involve inappropriate proliferation and differentiation of target
   cells, ultimately producing TCDD-induced terata.  Why the teratogenic
   effects of TCDD are so highly species and tissue specific, and which
   animal species most accurately predicts the response of the human
   embryo/fetus, at the levels of exposure experienced by humans, still
   remains to be clarified.}},

Abstract = {{The therapeutic effectiveness of calcium channel antagonists (CCA) in
   hypertension and angina are well established.  More recently, CCAs have
   also been demonstrated to ameliorate neurologic dysfunction that often
   accompanies ischemia associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage and stroke.
   We have hypothesized that retinal degeneration associated with ischemia
   may also result from the accumulation of calcium intracellularly,
   so-called ``Ca++ overload{''}.  To test this hypothesis, a rat model of
   acute retinal ischemia, produced by direct occlusion of posterior
   ciliary and central retinal arteries, was developed.  The extent of
   retinal dysfunction induced by ischemia was evaluated by
   electroretinograms (ERGs).  Occlusion of the retinal arteries resulted
   in the disappearance ob both a- and b-waves during the occlusion period
   (30 minutes) in vehicle-treated rats.  Total retinal ischemia did not
   produce any significant change in magnitude of ERG a-wave amplitude
   during three-hours of reperfusion.  However, ERG b-waves amplitudes were
   significantly reduced by more than 60\%.  In rats, pretreatment with
   nifedipine (0.33 to 3.3 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 minutes prior to the occlusion
   of the retinal vessels produced a significant dose-dependent increase in
   the recovery of b-wave amplitude when compared to vehicle-treated rats.
   These data support the idea that ``Ca++ overload{''}, resulting from the
   deregulation of intracellular Ca++ homeostasis, is a primary factor
   involved in ischemic retinal degeneration and that CCAs can protect the
   retina from ischemic damage.}},

Abstract = {{Eleven spring-fed streams located in central Oklahoma were sampled over
   a two-year period to evaluate which abiotic variables were most
   important in determining the abundance and size distributions of the
   freshwater snail Physella virgata virgata.  To determine if spatial
   scale and sampling resolution affected the conclusions derived from
   stepwise multiple regression and principal components analyses, data
   were analyzed in three ways.  An among-stream assessment included data
   collapsed over time and space for each stream.  Within-stream analyses
   were also conducted on each stream separately, and a between-habitat
   (pools versus riffles) analysis was performed for each stream
   separately.  At the largest scale, crayfish (Orconectes virilis)
   abundance and algal biomass were most strongly associated with both the
   size and abundance of snails among streams.  Within-stream analyses
   suggested that flow rate and substrate particle size were most important
   in predicting within-stream abundance patterns of snails.  Significant
   differences in both snail size and abundance were found between pools
   and riffles, with higher abundances and larger snails being found in
   pools.  Variables associated with microhabitat selection of snails also
   differed between pools and riffles, with flow and substrate particle
   size being most influential in riffles, while algal biomass and
   macrophyte densities were most important in pools.  Our findings suggest
   that spatial scale and sampling regime are critical in determining
   benthic invertebrate size and abundance patterns.}},

   the finite difference method of integration of the partial differential
   equations which state the mass balances of the sample components.  The
   elution profiles calculated with these three procedures agree quite well
   when applied to reasonably efficient columns (over 1000 theoretical
   plates), at moderate and high sample loads as long as the displacement
   effect predominates.  These profiles also agree well with experimental
   results.  Significant differences appear, however, when the
   concentration of the second component in the feed is smaller than that
   of the first one.  The origin and extent of these differences are
   discussed in detail and the range of deviations to be expected in
   practical cases is illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{We present an in-depth study of the simulated annealing approach to the
   scheduling of serial multiproduct batch processes under the assumption
   of a permutation schedule.  Four versions of the simulated annealing
   algorithm are studied based on two move acceptance criteria, the
   Metropolis algorithm and the Glauber algorithm, and two annealing
   schedules, the exponential schedule and the Aarts and van Laarhoven
   schedule.  Makespan minimization is performed for unlimited intermediate
   storage (UIS), no intermediate storage (NIS), zero wait (ZW), finite
   intermediate storage (FIS) and mixed intermediate storage (MIS) flowshop
   problems using simulated annealing and also the idle matrix search (IMS)
   heuristic.  Of the four versions of the simulated annealing algorithm
   studied, the Metropolis algorithm with the Aarts and van Laarhoven
   annealing schedule is found to give the best results, with all four
   versions giving significantly better results than the IMS heuristic. 
   The Metropolis algorithm with the Aarts and van Laarhoven annealing
   schedule is studied in more detail for further comparison with the IMS
   heuristic in terms of the computational effort expended by the simulated
   annealing algorithm and the solution quality obtained.}},

   local site and 150 cGy in ten fractions over two weeks to the whole
   body.  The mean survival for 12 patients was 31 weeks, with a median
   survival of 32 weeks.  One patient received six courses of combination
   chemotherapy for recurrent disease four months after TBI without marrow
   depression and survived 72 weeks, the longest survivor in this series. 
   Brain metastases occurred in only one patient, the  most common site of
   metastases being the liver.  All patients tolerated TBI well without
   nausea, vomiting or hair loss.  When bone marrow suppression occurred it
   was asymptomatic, requiring no treatment and resolving within eight
   weeks.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of vasopressin in isolated segments from branches
   (500-700 mu-m in external diameter) of human middle cerebral arteries
   obtained during autopsy of 15 patients who had died 3-8 hours before. 
   Paired segments, one normal and the other de-endothelized by gentle
   rubbing, were mounted for isometric recording of tension in organ baths.
   In 11 normal segments, vasopressin produced concentration-dependent
   contractions with an EC50 of 7.0 x 10(-10) M.  Removal of the
   endothelium from 12 segments did not significantly affect
   vasopressin-induced contractions.  Vasopressin produced further
   contractions in arterial segments with (n = 4) or without (n = 5)
   endothelium precontracted with KCl.  In segments precontracted with
   prostaglandin F2-alpha, acetylcholine caused relaxation only of those
   with endothelium.  At 10(-8) M (n = 11), the vasopressin V-1 receptor
   antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP produced a 60-fold shift to the right of
   the control response curve for vasopressin.  Increasing the
   concentration of the receptors antagonist to 10(-6) M (n = 7) further
   displaced the control curve in a parallel manner.  These results
   indicate that vasopressin exerts a powerful constrictor action on
   isolated human cerebral arteries by direct stimulation of V-1 receptors
   located predominantly on smooth muscle cells.  It appears that this
   contractile response is not modulated by the presence of an intact
   endothelial cell layer.}},

Abstract = {{The pulp industry is one of the major export industries of Portugal at
   present.  Eucalyptus globulus is widely planted for this purpose. 
   Nevertheless, the use of Eucalyptus is confronted with strong objections
   because of possible environmental effects.  The effect on soil moisture
   appears to be particularly relevant in the southern and interior
   semi-arid zones of the country.  The study utilized two watersheds near
   the town of Odemira in Alentejo, a southern province of Portugal.  The
   region has a relatively humid climate because of its proximity to the
   sea.  One 6-ha watershed contained scattered native cork oak (Quercus
   suber) with a newly developing understory of shrubs.  An adjacent 19-ha
   watershed contained a mature Eucalyptus globulus stand, which was
   harvested for the study.  The study included measurements of
   precipitation, runoff and soil water storage.
   Measurements of the tree stands and canopies were included for the
   characterization of throughfall and stemflow.  The results demonstrated
   that the summer-dry climate depleted soil moisture to such a degree that
   wintertime recharge of the cork-oak watershed generated only one percent
   of annual rainfall into runoff.  Annual rainfall increased during the
   study period, confounding wetter soil conditions with the effect of
   Eucalyptus harvesting.  Canopy interception by the mature Eucalyptus
   stand was 16.8\%, and stemflow was 2.7\% of annual rainfall.  Stemflow
   from the scattered oak trees was 1.3\% of annual rainfall, but canopy
   interception could not be evaluated and was estimated at 4.2\%. 
   Interception by the shrub vegetation in the cork oak watershed was not
   measured.  measurements showed no difference in monthly
   evapotranspiration (E(t)) between the two vegetation types during the
   pre-treatment period.  However, the 11 mm month-1 reduction of E(t)
   lasted only for three months.  After this period the regenerating
   Eucalyptus coppice matched water use of the cork-oak stand and appeared
   to exceed this by 4 mm month-1 at the end of the drought cycle. 
   Harvesting increased first-year runoff only by 4 mm and second-year
   runoff by 36 mm after soil water recharge by}},

   stochastic model. The k-epsilon turbulence model was used to
   characterize the length and time scales of the fluid. In the plane
   confined jet the influence of the restitution coefficient on the
   statistical distribution of velocities was analysed. Particular
   attention was dedicated to the epsilon equation corrections regarding
   the problem of the free jet spreading rate overprediction. The influence
   of the particle tangential momentum equation on the prediction of
   particle concentration near the centre line in axisymmetric free jets
   was also analysed. Comparisons between predictions and experimental data
   are presented and shown to be satisfactory regarding the incomplete

Abstract = {{Faced with soldiers of a Rhinotermitidae termite, workers of the
   predatory ant Pachycondyla villosa present a posture of ``prudence{''}
   where they throw their antennae backwards and lift their hind legs and
   sometimes even other legs, thus avoiding contact of these appendages
   with mandibles of the prey.  The Rhinotermitidae workers, on the other
   hand, are antennated during capture.
   While washing the soldiers and then soaking them in water used for
   washing workers, the posture of ``prudence{''} on the part of the P.
   villosa may be removed.  Reciprocally, in washing the workers and
   soaking them in water used for washing soldiers, the postural response
   may be induced.  Thus, there is a cuticular product coming out of the
   soldier which acts as a kairomone on the P. villosa workers.
   Workers changing from internal service to hunting activities were put in
   the presence of live and active soldiers and of anaesthetized soldiers
   of termites.  At the time of the first encounter the soldiers are
   antennated.  At the time of the second encounter, there are only active
   soldiers.  Ants that have already been in contact with active soldiers
   reveal the postural response, whereas those have been in contact with
   anaesthetized soldiers continue to examine by antennuation.  They
   manifest the posture of ``prudence{''} only where there is an additional
   contact.  There is therefore a sort of apprenticeship where the
   ``prudence{''} response is only acquired after a first contact when the
   ant is aggressed by a soldier.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of a positive clinical history and skin test (ST) results
   for 17 fish species (anchovy, bass, carp, dogfish, eel, gilthead,
   mackerel, mullet, perch, red millet, salmon, sardine, sole, tench,
   toothed gilthead, trout, and tuna) were investigated in 20 children with
   cod-positive clinical history, ST, and RAST, and in 40 children positive
   to one or more foods different from cod (cow's milk, chicken egg white,
   peanut, and tomato). In cod-positive children, positive clinical history
   (60\%) and ST (85\%) to fish species were more frequent than in
   cod-negative children (7.5\% and 10\% respectively). In cod-positive
   children, a high frequency of positive STs to eel (85\%) and to bass,
   dentex, sole, and tuna (55\%) was observed. Positivity to dogfish (10\%)
   was the least frequent. RAST-inhibition experiments suggested the
   presence of cross-reacting antigen(s) in cod, bass, dentex, eel, sole,
   and tuna. Results of this study demonstrate that cod allergy might be,
   on the whole, a reliable index of fish allergy, but cod-positive

   existence of poroelastic effects in the reservoir.  The poroelastic
   effects, induced by leak-off of the fracturing fluid, are treated in a
   manner consistent with the basic assumptions of the PKN model, by means
   of a transient influence function.  The fracture model is formulated in
   a moving coordinates system and solved using an explicit finite
   difference technique.  The numerical algorithm has the following
   features:  fixed mesh, adaptive control of the time step, and
   unconstrained fracture length during shut-in.  Numerical simulation with
   this model indicates that poroelastic processes could be responsible for
   a significant increase of the treatment pressure, but that they have
   virtually no influence on the fracture length and fracture width.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the first U-Pb isotope analyses on experimentally
   shocked zircon, titanite, and monazite from Proterozoic granitoid rocks.
   In all three types of minerals, shock-waves produce drastic changes in
   the crystal lattices, causing strong lowering of birefringence,
   turbidization, and decolorization of the individual grains.  Moreover,
   X-ray patterns indicate transition of the crystals into polycrystalline
   aggregates of < 10(-5) mm block-size.  Precisely dated grains with
   concordant or nearly concordant ages were embedded in KBr and shocked at
   35, 47.5, and 59 GPa.  U-Pb isotope analyses on these grains show that
   shock metamorphism does not fractionate Pb isotopes  within the
   analytical precision of +/- 0.1\%.  As far as chemical fractionation is
   concerned, there is no difference in degree of concordancy between
   shocked and unshocked monazite, and small degrees (< 2\%) of relative
   U/Pb fractionation in shocked zircon and titanite are due to
   time-integrated Pb-loss and not to shock experiment.  In consequence,
   the data document that shock-wave metamorphism alone does not measurably
   effect the U-Pb chronometer, questioning the view that lower intercept
   ages of discordant U-Pb data reflect shock-induced re-equilibration of
   the chronometer in moderately to highly shocked, rapidly cooling rocks.}},

Abstract = {{Holocene marine mollusks, many in situ, are found in great numbers on an
   emergent coastal plain north of the Rio Santa, on the north-central
   coast of Peru.  Samples of the mollusks were collected, identified, and
   grouped into assemblages of recurring species.  The surficial
   sedimentology and geomorphology of the coastal plain were studied to
   determine the paleoecological significance of the molluscan shells, many
   of which belong to species now restricted to a biogeographically
   transitional zone north of Bayovar, Peru, 200 km north of the study
   area.  Radiocarbon dates, mostly obtained from shells in natural
   deposits and middens, were used to track the Holocene development of the
   coastline.
   The warm-water mollusks lived within a shallow lagoon of about 29 km2
   between 6500-4300 yr B.P.  Free tidal exchange with the Pacific Ocean
   was impeded by partially-drowned beach ridges within the lagoon and by a
   barrier-forming beach ridge that joined the mainland with an offshore
   island.  Contemporaneous, in situ, cold-water faunas were discovered at
   the mouth of the lagoon and in washover deposits landward of the barrier
   beach ridge.  The association of contemporaneous and adjacent
   assemblages of warm-water and cold-water mollusks shows that the
   thermally-anomalous molluscan assemblage (TAMA) at Santa is a
   consequence of local coastal paleogeography, not regional or global
   mid-Holocene climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Late Pleistocene-Holocene history of the Ebro continental shelf of
   northeastern Spain is recorded in two main sedimentary units: (1) a
   lower, transgressive unit that covers the shelf and is exposed on the
   outer shelf south of 40-degrees-40'N, and (2) an upper, progradational,
   prodeltaic unit that borders the Ebro Delta and extends southward along
   the inner shelf. The lower transgressive unit includes a large linear
   shoal found at a water depth of 90 m and hardground mounds at water
   depths of 70-80 m. Some patches of earlier Pleistocene prodelta mud
   remain also, exposed or covered by a thin veneer of transgressive sand
   on the northern outer shelf. This relict sand sheet is 2-3 m thick and
   contains 9000-12,500 yr old oyster and other shells at water depths of
   78-88 m.
   The upper prodelta unit covers most of the inner shelf from water depths
   of 20-80 m and extends from the present Ebro River Delta to an area to
   the southwest where the unit progressively thins and narrows.
   Interpretation of high-resolution seismic reflection data shows the
   following facies occurring progressively offshore: (1) a thick
   stratified facies with thin progradational ``foresets beds{''}, (2) a
   faintly laminated facies with sparse reflectors of low continuity, and
   (3) a thin transparent bottomset facies underlain by a prominent
   flat-lying reflector. Deposition in the northern half of the prodelta
   began as soon as the shoreline transgressed over the mid-shelf, but
   progradation of the southern half did not begin until about 1000-3000
   yrs after the transgression.
   A classic deltaic progradational sequence is shown in the Ebro prodelta
   mud by (1) gradation of seismic facies away from the delta, (2)
   coarsening-upward sequences near the delta and fining-upward sequences
   in the distal mud belt deposits, and (3) thin storm-sand layers and
   shell lags in the nearshore stratified facies. The boundaries of the
   prodeltaic unit are controlled by increased current speeds on the outer
   shelf (where the shelf narrows) and by development of the shoreface sand
   body resulting from shoaling waves on the inner shelf.}},

Title = {{FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE AS FACTORS IN THE PERSONAL IDEAL OF THE FARMERS
   WORK - THE ASSESSMENT OF FARMING AS A PROFESSION}},
Journal = {{BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT}},
Year = {{1990}},
Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{The structural changes taking place in the agricultural sector are being
   largely dictated by the choice of farming as a profession.  In addition
   to economic factors, social factors, such as the ideal of farming as a
   profession, also play their part when people are deciding whether to
   take on a farm or not.  Here, freedom and independence occupy a central
   position in the farmer's personal concept of his work, as numerous
   investigations have confirmed.  A qualitative analysis reveals six
   levels of freedom:  the freedom to run one's farm as one likes, the
   freedom associated with working in the open air, with being one's own
   master, with being able to time one's work as one likes within the
   overall programme, the freedom to perform the work as one pleases, and
   the economic independence provided by this livelihood.  However, some of
   these components of freedom appears to exist more in the minds and
   assertions of farmers than in actual practice.  The author concludes by
   outlining two challenges arising for future evaluations of the farming
   profession:  the single European market, which the German farmers are
   preparing for by reorganising the integration of the production stage,
   and all-German farming, which will produce totally new tasks for the
   representatives of the farming profession.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we describe the effects of rapid thermal annealing on the
   electrical and optical properties of modulation-doped quantum wells
   (MDQWs).  The sheet carrier concentration in MDQW structures which have
   been annealed in contact with a piece of GaAs tends to decrease with
   increasing annealing time due to Si auto-compensation in the doped
   AlGaAs regions.  The high energy cut-off point of 4.2 K PL spectra,
   which occurs at the Fermi energy, and the 77 K PL linewidth are accurate
   measures of sheet carrier density.  These two parameters track
   variations in carrier density produced by annealing.  Photoluminescence
   spectra also provide additional insight into annealing-induced changes
   such as Si migration, which causes a degradation in the mobility of the
   two-dimensional electron gas.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial infection has been implicated in premature labor in humans. To
   elucidate mechanisms and potential intervention strategies, we sought to
   develop a model of infection-induced pregnancy loss in rabbits.  On day
   21 (70\% of gestation), each uterine horn was inoculated
   hysteroscopically with 0.2 ml containing saline solution or 10(6) cfu
   Escherichia coli or Bacteroides bivius or Fusobacterium necrophorum.
   Fetal viability was assessed.  Animals were sacrificed at various times
   or as delivery occurred.  Serum progesterone and amniotic fluid
   prostaglandins were measured.  Cultures and histologic sections were
   prepared.  Compared with the saline solution group, E. coli and F.
   necrophorum-inoculated rabits were significantly more likely to deliver
   (16 of 16 and six of seven with mean times of 31.9 +/- 10.7 and 28.3 +/-
   11.5 hours, respectively for E. coli and F. necrophorum).  Positive
   amniotic fluid cultures for the E. coli group were found in 11 of 12
   (92\%) and for the F. necrophorum group in three of three cases (100\%).
   Histologic inflammation was seen heavily in both the E. coli and F.
   necrophorum groups, whereas it was absent in the saline solution group.
   Inoculation with B. bivius led to a much lower pregnancy loss rate
   (eight of 32) and less histologic inflammation despite positive uterine
   cultures in most animals.  This model may provide an opportunity to
   determine mechanisms of clinical and subclinical intraamniotic infection
   and to test intervention strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Glucose tolerance and insulin secretion were studied in 56 women 6-12
   years following a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes, and in
   23 matched controls.  At recall 14 women were known to have diabetes and
   five were again pregnant with recurrent gestational diabetes.  The early
   development of diabetes was associated with a fasting plasma glucose > 6
   mmol/l during pregnancy and with a high plasma glucose response to oral
   glucose which persisted after delivery.  Obesity was predictive of
   non-insulin-dependent diabetes whereas those that later required insulin
   were not obese.  At recall, seven of the remaining 37 women were found
   to have unrecognized diabetes, 13 had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)
   and 17 were normal by WHO criteria using a 75 g oral glucose tolerance
   test.  In these 37 women, fasting plasma glucose and the glucose
   response to oral glucose in pregnancy were not predictive of subsequent
   diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.  Obesity in pregnancy and
   subsequent weight gain were associated with non-insulin-dependent
   diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance at recall.  Insulin deficiency
   was observed during the oral glucose tolerance test in the diabetics
   (the mean+/-SEM ratio insulin area:  glucose area 4.1+/-1.3 diabetics,
   10.7+/-1.8 controls, p < 0.05), whereas in the group with impaired
   glucose tolerance insulin levels were high and in proportion to their
   hyperglycaemia (insulin area:  glucose area 10.9+/-1.4 controls).  Women
   with normal glucose tolerance and previous gestational diabetes had
   significantly lower insulin responses than their controls, despite mild
   hyperglycaemia (insulin area:  glucose area 4.0+/-0.7 normal glucose
   tolerance, 7.6+/-1.1 controls, p < 0.02).  Abnormalities of glucose
   tolerance and insulin secretion are present following a gestational
   diabetic pregnancy.  Gestational diabetes identifies women at risk for
   developing diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, both of which are
   risk factors for premature vascular disease.}},

Abstract = {{The speed-torque relationship of the right knee extensor muscle group
   was investigated in eight untrained subjects (28 +/- 2 yr old).  Torque
   was measured at a specific knee angle during isokinetic concentric or
   eccentric actions at nine angular velocities (0.17-3.66 rad/s) and
   during isometric actions.  Activation was by ``maximal{''} voluntary
   effort or by transcutaneous tetanic electrical stimulation that induced
   an isometric torque equal to 60\% (STIM 1) or 45\% (STIM 2) of the
   voluntary isometric value.  Torque increased (P < 0.05) to 1.4 times
   isometric as the speed of eccentric actions increased to 1.57 rad/s for
   STIM 1 and STIM 2.  Thereafter, increases in eccentric speed did not
   further increase torque.  Torque did not increase (P > 0.05) above
   isometric for voluntary eccentric actions. As the speed of concentric
   actions increased from 0.00 to 3.66 rad/s, torque decreased (P < 0.05)
   more (P < 0.05) for both STIM 1 and STIM 2 (two-thirds) than for
   voluntary activation (one-half).  As a result of these responses, torque
   changed three times as much (P < 0.05) across speeds of concentric and
   eccentric actions with artificial (3.4-fold) than voluntary (1.1-fold)
   activation.  The results indicate that with artificial activation the
   normalized speed-torque relationship of the knee extensors in situ is
   remarkably similar to that of isolated muscle.  The relationship for
   voluntary activation, in contrast, suggests that the ability of the
   central nervous system to activate the knee extensors during maximal
   efforts depends on the speed and type of muscle action performed.}},

Abstract = {{Onchocerca volvulus worms, extracted from nodules by collagenase
   digestion, stained with haematoxylin and cleared in glycerol, were
   unravelled for longitudinal examination and later embedded in brain
   blocks for study of serial transverse sections. A classification system
   for female worms is proposed, based on the reproductive status of 446
   worms from Guatemala, 94 from Liberia and 125 from Mali. They were
   categorized into fecund, inseminated specimens; uninseminated, but
   potentially fertile specimens, shedding ova destined to degenerate;
   worms changing from the uninseminated to the inseminated state and vice
   versa, which were few in number; old worms, with degenerate ovaries,
   whose genital tracts were either empty or had disappeared; and moribund
   or dead worms, characterized by loss of turgor, collapse and
   degeneration, calcification, or invasion by polymorphic, basophilic
   cells. Potentially fertile worms shed oocytes continously and, when they
   were inseminated, embryonic development ensued. No evidence was found of
   a periodic cycle of reproduction. Inseminated worms were found in
   nodules without a male worm, and uninseminated worms in nodules
   harbouring male worms. Measurements are recorded of portions of the
   female reproductive tract and of the length of uterus occupied by the
   various embryonic stages in fully fecund worms. A significant difference
   in the length of the body behind the first and second ovaries was
   observed as between worms from West African savanna (Mali) and forest
   (Liberia). Limited observations were also made on meiosis in the oocyte,
   penetration of the oocyte by sperm, formation of the ovum, syngamy and
   zygote formation.}},

Abstract = {{We report the preparation and characterization of an IgG2 monoclonal
   antibody (MAb), HSMA, prepared against a human pooled sweat extract
   (HPSE).  The major component of HPSE was a mucin-type molecule, as
   revealed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylanide gel electrophoresis
   (SDS-PAGE) stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reagent.  By
   immunoblotting, HSMA revealed a smear in the high molecular weight
   range, typical of mucins.  In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),
   HSMA failed to react with HPSE fractions isolated after anionic exchange
   gel chromatography.  Similarly, radio-immunobinding assays demonstrated
   no reactivity between HSMA and A, B, H, and Lewis blood group-related
   structures.
   The immuhistological labeling on normal skin showed that HSMA reacted
   with the cells of eccrine sweat glands, and to a lesser extent, with
   sebaceous glands and epidermal cells.  Periodate treatment in situ
   abolished these reactions, thus suggesting the carbohydrate structure of
   the HSMA-epitope.  In indirect immunofluorescence (IF) studies, HSMA
   also reacted with other exocrine glands, e.g. mammary glands, sublingual
   glands, mixed sero-mucous glands of the trachea, and in the pancreas. 
   Sparse positive cells were also observed in the testis, kidney, thyroid
   and digestive tract.}},

Abstract = {{The ultrastructure of 17 human parotid glands was studied in order to
   determine the features of the nuclear bodies and their possible relation

   bodies were seldom found. The percentage of nuclear sections containing
   nuclear bodies varied from 5.7 to 66.4 for the acini, and from 17.8 to
   80\% for the striated ducts. In 4 out of our 6 cases of chronic
   inflammation, numerous nuclear bodies were observed in the same nucleus.
   The increase in the number of nuclear bodies seemed to be related to an
   altered cell metabolism. In 3 cases, membranous type inclusions were
   found. This type of nuclear inclusion is quite different from the true
   nuclear bodies.}},

Abstract = {{The prostatic hyperplasia takes place in the average and old age male
   population.  It occurs in 23 to 88\% of the the men between 45 and 90
   years old and it may cause server urinary obstructive symptoms in 10 to
   25\% of them.  A significative amount of that percentage of symptomatic
   patients deserve treatment.
   The pharmacologic treatment can bring relief of symptoms for a shorter
   of longer period of time but it is not the definite solution.  In our
   days the hormones (with anti-androgens effects) and the alfa-1-blockers
   are used with this purpose.
   The indications of surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia
   are:  urinary infection non responsive to medical treatment; upper
   urinary tract dilatation or acute urinary retention; decrease of the
   kidney function; behavioral troubles caused by urinary symptoms.
   The surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia can be performed
   by open or trans-urethral surgery.  In the urologic centers 90\% of
   prostatic sugeries are trans-urethral resections (T.U.R.) with similar
   benefits of the open surgery.  The T.U.R. is more comfortable and less
   painful for the patient.
   Although, the prostatic surgery may cause retrograde ejaculation it does
   not interfere on the male sexual behavior and capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Two adult males (ages 31 and 35 years) were studied while they
   participated in a week-long marathon tennis match under conditions of
   extreme sleep restriction (4-5 h reductions per night). Polysomnographic
   monitoring was conducted on the two nights prior to the marathon,
   continuously throughout the match, and on two recovery nights. In
   addition, measures of daytime sleepiness, mood state, and cognitive
   performance were obtained during the course of the study.  Despite
   undergoing marked sleep restriction, both players continued to obtain
   their usual (baseline) amounts of slow wave sleep throughout the
   marathon.  Both players showed a gradually increasing tendency toward
   daytime dozing across the first few days of the marathon.  This tendency
   decreased on the fifth day but increased again on the sixth day of the
   match.  Also, both players showed a pre- to postmatch decline on some
   cognitive measures.  However, the players differed markedly in their
   ratings of sleepiness, mood ratings, recovery sleep patterns, and
   endurance with respect to the demands of the match.  Results appear to
   be consistent with previous laboratory studies in documenting the
   primacy of the ``slow wave sleep drive.{''}  Given the marked
   differences observed between the players, research designed to identify
   factors that predict response to sleep loss seems to be warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of subtypes of the muscarinic receptor in homogenates
   of the rat brain was investigated by measuring the competitive
   inhibition of the binding of {[}H-3]N-methylscopolamine by pirenzepine
   and AF-DX 116
   (11]]2-](diethylamino)methyl{[}-1-piperidinyl{[}acetyl{[}-5,
   11-dihydro-6H--pyrido{[}2,3-b]{[}1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one). In most
   brain regions, the competitive binding curves for AF-DX 116 and
   pirenzepine were consistent with a two-site model. The dissociation
   constant of pirenzepine for its high-affinity site (M1 receptor) was
   approximately 10(-8) M, whereas the dissociation constant of AF-DX 116
   for its high affinity site (M2 receptor) was approximately 10(-7) M. In
   many regions, particularly those in the forebrain, the sum of the
   densities of the M1 and M2 binding sites was substantially less than
   100\% of the total sites, indicating the existence of a third population
   of sites lacking high affinity for both pirenzepine and AF-DX 116. We
   have designated these latter sites as non-M1, non-M2 muscarinic
   receptors. In general, the densities of the M1 and non-M1, non-M2
   binding sites were highest in cerebral cortex, corpus striatum and
   hippocampus, intermediate in thalamus and hypothalamus, and lowest in
   midbrain, medulla-pons and cerebrellum whereas the M2 binding site had a
   relatively low, uniform density throughout the brain. The binding
   capacity of {[}H-3]N-methylquinuclidinyl benzilate was estimated to be
   20 to 30\% lower than that of {[}H-3]quinuclidinyl benzilate in various
   regions of the forebrain, but not in more caudal regions of the brain
   where the two radioligands had approximately the same binding
   capacities. Treatment of homogenates of the cerebral cortex with
   benzilylcholine mustard caused a selective loss of the majority of the
   {[}H-3]N-methylscopolamine binding sites but spared 25\% of the sites
   labeled by {[}H-3]quinuclidinyl benzilate. The results of
   pirenzepine/{[}H-3]quinuclidinyl benzilate competitive binding
   experiments on cerebral cortex treated with benzilylcholine mustard
   showed that the residual binding sites for {[}H-3] quinuclidinyl
   benzilate were enriched in M1 muscarinic receptors.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of self-diffusion and trace component diffusion of Cs+ in
   Hydrous stannic oxide heated at 50 and 400-degrees-C was studied.  The
   diffusion coefficients decrease with the increase of exchange capacity
   due to the increase of the strength of electrostatic interaction with
   the exchange sites.  They are generally higher at 400-degrees-C due to
   the change of the microporous texture to a mesoporous one.  This is more
   important than the contrary effect of the decrease of site acidity at
   400-degrees-C.  The self-diffusion and trace component diffusion
   coefficients are almost equal, probably due to the presence of almost
   the same amount of free water in the oxide which seems to retain the
   alkali ions in a substantially dehydrated form.}},

   displayed an increase in the steady-state levels of mRNA for
   interstitial procollagenase that was proportional to its enzymatic
   activity. Laminin, the main component of matrigel, had no effect on the

   an n.m.r. time-scale, and both 1:1 and 1:2 complexes have been
   characterized.  The spectra of the complexes of Al(III) and Ga(III) show
   that the metal ions are bound to only one of the nitrogens of the azo
   groups.  In contrast, the 1:2 indium(III) complexes of the two symmetric
   ligands studied are fluxional, and values of DELTA-G double-ended-dagger
   are given for the process which `flips' the metal ions between the two
   nitrogen atoms.  For the 1:1 and 1:2 aluminium(III) and the 1:2
   gallium(III) complexes of asymmetric ligands, the expected isomers have
   been observed, and the equilibrium isomer ratios are reported. 
   Assignments based on H-1 n.m.r. spectra have been confirmed by the 15N
   n.m.r. spectrum of a 1:2 gallium(III) complex with a ligand enriched in
   N-15.  The isomer ratios can be largely rationalized by considering the
   effect substituents in the 4 and 4' positions have on the electron
   density of the remote nitrogen atom in the azo groups.  The effect of
   changes in pD on the isomer ratios and the H-1 chemical shifts has also
   been studied for the 1:2 gallium(III) complexes of a ligand with an

Abstract = {{Large toroidal and poloidal asymmetries with characteristics which are
   sensitively dependent on q(a), the vertical position of the plasma, and
   the type of additional heating are observed in the energy flow to the
   ASDEX divertor target plates.  The largest asymmetries and total energy
   depositions are observed during lower hybrid wave injection experiments
   with approximately 50\% of the input energy going to the combined
   divertor targets and shields.  A maximum localized energy density
   loading of 10 MJ/m2 is typical under these conditions.  Measurements of
   the asymmetries are consistent with a model in which magnetic islands
   and ergodicity due to intrinsic magnetic perturbations dominate the
   energy transport across the primary magnetic separatrix.  These results
   emphasize the essential role of resonant magnetic perturbations in
   determining the performance of tokamaks and demonstrate that
   non-axisymmetric effects caused by small perturbations became
   increasingly important in determining the transport properties as the
   injected power is increased.}},

   cornstarch.  Digestibilities of DM and OM decreased by an average of 6\%

   and cubic responses were noted in digestibilities of fiber constituents
   (lower values at the 7.5 and 10.0\% levels, higher values at the 2.5,

   increasing BP levels.  Wet weight of feces increased (from 117 to 374

   defecation was higher (P < .05) for dogs fed the diet containing 12.5\%
   BP than for dogs fed the other diets (5.2 vs mean value of 2.8/24 h). 
   Mean retention time of marked fiber decreased linearly (high value of
   23.4 h for the 2.5\% BP treatment, low value of 13.0 h for the 10.0\% BP
   treatment) with increased level of BP.  Beet pulp levels up to 7.5\% of

Abstract = {{The upper C-horizon was analyzed in 19 beech and oak stands in southern
   Sweden over a period of 40 years.  The results confirmed a study of ten
   other stands of the same period.  The exchangeable base and metal
   cations had decreased, on average, in the following order:  Na > Mn > Zn
   > Ca, Mg > K and 20-70\% was recovered in 1988.  Exchangeable Al had
   doubled.
   In spite of soil acidification, which according to earlier results
   should also have occurred in the upper soil horizons, many field-layer
   species had increased in cover.  Among these were several nitrophilous
   species.  However, a few species had decreased in cover, especially in
   the most-acid pH range.
   The yield of beech and oak has been measured since 1945.  Beech had
   increased more than expected in both basal area and site index (height)
   in 1976-85, while oak showed no stable changes in yield.
   The simultaneous increase of nitrogen deposition and decrease of soil
   macronutrients leads to the conclusion that the higher availability of N
   has been of greater influence on the ground flora and yield of beech
   than the loss of other macronutrients.}},

Abstract = {{Low density lipoprotein (LDL) and peripheral blood mononuclear
   leukocytes (MNL) were isolated from patients with (n = 11) and without
   (n = 11) angiographically documented coronary artery disease (CAD). LDL
   degradation rates in MNL were determined in vitro using both autologous
   and homologous LDL. The mean rate of LDL degradation was 1.7-fold higher
   in CAD-MNL than in control-MNL (P < 0.05), independent of the LDL
   source. The increased LDL degradation rate in CAD-MNL appeared to be due
   to an increased receptor-mediated LDL degradation rate in CAD-MNL and
   not to an increased CAD-LDL interaction with the receptor since LDL
   isolated from patients with and without CAD had similar in vitro
   degradation rates in HL-60 cells and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced
   HL-60 macrophages. An increased ratio of apo B to cholesterol,
   specifically apo B to cholesteryl ester, was observed in LDL isolated
   from patients with CAD. LDL particles isolated from CAD patients
   contained 14.8\% less cholesteryl ester thn LDL from control subjects (P
   < 0.01). The data suggest that CAD patients have an increased plasma LDL
   particle number even though they have similar plasma LDL-cholesterol
   levels as compared to control subjects. These data indicate that CAD
   patients with normal plasma LDL cholesterol levels have two metabolic
   abnormalities: an altered LDL composition resulting in particles with
   reduced cholesteryl ester content and an increased LDL catabolism
   resulting in an increased influx of LDL cholesterol into MNL; both of
   which may play a role in the development of coronary heart disease.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study was to assess the mechanical role of
   the expiratory muscles during spontaneous breathing in prone animals.
   The electromyographic (EMG) activity of the triangularis sterni, the
   rectus abdominis, the external oblique, and the transversus abdominis
   was studied in 10 dogs light anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium.
   EMGs were recorded during spontaneous steady-state breathing in supine
   and prone suspended animals both before and after cervical vagotomy.  We
   also measured the end-expiratory lung volume {[}functional residual
   capacity (FRC)] in supine and prone positions to assess the mechanical
   role of expiratory muscle activation in prone dogs.  Spontaneous
   breathing in the prone posture elicited a significant recruitment of the
   triangularis sterni, the external oblique, and the transversus abdominis
   (P < 0.05).  Bilateral cervical vagotomy eliminated the postural
   activation of the external oblique and the transversus abdominis but not
   the triangularis sterni.  Changes in posture during control and after
   cervical vagotomy were associated with an increase in FRC.  However,
   changes in FRC, on average, were 132.3 +/- 33.8 (SE) ml larger (P <
   0.01) postvagotomy.  We conclude that spontaneous breathing in prone
   anesthetized dogs is associated with a marked phasic expiratory
   recruitment of rib cage and abdominal muscles.  The present data also
   indicate that by relaxing at end expiration the expiratory muscles of
   the abdominal region are directly responsible for generating roughly
   40\% of the tidal volume.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional large-strain electrokinetic consolidation model is
   formulated for which properties may be chosen arbitrarily. Important
   void ratio dependent soil properties include permeabilty,
   compressibility, specific conductance and electrokinetic mobility. These

   parameters of which are measured where possible. The resulting
   non-linear partial differential equation is solved numerically using a
   finite element approach and the results are compared to experimental
   measurements obtained from a novel electrokinetic consolidation cell.
   This cell is used to consolidate a dispersion of colloidal silica. One
   of the cell's unique features involves a liquid anode which does not
   give off oxygen and which permits virtually complete control over those
   ions which serve as current carriers. This provision is used to examine
   the effect of injecting multivalent cations into pre-consolidated,
   compacted silica. In addition to the new electrode design, the cell is
   pressurized to some desired level in order to permit a greater
   development of effective stresses in the densifying sample.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the BONDYN program (BONd graph DYNamics) as a
   procedure for simulating dynamic systems.  It is based on bond graph
   theory and provides a means for treating dynamic systems that
   simultaneously include various physical domains.  The program makes use
   of the bond graph module handling facility in order to build a general
   model starting from simple submodels.  Although the latter can be
   defined by the user, a library has been appended to the preprocessor
   which includes some of these submodels.  Special developments for
   simulating multibody systems can be found among them.  Once the overall
   bond graph has been assembled the program builds the state equations of
   the system in the form of a subroutine that can be accepted by a high
   level language compiler, which is FORTRAN 77 in this case.  Simulation
   outputs can be shown either graphically or in a table.}},

Title = {{HIGH-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT GLUTENIN SUBUNIT VARIATION IN THE SITOPSIS SECTION

Abstract = {{Variation in high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin subunit composition
   among Aegilops species of the sitopsis section, namely Ae. bicornis, Ae.
   longissima, Ae. sharonensis, Ae, searsii and Ae. speltoides was
   investigated using one-dimensional, as well as two step one-dimensional
   (2S-1D), sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
   (SDS-PAGE).  The presence of three glutenin bands in several accessions
   of Ae longissima and Ae. sharonensis seems to be evidence for the
   existence of at least three active genes, called x, y and z, controlling
   the synthesis of the high molecular weight glutenins in the genome S of
   Aegilops.  From comparisons between the glutenin patterns found in the
   species analysed and those bands observed for the B genome of hexaploid
   wheat, it can be concluded that Ae. bicornis, Ae. longissima and Ae.
   sharonensis are unlikely donors of the B genome, mainly because of the
   presence of specific glutenin markers that were absent in wheat.  Ae.
   searsii and Ae. speltoides showed glutenin subunits that moved within
   the range of those of B, but Ae. speltoides is the only species that
   could explain the variability for HMW subunits previously described for
   the B genome of wheat, and therefore it cannot be excluded as a possible
   donor of this genome.}},

Abstract = {{Formate is a substrate, or product, of diverse reactions catalyzed by
   eukaryotic organisms, eubacteria, and archaebacteria. A survey of
   metabolic groups reveals that formate is a common growth substrate,
   especially among the anaerobic eubacteria and archaebacteria. Formate
   also functions as an accessory reductant for the utilization of more
   complex substrates, and an intermediate in energy-conserving pathways.
   The diversity of reactions involving formate dehydrogenases is apparent
   in the structures of electron acceptors which include pyridine
   nucleotides, 5-deazaflavin, quinones, and ferredoxin. This diversity of
   electron acceptors is reflected in the composition of formate
   dehydrogenase. Studies on these enzymes have contributed to the
   biochemical and genetic understanding of selenium, molybdenum, tungsten,
   and iron in biology. The regulation of formate dehydrogenase principles
   of regulation in anaerobic organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Relationships between specific dietary factors and aspects of glucose
   tolerance were examined using data from the Zutphen Study.  In 1970, an
   oral glucose tolerance test was carried out in 394 non-diabetic men aged
   50-70.  Habitual dietary intake was assessed using the cross-check
   dietary history method.  In univariate analyses, positive associations
   were observed between fasting glucose and the intake of saturated fat
   (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.13, p < 0.01) and dietary cholesterol
   (r = 0.16, p < 0.01), and also reflected by an association with egg
   consumption.  These results were confirmed in multivariate analyses,
   taking into account total energy intake, subscapular skinfold thickness
   and age.  In univariate analyses, significant inverse associations were
   found between the incremental area under the curve (IAUC) and the intake
   of mono- and disaccharides (r = -0.22, p < 0.001) and pectin (r = -0.15,
   p < 0.01), as well as the consumption of sugar products.  Similar
   results were obtained in multivariate analyses.  The change in saturated
   fat intake in the period 1960-1970 was positively associated with IAUC,
   independent of concurrent intake in 1970, age, subscapular skinfold and
   change in energy intake.  In a similar model the change in pectin intake
   was inversely associated with IAUC.  These findings suggest that the
   intake of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol may be detrimental to
   glucose tolerance, in contrast to the intake of pectin and mono- and
   disaccharides.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly users must navigate through a hierarchy of menus in order
   to access the various functions available on a computer.  As the number
   of functions proliferates and the menu hierarchies grow more complex,
   the time it takes users to access any given function has become
   unacceptably slow.  Specifically, given a set of functions, recent
   studies have shown how to identify the structure of the complete,
   homogeneous hierarchy that minimizes the average time to access these
   functions.  In this article a general method for finding the optimal
   hierarchy is developed.  The method does not confine the search for an
   optimal hierarchy to the set of complete, homogeneous hierarchies; nor,
   given suitable input, does the method select as optimal a hierarchy that
   cannot be easily navigated.  It is important to identify the optimal
   hierarchy because it can reduce the average access time considerably, in
   some cases (at least in theory) by almost 100\%.}},

Abstract = {{The high temperature corrosion behaviour of some nickel aluminides
   alloyed with zirconium or hafnium is presented.  The corrosion tests
   were carried out in the temperature range 920 to 1010-degrees-C, both in
   air in atmospheres containing sulphur dioxide, using a thermobalance. 
   The results obtained in air show that all the nickel aluminides display
   sufficient corrosion resistance up to 920-degrees-C.  Nickel aluminide
   alloyed with hafnium is more resistant than the aluminide alloyed with
   zirconium.  The oxide layer on the specimens tested in air is always
   very thin, exhibits low porosity and consists mainly of Al2O3.  Without
   controlled preoxidation these materials are rather susceptible to
   corrosion in atmospheres containing sulphur dioxide.  The preoxidation
   in gas mixture containing water vapor and hydrogen markedly improves the
   corrosion resistance of these alloys.  The corrosion implies the
   selective oxidation of nickel aluminides.  The protective layer consists
   mainly of aluminum oxide and protects the base material also in
   atmospheres containing sulphur dioxide.}},

Abstract = {{Electrophoretic analysis of 24 loci specifying a number of enzymatic and
   non-enzymatic proteins was carried out in populations of Primorye house
   mice.  No variability in Ldh-B, Ldh of testis, fumarase, alpha-Gpd,
   Aat-2, Sod-2, Gp-1, GP-3 was found.  Distribution of the same main
   variant in all samples is represented by Sdh, Mor-1, Mor-2, Ldh-A, GP-2,
   Est-D, Gpd-x, Pgl, Ldr and alb.  The second variant of these loci was
   found in one or two animals.  Two and more variants encountered with
   significant frequency were detected for Id-1, Hbb, Aat-1, Est-1, Est-2,
   Mod-2.  Hybrid origin of the Primorye house mouse is assumed. 
   Genogeography of Id-1, Hbb, Aat-1 and Est-1 points to involvement of the
   Mus-2C castaneus form in development of their genofond, the effect of
   Mus-2A musculus being not excluded.  Genogeography of Sod-1 confirms the
   involvement of both castaneus and musculus.  Intensive mutual
   penetration of these forms (more than 300 km from north to south)
   indicates that they did not achieve the level characteristic of musculus
   and domesticus in the course of their differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Reactive radicals at the surface of quartz or other SiO2 polymorphs have
   been studied by EPR in relation to their possible role in pathogenicity.
   All the examined dusts bear the characteristic radicals of silica ground
   in air:  Si., SiO., SiO2.(peroxyradical) and O2.(superoxide ion), but
   some also show additional spectral lines belonging to other radical
   forms.  Comparison of standard quartz dusts (DQ-12, Min-u-sil 5) with a
   natural quartz and with what obtained by griding a very pure quartz
   crystal indicates that to a higher purity corresponds a higher radical
   population.  Cristobalite and vitreous silica exhibit similar spectra,
   with larger proportion by respect to quartz, of partially reduced oxygen
   forms.  The reactivity of the silica surface towards 02 and NaClO
   aqueous solutions are investigated by examining the modification in the
   EPR spectra induced by these treatments.  A possible mechanism for
   fibrogenicity is proposed whereby, within the activated macrophage, a
   catalytic reaction occurs between surface functionalities and macrophage
   oxygen metabolities.  This reaction would trigger the abnormal
   production of fibroblast stimulating factors, ending up with silicosis.}},

   reduction of synthetic peptides and N-terminal blocked peptides, in
   order to evaluate its potential for peptide sequence determination.  The
   -CH2-NH- cleavage with charge retention on the N-terminus was prominent,
   and the entire sequence of ions produced in this manner was observed. 
   Some of the sequence ions arising from -CH2-NH- cleavage accompanied by
   migration of two hydrogens, and -NH-C-alpha-H- cleavage with charge
   retention on the C-terminus, also occurred prominently.  In addition, a
   great number of internal fragment ions were produced in relatively high
   abundance; these provided supplementary sequence information and were,
   in some cases, critical in determining the complete sequence.  The
   usefulness of this method was exemplified by its application to the
   sequence determination of bacterial lipopeptides.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate how the recovery of the
   cochlea, after acoustic trauma, might be influenced by acoustic
   stimulation or deprivation.  In anaesthetized adult chinchillas, both
   ears were simultaneously exposed to a traumatizing acoustic stimulus (2
   kHz tone, at 117 dB SPL for 15 min).  Probe microphones positioned in
   both bullae were used to ensure identical exposure to the two ears; this
   was important because the experiment relies on within-animal controls. 
   Cochlear action potential thresholds across frequency (CAP audiograms)
   were used to verify the similarity of threshold shifts to the two ears. 
   Immediately following, a unilateral ossiculectomy was performed which
   resulted in one cochlea being acoustically deprived during the recovery
   period, whilst the other was not.  In groups of animals with recovery
   periods of 1, 3, 6, and 12 weeks, both the acoustically deprived and the
   normally stimulated cochleas were examined with scanning electron
   microscopy.  To quantify hair cell damage, we used a damage scale based
   on stereociliar integrity; for each cochlea, a standard region 5.5-8.5
   mm from the apex was studied in detail.  We found that after acoustic
   trauma, hair cell damage to the cochlea which is deprived of sound
   during the recovery period, is significantly greater compared with that
   in the normally stimulated, contra-lateral cochlea.  Our results suggest
   that mechanical activation of the inner ear acts to inhibit long-term
   degenerative processes, or influence repair of partially damaged hair
   cells.}},

   Myofibrils were mixed with maleate-NaOH buffer to set the pH between

   approximately 1.0 M) of KCL and were stored at 2-degrees-C. Acid-induced
   denaturation of myofibrillar protein such as myosin and actin was
   investigated by means of changes in various ATPase activities and in
   digestibility by alpha-chymotrypsin.
   The results showed that under the acid treatment, the majority of
   myofibrillar protein was slowly denatured in a complexed form as
   actomyosin in the presence of low concentration (0.1 M) of KCl, whereas
   through dissociation into myosin and actin in the presence of high
   concentration (over 0.5 M) of KCl.
   It was also shown that a rise in pH of myofibrils suspension tended to
   accelerate a preferential denaturation of actin, while a fall in pH
   caused rapid denaturation of actin together with myosin.}},

Abstract = {{To explore the southern limit of the temperature zone form of the Culex
   pipiens complex of mosquitoes in North Africa, we compared the structure
   of the copulatory structures of such male mosquitoes sampled along the
   length of Egypt.  Larval mosquitoes were collected in 11 sites
   distributed along the entire Egyptian span of the Nile Valley as well as
   in sites along the central Red Sea coast and in the western desert. 
   Four of these sites were sampled repeatedly, at various times of the
   year.  A DV/D ratio was calculated for each adult male mosquito. 
   Although all DV/D values conformed to criteria normally attributed to
   the temperate zone form, even at the southernmost site (22-degrees-N),
   values tended toward those of the tropical form in southern sites and
   during the summer months.  We concluded that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes of
   the Middle East are predominantly Mediterranean in form due to an
   isolating effect of the Sahara Desert which separates these temperate
   zone insects from those of tropical Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Differences and similarities between the mutagenicity of microwave
   radiation and VCM were studied on the lymphocytes of persons
   occupationally exposed to either of these two clastogens. The results of
   the micronucleus test and the chromosome aberration assay were compared.
   Our findings provided evidence that the mutagenicity of both VCM and
   microwave radiation can be detected with both of these tests. However,
   we detected both quantitative and qualitative differences between VCM
   and microwave radiation in the induction of aberrations and micronuclei.
   VCM causes quantitatively more chromosome damage but less dicentric and
   ring chromosomes than microwave radiation. Anaphase bridges are
   constantly present in the cultured lymphocytes of VCM-exposed persons
   but they are rarely seen in the lymphocytes of persons exposed to
   microwave radiation. The number of micronuclei per a certain number of
   aberrations is much higher in personsd exposed to VCM than in those
   exposed to microwave radiation. An attempt was made here to point out
   the main differences in the clastogenic action of a physical and a
   chemical agent. Such data can be fundamental for better understanding of
   the genetic effects which derive from mutal action of chemical and
   physical clastogens.}},

Abstract = {{Passive deviation of one eye through 18-degrees, 30-degrees and
   42-degrees, achieved by force applied to a sucked-on contact lens,
   caused the direction of visual targets seen by the other eye to be
   misjudged in the direction of the passive movement by an amount roughly
   one-sixth of the angle of passive deviation.  The result was the same
   when the perceived direction was indicated by hand, as when the instant
   at which a moving target seemed straight ahead was signalled.  This
   result is interpreted by considering that muscular efferents were
   identical in normal and eye-deviated subjects.  The main difference
   between the two target localization conditions results from the
   proprioceptor output of the deviated eye.  Our data demonstrate that the
   assessment of the direction of a target seen by an eye that is free to
   move depends in part on information received by the brain from
   proprioceptors in the orbit (in our case the contralateral orbit).  It
   would be surprising if the ipsilateral orbit did not contribute as much
   or more.  We therefore consider that this constitutes clear evidence
   against the pure outflow theory of visual direction judgement (Helmholz,
   1867), additional to that provided by the all-or-nothing situation of
   complete versus incomplete oculomotor paralysis.
   Two models have previously been proposed to describe the function of the
   visual localization mechanism.  Both assume that the necessary
   information is derived from the coding of the position of the eye in the
   orbit, either through a copy of the muscular activation or through eye
   muscle proprioception.  We propose an alternative model in which both
   afferent and efferent signals from all actively contracted or stretched
   muscles provide the necessary information to the CNS.  The data gathered
   so far from normal subjects made strabismic with a suction lens, and
   from a fair proportion of strabismic patients, support our model
   describing the mechanism of localizing of a single punctate target in
   darkness.}},

Abstract = {{A comparison of semi-solid vs. liquid embryo proliferation media was
   made using two Gossypium hirsutum L. genotypes (Coker 312 and T25) and
   two callus initiation media. Sections of petioles from mature, flowering
   plants were cultured on two modified Murashige and Skoog media. Medium 1
   included 4.0 mg l-1 NAA and 1.0 mg l-1 kinetin; medium 2 contained 0.1
   mg l-1 2,4-D and 0.1 mg l-1 kinetin. After six weeks, callus was removed
   from each explant and divided in half. One callus portion was placed in
   liquid proliferation medium and the other on semi-solid (0.2\% Gelrite)
   proliferation medium. Composition of proliferation medium was identical
   to that of initiation medium, except no growth regulators were added.
   Embryos were counted after eight weeks. The percentage of explants
   forming callus was influenced by genotype/initiation medium combination.
   Analysis of variance procedures revealed significant variability for
   callus initiation media, proliferation media (semi-solid or liquid), and
   an initiation medium x genotype interaction. Paired t-tests indicated
   that more embryos were produced in liquid proliferation medium (227.3
   embryos/culture) than on semi-solid proliferation medium (134.6
   embryos/culture).}},

Abstract = {{Total IgG and tetanus antibodies were evaluated in 2 series of

   been normal and birth weights > 3 kg.  Cord blood mothers tetanus
   antibodies ratios were 1.5 in Paris and 0.98 in Libreville (p < 0.01)
   respectively.  Some African children were not protected, either due to
   the lack of response of their mothers to immunization (2.2\%) or to an
   insufficient antibodies transplacental transport (2.9\%), or to the lack
   of immunization of mothers (5.9\%).  On the contrary, all European
   children were protected, in spite of low maternel antibody levels.
   Likewise, in Paris cord blood IgG level was 12.24 g/l vs 9.42 in mothers

   and 22.3 g/l in mothers (cord blood/mother ratio:  0.88; p < 0.01).  The
   correlations between maternal IgG levels and placental transfer rates

   large dimensionality, even when relatively small networks are
   considered.  This paper describes a data network design model based on a
   Mixed Integer/Linear Programming (MILO) formulation that does not, as do
   most other approaches, separate link capacity and facility selection
   from routing and topological design; it fully integrates these processes
   to capture the very important couplings that exist between them.  The
   performance constraints are incorporated into the model in such a way
   that they are linear but lead to the same grade of service for a
   balanced network as a nonlinear average network delay constraint.
   We show that our formulation leads to a natural decompostion of the
   optimal design problem into two subproblems solvable sequentially.  In
   the absence of capacity allocation constraints, the capacity and flow
   assignment problem is solved optimally and efficiently as part of the
   overall design process.  Moreover, the model leads directly to the
   solution of multifacility design problems.
   We present a fast link reduction algorithm that efficiently designs
   single or multifacility networks and yields robust local extrema.  This
   algorithm is based on a special-purpose monotonic greedy drop heuristic
   procedure.  One important application of this model is the design of
   multifacility networks, e.g., networks in the early stages of fiberoptic
   penetration, where other facility types necessarily coexist.  Our
   numerical results show that economies-of-scale lead to the appearance of
   fiber-optic highways within the network as traffic grows.  The numerical
   results also demonstrate the flexibility and computational efficiency of
   the algorithm, with particular emphasis on multifacility network design
   and planning.}},

Abstract = {{The relative paucity of data about the development of the stem cell pool
   present in the spleen prompted this study. During in vitro cultures of
   B-enriched lymphocytes from mouse spleens and in the presence of a
   culture supernatant of WEHI-3 cells (WEHI-SUP), a population of cells
   expressing the BP-1 antigen appears progressively, reaches an optimal
   size 8 days after initiation of the culture, and disappears on day 28.
   In 8-day-old cultures, a minor population of cells bearing both BP-1 and
   B220 can be detected. The growth of this cell population, with
   characteristics of the B lymphoid lineage (pro-B), is strictly dependent
   on the presence of WEHI-SUP in the medium. After 2 weeks of culture, the
   BP-1 antigen is expressed on a cell population, which is essentially
   constituted of B220-, polynuclear cells. The BP-1 antigen, which is
   considered as characteristic of early cells of the B lymphoid lineage,
   can therefore also be expressed on cells of the myeloid lineage. The
   injection of BP-1+ or B220+ cells in irradiated mice can hardly
   reconstitute their B cell pool, whereas BP-1- and B220- cells are much
   more efficient in vivo progenitors of this cell lineage.}},

Abstract = {{Chorioangiomas are relatively frequent, benign and highly vasculated
   tumours of the placenta.  In a few rare cases they show an excessive
   growth.  Placental necrosis, preterm delivery and foetal asphyxia are
   well-known complications.  Another severe complication is maternal
   thrombocytopenia, leading to serious thrombopathia.  In cases with
   unfavourable examination conditions, it may be difficult to distinguish
   ultrasonographically between a chorioangioma and foetal elements.  In
   our case, final diagnosis of a 10 by 9 cm chorioangioma became possible
   by the use of Doppler ultrasound.  Arterial and venous signals were seen
   all over the tumour.  During the following period of observation, the
   tumour did not grow and pregnancy was uneventful.  Diagnosis of
   chorioangiomas should be made as early as possible to enable the
   obstetrician to adjust the management of pregnancy to complications that
   can be expected.}},

Abstract = {{A phenomen of rapid and effective acidification of the medium by cells
   of the methylotrophic yeasts Hansenula polymorpha and Pichia pinus,
   grown in a medium with methanol, during incubation in an unbuffered
   solution in the presence of methanol or formaldehyde is described.  A
   close correlation of the acidification phenomenon and methylotrophic
   metabolism is noted.  It was established that the system of
   acidification of the medium is induced by methanol and is subject to
   glucose and ethanol repression and inactivation.  The acidification
   process is energy-dependent, since it is inhibited by respiratory
   poisons, uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, and inhibitors of
   ATPases.  It was shown that the release of protons is coupled with an
   extrusion of formate anions into the medium.  It is suggested that
   electrogenic plasmalemma H+-ATPase, which is responsible for the
   secondary electrophoretic extrusion of formate anions into the medium,
   participates in the acidification system.  A possible physiological role
   of the acidification system in the methanol metabolism in yeasts is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Macrophage-derived PGE2 is usually considered to be a down-regulator of
   TNF-alpha production.  However, we recently demonstrated that PGE2 may
   display dual activities in that low concentrations stimulated whereas
   higher doses suppressed TNF-alpha synthesis in resident peritoneal
   macrophages.  To examine the underlying molecular mechanisms, we studied
   TNF-alpha gene expression in rat peritoneal macrophages and the murine
   PU5-1.8 macrophage line.  In both macrophage types, PGE2 enhanced
   TNF-alpha gene transcription and production at an optimal concentration
   of 1 ng/ml.  Furthermore, evidence was obtained that PGE2 may stimulate
   TNF-alpha mRNA accumulation via a rise of the intracellular messenger
   cGMP.  Both, exogenously added as well as endogenously, by sodium
   nitroprusside generated cGMP were found to enhance TNF-alpha gene
   expression and production.  These findings lend further support to the
   concept that cGMP may represent one of the positive signals for
   TNF-alpha synthesis.}},

   such as (100), (110), (111), (210), (211), and (310) planes have been

   varies with azimuthal angle in the interface and the atomic diameter
   ratio of bcc to fcc, alpha.  From geometrical considerations of the
   atomic configuration at the interface azimuthal angle was fixed in
   several cases and the interfacial energy versus alpha was obtained for
   each interface.  The interfacial energy shows some energy valleys at the
   specific values of alpha.  By comparison of the depths of the energy
   valleys in each interfacial energy versus alpha curve, we can predit the
   preferred orientation relationships in bcc metals on the fcc(111)

   3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (3,3',4,4'-TCB) and

   resembled those of TCDD. The poor Ah receptor ligand
   2,2',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl was not toxic in 5L cells. The
   concentrations of TCDD, 3,3',4,4'-TCB or BA required for the toxic
   response were similar to those that elicited P450IA1 induction. The

Abstract = {{To examine the prediction that reproductive effort should increase with
   age, I compared female bison (Bison bison) of varying ages in terms of
   maternal behavior, reproductive costs, and the quality and quantity of
   offspring. In support of predictions, older mothers showed more
   tolerance toward and spent more time nursing their calves in months 1-5
   than expected based on age differences in size and presumed milk
   production. The two oldest mothers, who died before calving again,
   appeared to make the greatest effort. When mothers were barren between
   calves, which occurred more often in older females, their increased
   investment enhanced the weight, dominance, maturation rate, and/or
   fecundity of previous and subsequent offspring. In contrast to
   predictions, however, offspring quality did not generally increase with
   maternal age; in fact, primiparae tended to produce larger daughters.
   Nursing behavior varied little in month 1, when offspring condition was
   apparently most affected. Young mothers contacted their calves more
   often and tended to graze more during the first month. Reproductive
   costs appeared greater for young mothers; their fecundity in years after
   calving was relatively low. Proportional weight loss following
   reproduction decreased with age, although changing growth rates
   complicate interpretation. The results suggest a general decrease in
   reproductive effort, or at least in associated costs, during the
   reproductive life span. This pattern may be due in part to the increased
   experience and dominance status of older mothers, through which they may
   avoid some of the reproductive costs incurred by primiparae. {[}Behav

Abstract = {{The action of the fenoxycarb (an IGR JH mimetic) on the development of
   the tachinid parasitoid P. nigrolineata was tested by application onto
   its host O. nubilalis (by dipping larvae into acetone solution at 0 to 5
   mu-g/mu-l).  The duration of the larval development of the parasitoid
   (from host 4/5 ecdysis to pupariation) increased with the fenoxycarb
   concentrations from 11 days for control to 19 for 5 mu-g.  the duration
   of the puparial stage was only slightly affected.  Fenoxycarb treatment
   induced a high mortality of parasitoid instars II and III:  37\% with 5
   mu-g vs. 0 with control.  The yield in flies was reduced from 49\% for
   controls to 31\% for 5 mu-g.  the larval growth was strongly delayed by
   the IGR:  about 50\% of ``treated{''} parasitoids were still in instar,
   I, 6 d after 4/5 host ecdysis vs. 5\% in controls.  Fenoxycarb
   ``treated{''} larvae stopped their growth especially in instar II, at a
   weight near 1 mg, such that 50\% were still in this state 22 d after 4/5
   ecdysis while 92\% of control larvae had become pupariae.
   Contrary to some questionable results previously reported on the benign
   action of fenoxycarb on different beneficial insects, this IGR appeared
   harmful for the tachinid larvae tested.  This JH mimetic, broadly used
   especially on orchard pests should be more carefully sprayed with
   consideration for natural enemies.}},

Abstract = {{Constant speed propulsion tests of full models are investigated.  The
   propulsion factors are found to vary with propeller speed, n.  When the
   tests extend to idling conditions, the nominal wake fraction and the
   complete propeller-hull behind characteristics phi(u/nd) are determined.
   Fifteen designs of hull and screw are investigated.  In some, the
   coupling between the velocity field of the hull and that of the screw is
   found to be strong.  The behind characteristics depend both on the
   design of the screw and on the design of the hull.  The same design of
   screw may efficiently power hulls of quite different form.  A second
   kind of behind characteristic, psi{[}(1 - omega)u/nd, is introduced.  It
   is obtained from phi and it can be compared directly with the open-water
   characteristics.  It is shown experimentally that in a full ship the
   open-water characteristics are not generally an accurate substitute for
   the behind ones.  Therefore phi or psi ought to be used when predicting
   ship propeller speed N and power.  A condition for running the
   propulsion test is derived in which, after correction for the scale
   effect of blade friction on torque, the full-scale behind torque
   coefficient may be found from the model one.  Furthermore, in this test
   condition N may be rigorously scaled from n, measured on the model. 
   Thus full-scale performance is determined.  Limited tests of the method
   appear accurate.}},

Abstract = {{Only few data are available about the course of symptoms, cardiac

   followed the course of 308 paced patients (age 72 +/- 11 years) with a
   mean implantation time of 63 +/- 45 months.  Results:  The symptom triad
   of syncope, dizziness, and dyspnea improved remarkably in 93\% of
   patients.  Thirty-nine percent suffered from coronary heart disease. 
   The risk factors of hypertension (47\%), nicotine (37\%), and diabetes
   mellitus (25\%) were found significantly more often than in a normal
   population with the same age and sex profile.  In VVI paced patients
   with sick sinus syndrome (SSS, n = 67) atrial fibrillation (AF) occurred
   significantly more often (42\%) than in patients with AV block (n = 80,
   23\%, P < 0.05).  Only one out of 41 DDD paced patients showed AF at
   follow-up.  VVI stimulation seems to favor AF due to retrograde
   conduction in SSS.  Only 3\% of patients with SSS developed second- or
   third-degree AV block.  Therefore, atrial pacing is preferable in most
   patients with SSS.}},

   contribute to in-situ formation and atmospheric removal of the
   unsaturated aliphatic contaminants acrolein, acrylonitrile, and maleic

   anhydride may involve the reaction of OH (and O3) with 1,3-dienes and
   the reaction of OH with aromatic hydrocabons, respectively.  There is no

   acrolein (half-life = less than one day) and of maleic anhydride
   (half-life = several hours) is expected from their rapid reactions with
   OH (major), O3, and NO3.  These reactions lead to formaldehyde and

   Acrylonitrile is removed at a slower rate (half-life = 2-7 days) by
   reaction with OH, leading to formaldehyde and formyl cyanide.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive agricultural practices are thought to cause soil structure
   deterioration.  The work reported herein aims to study and analyze the
   long-term effects exerted by high application rates of N,P,K fertilizer
   on soil structure as characterized by tensile strength, stability to
   water, friability, and bulk density of its structural units.
   No differences were found in the organic matter content between the
   control and the fertilized plots.  Bulk density increased with
   diminishing the aggregates' diameter and this was attributed to
   shrinkage and not to differential effects brought about by different
   N,P,K amounts.  In the dry state the structure was more friable and
   ``smaller grained{''} under high P and without N fertilizers.  Water
   stability was not affected by the differential N,P,K treatments when
   compared with the control.}},

Abstract = {{This report describes a catheter ablation technique to treat
   atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia while preserving
   anterograde conduction, and its application in 42 patients with
   drug-refractory repetitive episodes of tachycardia.  One of these
   patients had common and reverse forms of tachycardia.  Using atrial
   activation in the His-bundle lead as a reference, the optimal ablation
   site was selected by positioning an electrode catheter to obtain a
   synchronous or earlier atrial activation than the reference during
   tachycardia.  At this site, His-bundle deflection was completely absent,
   or was present at a low amplitude ( < 0.1 mV).  In the majority of
   patients, these criteria were found in the immediate vicinity of the
   site of proximal His-bundle recording (adjacent to the reference
   catheter).  Shocks of 160 or 240 joules (J) were delivered at this site
   (mean +/- SD = 518 +/- 392 J/session) with a resulting preferential
   abolition of impairment of fast retrograde conduction.  Anterograde
   conduction, though modified, was preserved in all patients, except for
   four (10\%) patients who remained in complete heart block.  Thirty
   patients (70\%) remained free of arrhythmia without medication or
   pacemaker for a mean follow-up period of 23 +/- 13 (2-63) months.  Six
   other patients (15\%) were controlled with a previously ineffective
   medication.}},

Abstract = {{One-dimensional structures such as defect lines or chains of dipolar
   particles are generally subject to strong Landau-Peierls thermal
   fluctuations. Coupling between these fluctuations in parallel lines may
   lead to an attractive force, analogous to the London force, or to a
   repulsive force of entropic origin. We analyze these forces for chains
   of electric dipoles and for flux lines in isotropic superconductors. In
   the first case the force is attractive, and can significantly change the
   Hamaker constant, which governs the attraction between colloidal
   particles. In the second case, over much of the magnetic
   field-temperature phase diagram the force is repulsive, and dominates
   over the direct repulsive interaction between flux lines.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of alloying elements on TiC particulate dispersion into
   liquid aluminum was investigated. TiC particles could be dispersed in
   liquid aluminum without excessive dissociation, because of their
   chemical stability. The time required for dispersion of TiC particles
   into molten aluminum is defined as the incorporation time. The results
   of measurement showed that the alloying elements were divided into three
   types concerning the effect on particulate incorporation time:
   shortening, prolonging the incorporation time and no effect.
   The incorporation of TiC particles into molten aluminum proceeds
   accompanying TiC dissociation for wetting, resulting in the formation of
   an intermetallic compound of the Ti-Al system. In the case of additions
   of silicon, calcium and zirconium, EPMA showed that these elements
   promoted the reaction of TiC particulate dissociation; TiC --> Ti + C
   and shortened the incorporation time by forming an intermetallic
   compound with titanium. On the other hand, although alloying elements
   such as magnesium, lead and bithmuth were not contained in the
   intermetallic compound, the incorporation time was shortened by the
   surface active effect of these alloying elements. Copper had a little
   effect on the incorporation time. Since TiC dissociation is controlled
   by the existence of titanium in melt, the incorporation time for the
   Al-Ti system was prolonged consequently.
   It is clear from the microstructural observation that particles
   segregate along grain boundaries of the matrix under slow solidification
   rate as air cooling in the crucible. However, under the condition of
   rapid solidification rate, the sound composite showing a uniform
   particulate distribution was obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Wheat stem rust was first found in susceptible nurseries in southern
   Manitoba in the third week of July. Warm and dry weather during most of
   the growing season limited spread of the disease, and there were no
   losses in wheat crops. Losses were expected, however, in some heavily
   infected fields of barley. Five races were identified from 411 isolates
   collected from wheat and barley across Canada. The races isolated from
   wheat and their frequencies in eastern regions and Manitoba were
   similar. The combined frequencies were TPM (46.9\%), QFC (49.1\%), QCC
   (8.4\%), RCR (2.1\%), and RCC (1.6\%, Manitoba only). From Alberta and
   British Columbia the races and their frequencies isolated from wheat
   were QFC (61.0\%), QCC (25.4\%), TPM (11.9\%), and RCC (1.7\%). In a
   comparison of wheat and barley as sources of isolates, race QCC was
   isolated more frequently from barley, whereas QFC occurred more commonly
   on wheat. All isolates were virulent to genes Sr5, Sr21, Sr9g, and Sr17,
   and virulence to Sr8a was high. Virulence occurred with moderate
   frequency to genes Sr9e, Sr7b, Sr11, and Sr36; and with low frequency to
   Sr9b. No virulence was detected to Sr6, Sr13, Sr22, Sr24, Sr25, Sr26,

Abstract = {{The following question is discussed and evidence for and against it is
   advanced: is it true that if F is an arbitrary finite subgroup of an
   arbitrary non-linear simple locally finite group G, then C(G)(F) is
   infinite?  The following points to an affirmative answer.
   THEOREM A.  Let F be an arbitrary finite subgroup of a non-linear simple
   locally finite group G.  Then there exist subgroups D delta C
   less-than-or-equal-to G such that F centralizes C/D, F - C
   less-than-or-equal-to D, and C/D is a direct product of finite
   alternating groups of unbounded orders.  In particular, F centralizes an
   infinite section of G.
   Theorem A is deduced from a ``local{''} version, namely
   THEOREM B.  There exists an integer valued function f(n, r) with the
   following properties.  Let H be a finite group of order at most n, and
   suppose that H less-than-or-equal-to S, where S is either an alternating
   group of degree at least f = f(n, r) or a finite simple classical group
   whose natural projective representation has degree at least f.  Then
   there exist subgroups D delta C less-than-or-equal-to S such that (i)
   {[}H, C] less-than-or-equal-to D, (ii) H - C less-than-or-equal-to D,
   (iii) C/D approximately-congruent-to Alt(r), (iv) D = 1 if S is
   alternating, and D is a p-group of class at most 2 and exponent dividing
   p2 if S is a classical group over a field of characteristic p.
   The natural ``local version{''} of our main question is however
   definitely false.
   PROPOSITION C.  Let p be a given prime.  Then there exists a finite
   group H that can be embedded in infinitely many groups PSL(n, p) as a
   subgroup with trivial centralizer.}},

Abstract = {{The IgM antibody response of BALB/c mice to bacterial (Leuconostoc)
   dextran B1355 is influenced in a positive and negative manner by
   regulatory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively.  Treatment with
   concanavalin A (ConA) at the time of immunization or 2 days later caused
   suppression and enhancement of the antibody response, respectively. 
   Priming of mice with a sub-immunogenic dose of dextran resulted in
   profound suppression upon subsequent immunization 3 days later.  None of
   these effects were demonstrable in athymic mice.  Transfer of T cells
   from mice primed 18 h previously with a subimmunogenic dose of dextran
   suppressed the antibody response in immunized recipients; such
   suppression was abolished by the treatment of transferred cells with
   anti Thy 1.2 or anti Lyt2.2 (CD8) antibody in the presence of
   complement.  By contrast, the transfer of T cells from mice, which had
   been given an immunogenic dose of dextran 4 days previously, increased
   the antibody response in immunized recipients; such enhancement was
   abolished by treating transferred cells with anti Thy 1.2 or anti L3T4
   (CD4) antibody in the presence of complement.  These findings indicate
   that the immune response to dextran B1355 is regulated by CD4+
   T-amplifier cells (Ta cells) and by CD8+ T-suppressor cells (Ts cells)
   which are activated during the course of a normal antibody response.}},

Abstract = {{At its geographical limits, the distribution of Macrocystis C. Agardh is
   related to highest summer sea surface temperatures.  This paper
   discusses New Zealand populations of M. pyrifera (Linnaeus) C. Agardh,
   the distribution of which may be correlated closely with the Southland
   Current.  In New Zealand, M. pyrifera does not persist in areas where
   maximum temperatures exceed 18-19-degrees-C for several days, and where
   the warmest monthly isothere does not exceed 16-17-degrees-C.  An
   apparent easterly retraction of Macrocystis distribution within Cook
   Strait since 1942 is described, and the possibility that this may
   reflect slight warming in ambient sea surface temperature over the last
   forty years is discussed.  The intolerance of the kelp to extreme
   temperatures above 18-19-degrees-C was confirmed by experimental
   transplantation of kelp plants within Queen Charlotte Sound. 
   Collectively these observations suggest M. pyrifera may indicate patches
   of relatively cool water, and on a very small geographic scale.  In an
   area such as the Marlborough Sounds, clearly close to the plant's limits
   of distribution, the presence of Macrocystis may be useful in
   considering potential sites for locating net cages for the commercial
   ``ranching{''} of chinook salmon.  The upper temperature limit for both
   kelp and salmon appear to be similar.}},

Abstract = {{Moist tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) hay was treated with
   granular urea at rates of between 0 and 220 g urea N kg-1 dry matter
   (DM) and baled with a conventional baler. Moisture content (MC) at the
   onset and end of baling were 400 and 280 g kg-1, respectively. The hay
   was stacked in small stacks and stored for 35 days. Fifty-six and 91\%
   of the incorporated urea had been hydrolyzed by 4 and 14 days after
   baling, respectively. Urea hydrolysis elevated pH and lowered bale
   temperatures relative to untreated hay. Temperatures in untreated bales
   were above 50-degrees-C for 17 days after baling while treated bales
   were up to 18-degrees-C cooler. Treated hay lost significantly less
   water during storage than untreated hay. Final MC was significantly
   related to initial MC and the interaction of urea treatment and initial
   MC. Total bacterial counts were not significantly changed by urea
   treatment. Initial populations of yeasts and molds were greater than
   10(5) colony forming units (CFU) g-1 fresh weight (FW) but were less
   than 10(1) CFU g-1 FW after 35 days when another 12 g urea N kg-1 DM was
   added. Dry matter of treated hay retained 32\% of initial N added as
   urea after 14 days of storage. Urea significantly improved in vitro dry
   matter and cell wall digestibilities in samples taken the day of baling
   and also after 35 days of storage.}},

Abstract = {{The PARELLA model is a probabilistic parallelogram model that can be
   used for the measurement of latent attitudes or latent preferences. The
   data analyzed are the dichotomous responses of persons to stimuli, with
   a one (zero) indicating agreement (disagreement) with the content of the
   stimulus. The model provides a unidimensional representation of persons
   and items. The response probabilities are a function of the distance
   between person and stimulus: the smaller the distance, the larger the
   probability that a person will agree with the content of the stimulus.
   An estimation procedure based on expectation maximization and marginal
   maximum likelihood is developed and the quality of the resulting
   parameter estimates evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{A model of photosynthate production is the central component of a larger
   whole-tree ecophysiological growth process model for Populus (ECOPHYS). 
   This photosynthesis model was validated by comparing predicted
   photosynthate production values for individual leaves and the total tree
   with hourly field measurements collected on four days spaced throughout
   a growing season.  Simulated trees had identical numbers of leaves and
   leaf areas as the sample trees studied in the field, and hourly weather
   data collected on the plantation site were supplied as a model input. 
   Total production for the four sample days ranged between 200 and 4900 mg
   CO2 tree-1 day-1.  Model predictions of total daily photosynthate
   production were within 12\% of the observed rates for three of the four
   sampling days.  Diurnal variations in stomatal conductance and ambient
   CO2 concentrations and seasonal variations in area leaf weight were the
   primary sources of error.  Total leaf area, proportion of sunlit leaf
   area, and photosynthetic efficiency were the most important factors
   influencing carbon dioxide exchange rates.}},

Abstract = {{Life events and difficulties were recorded for the year before stroke,
   using a standardised semi-structured interview, in 113 surviving
   patients seen after their first ever in a lifetime stroke.  An age and
   sex-matched control group (n = 109) was also interviewed about the
   preceding year.  The stroke patients reported fewer non-threatening
   events and events with only a short-term threat, while difficulties were
   reported with equal frequency by the two groups.  However, events which
   were severely threatening in the long-term were significantly more
   common in the stroke patients (in the 52 weeks before stroke 26\% versus
   13\%, odds ratio 2.3, 95\% confidence interval 1.1-4.9).  The increased
   rate was apparent throughout the year and not just in the weeks
   immediately before stroke onset.  The number of stroke patients
   experiencing severe events in the follow up year fell to the level found
   in the control group.  Recognised risk factors for stroke were found
   equally in those patients with and without severe events before onset,
   except that hypertension was rather less common in the patients who had
   experienced a severe event.  It therefore appears that severe life
   events may be one of the determinants of stroke onset.}},

Abstract = {{The branch of science known as artificial intelligence covers a number
   of different fields of application.  Expert systems is one field which
   has attracted a lot of attention in recent years.  However, agricultural
   research has been devoting too little attention to the other fields,
   such as robotics or image comprehension, despite the interesting
   applications they promise.  Basic discussion and research are lacking in
   these fields.
   This article provides a survey of the various sub-branches of artificial
   intelligence, and furnishes examples of their applications in industry. 
   Potential directions which development might take for farming are
   analysed, and current research into applications of artificial
   intelligence for agriculture described.  The author shows that there is
   great potential for research in the field of artificial intelligence and
   that this should not be completely ignored by those engaged in
   agricultural research.}},

Abstract = {{Intestinal adhesions after cholecystectomy are a possible cause of
   abdominal complaints.  In this prospective autopsy study, we examined
   the frequency of intestinal adhesions in 100 consecutive patients who
   had had a cholecystectomy at some stage in their medical history.  In
   addition, we retrospectively surveyed the patients' files in order to
   clarify the presence of significant postoperative abdominal complaints
   indicated by recordings of relaparotomy or gastrointestinal examinations
   in hospital after the initial cholecystectomy.  We found that 9 (9\%) of
   the patients had severe intestinal adhesions (small bowel or caecum
   tightly fixed to the bed of the gallbladder, forming a kink) at autopsy.
   Relaparotomy had been performed on 4 (4\%) patients.  Thirty-four (34\%)
   patients had had significant abdominal complaints.  The presence of
   these adhesions, particularly of distal ileum (6 patients),
   significantly (p = 0.005) accumulated in patients with recordings of
   postoperative complaints.  The tumours, or tumour-like scars, in the
   cystic duct-stump and choledochal region found in 15 (15\%) patients
   also independently correlated (p = 0.04) with the postoperative
   abdominal complaints.  Other autopsy findings, such as peptic ulcers,
   cystic remnants, or choledochal stones showed no association with the
   complaints.  We conclude that intestinal adhesions and scars in the
   choledochal region are clinically significant and relatively common
   causes of abdominal complaints after cholecystectomy, and that they
   should be considered after other causes, e.g. those of biliary origin,
   have been excluded.}},

Abstract = {{We have generated two mouse IgM monoclonal antibodies against rat
   microglia.  The RMG-1 antibody recognized a 46-kilodalton cell-membrane
   antigen of ameboid microglia and cross-reacted with perivascular cells,
   monocytes/macrophages, and capillary endothelial cells of various organs
   but not with ramified microglia.  In the normal brain, RMG-1 positive
   cells were found in the choroid plexus, periventricular area, corpus
   callosum, subarachnoid space and white matter of the cerebrum  The RMG-2
   antibody recognized a 78-kilodalton cytoplasmic and cell-membrane
   antigen of ameboid and ramified microglia and cross-reacted with
   perivascular cells and monocytes/machrophages of various organs but not
   with endothelial cells.  A small number of RMG-2-positive cells were
   found in the choroid plexus and subarachnoid space on embryonic day 17.
   On postnatal day 1, RMG-2-positive cells appeared in the periventricular
   area and corpus callosum and then migrated to the internal capsule and
   thalamic nucleus.  Thereafter, the number of RMG-2-positive cells
   increased, reaching a maximum on postnatal day 10 to 14, and gradually
   decreasing by postnatal day 28. These observations show that microglia
   are cells of monocytic lineage that enter the brain parenchyma late in
   embryogenesis or early in the postnatal period and lose at least some
   monocytic antigens to differentiate into ramified microglia.  These
   monoclonal antibodies will provide useful tools to investigate the
   relation between microglia, perivascular cells, and endothelial cells in
   the brain and the kinetics of these cells in normal or pathologic
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The metabolism of lidocaine by human hepatic microsomes and purified
   human cytochrome P-450s, P0450NF (P450IIIA4), P-450MP (a P450IIC from)
   and P-450PA (P450IA2) was examined and their metabolism was compared
   with that by rat hepatic cytochrome P-450s.  Human hepatic microsomes
   produced monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and 3-hydroxylidocaine
   (3-OH-LID) from lidocaine.  In a reconstituted system with
   dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, P-450NF efficiently produced MEGX. P-450PA
   was not efficient in lidocaine N-deethylation (formation of MEGX) but
   produced 3-OH-LID.  P-450NF and P-450MP did not produce 3-OH-LID.
   Lidocaine N-deethylation activity of P-450NF was enhanced in a modified
   reconstituted system with a phospholipid mixture and sodium cholate.
   P-450NF appears to be an ortholog to rat P450 PB-1 (P450IIIA2).
   Anti-P450 PB-1 antibody crossreacted with P-450NF and efficiently
   inhibited lidocaine N-deethylation in human hepatic microsomes.  The
   correlation of lidocaine N-deethylation activity with the concentration
   of P-450NF determined immunochemically with anti-P450 P450 PB-1 antibody
   was good (r = 0.81).  In addition, correlation between P-450NF content
   estimated with anti-P450 PB-1 and anti-P-450NF preparations was good (r
   = 0.96). These results suggest that rat P450 PB-1 and human P-450NF have
   closely related properties and P-450NF is the major enzyme involved in
   lidocaine N-deethylation in human hepatic microsomes.}},

Abstract = {{A new field of study, behavioral physics, is proposed in which
   fundamental principles of classical and relativistic physics are applied
   to the behavior of organisms.  This is done by considering behavior as
   the equivalent of mass and, hence, energy, as occurring in an inertial
   frame of reference, and as measurable as changes in position and
   velocity along a time continuum.  The primary forces that accelerate
   behavior are considered to be reinforcement, which increases its
   velocity, and punishment, which reduces its velocity.  Based upon this,
   a theory of behavioral energy is proposed in which it is seen that a
   positively accelerated behavior attracts energy from the behavioral
   system to which it belongs, while a negatively accelerated behavior
   returns energy to the system, as a function of the proportional
   relationship of the masses involved.  Behaviors of large systems, their
   components, and closed and open behavioral systems appear to conform to
   the tenets of the theory.}},

Abstract = {{The self-incompatibility system in Potentilla fruticosa was investigated
   by examining pollen cytology, and by analysing intercrosses between two
   self-incompatible, cross-compatible cultivars of the species. The pollen
   was found to be binucleate, which is consistent with a single locus
   self-incompatibility system acting gametophytically in the pollen. This
   was confirmed by the results of the intercrosses. A proposed model for
   the inheritance of extra petals was tested by backcrossing selected F1
   hybrid plants to both of their parents. Non-random segregation of the
   double modifier (Dm) locus suggested linkage to the self-incompatibility
   locus (S). The model was accordingly modified to include this linkage.}},

Abstract = {{Generally, it is considered technically impossible to perform an
   extensive mucosal resection of the esophagus using endoscopy.  We have
   developed a new method of endoscopic esophageal mucosal resection using
   a transparent tube (EMRT).  With this technique, any amount and any part
   of the esophageal mucosa can be safely and easily resected.  After an
   experimental study, EMRT was performed in 11 patients and there were no
   major complications.  Near-total circumferential resection of the mucosa
   was possible, and the surface of the esophageal muscle layer
   (non-bleeding resection layer) was left intact.  We performed this
   technique on a patient with a mucosal cancer of the esophagus, and
   succeeded in resecting the lesion during a short course of treatment. 
   We conclude that EMRT is of value in the endoscopic treatment of
   early-stage esophageal cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Using the surface forces apparatus technique we have measured the
   dynamic properties of ultrathin liquid films between two molecularly
   smooth solid surfaces sliding past each other.  The results on several
   different liquids are reviewed; these reveal film properties that are
   profoundly different from those of the bulk liquids once the film
   thickness falls below five molecular diameters.  For example, the
   liquids can now support a normal (hydrostatic) pressure as well as shear
   stresses, exhibiting upper and lower yield points (stick-slip friction).
   Certain molecular rearrangements can take 10(10) times longer in a 10
   angstrom film than in the bulk liquid.  The experimental results are
   reproduced by computer simulations which indicate that liquid molecules
   in ultrathin films become ordered and solid-like, `freezing' into
   discrete layers which also have lateral order.  On applying a shear
   force, the film undergoes a melting transition from `solid' to `liquid'
   at the yield point.  But even during slip some order remains within the
   film which therefore becomes more like a liquid crystal than a simple
   liquid.  These phenomena and thin film properties do not appear to be
   readily describable in terms of mechanisms or concepts applicable to
   bulk liquids or solids.}},

Abstract = {{Using an anti-Ro (SS-A)-specific ``sandwich{''} enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western immunoblotting, we determined
   the Ro (SS-A) content (both quantitative and qualitative) in
   saline-perfused organs of the guinea pig.  All tissue extracts contained
   substantial concentrations of Ro (SS-A) antigen and could be grouped
   into 3 categories based on quantitative reactivity in the sandwich
   ELISA.  The 60-kd and 52-kd molecular forms of Ro (SS-A) present in
   tissue extracts were similar to those described in Wi-L2 extracts, and
   the 54-kd molecular form of Ro (SS-A) in guinea pig erythrocytes was
   similar to that found in human erythrocytes.  The tissue distribution of
   the isoforms of Ro (SS-A) was shown by Western immunoblotting to vary in
   different tissues, and the reactivity to the 60-kd Ro (SS-A) was
   correlated with the activity seen in the ELISA.  Both the 60-kd and
   53-kd Ro (SS-A) bands in guinea pig liver extracts were very weak on
   Western immunoblots, in contrast to the high concentration of Ro (SS-A)
   antigen in the ELISA.  Other data suggest the possible existence of a
   unique form of Ro (SS-A) in the liver.  Guinea pig tissues have 4 Y RNA
   that are equivalent to the 4 human RNA-hY1, hY3, hY4, and hY5-present in
   HeLa cells, while guinea pig red blood cells have only one Y RNA, which
   is equivalent in size to human hY4.  This heterogeneity of the Ro (SS-A)
   antigen suggests that there is differential expression of the various Ro
   (SS-A) genes in different tissues and expands the possibilities for
   tissue-specific pathologic events involving the Ro (SS-A)/anti-Ro (SS-A)
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Many tumors in the brain and in other tissues can be delineated
   precisely in images obtained with a CT scanner.  After the scan is
   obtained the patient is taken to another room for radiation therapy and
   is positioned in the beam with the aid of external markers, simulators
   or stereotactic devices.  This procedure is time consuming and subject
   to error when precise localization of the beam is desired.  The CT
   scanner itself, with the addition of a collimator, is capable of
   delivering radiation therapy with great precision without the need for
   external markers.  The patient can be scanned and treated on the same
   table, the isocenter of the beam can be placed precisely in the center
   of the lesion, the beam can be restricted to just those planes in which
   the lesion appears, several arcs can be obtained by simply tilting the
   gantry, and the position of the patient in the beam can be monitored
   continuously during therapy.  We describe here the properties of the

Abstract = {{The gene which causes tyrosinase-positive oculocutaneous albinism
   (ty-pos OCA) is not known.  Forty-seven Bantu-speaking Negroid families
   with ty-pos OCA were studied in an attempt to find linkage to the gene. 
   Fifteen `classical' and seven DNA polymorphisms were used in the search
   for linkage.  Close linkage was excluded for the Rh, Gc and beta-globin
   loci.  There is no suggestion of linkage to MNS, ABO, PGM1, 6PGD, ACP1,
   GPX1, GLO1, GPT1, PEP A, Tf, alpha1-AT, Hp, DQA, DXA and three arbitrary
   restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs).  There is a slightly
   positive lod score for pAW101 (D14S1) (0.591 for theta = 0.2).  An
   `interesting' lod score was obtained with Bf and a haplotype generated
   by the markers DQA and DXA (1.575 for theta = 0.1 and 0.979 for theta =
   0.2, respectively).  Further testing of markers on chromosome 6p are
   indicated.  Although ty-pos OCA in Southern Africa is likely to be a
   homogeneous disorder, genetic heterogeneity cannot be excluded as
   differences due to the presence/absence of ephelides within families
   have been observed.  To date 57\% of the genome has been excluded from
   linkage with ty-pos OCA.}},

Abstract = {{Both phased array techniques for single-component sensors and vectorial
   analysis of three-component recordings can provide estimates of the
   azimuth and slowness of seismic phases.  However, a combination of these
   approaches provides a more powerful tool to estimate the propagation
   characteristics of different seismic phases at regional distances.
   Conventional approaches to the analysis of three-component seismic
   records endeavor to exploit the apparent angles of propagation in
   horizontal and vertical planes as well as the polarization of the waves.
   The basic assumption is that for a given time window there is a dominant
   wavetype (e.g., a P wave) traveling in a particular direction arriving
   at the seismic station.  By testing a range of characteristics of the
   three-component records, a set of rules can be established for
   classifying much of the seismogram in terms of wavetype and direction.
   It is, however, difficult to recognize SH waves in the presence of other
   wavetypes.  Problems also arise when more than one signal (in either
   wavetype or direction) arrive in the same window.  The stability and
   robustness of the classification scheme is much improved when records
   from an array of three-component sensors are combined.
   For a set of three-component instruments forming part of a larger array,
   it is possible to estimate the slowness and azimuth of arrivals from the
   main array and then extract the relative proportions of the current P-,
   SV-, and SH-wave contributions to the seismogram.  This form of wavetype
   decomposition depends on a model of near-surface propagation.  A
   convenient choice for hard-rock sites is to include just the effect of
   the free surface, which generates a frequency-independent operation on
   the three-component seismograms and which is not very sensitive to
   surface velocities.  This approach generates good estimates of the
   character of the S wavefield, because the phase distortion of SV induced
   by the free surface can be removed.  The method has been successfully
   applied to regional seismograms recorded at the medium aperture
   Warramunga array in northern Australia, and the two small arrays NORESS
   and ARCESS in Norway, which were designed for studies of regional
   phases.
   The new wavefield decomposition scheme provides results in which the
   relative proportions of P, SV, and SH waves as a function of time can be
   compared without the distortion imposed by free surface amplification. 
   Such information can provide a useful adjunct to existing measures of
   signal character used in source discrimination.}},

Abstract = {{Permutation-valued Markov processes provide a convenient way to describe
   the genealogical structure of certain population models that allow
   immigration or mutation. Distinct cycles of the permutation correspond
   to binary branching trees that describe relationships among members of a
   particular family (or copies of an allele in the genetics setting), and
   the ordering of the cycles corresponds to families (or alleles) in the
   order of their appearance in the population. Building on the simple
   combinatorial structure of the Yule process with immigration, we
   describe the tree-valued processes that arise from linear birth and
   death processes and a population genetics model of Moran. This approach
   simplifies and explains much of the combinatorial structure of such
   processes, and relates genealogical (or time-reversed) processes with
   those running forward in time.}},

Abstract = {{The metabolic and hormonal responses to an intensive single-circuit
   weight-training session were studied in 15 untrained male students.  The
   training programme consisted of ten exercises, employing all the large
   groups of muscles.  Students performed three circuits using a
   work-to-rest ratio of 30 S:30 s at 70\% of one-repetition maximum.  The
   whole programme lasted 30 min.  Blood samples were obtained from the
   anticubital vein 30 min before exercise, immediately after exercise
   finished and after 1-h, 6-h, and 24-h periods of recovery.
   The training session produced significant increases in the plasma
   adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, aldosterone, testosterone,
   progesterone and somatotropin concentrations.  The plasma level of
   insulin and C-peptide remained unchanged.  The strength exercises caused
   elevated ratios of cortisol:testosterone and cortisol:insulin,
   indicating a prevalence of stimulation of catabolic processes as well as
   of mobilization of energy reserves but during the recovery period the
   reverse of this was observed.  Immediately after exercise the mean
   lactate concentration was 7.19 mmol.1(-1), SD 0.56, the glucose
   concentration increased significantly during exercise and decreased
   rapidly during recovery.  The high density lipoprotein-cholesterol
   increased in 1-h period of recovery compared with the initial level. 
   The concentration of total cholesterol, low density
   lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglyceride, did not change.  Paced cell
   volume did not change during exercise or recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Slabs of human enamel and cementum were incubated with plasma alone or
   with various mixtures of plasma and saliva.  Proteins and glycoproteins
   that adsorbed to the surface of the slabs in 0 to 60 min were labeled by
   lactoperoxidase-catalyzed I-125-iodination and by mild periodate
   oxidation followed by NaB3H4 reduction.  The labeled components were
   separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
   and visualized by autoradiography or fluorography.  From plasma alone, a
   58 and a 66 kDa protein (probably albumin) were adsorbed to the enamel
   surface in relatively equal amounts, but no I-125-labeled components
   were detected on the cementum surface in the absence of saliva.  Adding
   10\% saliva to the incubation mixture promoted the adsorption of the 58
   and 66 kDa components to cementum.  In addition, another set of
   proteins, including components of 44, 47, 29, and 25 kDa, was adsorbed
   to both cementum and enamel in the presence of saliva.  These six
   proteins were the major I-125-labeled species in all of the pellicles
   formed from mixtures of plasma and saliva.  The electrophoretic mobility
   of the major 120 and 140 kDa H-3-labeled sialoglycoproteins absorbed to
   both cementum and enamel was similar to that of the low-molecular-weight
   mucin of submandibular/sublingual saliva.}},

Abstract = {{Selective extinction following isolation of habitat patches may be due
   to biogeographical (e.g., island size or isolation) and ecological
   (species natural histories, interspecific interactions) factors, or
   their interactions.  Among the demographic and life history attributes
   commonly associated with high extinction probability are small
   populations, large size of individuals, and population variability.
   Long-term capture-recapture data from forest habitat in central Panama
   permit an examination of the association between mainland survival rates
   and extinction on a nearby landbridge island.  Species of birds that no
   longer occur on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, have, on average,
   lower survival rates on the adjacent mainland than species that have
   persisted on BCI.  Moreover, of the species that no longer occur on BCI,
   those with lower mainland survival rates generally disappeared earlier
   from the island,  My analysis provides little evidence of a relationship
   between extinction and population size.  Recolonization of BCI from the
   adjacent mainland by the forest undergrowth species studied here is
   unlikely.  Reduced reproductive success on BCI combined with naturally
   low adult survival rates seems to be responsible for these BCI
   extinctions.  High nest predation and/or altered landscape dynamics are
   probable agents in the low reproductive success.  The methods used here
   could be employed in other circumstances to identify
   fragmentation-sensitive species.}},

Abstract = {{Effect of exogenous betaine on the growth of an L-lysine-producing
   mutant of Brevibacterium lactofermentum was examined in a medium
   containing different carbon sources such as glucose, fructose, or
   sucrose.  The growth rate decreased significantly with a rise in
   temperature when sucrose was the carbon source.  Both the specific
   sucrose consumption rate and the invertase activity of the mutant
   decreased with the culture period when the cultivation temperature was
   35-degrees-C.  The addition of betaine restored both growth and
   invertase activity on medium containing sucrose as the carbon source at
   35-degrees-C.  Betaine protected the invertase activity against the
   inactivating effects of high temperature in vitro.  Furthermore, the
   addition exogenous invertase into production medium at 35-degrees-C
   restored the growth rate to that at 32-degrees-C.  These results
   indicated that growth decreased on medium containing sucrose at
   35-degrees-C due to a decrease in invertase activity, and that addition
   of betaine was an effective way to enhance growth on this medium at a
   higher temperature.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1990}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The lectin in Rhizoctonia solani is a major protein, although its
   function was previously unknown.  An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
   was developed to quantify the lectin content in mycelium, sclerotia and
   culture filtrate during the development of R. solani grown in a
   synthetic medium.  Lectin content was low in young mycelium but
   increased dramatically at the onset of sclerotium formation, reaching a
   maximum in adult sclerotia.  Upon  myceliogenic germination, the lectin
   content of the sclerotia rapidly decreased.  It thus appears that the
   lectin is a developmentally regulated sclerotium-specific protein
   accumulating during sclerotium formation and disappearing during
   germination.  Its relative abundance and the pattern of developmental
   control suggests that the lectin is probably a storage protein.  Lectin
   accumulation was also influenced by the composition of the medium.
   Addition of supplementary carbohydrate (D-glucose) caused a marked
   reduction in lectin content whereas increased nitrogen in the form of
   L-asparagine led to a higher lectin content.  However, when the
   L-asparagine concentration was too high, autolysis occurred and part of
   the lectin was released into the medium.}},

   with information obtained in 1984.  In 1988, 439 tunnelled-catheters and
   355 ports were inserted in patients; 2,778 organisms were subsequently
   recovered from 933 episodes of bacteremia and fungemia.  Fifty-percent
   of the episodes of bacteremia and fungemia were vascular access
   device-related.  Compared to 1984, the relative incidence of bacteremia
   due to gram-positive organisms increased from 33 to 43 \%, polymicrobic
   cultures increased from 24 to 27 \%, and the number of organisms with
   colony counts greater than 100 cfu/ml increased from  24 to 44 \%.  In
   1988, device-related sepsis was often caused by Acinetobacter spp.,
   Bacillus spp., Corynebacterium spp., pseudomonads other than Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa, and coagulase-negative staphylococci.  Infection was also

Abstract = {{Time course recovery from induced airway obstruction by carbachol
   infusion (CI; 0.2-mu-g.kg-1.min-1 for 40 min), carbachol aerosol (CA; 10
   breaths of 2\% solution), and histamine aerosol (HA; 25-50 breaths of
   5\% solution) challenge was investigated in conscious sheep (n = 6
   each). Total lung aerosol deposition and airway caliber as assessed by
   pulmonary airflow resistance (R(L)) were measured every 20-30 min up to
   4 h after the challenges.  Aerosol deposition was measured by monitoring
   aerosol concentration continuously with a laser aerosol photometer while
   the sheep rebreathed 1.0-mu-m-diam inert oil droplets delivered by a
   0.25-liter bag-in-box system driven by a respiratory pump at a breathing
   frequency of 30 breaths/min.  Total accumulated deposition at the fifth
   breath (AD5) as percentage of the initial aerosol concentration was
   determined and used as an aerosol deposition index.  Percent changes in
   AD5 from baseline were compared with corresponding changes in RL.  Both
   RL and AD5 increased after Cl, CA, and HA: 192-477\% for RL and 23-44\%
   for AD5 (P < 0.05).  Mean RL returned to baseline values 1 h after CI
   and HA and 2 h after CA.  Mean AD5 returned to baseline at 1 h post-HA.
   In contrast, mean AD5 remained elevated for 2-4 h after CI and CA (P <
   0.05), and the increased AD5 could not be reversed by a bronchodilator
   aerosol.  The persistence of enhanced aerosol deposition long after the
   return of RL to baseline suggests that complete recovery of airway
   conditions after CI and CA takes much longer than predicted by RL.
   Because carbachol is a potent secretagogue and clearance of airway mucus
   is a slow process, the differential response between RL and AD5 after
   carbachol may be related to increased airway luminal secretions,
   particularly in the distal small airways.}},

Journal = {{CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1990}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1157-1169}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A hand-operated, rotating-scope sediment sampler (HORS) has been
   developed for coarse-grained, shallow-marine sediment.  Design of the 10
   kg HORS was inspired by the 60 kg, winch-operated Shipek sampler which
   also has a 180-degrees rotating scoop.  At one-sixth of the Shipek mass,
   the HORS typically collects about one-sixth as much sediment.  The HORS
   is recommended only if a whinch is unavailable for a Shipek grab
   sampler.
   Grab samplers without a 180-degrees rotating scoop rely on one or two
   pairs of jaws which close toward the center along arcs of 90-degrees. 
   These center-closing devices commonly fail to sample coarse sediment
   because a large grain, e.g. a shell fragment, impedes closure and allows
   the sample to escape during ascent.  Center-closing jaws which meet
   rather than overlap eventually fail to meet completely because of wear
   along the jaw edge or misalignment.  All grab samplers, including
   rotating-scoop types, may induce some loss of the finest fraction and so
   are best reserved for reconnaissance work.  The sampler described herein
   has facilitated reconnaissance of the modern equivalent of oolitic
   ironstone in the southeastern Caribbean.}},

Abstract = {{The natriuretic effect of dopamine (DA) is less in younger than in older
   animals. The natriuretic effect of DA is due in part to occupation of
   renal tubular DA1 receptors, which are most abundant in the proximal
   convoluted tubule (PCT). However, it has not been determined whether
   ontogenic differences in DA1-receptor density, affinity, or coupling to
   intracellular second messengers are involved in the reduced natriuretic
   effect of DA in the young animal. We therefore studied the DA1 receptor
   by radioligand binding with the DA1 antagonist I-125-SCH 23982 and the
   effect of DA1 agonists and guanine nucleotides on adenylate cyclase (AC)
   activity in microdissected PCT during development in Wistar-Kyoto rats
   (WKY). The dissociation constant (K(d)) and maximum receptor density
   (B(max)) were similar in all groups (K(d), in nM: 11.9 +/- 0.7 at 3 wk,
   10.6 +/- 0.4 at 8 wk, and 12.2 +/- 1.2 at 20 wk; B(max), in fmol/mm PCT:
   0.24 +/- 0.02 at 3 wk, 0.23 +/- 0.01 at 8 wk, and 0.24 +/- 0.01 at 20
   wk). Basal AC activities were similar, and forskolin (10(-5) M), which
   directly stimulates AC, increased AC activity to a similar extent in all
   age groups. However, the DA1 agonists, fenoldopam (10(-5) M) and
   SND-919-CL2 (10(-6) M), increased AC activity in PCT to a greater extent
   in 20-wk-old (55 +/- 7\%) than in 3-wk-old rats (27 +/- 1\%). The
   ability of the guanine nucleotides, GTP (10(-4) M) or Gpp(NH)p (10(-5)
   M), to increase AC activity was the same among the groups. However, the
   stimulatory effect of SND-919-CL2 (10(-6) M) in combination with
   Gpp(NH)p (10(-5) M) on AC activity in PCT increased with age. These data
   suggest that there is a reduced efficiency in DA1 receptor-AC coupling
   in the PCT of the young WKY. This may explain in part the decreased
   natriuretic effect of DA in the young.}},

   all-glass water-jacketted culture vessels of almost-equal-to 250 ml
   capacity, linked by electro-pneumatic valves and medium lines of low
   hold-up volume to a common, spherical medium reservoir.  The contents of
   the reservoir and the culture vessels are agitated by efficient
   vibratory stirrers to keep the insoluble substrate in homogeneous
   suspension, and are blanketed against contact with atmospheric O2 by
   slow purging with a stream of O2-free gas mixture containing 5\%H-2,
   30\% CO2 and 65\% N2.  Medium is dosed to the culture vessels by
   periodic activation of the pneumatic valves, and corresponding volumes
   of culture are displaced into sterile harvest vessels via lateral exit
   ports with the aid of a slow flow of anaerobic gas through the culture
   vessels. Both pH auxostat (as defined by Martin and Hempfling ]1{[}) and
   chemostat operation are possible.  Performance specifications of the
   system are given and the usefulness of the system for investigations of
   the kinetics of growth on, and utilization of, solid substrates is

Abstract = {{We have purified a cell wall protein from extracts of soybean (Glycine
   max) that was previously shown to be immunologically related to p33, a
   wound-induced carrot cell wall protein (Tierney ML, Weichert J, Pluymers
   D {[}1988] Mol Gen Genet 211: 393-399). Amino acid composition analysis
   reveals that the protein is 36\% proline and hydroxyproline and its
   amino-terminus was determined to be
   AsnTyrGluAsnProHypValTyrLysProHypThrGluLysProHypValTyr. In vivo
   {[}H-3]proline labeling of soybean hypocotyl tissues and Western blot
   analysis indicate that the apical hook, a region characterized by active
   growth, is a predominant site for synthesis of this protein and that
   wounding does not a significantly affect its synthesis or accumulation.
   Antibodies raised against the hook protein also cross-reacted with
   higher molecular weight protein in cell wall extracts of wounded hook
   tissue. These data indicate that there are at least two related,
   proline-rich cell wall protein in the hook region of soybean seedlings,
   one that appears to be developmentally regulated and another that is
   wound-inducible. RNA encoding the developmentally regulated seedling
   cell wall protein was detected in both the hook and elongating region of
   the hypocotyl. The presence of this RNA in the elongating region in the
   absence of detectable levels of the protein indicates either that the
   expression of this cell wall protein is subject to posttrascriptional
   control or that the rate of insolubilization of this protein increases
   in more mature regions of the hypocotyl.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical investigation is reported of the conditions for the
   excitation and propagation of a traveling wave representing charge
   transfer between trapping centers located at an interface between an
   insulator and a unipolar semiconductor.  It is shown that such a wave
   may be excited when carriers drift in the semiconductor (beginning from
   a certain threshold value of a longitudinal electric field) and also
   when the trapping time of a free carrier at a center is short compared
   with the release time.  The resultant wave travels along an interface at
   a velocity much lower than the carrier drift velocity.  The frequency of
   the oscillations is also low compared with the reciprocals of the
   electron-capture time of a given center tau-k-1 and of the Maxwellian
   relaxation time tau-M-1.  The wave decays on both directions away from
   the interface.  It penetrates deeper in the semiconductor because of
   diffusion and this gives rise to additional losses, which may become
   dominant when the initial band bending at the semiconductor surface is
   of the type that induces accumulation.  On the other hand, a band
   bending that induces depletion tends to excite the traveling-wave
   instability.}},

   from a cell extract of Pseudomonas azotocolligans.  The purified enzyme
   appeared as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis, and consisted of a single polypeptide with a molecular
   weight of about 30,000.  Of phosphoryl donors tested,
   p-nitrophenylphosphate (p-NPP) and pyrophosphate (PPi) were as effective
   as ATP.  Optimal pHs for the phosphorylating activity were around 4.0
   and 5.5 when PPi and ATP were used as phosphoryl donors, respectively. 
   The Km for AsA was 147 mM.  The enzyme activity was inhibited by Cu2+,
   but not by sulfhydryl reagents.  The enzyme simultaneously had
   phosphatase activity at weakly acidic or neutral pH and the Km for p-NPP
   in the phosphatase activity was 0.38 mM.  The enzyme was tentatively
   named ``ascorbic acid phosphorylating enzyme.{''}}},

Abstract = {{The effect of temperature and humidity on SO2-induced photosynthetic
   depression was determined in gas exchange experiments with leaves of
   Vicia faba, L. Stomatal behaviour was sensitive to humidity resulting in
   higher uptake rates of SO2 and stronger reductions of photosynthesis at
   low VPD (vapour pressure deficit).  After a fumigation period of 2 h,
   when the photosynthetic rate had stabilized, photosynthesis of leaves
   exposed to SO2 at 8-degrees-C was reduced much more than at 18-degrees-C
   at the same rate of SO2 uptake.  Data analysis with a mechanistic model
   revealed that this effect was due to the slower rate of S(IV) oxidation
   at lower temperatures, resulting in higher accumulation of S(IV) and
   thus stronger reduction of photosynthesis.  These results were confirmed
   by experimental analyses of the S(IV) concentration in leaves following
   fumigation, which showed that more S(IV) accumulated in leaves exposed
   at a lower temperature.  This may explain the high sensitivity of plants
   exposed to SO2 under winter conditions, when both VPD and temperature
   are low.}},

   uncharged molecules from the boundary layer in front of the membrane by
   charged ions, which accumulate at the membrane surface due to their
   strong forces of interaction.  In addition, deposited layers of protein
   from milk, starch and gelatine reduce the rate of permeation both of
   lactose and of salt ions.  This is thought to be due to the compression
   of the region of the deposited layer adjacent to the membrane into a
   secondary membrane with solution diffusion properties.}},

Abstract = {{In April 1986, the infauna at 45 offshore stations was sampled in the
   central North Sea and along a transect into the German Bight using a
   Reineck box sampler and a van Veen grab. At 19 of these stations, the
   epifauna was collected in a dredge. A total of 380 species were
   identified, 311 species in grab samples and 142 species in dredge
   samples. Four infaunal and two epifaunal assemblages were separated
   using cluster analysis. The depth borders for seperating the infauna and
   epifauna assemblages in the central and the southern North Sea were set
   at the 50 m and 60 m isobaths, respectively. The infauna assemblages
   were further structured by the sediment. A gradient in species
   composition from west to east in the central North Sea was observed
   among both the infauna and epifauna. In the central North Sea, the mean
   biomass was lower (2-7 g AFDW m-2) than in the southern North Sea (5-11
   g AFDW m-2). The mean densities were also lower (400-1200 ind. m-2
   compared to 1400-2800 ind. m-2), but the mean number of species at each
   station was about the same (35-61 compared to 37-54). It was shown that
   the infaunal assemblages in the central North Sea seem similar to those
   in the northern North Sea.}},

   further examined in terms of the liquid velocity distribution in the

Abstract = {{A time-dependent simulation model of reactive sputtering is proposed. 
   The model deals with time-dependent poisoning of the target surface and
   hysteresis phenomena.  The model is based on the calculation of the
   time-dependent change in gettering pumping speed and target poisoning
   speed, yielding the time-dependent change in target coverage and
   reactive gas partial pressure.  By calculating the equilibrium values of
   the time-dependent change over a range of reactive gas flow rates,
   hysteresis effects of target coverage and reactive gas partial pressure
   are investigated as a function of the gas flow rate.  The hysteresis
   results obtained suggest that with the time-dependent model it is
   possible to evaluate the effect of pumping speed on the transition
   points and width of hysteresis curves.  As compared with experimentally
   investigated results it is found that the model explains mechanisms of
   reactive sputtering qualitively.}},

Abstract = {{Levels of exposure to radiation were recorded at sixty sites in fifteen
   patients during intramedullary interlocking femoral nailing.  Radiation
   film dosimeters were placed at four gonadal sites on each subject.  A
   standard male-gonad cup or a pelvic drape of 0.5-millimeter-thick
   lead-equivalent was put in place to shield the gonads.  A second set of
   four dosimeters was placed external to the shield to approximate
   unprotected exposure.  The total duration of the fluoroscopy averaged
   five minutes (range, thirty seconds to fourteen minutes).  The total
   exposure to radiation external to the shield was 35 +/- 34 millirems at
   the male gonadal sites and 17 +/- 11 millirems at the female gonadal
   sites.  With use of the gonadal shield, exposure to radiation was not
   measurable in thirteen of the fifteen patients.  The differences between
   the exposures of the shielded and unshielded sites to radiation were
   statistically significant (p < 0.001).  The highest level of gonadal
   exposure was found with the treatment of proximal femoral fractures and
   with the use of statically locked nails.  Regardless of the conditions,
   and for all types of fractures and locations, our results demonstrated
   that gonadal shielding is justified.}},

Abstract = {{Among the first measurements made from near-Earth orbiting satellites
   were measurements of the magnetic field.  The sources of that field lie
   both within the Earth, in its core and crust, and in the surrounding
   ionosphere and magnetosphere.  This article summarizes some of the
   methodology and results for studies of the Earth's mantle and crust. 
   Mantle conductivity studies can be made either by studying signals
   impressed on the Earth from outside, e.g., the ionosphere or
   magnetosphere, or by studying signals originating in the core and
   transmitted through the mantle.  Crustal field studies begin with a
   careful selection of the data and subsequent removal of core and
   external fields by some sort of filtering.  Average maps from different
   local times sometimes differ, presumably due to the remaining presence
   of fields of external origin.  Several techniques for further filtering
   are discussed.  Where large-area aeromagnetic maps are available,
   crustal maps derived from satellite data can be compared with upward
   continued data.  In general, the comparisons show agreement, with some
   differences, particularly in and near the auroral belts.  The satellite
   data are further reduced by various methods of inverse and forward
   modelling, sometimes including reduction to the pole (RTP).  These
   techniques are generally unstable at the equator.  Common methods of
   stabilizing the inversions include principle components analysis and
   ridge regression.  Because of the presence of the core field, the entire
   crustal contribution from the field is not known.  Also, there is a
   basic nonuniqueness to the inverse solutions.  Nevertheless,
   magnetizations that are interpretable can be derived.}},

Abstract = {{Unintentional injuries at school have been identified as a significant
   public health problem.  A major barrier to the development of injury
   prevention policy has been the absence of national data on the
   circumstances of injuries to students which occur at school.  This study
   sought to determine the incidence, nature, and circumstances of injuries
   which resulted in death or hospitalization.  Fatalities were identified
   from national mortality data for 1977-86 inclusive.  Coroners' files
   were then examined to obtain details of the circumstances of injury. 
   Hospitalization cases were identified from the national hospital
   discharge summary for 1986.
   Fifteen fatalities were identified.  The circumstances of the deaths
   were diverse with the most frequent event being a fall (n = 4).  A total
   of 1013 first admissions to hospital were identified, giving an overall
   incidence rate of 152/100 000 students/year.  Injury rates declined with
   increasing age, and males had higher rates than females for all ages. 
   Fractures of the upper and lower limbs and intracranial injury
   represented more than three-quarters of all injury.  The two leading
   causes of injury, falls, and incidents involving striking against or
   being struck by a person or object, represented 89\% of all incidents. 
   The use of playground equipment and involvement in sporting activity
   were two of the more common aspects of many injury events.
   The results suggest that prevention policy should place emphasis on
   those in their first 2 years of schooling, falls from playground
   equipment, provision of protective equipment for sporting activities,
   sporting activities designed to minimize physical contact, establishment
   of standardized injury referral procedures, first-aid training, and a
   standardized injury reporting system.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of budesonide, terfenadine and a combination of budesonide
   and oxymetazoline in the treatment of perennial rhinitis was evaluated
   by a double blind, parallel group study.  Adult patients with perennial
   rhinitis were randomized into three groups.  Group 1 patients received
   budesonide nasal aerosol 400 mu-g/day for 21 days and oxymetazoline
   nasal drops for the first three days.  Group 2 and 3 patients received
   budesonide 400-mu-g/day and terfenadne tablet 60 mg twice/day
   respectively.  Nasal symptoms were assessed by the patients before and
   daily during the treatment period using a simple scoring system.  One
   hundred and forty-two patients were recruited and 130 completed the
   study.  Budesonide, but not terfenadine, significantly reduced all nasal
   symptoms from baseline (p < 0.05).  Terfenadine could significantly
   relieve the nasal blockage (p < 0.05) more than other nasal symptoms. 
   Budesonide with or without oxymetazoline nasal drops provided a better
   control of nasal symptoms than terfenadine (p < 0.05).  Budesonide with
   oxymetazoline for the first three days showed a faster relief of nasal
   blockage than budesonide alone (p < 0.05).  Mild and transient adverse
   effects were encountered in all three groups.  It is concluded that
   nasal symptoms of perennial rhinitis are more adequately controlled by
   budesonide than by terfenadine.}},

Abstract = {{The study was carried out in northern Kenya in 1984-87.  Forestomach
   volumes and digesta retention times were measured using Cr-EDTA or
   Co-EDTA as fluid markers and Ce-labelled particles or Cr-mordanted
   particles as particulate phase markers.
   Mean retention times of fluid and of particles were longer in the dry
   season than in the green season in all four animal species.  The
   increase of particle mean retention time, as a percentage of the values
   in the green season, was highest in sheep (46\%), followed by cattle
   (27\%), goats (22\%) and camels (18\%).  Forestomach volumes were also
   greater in the dry than in the green season; the increase was again
   highest in sheep (55\%), followed by cattle (31\%), goats (29\%) and
   camels (28\%).  Outflow rates of fluid from the forestomach and the
   selectivity factor, by which small particles were retained longer in the
   forestomach than fluid, did not differ significantly between the
   seasons.
   It is suggested that the increase of forestomach volumes is an effective
   adaptation to dry-season pasture conditions.  It enables the animals to
   retain feed particles longer in the forestomach and so improve fibre
   digestion when feed quality is low.  Cattle and sheep, which depend on a
   poor quality diet, improve fibre digestion in this way in the dry season
   more effectively than camels and goats.  Camels and goats, on the other
   hand, were able to select a diet of such quality, even in the dry
   season, that their need to augment fibre digestion was reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Low dose 5-azacytidine was administered to 11 patients with acute

   inducing differentiation of leukemic blasts.  The patient population
   included both patients who had received no prior therapy (two patients),
   as well as patients refractory to primary therapy (five patients) and
   patients who had relapsed after achieving complete remission (four
   patients).  Both previously untreated patients had a history of
   myelodysplastic syndrome, and two of the primarily refractory patients
   had leukemia following chemotherapy for other malignancies.  The median
   age was 55 years (range 36-78 years).  Twenty-one courses of
   5-azacytidine were administered as 7-day continuous infusions at a dose
   of 75 mg/m2/day.  Significant nonhematologic toxicity was not observed. 
   No patient had a response as defined by bone marrow remission or
   improvement in transfusion requirement for red blood cells or platelets.
   Although some patients developed bone marrow hypocellularity (six
   courses in five patients), none became aplastic, and eight courses in
   six patients were associated with increased bone marrow cellularity
   percentage of blasts.  Five courses in three patients were inevaluable
   (one central nervous system hemorrhage, one central nervous system
   leukemia, three courses in one patient who refused bone marrow
   aspiration).  It is unlikely that low dose 5-azacytidine will be of
   benefit to patients with AML, and there was no evidence of clinically

Abstract = {{We tested the involvement of ethylene in maize (Zea mays L.) root
   gravitropism by measuring the kinetics of curvature and lateral auxin
   movement in roots treated with ethylene, inhibitors of ethylene
   synthesis, or inhibitors of ethylene action.  In the presence of
   ethylene the latent period of gravitropic curvature appeared to be
   increased somewhat.  However, ethylene-treated roots continued to curve
   after control roots had reached their final angle of curvature.
   Consequently, maximum curvature in the presence of ethylene was much
   greater in ethylne-treated roots than in controls.  Inhibitors of
   ethylene biosynthesis or action had effects on the kinetics of curvature
   opposite to that of ethylene, i.e. the latent period appeared to be
   shortened somewhat while total curvature was reduced relative to that of
   controls.  Label from applied H-3-indole-3-acetic acid was
   preferentially transported toward the lower side of stimulated roots. In
   parallel with effects on curvature, ethylene treatment delayed the
   development of gravity-induced asymmetric auxin movement across the root
   but extended its duration once initiated.  The auxin transport
   inhibitor, 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid reduced both gravitropic
   curvature and the effect of ethylene on curvature.  Since neither
   ethylene nor inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis or action prevented
   curvature, we conclude that ethylene does not mediate the primary
   differential growth response causing curvature.  Because ethylene
   affects curvature and auxin transport in parallel, we suggest that
   ethylene modifies curvature by affecting gravity-induced lateral
   transport of auxin, perhaps by interfering with adaptation of the auxin
   transport system to the gravistimulus.}},

Abstract = {{Forestry problems are frequently represented by a system of equations
   rather than a single equation.  Many authors have used the two- and
   three-stage least squares (2SLS and 3SLS) and seemingly unrelated
   regressions techniques of econometrics to estimate the coefficients of
   these forestry systems.  The assumption in using these techniques is
   that the error terms of individual equations are independent and
   identically distributed (iid), even though the equations may be
   contemporaneously correlated.  For forestry systems, this assumption is
   frequently not met.  The results are that the estimated variances of the
   coefficients are statistically biased and not consistent, and confidence
   intervals for the estimated coefficients and mean predicted values are
   inaccurate.  The multistage least squares (MSLS) technique presented in
   this paper relaxes this iid assumption by extending 3SLS to a more
   generalized error structure.  MSLS is a linear least squares technique
   that will result in consistent estimates of the coefficients and their
   associated variances.  The error covariance matrix of the system of
   equations is estimated as the product of transformation matrices for
   each equation and an estimate of the contemporaneous covariance matrix
   of the system.  The estimated coefficients will be asymptotically
   normally distributed.  The limitations to the MSLS technique are that
   equations of the system must be linear and sample sizes must be equal
   for all equations.  In addition, large sizes are required to calculate
   confidence intervals and to test hypothesis statements.  The MSLS
   technique is demonstrated using a tree volume estimation example.}},

Abstract = {{Cermet coatings containing TiB2 crystals dispersed in an iron-based
   matrix have been obtained by the plasma spray synthesis process
   developed at the Industrial Materials Research Institute.  The main
   feature of this technique is the combination in a one-step operation of
   both the synthesis and the deposition process.  The resultant coatings
   are thick and possess a good abrasion resistance.
   In order to elucidate the fine microstructure of these TiB2-Fe coatings
   obtained through a rapid solidification process and to understand their
   good abrasion-wear behavior, a transmission electron microscopy study
   has been undertaken.
   Energy-dispersive spectroscopy using an ultrathin window detector and
   electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) techniques, both allowing the
   detection of relatively light elements, were used.  For the range of
   compositions investigated, EELS was more sensitive for the localization
   of boron and offered a better spatial resolution.
   The results have shown that coatings obtained by the plasma spray
   synthesis process contain TiB2 particles ranging from 10 to 700 nm in
   size dispersed in a matrix of iron and FeTi.  The unusual microstructure
   of these coatings is probably responsible for their good wear
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{From 1978 until 1988, 63 consecutive patients with squamous cell
   carcinoma of the nasal vestibule were treated by radiation therapy. Mean
   follow-up time was 46 months.  Thirty-five patients were classified as
   having T1N0 tumors, 24 as T2N0; four patients were staged as T1/2N+.
   Treatment of the primary consisted of external radiation (n = 17),
   interstitial radiation (n = 37), or external radiation combined with
   interstitial radiation (n = 9).  With respect to the N0 patients, local
   relapse was found in 3\% (1/35) of T1 tumors and in 21\% (5/24) of T2
   tumors.  Three out of six failures were salvaged by surgery.  Elective
   irradiation of both sides of the neck (40 Gy) was performed in 9T1 and
   in 16 T2 patients.  Two regional failures occurred in the electively
   irradiated necks, two in the non-irradiated necks.  Regarding the T1/2N+
   patients, three relapsed locally and/or regionally, and one remains NED.
   For all 63 patients, a 5-year corrected survival of 90\%, a relapse-free
   survival of 80\%, and an overall survival of 65\% were observed.  In
   summary, for optimal local control and cosmesis we feel that for T1,2 N0
   tumor stages a dose of 60 Gy for T1 and 70 Gy for T2 tumors is adequate
   treatment.  The primary tumor is irradiated preferentially in our view,
   by means of interstitial techniques; furthermore, our data do not
   support the use of elective neck RT.  Although patients rarely present
   the lymph node metastasis (6\%), the prognosis of T1,2 N+ patients
   remains grim and more aggressive (surgical) treatment might be needed
   for this category.}},

Abstract = {{Guanfacine, an alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist, was compared with prazosin
   hydrochloride for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate
   essential hypertension in an 8-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel
   evaluation to determine efficacy and safety.  The study consisted of a
   2-week screening/weaning period (phase I), a 3-week treatment period
   with chlorthalidone 25 mg every morning (phase II), and an 8-week
   double-blind treatment period with diuretic plus prazosin or guanfacine
   (phase III).  Those who had an average seated diastolic blood pressure
   (BP) of 95 to 114 mm Hg at the end of the phase II period were eligible
   to enter the phase III period and were randomly assigned to
   chlorthalidone plus either guanfacine, 1 mg every night, or prazosin, 1
   mg three times a day.  Of the 102 patients who were randomly assigned to
   guanfacine or prazosin, 80\% completed the entire study.
   Guanfacine and prazosin appeared to be equally effective and reduced
   seated as well as standing diastolic and systolic BP.  The mean seated
   systolic and diastolic BP were reduced 11/9 mm Hg by guanfacine and
   11/10 mm Hg by prazosin.  The mean reduction is seated pulse was 3
   beats/minute for guanfacine and no change with prazosin.  Similar
   changes occurred in the standing position.  Very few adverse effects
   were reported during the study.  Adverse effects with an incidence of
   5\% or greater for either drugs group were dizziness (6\% guanfacine,
   8\% prazosin), xerostomia (6\% guanfacine, 2\% prazosin), and somnolence
   (0\% guanfacine, 6\% prazosin).  Three patients (6\%) in the prazosin
   group experienced symptoms of orthostasis requiring premature
   discontinuation of the drug and termination from the study.}},

Abstract = {{Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia which is
   particularly prevalent among the elderly. In patients with AF of recent
   onset, restoration of sinus rhythm may be feasible and this can be
   achieved by DC cardioversion, or by the use of one of a number of drugs
   including amiodarone, flecainide or propafenone. Neither digoxin nor the
   calcium antagonists facilitate the restoration of sinus rhythm.
   Recurrence of AF is common after successful cardioversion and, although
   long term antiarrhythmic drug therapy may help to maintain sinus rhythm,
   all such drugs are potentially toxic and can have important
   proarrhythmic actions. In patients with chronic AF, restoration of sinus
   rhythm is rarely possible and treatment is directed towards control of

   a rate-limiting calcium antagonist such as verapamil or diltiazem;
   beta-blockers may also be used although they appear to impair effort

   reduce the risks of systemic embolisation, even in patients with

   context. A minority of patients present with AF associated with

Abstract = {{Chloride ion diffusion in porous concrete is one of the two major
   factors that cause corrosion to the reinforcing steel bars.  A physical
   model is given in the present paper for describing the chloride
   diffusion process.  The diffusion model is distinctly characterized by
   the time-dependent diffusion coefficient and surface concentration,
   which are not usually found in an ordinary diffusion process.  The
   physical model is amenable to an analytic solution and verified by
   comparing the theoretical predictions with the experimental data. 
   Potential applications of the diffusion model to predict the exposure
   time when the chloride concentration reaches the corrosion threshold of
   the reinforcing steel bars are illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{Abnormalities in the fast Fourier transforms of signal-averaged
   electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained during sinus rhythm appear to
   distinguish patients with ischemic heart disease and sustained
   monomorphic ventricular tachycardia from those without ventricular
   tachycardia.  This study was performed to determine the power of
   frequency analysis to detect patients with a history of ventricular
   fibrillation, to determine the extent to which spectra of
   signal-averaged ECGs from patients with ischemic and nonischemic heart
   disease are comparable and to compare results of signal-averaged ECG
   analysis in patients with ventricular fibrillation with results of
   programmed ventricular stimulation.
   Signal-averaged ECGs were obtained during sinus rhythm from 60 patients
   sustained ventricular tachycardia (Group I) and 34 patients with
   ventricular fibrillation (Group II).  Results of signal-averaged ECG
   analysis were abnormal in 92\% of patients with ventricular tachycardia
   and 85\% of patients with ventricular fibrillation (p = NS).  Abnormal
   spectra were detected in the signal-averaged ECGs from 90\% of patients
   with ischemic and from 86\% of patients with nonischemic heart disease
   (p = NS).
   In contrast, the results of programmed stimulation differed markedly
   between the two patient groups.  Sustained ventricular arrhythmias were
   induced in 91\% of the patients with ventricular tachycardia compared
   with only 46\% of those with ventricular fibrillation (p < 0.001).
   Moreover, ventricular tachycardia was inducible in 81\% of patients with
   ischemic heart disease compared with only 50\% of those with nonischemic
   heart disease (p < 0.02).  Thus, abnormalities in the spectra of
   signal-averaged ECGs were found in the majority of patients with
   ventricula r fibrillation and were detectable even in those whose
   arrhythmia was not i nducible by programmed stimulation.  These results
   broaden the potential clinical application of noninvasive interrogation
   of signal-averaged ECGs t o include the prospective identification of
   patients with ischemic or nonis chemic heart disease prone to
   ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibril lation.}},

Abstract = {{Intense and persistent use of DDT for malaria control has increased
   resistance and induced exophilic behavior of Anopheles
   pseudopunctipennis.  An evaluation of bendiocarb and DDT to control this
   species in Sinaloa, Mexico, showed that, in spite of DDT-resistance,
   both insecticides produced similar effects.  Feeding patterns were
   analyzed to explain these results.  Resting mosquitoes were collected
   over the dry and wet seasons.  Anophelines were tested in an ELISA to
   determine the source of the meals.  The human blood index (HBI) ranged
   from 3.3 to 6.8\% in DDT-and from 12.7 to 26.9\% in bendiocarb-sprayed
   houses.  Irritability and repellency in DDT-sprayed houses could explain
   the reduced HBI.  In contrast, bendiocarb produced higher mortality. 
   These effects could have affected different components of the vectorial
   capacity and similarly reduced malaria.}},

Abstract = {{Topological developmental models with local (position of internodes) and
   global (branch lengths) characteristics are proposed to investigate the
   relationships between fundamental branching patterns of plants such as
   acrotony, mesotony, and basitony, including the coincidence of different
   patterns on the same plant.  Modification of the basic acrotony during
   the development by means of, (1) the final expected main axis length
   results in either basitony or an extension of acrotony over a shortened
   main axis, (2) the final expected lateral branch length yields either
   lateral unlimited sympodial branching or the absence of proximal
   branches.  Combinations of these schemes can have variable quantitative
   expressions on main and lateral axes.
   As applications, progressive morphological changes introduced by
   monotonic variations of parameter values give an insight into the
   relationships between determinate and indeterminate growth, using
   Lycopersicon as an example.  - A theoretical framework is proposed as a
   possible aid for formalizing plant typology.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1990}},
Volume = {{117}},

Abstract = {{The effects of competition from volunteer barley (Hordeum vulgare) on
   the growth and yield of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) were investigated
   in four experiments over three seasons.  The growth of rape in the
   autumn was reduced by 50-91\% by competition from 400 barley plants m-2.
   A lower barley density of 200 plants m-2 had less effect but still
   reduced growth of rape by 65-81\% in two of the experiments and 25-40\%
   in the other two.  During winter and spring the barley decreased in
   vigour and in the spring the rape started to recover, especially on the
   early drilled (23-30 August) plots.  The rape sown in mid-September
   recovered less quickly.  In Experiment 3, herbicides applied in November
   to control barley did not result in increased growth of rape in winter
   but led to greater recovery in spring.  The barley died during the
   winter in Experiments 2 and 4, even in the absence of herbicides. 
   Despite the marked effects of barley on the growth of rape in the
   autumn, yields on plots that had previously contained 200 barley plants
   m-2 were reduced by a maximum of only 16\% in three of the experiments. 
   In Experiment 3, where the barley was most competitive, this density and
   400 plants m-2 lowered yields by 39\% and 78\%, respectively.  Where a
   herbicide was used in November to control the barley these yield losses
   were reduced to 5\%.  In many rape crops the cost of herbicide treatment
   would be greater than the financial returns from the expected increase
   in yield resulting from the control of weeds.  Possible reasons for the
   small loss in yield of rape from barley densities that had substantial
   effects on the growth of rape in the autumn are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The ischemic damage following liver transplantation (LTX) is
   predominantly located at the endothelial cell level and is a major cause
   for a disturbance of microcirculation.  The present study was designed
   to test the hypothesis that changes in the quality of organ preservation
   are correlated with changes in microcirculation:  16 pigs underwent LTX,
   preservation by Bretschneider's HTK-solution (Histidin, Tryptophan,
   alpha-Ketoglutarat) complemented by indomethacin (50 mu-mol/L).  Cold
   ischemia times were 9 hr (n = 8) and 18 hr (n = 8), respectively.  Using
   the H2-clearance technique, hepatic microcirculation was measured
   before, 30 min, and 20 hr after LTX.  Normal tissue perfusion was 107
   +/- 16 ml/100 g/min, at 30 min posttransplantation 91 +/- 13 ml/100
   g/min in the short-term and 48 +/- 7 ml/100 g/min in the long-term
   preservation group.  Whereas no animal of the long-term preservation
   group survived longer than 8 hr, all animals of the short-term
   preservation group survived, and tissue perfusion could be measured 20
   hr postoperatively (101 +/- 19 ml/100 g/min).  At 30 min
   postoperatively, all surviving animals had tissue perfusion rates grater
   than 70, and all nonsurvivors had values below 60 ml/100 g/min.  We
   conclude therefore that the extent of decrease of microcirculation after
   LTX may be a useful predictor of organ function and survival.}},

Abstract = {{In human keratinocytes cultured in conditions which allow
   differentiation and stratification and which are suitable to
   reconstitute a fully functional epidermis, the integrin alpha-6-beta-4
   and two members of the beta-1 integrin family (alpha-2-beta-1 and
   alpha-3-beta-1) were polarized to the basal and lateral domains of the
   plasma membrane both in growing colonies and in the reconstituted
   epidermis. Conversely, alpha-V-beta-5 integrin was expressed at the
   basal surface in growing and migrating but not in stationary
   keratinocytes. The integrin alpha-6-beta-4 was organized in patches and
   spots corresponding to F-actin-free submembraneous areas and did not
   colocalize to focal contacts; moreover, alpha-6-beta-4 colocalized with
   patches of laminin deposited underneath the ventral membrane of
   individual cells. The two beta-1 laminin receptor integrins
   (alpha-2-beta-1 and alpha-3-beta-1) were never found in the basal domain
   but matched the lateral position of vinculin (but not talin), cingulin
   and desmoplakins. Only the integrin complex alpha-V-beta-5 was
   associated with talin- and vinculin-containing focal adhesions mostly in
   the peripheral cells of expanding keratinocyte colonies and in
   coincidence with fibronectin strands. The topography of beta-1 and
   beta-4 integrins reflects a functional role in adhesion and in the
   maintenance of the state of aggregation of cultured keratinocytes since
   lateral aggregation was impaired by antibodies to beta-1 whereas
   antibodies to beta-4 prevented cell-matrix adhesion.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed gravity data, collected along an east-west transect across the
   northern New Quebec Orogen near Leaf Bay, provide constraints on the
   deep structure of this segment of the orogen.  The Bouguer anomaly
   profile contains long and short wavelength components.  A steep gravity
   gradient and a strong positive anomaly near the centre of the orogen are
   related to the presence of dense mafic volcanic rocks in the shallow
   crust.  Two alternative models are presented that are compatible with
   the long wavelength gravity data.  The authors prefer to interpret the
   long wavelength components in terms of crustal thickening beneath the
   orogen and increased crustal density in the Rae Province, to the east. 
   A scenario based on this crustal density structure is suggested for the
   evolution of the orogen.  It calls for (1) the formation of a small
   ocean separating the Superior and Rae provinces; (2) subduction of this
   ocean beneath the Rae Province; and (3) complete closure of the basin
   with overthrusting of the Superior margin and, possibly, obduction of
   the Rae Province onto the Superior Province craton.}},

Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{1.  Single cone photoreceptors were dissociated from the retina of a
   lizard with the aid of papain.  The majority of the cells lost their
   outer segments but had well-preserved, large synaptic pedicles.
   Electrical properties of the cells were studied with tight-seal
   electrodes in the whole cell configuration.  On the average, cone inner
   segments had a resting potential of -55 mV, and at this potential their
   input resistance was 2.6 G-OMEGA and their capacitance was 8 pF.
   2.  Under current clamp the cones exhibited a pronounced anomalous
   voltage rectifaction in response to hyperpolarizing currents.  The
   voltage rectification was eliminated by external Cs+.  3. The
   Cs+-sensitive current underlying present voltage rectification was
   isolated by blocking other currents present in the cone.  Co2+ blocked a
   voltage-dependent Ca2+ current and a Ca2+-dependent Cl- current, and
   tetraethylammonium (TEA)+ blocked  delayed-rectifier K+ current.
   4.  The Cs+-sensitive current was activated by hyperpolarization to
   potentials more negative than -50 mV, and its current-voltage (I-V)
   relationship exhibited inward rectification.
   5.  The inward-rectifying current was selective for K+, but not
   exclusively.  Increasing external K+ concentration 10-fold shifted the
   reversal potential by 13 mV.  If Na ions also permeate through the
   inward-rectifying channels, the ratio of permeabilities (P(K)+/P(Na)+)
   in normal solution is approximately 3.9.
   6.  The kinetics of the inward-rectifying current were described by the
   sum of two exponentials, the amplitudes and time constants of which were
   voltage dependent.
   7.  The voltage dependence of the inward-rectifying current was
   described by Boltzmann's function, with half-maximum activation at -79
   mV and a steepness parameter of 7.5 mV.
   8.  The voltage dependence and kinetics of the inward-rectifying current
   suggest that it is inactive in a cone photoreceptor in the dark. 
   However, it becomes activated in the course of large hyperpolarizations
   generated by bright-light illumination.  This activity will modify the
   waveform of the photovoltage-the current will generate a depolarizing
   component that opposes the light-generated hyperpolarization.}},

Abstract = {{Three major forms of 2',5' oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase are induced

   studied the binding and activation of the 69- and 100-kD forms to
   single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds) RNAs. The 69- and 100-kD
   form enzymes purified by immunoaffinity chromatography, were shown to be
   activated by synthetic dsRNAs poly(I) poly(C) or poly(A) poly(U) whereas
   ssRNAs poly(I), poly(C), poly(A), poly(U), and poly(G) had no effect.
   Both enzymes were also partially purified by binding to dsRNA or
   ssRNA-Sepharose. The synthetases bound to dsRNA Sepharose were partially
   activated but required the addition of soluble poly(I) poly(C) for
   maximal activity. The synthetases bound to ssRNA-Sepharose manifested no
   activity but became activated in the presence of soluble dsRNA, poly(I)
   poly(C). However, activation of such ssRNA-bound enzymes by dsRNA did
   not result in their dissociation from the ssRNA-Sepharose. These results
   indicate the presence of different polynucleotide binding sites on the
   69- and 100-kD forms of 2-5A synthetase: a specific dsRNA binding site
   essential for activation and another polynucleotide binding site or
   sites which, although not specific, might be important for the optimal

Abstract = {{There is substantial evidence for increased sympathetic nerve activity
   in young, mildly hypertensive humans.  This evidence has been derived
   mainly from measurement of plasma catecholamines and from responses to
   adrenergic antagonists and agonists in normotensive and mildly
   hypertensive subjects.  In addition, in recent studies direct
   measurements of sympathetic nerve activity to the muscle circulation
   have been obtained by microneurography.  These data also indicate that
   sympathetic nerve activity is increased in young, mildly hypertensive
   humans.  The present paper reviews this work with microneurographic
   measurements and highlights several concepts.  (1) The increases in
   sympathetic nerve activity to the muscle in mild  hypertension are not a
   result of impairment in the inhibitory influence of arterial
   baroreceptors; presumably, they reflect a heightened central nervous
   system sympathetic drive. (2) In the supine position the inhibitory
   influence of cardiopulmonary baroreceptors on sympathetic nerve activity
   is increased in mild hypertension.  This increase in cardiopulmonary
   baroreflex control buffers the heightened sympathetic neural drive in
   mildly hypertensive subjects in the supine position, but withdrawal of
   this increase during orthostatic stress produces exaggerated reflex
   sympathetic vasoconstrictor responses to orthostasis in mildly
   hypertensive subjects. (3) Arterial chemoreceptor reflexes are increased
   in mildly hypertensive subjects and lead to exaggerated increases in
   sympathetic nerve activity during hypoxia.  (4) There is increasing
   evidence that two humoral agents, epinephrine and insulin, exert
   excitatory effects on sympathetic neural outflow, which may contribute
   to the increased sympathetic activity and arterial pressure in human
   hypertension. (5) The postexercise decreases in blood pressure that
   occur in many subjects with mild hypertension are associated with a
   decrease in sympathetic neural discharge to muscle, suggesting that the
   postexercise decrease in blood pressure may be mediated in part by
   inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity.}},

Abstract = {{The tribology knowledge reported in this paper was obtained during the
   construction of a sample manipulator for the Textor tokamak and during
   tests made in relation with the development of a drive mechanism for the
   ALT II limiter.  After some year of operation, the combination
   steel-bronze coated with MoS2 dry lubrication has proven to be very
   reliable.  The plasma induced chemical vapour deposition of thin films
   on MoS2 may increase drastically the friction coefficient and lead to
   seizure effects.  Nevertheless, for typical films as used in today's
   tokamaks ( < 100 nm) only a small increase of the friction coefficient
   could be detected.
   The paper deals with two specific applications for the tokamak TEXTOR;
   it should however be noted, that severe tribology problems occur
   generally when movable parts are used in plasma devices for diagnostic
   or other purposes.}},

Abstract = {{The activity of oxygen evolution in OE PS II particles of spinach and
   the role of the peripheral polypeptides in this process were
   investigated. Washing of the complex with 1 M NaCl removed the 25 and 16
   kD proteins, leaving the initial release of O2 under constant
   illumination unchanged; it slightly inhibits the amplitude of O2
   evolution to a light flash and keeps the induction picture of delayed
   millisecond fluorescence unchanged. Treatment with a mixture of 2.6 M
   urea and 200 mM NaCl leads to splitting off of three peptides (16, 25,
   33 kD) and changes the shape of the induction curves of O2 evolution
   (under constant illumination), completely inhibits the release of oxygen
   in response to a flash and eliminates the rapid component of delayed
   fluorescence. It is concluded that the 33 kD protein is essential for
   the reduction of P680+, maintaining the donor side in the S3Z state.
   Washing it slows down the process of oxidation of water in the S2Z
   state.}},

Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Generally, conduction of the forces from the distal end of the
   prosthesis stem into the surrounding cortical bone effects a local load
   increase in the bone.  Where bone and stem are in close contact >>
   stress protection << is hardly avoidable, and this, together with the
   load increase, results in the formation of a >> plug of bone << beneath
   the tip of the prosthesis.  Since the prosthesis stem rests on this bone
   >> plug <<, additional >> stress protection << of the femur results,
   which may possibly lead to total failure of the femur and/or the
   prosthesis.
   A 3-dimensional FEM-analysis shows that the hollow-stem prosthesis helps
   to decrease the stress peak beneath the tip of the prosthesis, while at
   the same time the stress in the proximal cortical bone increases.  The
   increase in the loading of the bone inevitably causes a reduction in
   bone breakdown through >> stress shielding << in this region.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of prolonged substitution of readily digested carbohydrates
   (wheat starch) for poorly digested carbohydrates (mixture of various

   hormones were investigated in Zucker, genetically obese rats. Lean rats
   were also studied in parallel. Usually, plasma lipid and insulin levels
   and insulin/glucose ratio were higher in obese rats vs. their lean
   littermates. High-fibre diet intake led to weight loss in both obese and
   lean rats. With a highfibre diet, plasma lipid, insulin and glucose
   postprandial levels in both groups were reduced when compared with their
   respective control animals. Dietary fibre modified the lipoprotein
   profile. Triglycerides and cholesterol were reduced in all studied
   lipoprotein fractions. The study of high density lipoprotein (HDL)
   fraction in rats fed a high-fibre diet demonstrated a decrease in the
   HDL1 subpopulation and in the apolipoprotein (apo)E proportion. The
   findings show that a high-fibre diet modulates plasma lipid, insulin and

Abstract = {{The influence of water stress at two soil temperatures on allocation of
   net photoassimilated carbon in soybean (Glycine max {[}L.] Merr.) was
   investigated using compartmental analysis.  The experimental phase
   employed classical C-14 labeling methodology with plants equilibrated at
   soil water potentials of -0.04, -0.25 and -0.50 MPa; and soil
   temperatures of 25 and 10 C.  Compartmental analysis followed that of
   McCoy et al. (1989).  Carbon immobilization in the shoot apex generally
   followed leaf elongation rates with decreases in both parameters at
   increasing water stress at both soil temperature.  However, where
   moderate water stress resulted in dramatic declines in leaf elongation
   rates, carbon immobilization rates were sharply decreased only at severe
   water stress levels.  Carbon immobilization was decreased in the roots
   and nodules of the nonwater stressed treatment by the lower soil
   temperature.  This relation was reversed with severe water stress, and
   carbon immobilization in the roots and nodules was increased at the
   lower soil temperature.  Apparently, the increased demand for growth
   and/or carbon storage in these tissues with increased water stress
   overcame the low soil temperature limitations.  Both carbon pool sizes
   and the partitioning of carbon to the sink tissues increased with
   moderate water stress at 25 C soil temperature.  Increased pool sizes
   were consistent with whole plant osmotic adjustment at moderate water
   stress.  Increased partitioning to the sinks was consistent with carbon
   translocation processes being less severely influenced by water stress
   than is photosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation of the biochemical effects of an anthelmintic,
   tioxidazole (TIOX, methyl 6-{[}n-propoxy]benzothiazole-2-carbamate), on
   Hymenolepis diminuta in experimentally infected rats is reported.  The
   chemotherapeutic actions of TIOX on H. diminuta in vivo were accompanied
   by marked changes in worm weight and chemical composition.  Tapeworms
   recovered from rats that had received a therapeutically effective dose
   of TIOX 24 hr earlier were significantly smaller and contained much less
   glycogen (as a percentage of the wet weight) than worms from untreated
   controls.  In TIOX-treated worms, protein concentrations rose at a rate
   sufficient to offset the decline in glycogen concentration. 
   Glycogen/protein ratios in TIOX-treated worms were considerably lower
   than the corresponding control values.  Differences in the absolute
   amounts of glycogen and protein between control and drug-treated worms
   were even more pronounced.  Administration of a subcurative dose of TIOX
   to the rat produced in H. diminuta another change, the onset of which
   preceded the gross alterations in worm weight and chemical composition. 
   In vitro studies, carried out 18 hr after treatment, revealed that
   TIOX-treated worms absorbed and metabolized much smaller quantities of
   exogenous glucose than did the controls and the ability of the worm to
   accumulate glucose against a concentration difference was significantly
   depressed.  A mode of action common to the structurally related
   benzothiazole and benzimidazole anthelmintics is indicated by the
   similarity of their biochemical and physiological effects on the
   tapeworms and their time course of action when administered to rats
   infected with H. diminuta.
   Molecular modeling revealed that the benzothiazole and benzimidazole
   anthelmintics are congruent electronically and structurally.  In vivo
   drug efficacy depends upon the magnitude of the molecular dipole moment
   and the percentage of polar surface area.  Within the benzimidazole
   series, structural and electronic congruence is found between the
   2-thiazolyl and 2-methyl carbamate groups, suggesting that these groups
   behave similarly in transport to, and binding at, the active site. 
   Finally, anthelmintics that have the 5' substituents twisted
   out-of-plane were more active than those anthelmintics with 5'
   substituents in-plane.  All of these factors implicate a highly polar,
   L-shaped cleft to which the anthelmintics bind at the active site.}},

Abstract = {{In Drosophila, male and female gametes begin development when a stem
   cell divides to produce a cyst precursor.  Subsequently, four special
   divisions give rise to a cluster of 16 interconnected cystocytes that
   develop into a single egg or 64 sperm.  We identified and characterized
   a gene, bag-of-marbles (bam), that disrupts cyst formation in both
   sexes.  An apparent null mutation causes abnormal cysts to form
   containing an excess number of cells that cannot differentiate into
   gametes.  bam function resides within a simple 2.2-kb transcription unit
   encoding a single 442-amino-acid protein that shows similarity to the
   product of the ovarian tumor gene.  The specific expression of bam RNA
   within female cystoblasts suggested that it might be involved in the
   specific cell-cycle alterations that occur during cystocyte divisions.}},

Abstract = {{There has been much controversy about the relative importance of man's
   misuse of the land and of the increase in drought as determinants of the
   desertification process.  In one particular area of southwest Spain
   there is abundant historical information on changes that have occurred
   to natural vegetation during the last 500 years, the result being an
   almost complete substitution of mesic ecosystems by more arid ones.  All
   the changes detected in the ecosystems point to a clear trend towards
   desertification.  However, it is difficult to assess what was the real
   trigger for these changes since, in addition to climate changes,
   significant changes in the use of the area by man have been reported. 
   Combining the historical information with some present-day observations,
   it has been concluded that human activity could play an important role
   as trigger of the desertification the area has undergone.}},

   an easy adjustment of the limit values required by specification
   standards.  After pH adjustment with hydrochloric acid and addition of
   potassium ions and/or seed crystals, respectively, the tartaric acid is
   precipitated as potassium hydrogen tartrate in a second stage.  The
   purity of the precipitate amounts to 99\%.
   The equilibrium conditions for the copper(l) oxide precipitation were
   reached within some minutes, and those for the tartaric acid
   precipitation after 12 h.  The salinity of the waste water is reduced by

Abstract = {{Urea has become the leading form of N fertilizer worldwide. 
   Historically there has been concern about biuret formed during the
   manufacturing of urea fertilizer and the potential adverse effect of
   biuret on plant growth.  In this paper, the fate of biuret in soils and
   its phytotoxicity is reviewed.  Biuret is mineralized by many soil
   micoorganisms, but the process is much slower than for urea. 
   Excessively high biuret concentrations can damage seedlings and, like
   urea, should not be placed in close proximity to germinating seeds. 
   Crop tolerance to biuret varies according to the plant species, soil
   conditions, fertilizer placement, and method of application.  Biuret
   applied to soil or to plant foliage interferes with N metabolism and
   protein synthesis.  The current standards in the fertilizer industry
   supply adequate protection against biuret-induced damage to crops.}},

Abstract = {{Dichloroacetate (DCA) activates pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) by
   inhibiting PDH kinase.  Neutralized DCA (100 mg/kg) or saline was
   intravenously administered to 20 to 25-day-old rats (50-75 g).  Fifteen
   minutes later a mixture of {[}6-C-14]glucose and
   {[}H-3]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was administered intravenously and the
   animals were sacrificed by microwave irradiation (2450 MHz, 8.0 kW,
   0.6-0.8 sec) after 2 or 5 min.  Brain regional rates of glucose use and
   metabolite levels were determined.  DCA-treated rats had increased rates
   of glucose use in all regions studied (cortex, thalamus, striatum, and
   brain stem), with an average increase of 41\%.  Lactate levels were
   lower in all regions, by an average of 35\%.  There were no significant
   changes in levels of ATP, creatine phosphate, or glycogen in any brain
   region.  Blood levels of lactate did not differ significantly between
   the DCA- and the saline-treated groups.  Blood glucose levels were
   higher in the DCA group.  In rats sacrified by freeze-blowing, DCA
   treatment caused lower brain levels of both lactate and pyruvate.  These
   results cannot be explained by any systemic effect of DCA.  Rather, it
   appears that in the immature rat, DCA treatment results in activation of
   brain PDH, increased metabolism of brain pyruvate and lactate, and a
   resulting increase in brain glycolytic rate.}},

Abstract = {{Active optics methods are capable to generate a large variety of
   aspherical figures of particular interest in the design of cameras and
   spectrographs for astronomical instrumentation. All-reflective optics
   are required for EUV, UV, IR, and NIR observations and are generally
   prefered in the visible for large spectral coverages. The case of
   biaxial symmetry mirrors has been investigated for on-axis aberration
   correction of third order astigmatism. The new proposed solution has
   been optimized from the inextensional flexure of a tubular model linked
   at one end to a constant thickness meniscus mirror. Interferometric
   results display the diffraction limited accuracy of obtained toroid
   figures.}},

Abstract = {{Programmable logic array (PLA) is a popular structure for realizing
   arbitrary combinational networks.  Easy test generation (ETG) PLA, a
   kind of PLA design with the property of easy test generation, is a PLA
   design with added product terms and/or outputs such that tests are easy
   to generate, even no effort on test generation and fault simulation is
   necessary.  This paper attempts to further clarify the concept of ETG
   circuits and extends the concepts of pseudo-nonconcurrency and
   separation to reduce the hardware overhead, based on a unified
   single-fault model.  Experimental results show that the hardware
   overhead is generally less than 5\%, which is considered to be the
   lowest cost for testable PLA designs.}},

Abstract = {{A principal objective of the collaborative DIII-D Advanced Divertor
   Program (ADP) is to achieve density control in H-mode discharges with
   edge biasing and with continuous particle exhaust at a rate determined
   by the external fueling sources (typically 20 Torr. L/s).  The divertor
   baffle-bias ring system has been optimized for pumping speeds
   almost-equal-to 50 000 L/s with the neutrals transport code DEGAS.  With
   an entrance slot conductance of 50 000 L/s, a pumping speed of the same
   order is required to remove half of the almost-equal-to 40 Torr. L/s
   that enters the baffle chamber for typical H-mode discharges. 
   Increasing the exhaust fraction with higher pumping speed is
   self-limiting, owing to the attendant reduction of the recycling flux. 
   The effects of pumping on the plasma core, scrape-off layer (SOL), and
   divertor have been estimated with a model that self-consistently couples
   the transport in these regions.  The required almost-equal-to 50 000 L/s
   pumping speed can be achieved with either titanium getter pumps or
   cryopumps.  Evaluation of both systems has led to the conclusion that
   cryopumps will be more compatible with the environment of the DIII-D
   divertor.}},

Abstract = {{The level of intensification of Israeli inland aquaculture, together
   with the scarcity of water in the country, led to the development of new
   intensive closed cycle fish culture systems.
   The system described here includes a relatively large water reservoir
   which acts as a natural biofilter and four 500 m2 concrete ponds.  Water
   from the reservoir is pumped into the ponds and returns to the reservoir
   by gravitation.
   Fish feeds are the main source of pollution in this kind of system. 
   Accumulation of NH4+ and NO2 and oxygen depletion endanger the fish and
   therefore must be monitored constantly.  As laboratory facilities do not
   exist in most farms, an attempt was made to show that field kits, an
   oxygen meter and a thermometer can supply important data on the water
   quality of a recycled intensive fish culture system and improve their
   management.
   The compiled information was used as a data base for ecologic studies of
   this system.}},
