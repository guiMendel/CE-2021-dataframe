Abstract = {{A flow injection analysis method is described to determine fluticasone
   propionate, based upon a novel adaptation of the reaction of
   o-phthalaldehyde with a thiol and a primary amine. The method, which
   allows both UV and fluorescence detection, has been optimised using
   experimental design. First a screening is executed to select the
   significant factors acid in a second step these factors are optimised
   with the variable-size simplex algorithm. In the screening step, a
   two-level fractional factorial design is compared with an asymmetrical
   design containing the same number of experiments, but in which one
   factor is at three levels. It was found that in both designs the same
   significant variables are detected for the two-level factors, but that
   for the three-level factor the asymmetrical design confirms an
   expectation of having a (local) optimum in the examined domain, whilst
   from the two-level design this is not at all apparent. Complete
   optimisation was carried out for both UV and fluorescence detection. The
   two detection methods did not have the same significant variables. For
   the UV detection, the temperature and the pH adjustment on-line
   (concentration of sodium hydroxide and amount of boric acid) were the
   most critical parameters. For the fluorimetric detection the temperature
   and the fraction of methanol were critical. Moreover the conditions
   found to be optimal are different for both detection methods. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Mouse 6Ckine/SLC (secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine) is a chemotactic
   factor for dendritic cells, T cells, and NR cells in vitro. In addition,
   mouse 6Ckine/SLC interacts with the chemokine receptor CXCR3, as do
   several chemokines with antiangiogenic properties. These dual properties
   of mouse 6Ckine/SLC were tested for the induction of an antitumor
   response by transducing the C26 colon carcinoma tumor cell line with a
   cDNA encoding mouse 6Ckine/SLC, The C26-6CK-transduced cells showed
   reduced tumorigenicity in immunocompetent or in nude mice, Part of this
   effect was likely due to angiostatic mechanisms as shown by
   immunohistochemistry and Matrigel assay. C26-6CK tumors were also
   heavily infiltrated with leukocytes, including granulocytes, dendritic
   cells, and CD8(+) T cells. In vivo, anti-CDS treatment increased the
   tumorigenicity of the C26-6CK tumor cells, and tumor-infiltrating CD8(+)
   T cells had the phenotype of memory effector cells, suggesting the
   induction of cytotoxic tumor-specific T lymphocytes, On the other hand,
   anti-asialo-G(M1) depletion also increased the tumorigenicity of C26-6CK
   cells, supporting the participation of NK cells. Finally,
   tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells had the phenotype and functional
   features of Immature dendritic cells. Overall, these results suggest
   that mouse 6Ckine/SLC has strong antitumor effects by inducing both
   angiostatic, CD8(+) T cell-mediated, and possibly NK-mediated tumor
   resistance mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{An inverse variational model is applied to four exceptionally cloud-free
   sea surface temperature image sequences of the Brazil-Malvinas
   Confluence area for the purpose of estimating sea surface velocity
   fields. The velocity fields are constructed by minimizing a mixed layer
   integrated form of the heat balance equation while the horizontal
   divergence and vorticity of the flow field are controlled. The source
   terms involved in the heat balance are determined by fitting a
   polynomial to diurnal temperature Variations as a function of
   temperature and longitude. A sensitivity study of the solution to
   perturbations of the weights imposed to the constraints on divergence
   and vorticity as well as of the representation of the source terms
   yields error fields associated with the velocity. A comparison of the
   estimated velocity fields with available concomitant in situ velocity
   measurements shows that the fields are realistic. Errors are of the
   order of 15-20\% in magnitude and 20 degrees-25 degrees in direction.
   These errors fall within the error bars of 25-30\% in magnitude and of
   30 degrees-35 degrees in direction, except for the summer image series.
   Surface velocities of 0.5-0.6 m s(-1) are obtained across the Malvinas
   Current. They are > 1 m s(-1) in the frontal region, in the Brazil
   Current overshoot, and in warm and cold core rings and vary between 0.3
   and 0.8 m s(-1) in the Brazil Current. With some hypotheses on the
   vertical shear of the horizontal flow the transport of the Malvinas
   Current is estimated to be 25 +/- 5 Sv between 41 degrees and 40 degrees

Title = {{T-cell frequency analysis does not predict the incidence of
   graft-versus-host disease in HLA-matched sibling bone marrow
   transplantation}},

Abstract = {{Background. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major and sometimes
   fatal complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The
   prediction of GVHD remains an important issue in preventing morbidity
   and mortality after allogeneic BMT. In the past 10 years, there has been
   great interest in using the frequency analysis of alloreactive helper
   and cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (HTLp and CTLp) to detect
   recipient-specific alloreactivity and thus predict GVHD in HLA-matched
   related and unrelated BMT. However, the results remain controversial.
   The intention of the present study was to investigate whether
   alloreactive HTLp and CTLp frequencies measured in donor peripheral
   blood before BMT would be a useful predictor for the occurrence of acute
   GVHD after HLA-matched sibling BMT.
   Method. A combined limiting dilution assay was used to determine
   alloreactive HTLp and CTLp frequencies for 42 HLA-matched sibling
   patient/donor pairs. The pretransplantation host-reactive HTLp and CTLp
   frequencies were then correlated with posttransplantation clinical
   outcomes of acute GVHD. The association between HTLp/CTLp frequencies
   and the incidence of acute GVHD was determined using the Fisher's exact
   test.
   Results. The mean values of HTLp and CTLp frequencies for this cohort of
   HLA-matched sibling patient/donor pairs were 1:321,322 (range 1:71,000
   to 1:1000,000) and 1:195,260 (range 1:3,717 to 1:1000,000),
   respectively. Acute GVHD (greater than or equal to II) was observed in
   one of four patients with high (>1:100,000) HTLp frequencies and 20 of
   36 patients with low (<1:100,000) HTLp frequencies. Similarly, 6 of 10
   patients with high (>1: 100,000) CTLp frequencies and 14 of 29 patients
   with low (<1:100,000) CTLp frequencies developed acute GVHD (greater
   than or equal to II). The overall correlation between host-reactive
   HTLp/CTLp frequencies and the incidence of acute GVHD in this cohort of
   patients was 42.5\% and 53.9\%, respectively, There was no significant
   difference in the incidence of acute GVHD between the patients with
   either high or low host-reactive HTLp/CTLp frequencies (P=0.331 and
   0.716, respectively). The data were also analyzed separately for the
   adult patient group based on GVHD prophylaxis with either cyclosporine
   alone or the combination of cyclosporine and methotrexate, Within these
   two prophylaxis groups, neither HTLp nor CTLp frequencies correlated
   with acute GVHD.
   Conclusion. Host-reactive HTLp and CTLp frequency analysis did not
   provide informative prediction for the occurrence of acute GVHD after
   HLA-matched sibling BMT.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. Opportunistic prospective follow-up study.
   Objective. To describe the natural history of low back pain in the
   community and to model the factors predictive of recovered versus
   persistent low back pain.
   Summary of Background Data. A two-phase questionnaire was mailed to
   adults in the Bradford Metropolitan Health District in 1994. Valid
   respondents were surveyed again in 1997. Analysis is based on the
   combined results of these two surveys.
   Methods. Unifactorial and multifactorial statistics were analyzed based
   on 1455 adults, with and without low back pain.
   Results. One third or respondents reported no lifetime low back pain.
   Average lifetime prevalence was 59\% and average annual prevalence 41\%.
   Of those who reported lifetime low back pain, 42\% reported persistent
   annual low back pain, 18\% reported a first episode in 1997, resulting
   in a 4\% population incidence rate, and 40\% reported intermittent low
   back pain. The likelihood of having had low back pain increased
   significantly with age. Those who reported a new case of low back pain
   in 1997 were significantly more likely to be 25-34 years of age, and
   thee persons were most likely to report acute low back pain with very
   little disability. Those with persistent low back pain were
   significantly more likely to report chronic low back pain with some
   disability. Logistic regression modeling ws unable to predict recovered
   versus persistent low back pain, given the person, pain and treatment
   factors available.
   Conclusions. Results showed that low back pain is a mutable problem with
   acute episodes blending into longer periods resulting in more disability
   as time progresses. A wide range of demographic, pain, consultation and
   treatment factors were not predictive of low back pain recovery.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 22 type II restriction endonucleases with 18 distinct
   specificities have been identified in six Helicobacter pylori strains.
   Among these 18 specificities are three completely new endonucleases,
   Hpy178III, Hpy991, and Hpy1881, that specifically cleave DNA at TC-NNGA,
   CCWCG, and TCNGA sites, respectively. The set of endonucleases
   identified in each strain varies, but ail have four- or five-base
   recognition sequences. Among 16 H. pylori strains, examination of the
   DNA modification status at the recognition sites of 15 restriction
   endonucleases reveals that each main has a substantially different
   complement of type II modification systems. We conclude that the type tl
   restriction-modification systems in H. pylori are highly diverse between
   strains, a unique characteristic of H. pylori. The diverse methylation
   status of H. pylori chromosomal DNA may serve as a new typing system to
   discriminate H. pylori isolates for epidemiological and clinical
   purposes. This study also demonstrates that H, pylori is a rich source
   of type II restriction endonucleases.}},

Abstract = {{Vinylidene chloride/acrylate copolymers display a good barrier to the
   transport of small molecules (oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, etc.) as
   well as to flavor and aroma constituents of food items. For this reason.
   they occupy a place of prominence in the barrier plastic packaging
   industry. However, at process temperatures, these materials tend to
   undergo degradative dehydrochlorination. This is a typical radical chain
   process with distinct initiation, propagation, and termination phases
   and if unchecked can lead to the development of coloration which may be
   objectionable in some applications. To examine the influence of an
   aliphatic side chain on this process, a series of vinylidene
   chloride/butyl acrylate (4, 8, 12, 18, 20 wt.\%) copolymers have been
   sythesized and fully characterized by chromatographic, thermal, and
   spectroscopic methods and by thermogravimetry. Increasing levels of
   butyl acrylate in the copolymer have little impact on the rate of
   initiation of degradation but do modestly decrease the propagation rate
   for the degradation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, a partially dominant
   X-linked disorder, is the most common inherited defect of the urea
   cycle. Previous reports suggested a variable phenotypic spectrum, and
   several studies documented different ``private{''} mutations in the OTC
   genes of patients. Our laboratory identified disease-causing mutations
   in 157 families with OTC deficiency, 100 of which came to medical
   attention through a hemizygous propositus and in 57 the index case was a
   heterozygous female. We correlated the genotype with age of onset, liver
   OTC activity, incorporation of nitrogen into urea, and peak plasma
   ammonia levels. The ``neonatal onset{''} group has a homogenous clinical
   and biochemical phenotype, whereas the ``late onset{''} group shows an
   extremely wide phenotype; 60\% of the mutations are associated
   exclusively with acute neonatal hyperammonemic coma. The remaining
   mutations caused a nonuniform phenotype ranging from severe disease to
   no symptoms; 31\% of the mutations in the OTC gene occur in CpG;
   dinucleotides (methylation-mediated deamination), and none of them
   accounted for more than 4\% of the total. Eighty-six percent of the
   mutations represented single-base substitutions and 68\% of the
   substitutions were transitions. G-to-A and C-to-T transitions were the
   most frequent substitutions (34 and 21\%, respectively) whereas C-to-A,
   A-to-C, C-to-G;, and T-to-A transversions were the least common
   (1.5-3\%). Twenty percent of propositi and 77\% of propositae carried
   new mutations. Forty percent of female germinal mutations were in CpG:
   dinucleotides whereas this number appears much smaller in male germinal
   mutations. These data allow classification of patients with OTC
   deficiency into at least two groups who have discordant disease course
   and prognoses. In addition, they improve our understanding on the origin
   of mutations in the OTC gene and allow better counseling of affected
   families. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   of arrival for each signal within an event. The signal amplitude is
   converted to time using the standard Wilkinson technique and then
   combined with its time of arrival into a single time trace. These traces
   are converted by multi-hit TDCs, which only convert the active channels
   and thus reduce the processing load. Additional custom-built CAMAC
   modules organise the TDC output into a suitable form for storage and
   transmission to a network of processor terminals over standard ethernet.
   This paper presents a description of the data acquisition system from
   preamplifier through to final storage in a VME-based system and
   subsequent distribution to a network of Sun terminals over ethernet. The
   system performance is illustrated with results from heavy-ion elastic
   scattering recorded with position sensitive strip detectors. (C) 2000

   fortuitous occupation of the DNA adjacent to the primary binding sites
   by an excess of the repressor. Furthermore, the protection pattern
   revealed by DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting reflected a
   side-by-side oligomerization of the protein along an extended DNA
   stretch. This type of DNA-protein interactions is more like those
   observed in some eukaryotic factors and nucleoid-associated proteins

Abstract = {{We present the local linear stability analysis of rotating jets confined
   by a toroidal magnetic field. Under the thin flux tube approximation, we
   derive the equation of motion for slender magnetic flux tubes. In
   addition to the terms responsible for the conventional instability of
   the toroidal magnetic field, a term related to the magnetic buoyancy and
   a term corresponding to the differential rotation become relevant fur
   the stability properties. We find that the rigid rotation stabilizes
   while the differential rotational destabilizes the jet in a way similar
   to the Balbus-Hawley instability. Within the frame of our local
   analysis, we find that if the azimuthal velocity is of the order of or
   higher than the Alfven azimuthal speed, the rigidly rotating part of the
   jet interior can be completely stabilized, while the strong shearing
   instability operates in the transition layer between the rotating jet
   interior and the external medium. This can explain the limb-brightening
   effect observed in several jets. However, it is still possible to find
   jet equilibria that are stable all across the jet, even in the presence
   of differential rotation. We discuss observational consequences of these
   results.}},

   that the cyclooctadienyl group coordinates to the ruthenium center by an

   associated with aryloxo anion. Further treatment of 2a and 2e with PMe3

Abstract = {{In vitro studies have provided evidence that Cl- ion currents are
   important for activation of vascular smooth muscle contraction. The
   stilbene, 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS),
   disrupts Cl- metabolism by blocking Cl- channels and by inhibiting Cl-
   bicarbonate exchange. The aims of this study were to: (i) characterize
   the hemodynamic responses produced by DIDS in pentobarbital anesthetized
   rats, and (ii) examine vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine
   before and after administration of DIDS. DIDS (2.5-50 mu mol/kg, 92.5 mu
   mol/kg total dose, i.v.) produced dose-dependent but transient
   reductions in mean arterial blood pressure and in hindquarter, renal and
   mesenteric vascular resistances. Prior to the administration of DIDS,
   norepinephrine (1.0-5.0 mu g/kg, i.v.) produced dose-dependent increases
   in mean arterial pressure, renal resistance and mesenteric resistance,
   but decreases in hindquarter resistance that were inversely related to
   dose. After administration of DIDS, the peak presser responses produced
   by norepinephrine were either slightly diminished (1.0, 2.5 mu g/kg) or
   unchanged (5.0 mu g/kg). Peak norepinephrine-induced changes in
   hindquarter and renal vascular resistance were unaffected by DIDS, while
   increases in mesenteric resistance were augmented. The total
   norepinephrine-induced increases in mean arterial pressure (mm Hg x s)
   were markedly reduced by DIDS. These effects of DIDS on
   norepinephrine-induced responses were similar, but not identical to
   those of the voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel blocker, nifedipine (500
   nmol/kg, i.v.). These findings suggest that DIDS may interfere with
   norepinephrine-induced depolarization of resistance arteries, thereby
   preventing activation of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Calreticulin is a lectin-like molecular chaperone of the endoplasmic
   reticulum in eukaryotes. Its interaction with N-glycosylated
   polypeptides is mediated by the glycan, Glc(1)Man(9)GlcNAc(2), present
   on the target glycoproteins. In this work, binding of monoglucosyl IgG
   (chicken) substrate to calreticulin has been studied using real time
   association kinetics of the interaction with the biosensor based on
   surface plasmon resonance (SPR). By SPR, accurate association and
   dissociation rate constants were determined, and these yielded a
   micromolar association constant. The nature of reaction was unaffected
   by immobilization of either of the reactants. The Scatchard analysis
   values for K-a agreed web crith the one obtained by the ratio
   k(1)/k(-1). The interaction was completely inhibited by free
   oligosaccharide, Glc(1)Man(9)GlcNAc(2), whereas Man(9)GlcNAc(2) did not
   bind to the calreticulin-substrate complex, attesting to the exquisite
   specificity of this interaction. The binding of calreticulin to IgG was
   used for the development of immunoassay and the relative affinity of the
   lectin-substrate association was indirectly measured. The values are in
   agreement with those obtained with SPR. Although the reactions are
   several orders of magnitude slower than the diffusion controlled
   processes, the data are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with
   single-step bimolecular association and dissociation reaction. Analyses
   of the activation parameters indicate that reaction is enthalpically
   driven and does not involve a highly ordered transition state. Based on
   these data, the mechanism of its chaperone activity is briefly
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of the Escherichia coli zinc transporter, encoded by the
   znuACB gene cluster, is regulated in response to the intracellular zinc
   concentration by the zur gene product. Inactivation of the zur gene
   demonstrated that Zur acts as a repressor when binding Zn2+ Eight
   chromosomal mutant zur alleles were sequenced to correlate the loss of
   Zur function with individual mutations. Wild-type Zur and Zur Delta
   46-91 formed homoand heterodimers. Dimerization was independent of metal
   ions since it also occurred in the presence of metal chelators. Using an
   in vivo titration assay, the znu operator was narrowed down to a 31-base
   pair region overlapping the translational start site of znuA. This
   location was confirmed by footprinting assays. Zur directly binds to a
   single region comprising a nearly perfect palindrome. Zinc chelators
   completely inhibited and Zn2+ in low concentrations enhanced DNA binding
   of Zur, No evidence for autoregulation of Zur was found. Zur binds at
   least 2 zinc ions/dimer specifically. Although most of the mutant Zur
   proteins bound to the znu operator in vitro, no protection was observed
   in in vivo footprinting experiments. Analysis of the mutant Zur proteins
   suggested an amino-terminal DNA contact domain around residue 65 and a
   dimerization and Zn2+-binding domain toward the carboxyl-terminal end.}},

Abstract = {{We study the gas emission of galaxies with active star formation,
   consisting mostly of H II and starburst galaxies, as well as some
   Seyfert 2 galaxies, and determine chemical and physical parameters, The
   data consist of 19 high signal-to-noise ratio optical templates, a
   result of grouping 185 emission-line galaxy spectra. Underlying stellar
   population models (from Raimann et al.) were subtracted from the
   templates in order to isolate the pure emission component.
   We analyse the distribution of these improved signal-to-noise ratio
   emission spectra in diagnostic diagrams and find that the H II templates
   show a smaller spread in log({[}O III]/H beta) values than the
   individual galaxies, apparently as a result of the population
   subtraction and a better signal-to-noise ratio. We thus suggest the
   template sequence as a fiducial observational locus for H II galaxies
   which can be used as reference for models. The sequence of line ratios
   presented by the H II galaxies in the diagram log({[}O III]lambda 5007/H
   beta) versus log({[}N II]lambda 6584/H alpha) is primarily owing to the
   gas metallicity, of which the log({[}N II]/H alpha) ratio is a direct
   estimator. We also study the properties of the starburst galaxies and
   those intermediate between H II and starburst galaxies, which are more
   metal rich and sit on more massive galaxies.
   We discuss the present results in the frame of a recently proposed
   equivalent-width diagnostic diagram for emission-line galaxies (by Rola
   et al.) and conclude that the observed ranges in W({[}O II])/W(H beta)
   and W(H beta) are mostly owing to the non-ionizing stellar population
   contribution. We propose that W(H beta) be used as an estimator of this
   contribution to the continuum, and briefly discuss implications to the
   cosmological use of H II galaxies.}},

Abstract = {{Linear alkylbenzenesulfonates (LASs) were determined in wastewaters and
   coastal waters by solid-phase extraction, using two different sample
   preparation protocols depending on the sample treated, followed by
   capillary electrophoresis and ultraviolet detection (CE-UV). The linear
   range of the proposed method varied from 3 to 53 and from 25 to 495 mu
   g/l, depending on the compound, with a limit of detection of 1 mu g/l
   when 250 ml of coastal water was preconcentrated. {[}M-H](-) ions were
   used for CE-MS confirmation after quantification by CE-UV. CE-MS
   diagnostic ions were the same ones used in LC-electrospray (ESI) MS and
   corresponded to m/z 297, 311, 325 and 339 for C-10, C-11, C-12 and C-13
   LASs, respectively. LASs were determined in wastewater samples of the
   influent and effluent of three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), two
   of them using biological treatment with secondary settlement and
   receiving mainly domestic wastewaters whereas one of the plants was
   operated with physicochemical treatment and received mainly industrial
   wastewaters. LASs were also analyzed in two samples from coastal waters
   of the bay of Cadiz (Spain) receiving untreated domestic effluents. All
   samples were also analyzed by LC-ESI-MS and the results are compared
   with the CE-W method developed in this work The concentration levels of
   total LASs varied from 988 to 1309 mu g/l in the influents of WWTPs,
   whereas in the effluents the concentrations varied from 136 to 197 mu
   g/l. The levels of LASs in coastal wastewaters of the bay of Cadiz
   varied from 739 to 911 mu g/l, indicating that the wastewaters
   discharged into the bay did not undergo any treatment at all. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{We determine simple analytical conditions for combined radiative and
   thermal equilibrium between the X-ray emitting plasma and the cold
   reprocessor in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galactic black holes
   (GBHs). These conditions determine the pressure at the transition zone,
   which is not arbitrary in the static situation. The conditions for the
   static solution are derived analytically for different forms of plasma
   heating and for cooling provided by Compton cooling, bremsstrahlung and
   (optionally) advective cooling.
   We conclude that if Compton heating is the only heating mechanism, we
   always achieve static equilibrium between the phases. For constant
   volume heating and radiatively cooled plasma the static solution is
   never achieved and evaporation or condensation takes place. However,
   static solutions with no evaporation/condensation are found for
   radiative cooling supplemented with lateral advection. Similar results
   are obtained for a two-temperature plasma. In the case of a general
   prescription of mechanical heating (Q(+) = h(0)P(m)T(-s)) of radiatively
   cooled one-temperature plasma, we find that a static solution is only
   possible when 0 < s < 3/2.
   Such conditions apply to all models, like disc/corona solutions,
   accretion-dominated advection flows (ADAFs) at their outer ADAF/disc
   boundary or cold clumps embedded in a hot medium. These models have to
   be reconsidered and supplemented either with an additional condition for
   the pressure at the transition zone or with an equation describing the
   mass exchange between the phases.}},

Abstract = {{A polyclonal antibody raised against a 17 amino acid polypeptide (the
   predicted C-terminal sequence of the cloned Drosophila melanogaster
   gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunit, RDL) was used to
   investigate the distribution of GABA receptor subunit(s) of this type in
   the nervous system of the cockroach Periplaneta americana. Intense
   staining was detected in the calyces of the mushroom bodies, glomeruli
   of the antennal lobes, lower central body, the corpora cardiaca and
   several cell layers of the medulla and the lobula regions of the optic
   robe. The most intense Immunocytochemical staining was in the
   suboesophageal ganglion. Control sections pre-incubated with the primary
   antibody and conjugated peptide were not stained. Thus, it appears that
   a GABA receptor subunit of the RDL type is located in cockroach brain
   regions involved in the processing of visual, olfactory and
   mechanosensory inputs to the nervous system. Since the corpora cardiaca
   reacted to this antiserum, this type of GABA receptor may also be
   involved in the regulation of neurosecretory activity. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We have investigated the structural basis for the differential catalytic
   function of the yeast Gcn5p-containing histone acetyltransferase (HAT)
   A2 complex and free recombinant yeast Gcn5p (rGcn5p), HAT A2 is shown to
   be a unique complex that contains Gcn5p, Ada2p, and Ada3p, but not
   proteins specific to other related HAT A complexes, e,g, ADA, SAGA.
   Nevertheless, HAT A2 produces the same unique polyacetylation pattern of
   nucleosomal substrates reported previously for ADA and SAGA,
   demonstrating that proteins specific to the ADA and SAGA complexes do
   not influence the enzymatic activity of Gcn5p within the HAT A2 complex.
   To investigate the role of substrate interactions in the differential
   behavior of free and complexed Gcn5p, sucrose density gradient
   centrifugation was used to characterize the binding of HAT A2 and free
   rGcn5p to intact and trypsinized nucleosomal arrays, H3/H4 tetramer
   arrays, and nucleosome core particles. We find that HAT A2 forms stable
   complexes with all nucleosomal substrates tested. In distinct contrast,
   rGcn5p does not interact stably with nucleosomal arrays, despite being
   able to specifically monoacetylate the H3 N terminus of nucleosomal
   substrates, Our data suggest that the ability of the KAT A2 complex to
   bind stably to nucleosomal arrays is functionally related to both local
   and global acetylation by the complexed and free forms of Gcn5p.}},

Abstract = {{High level activation of p53-dependent transcription occurs following
   cellular exposure to genotoxic damaging agents such as UV-C, while
   ionizing radiation damage does not induce a similarly potent induction
   of p53-dependent gene expression. Reasoning that one of the major
   differences between UV-C and ionizing radiation damage is that the
   latter does not inhibit general transcription, we attempted to
   reconstitute p53-dependent gene expression in ionizing irradiated cells
   by co-treatment with selected transcription inhibitors that alone do not
   activate p53. p53-dependent transcription can be dramatically enhanced
   by the treatment of ionizing irradiated cells with low doses of DRB,
   which on its own does not induce p53 activity, The mechanism of ionizing
   radiation-dependent activation of p53-dependent transcription using DRB
   is more likely due to inhibition of gene transcription rather than
   prolonged DNA damage, as the non-genotoxic and general transcription
   inhibitor Roscovitine also synergistically activates p53 function in
   ionizing irradiated cells, These results identify two distinct signal
   transduction pathways that cooperate to fully activate p53-dependent
   gene expression: one responding to lesions induced by ionizing radiation
   and the second being a kinase pathway that regulates general RNA
   Polymerase it activity.}},

Abstract = {{Density functional methodology has been used to study the mechanistic
   details of the migratory insertion of CO into the transition metal-alkyl
   sigma bond of the Fe cyclopentadienyl complexes CpFe(CO)(2)CH3 and
   {[}CpFe(CO)(2)CH3](+) in the presence of phosphine, PH3. Geometries,
   energies, and vibrational frequencies of reactants, molecular complexes,
   transition states, intermediates, and products are determined. Methyl
   migration with little PH3 participation is the rate-determining step for
   both the neutral system and the cation system. Addition of PH3
   stabilizes the metastable intermediates {[}CpFe(CO)(COCH3)- -PH3](0/+)
   and the products {[}CpFe(CO)(COCH3)(PH3)](0/+). The calculated
   activation energies of the rate-determining steps are 17.8 and 7.5
   kcal/mol for the neutral and cation reaction, respectively. The
   significant difference in these barriers is not due to the oxidatively
   promoted reaction utilizing a significantly different mechanism, but is
   interpreted in terms of methyl migration in the cation as having more
   radical character induced by the unpaired electron on Fe. For the
   reverse of the neutral migratory-insertion reaction, the overall
   activation energy is 24.3 kcal/mel. Thus, as is observed, the neutral
   reaction will be reversible only at higher temperatures. The overall
   exothermicities are -4.6 and -29.4 kcal/mol for the neutral and the
   cation reaction, respectively. The eta(2)- acyl intermediates
   \{CpFe(CO)(COCH3)\}(0/+) are more stable by 6.1 and 11.1 kcal/mol than
   the eta(2)-methyl (agostic) intermediates, respectively. However, these
   eta(2)-acyl intermediates are not involved in the favored pathway of
   either reaction due to higher barriers for their formation. Natural bond
   orbital analyses for the molecular complexes {[}CpFe(CO)(2)(CH3)-
   -PH3](0/+) show a weak donor-acceptor interaction, where the phosphine
   behaves as acceptor in the neutral complex but as a donor in the cation.}},

Abstract = {{We designed and fabricated a true triaxial loading system and used it to
   determine deformational and strength characteristics of the amphibolite
   penetrated by the superdeep hole drilled in the Bohemian massif of
   southeastern Germany under the German Continental Deep Drilling Program
   (KTB). Amphibolite is found between 3200 and 7300 m and thus the
   dominant rock in this 9100-m boring. Our loading system enables the
   application of three unequal principal stresses to a rectangular
   prismatic rock specimen. During a test we maintained the least principal
   (sigma(3)) and the intermediate (sigma(2)) stresses constant and
   increased the major principal stress (sigma(1)) until brittle Failure
   occurred, in the form of a fracture steeply dipping, in the sigma(3)
   direction. Typically, for the same sigma(3) level the amphibolite
   compressive strength increased substantially with the magnitude of
   sigma(2), demonstrating the inadequacy of Mohr-like failure criteria
   that ignore the effect of the intermediate principal stress on rock:
   strength. We found that a general criterion for the amphibolite could be
   expressed in the form of a power function relating the octahedral shear
   stress at failure to the mean normal stress acting on the plane
   containing the fracture. With respect to deformation, we established
   that for the same sigma(3) the onset of dilatancy increases
   significantly with the magnitude of sigma(2). Thus the intermediate
   principal stress appears to extend the elastic range of the
   stress-strain behavior for a given sigma(3) and hence to retard the
   onset of the failure process. Scanning electron microscopy observations
   oft he failure process reveal that microcracks develop mainly parallel
   to sigma(2) direction, as the intermediate stress grows beyond sigma(3),
   localizing in close proximity of the eventual main fracture.}},

Abstract = {{We perform direct three-dimensional numerical simulations for
   magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in a periodic box of size 2 pi
   threaded by strong uniform magnetic fields. We use a pseudospectral code
   with hyperviscosity and hyperdiffusivity to solve the incompressible MHD
   equations. We analyze the structure of the eddies as a function of
   scale. A straightforward calculation of anisotropy in wavevector space
   shows that the anisotropy is scale independent. We discuss why this is
   not the true scaling law and how the curvature of large-scale magnetic
   fields affects the power spectrum and leads to the wrong conclusion.
   When we correct for this effect, we find that the anisotropy of eddies
   depends on their size: smaller eddies are more elongated than larger
   ones along local magnetic field lines. The results are consistent with
   the scaling law (k) over tilde(//) similar to (k) over
   tilde(perpendicular to)(2/3) recently proposed by Goldreich \& Sridhar.
   Here (k) over tilde(//) (and (k) over tilde(perpendicular to)) are
   wavenumbers measured relative to the local magnetic field direction.
   However, we see some systematic deviations that may be a sign of
   limitations to the model or our inability to fully resolve the inertial
   range of turbulence in our simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The affect of high-frequency excitation on the low-frequency motions of
   dynamic systems is considered. It is suggested to differentiate between
   weak, strong and very strong high-frequency excitations. Several
   approaches and difficulties connected with the analysis of these systems
   are shown. Systems with strong excitation are examined in a general
   form. As an example, the responses of a one-degree-of-freedom system to
   strong and very strong, high-frequency external and parametric
   excitations are compared. It is indicated, how the results achieved
   could be generalized for mechanical systems with very strong excitation.

Abstract = {{We have used the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA)
   millimeter array outfitted with sensitive centimeter-wave receivers to
   search for cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies on arcminute
   scales. The interferometer was placed in a compact configuration that
   produces high brightness sensitivity, while providing discrimination
   against point sources. Operating at a frequency of 28.5 GHz, the FWHM
   primary beam of the instrument is similar to 6'.6. We have made
   sensitive images of seven fields, four of which where chosen
   specifically to have low IR dust contrast and to be free of bright radio
   sources. Additional observations with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory
   (OVRO) millimeter array were used to assist in the location and removal
   of radio point sources. Applying a Bayesian analysis to the raw
   visibility data, we place limits on CMB anisotropy flat-band power of
   Q(flat) = 5.6(-5.6)(+3.0) mu K and Q(flat) < 14.1 mu K at 68\% and 95\%
   confidence, respectively. The sensitivity of this experiment to
   flat-band power peaks at a multipole of l = 5470, which corresponds to
   an angular scale of similar to 2'. The most likely value of Q(flat) is
   similar to the level of the expected secondary anisotropies.}},

Abstract = {{The photochemical reactions of phenazine and acridine adsorbed on silver
   colloid surfaces were studied. Both molecules, when adsorbed on the
   surface of colloidal silver, were found to photodecompose with the
   cleavage of a N-C bond in a one-photon process. Phenazine was found to
   photodecompose further to graphitic carbon under our experimental
   conditions, particularly when irradiated with short-wavelength laser
   light. The reaction rate of phenazine, which we propose to adsorb flat
   on the surface, was faster than that of acridine, which we suggest
   adsorbs standing up, implying that the reaction rate might depend on the
   orientation of the molecule with respect to the local metal surface. The
   reaction rate and degree of photodecomposition of these compounds depend
   on the irradiation wavelength in a complicated manner. For acridine, the
   photoreaction rate and the Raman enhancement increased toward the blue,
   whereas the degree of photodecomposition, i.e., the quantity of
   photoproduct produced, is a maximum at similar to 500 nm.}},

Abstract = {{A prospective cohort study design was used to evaluate the impact of
   subclinical Mycobacterium paratuberculosis infection on days open in a
   sample of Michigan dairy herds with a history of cows positive for M.
   paratuberculosis diagnosed by fecal culture. Participating herds were
   tested and productivity and reproduction records were monitored for 18
   months. All cows greater than or equal to 24 months old were tested for
   M. paratuberculosis infection using the ELISA and radiometric
   fecal-culture (RFC) techniques. Test-negative cows were re-tested at the
   conclusion of the monitoring period. Multivariable regression models
   were used. Using both tests in parallel, the overall sample apparent
   prevalence for M. paratuberculosis infection was 41.8\% (223/533 animals
   tested). Adjusting for diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, this
   resulted in a calculated sample true prevalence of 59.9\%,
   ELISA-positive cows (on average) had a 28-day increase in days open when
   compared to ELISA-negative cows (p=0.02). The diagnostic method used to
   define a case altered the apparent association between paratuberculosis
   test status and days open. Fecal culture was a less-effective diagnostic
   tool for use in herds with a high prevalence of infected animals. The
   increase in days open in the ELISA-positive cows was an indication that
   perhaps reduced estrus expression or an increased post-partum anestrous
   period occurred in the subclinically infected ELISA-positive animals.
   This might have been due to a negative energy balance associated with M.
   paratuberculosis infection. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The unique properties of water in the supercooled (metastable) state are
   not fully understood(1). In particular, the effects of solutes and
   mechanical pressure on the kinetics of the liquid-to-solid phase
   transition of supercooled water and aqueous solutions to ice have
   remained unresolved. Here we show from experimental data that the
   homogeneous nucleation of ice from supercooled aqueous solutions is
   independent of the nature of the solute, but depends only on the water
   activity of the solution-that is, the ratio between the water vapour
   pressures of the solution and of pure water under the same conditions.
   In addition, we show that the presence of solutes and the application of
   pressure have a very similar effect on ice nucleation. We present a
   thermodynamic theory for homogeneous ice nucleation, which expresses the
   nucleation rate coefficient as a function of water activity and
   pressure. Recent observations from clouds containing ice are in good
   agreement with our theory and our results should help to overcome one of
   the main weaknesses of numerical models of the atmosphere, the
   formulation of cloud processes.}},

   behaviour and the photodynamics, i.e. the energy and angular
   distributions of the photoformed methyl radicals were compared with the

   of the CaF2(111) surface resulted in an increased desorption temperature
   of the adsorbate, and the emergence of a broadened translational energy
   photodissociation channel, P(E-T'). for CH3(g), associated in earlier
   work with photoinduced charge-transfer dissociation of the adsorbate.
   This suggested the formation of Ca metal clusters by process (a). By
   contrast, the hydrogen-atom-modified surface exhibited a decreased
   desorption temperature of the adsorbate and no broadening of P(E-T').
   The thermal hydrogen atoms may modify the surface by abstracting surface
   F, forming HF(g). Electron impact and hydrogen atom modification of the
   CaF2 changed the angular distributions for the `directly formed' (fast)

   Photometric properties of the host galaxies}},

Abstract = {{We present here the analysis of morphological and photometric properties
   of a sample of isolated spirals with (18) and without (11) an active
   nucleus, based on near-infrared imaging in the J and K' bands (Paper I).
   The aim of that comparative analysis is to find the differential
   properties that could be directly connected with the phenomenon of
   nuclear activity. We stress the importance of using isolated objects for
   that purpose. Our study shows that both sets of galaxies are similar in
   their global properties: they define the same Kormendy relation, their
   disk components share the same properties, the bulge and disk scale
   lengths are correlated in a similar way, bar strengths and lengths are
   similar for primary bars. Our results therefore indicate that hosts of
   isolated Seyfert galaxies have bulge and disk properties comparable to
   those of isolated non active spirals. Central colors (the innermost 200
   pc) of active galaxies are redder than the centers of non active
   spirals, most probably due to AGN light being re-emitted by the hot dust
   and/or due to circumnuclear star formation, through the contribution of
   giants/supergiants.
   Central to our analysis is the study of the possible connection between
   bars and similar non axisymmetric structures with the nuclear fuelling.
   We note that only one of the Seyfert galaxies in our sample, namely ESO
   139-12, does not present a primary bar. But bars are equally present in
   active and control objects. The same applies to secondary bars. Not all
   the active galaxies we have observed have them, and some control
   galaxies also present such central structures. Secondary central
   elongations (associated with secondary bars, lenses, rings or disks) may
   be somewhat different,, but this result should be confirmed with larger
   samples. We note that numerical models indicate that such secondary bars
   are not strictly necessary to feed the central engine when a primary bar
   is present. Our results show that down to scales of 100-300 pc, there
   are no evident differences between active and non active spiral
   galaxies.}},

Abstract = {{Histamine release from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells was
   continuously measured using a histamine oxidase (HO)-immobilized on-line
   electrochemical sensor. The sensor has a carbon-based electrode modified
   with a bilayer of osmium-polyvinylpynidine-based gel containing
   horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and BSA containing HO. The high specificity
   of the enzyme made the sensor highly selective with regards to diamines
   such as putrescine and cadaverine. We obtained a low detection limit of
   23 nM owing to the low operation potential of the sensor (below 0 V vs.
   Ag/AgCl) and the high activity of the enzyme after immobilization.
   Moreover, the sensor had a high conversion efficiency. The sensor
   response was unaffected by 400 min of continuous histamine measurement
   and by more than 2 weeks of storage in a refrigerator. We combined the
   histamine sensor with a microdialysis (MD) sampling probe and used it to
   measure the histamine concentration of RBL-2H3 cells stimulated with
   dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA) after incubation with
   IgE. We also fabricated a small volume histamine sensor by the
   microfabrication technique and were able to measure the histamine
   release from a small mast cell colony in real time with the sensor by
   drawing the extracellular solution continuously through a sampling
   capillary located near the cells. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All

   shown that refraction of waves in pulsar magnetospheres can account for
   the main features of profile morphology given that the hollow-cone
   emission model is the case. The observed frequency evolution of pulsar
   profiles appears to be well explained by the frequency dependence of the

   fields is also discussed. Then, profiles crossing dikes and faults are
   extracted from the recent high-resolution aeromagnetic survey of French

Abstract = {{We derive and investigate a family of pairs of extended explicit
   Bel'tyukov Runge Kutta (EBVRK) formulas to treat Volterra integral
   equations of the second kind. Each pair uses six stages and consists of
   an order 3 formula completely embedded in an order 4 formula. We examine
   the structure of EBVRK pairs to facilitate their derivation, and in
   particular, we show that at least six stages are needed to form such
   pairs. This design is motivated to allow a variable stepsize in order to
   satisfy a prescribed error tolerance with a minimum of computation. Some
   numerical examples illustrate the procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Gas sensing using local probes, such as atomic force and scanning
   tunneling microscopes (STM), enables accurate measurement and detection
   of very small quantities of gas molecules and chemicals. Here we report
   a unique application of the evanescent microwave probes (EMP) in
   detecting hydrogen. The EMP imaging has previously been applied to
   mapping resistivity and other non-uniformities in a variety of materials
   including metals, insulators, semiconductors (both organic and
   inorganic), composites, and biological specimens. The EMP detects the
   microwave resistivity of the sample and it has an exponential
   sensitivity to distance and thickness variations. The EMP was used to
   detect deflections in a Pd-coated cantilever and to quantify the amount
   of stress and the resistivity change in the Pd film as a function of
   hydrogen concentration. The stress was in the range of 5.26-8.59 X 10(7)
   Pa for H-2, concentrations of 0.5-1.4\% at room temperature, which is
   about three times larger than that found in the bulk Pd for the same
   range of H-2 concentrations. The Pd film's resistivity changed by 13.5\%
   at 3.0\% H-2 concentration and 18\% change in the EMP signal was
   observed. The EMP with an appropriate frequency can also be used to
   resonantly detect various physi-absorbed molecules at the surface of an
   appropriate material as well. We discuss these possibilities along with
   some specific experimental data. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All

Volume = {{416}},
Pages = {{45-73}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{This work reports results of numerical simulations of viscous
   incompressible flow past a sphere. The primary objective is to identify
   transitions that occur with increasing Reynolds number, as well as their
   underlying physical mechanisms. The numerical method used is a mixed
   spectral element/Fourier spectral method developed for applications
   involving both Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates. In cylindrical
   coordinates, a formulation, based on special Jacobi-type polynomials, is
   used close to the axis of symmetry for the efficient treatment of the
   `pole' problem. Spectral convergence and accuracy of the numerical
   formulation are verified. Many of the computations reported here were
   performed on parallel computers. It was found that the first transition
   of the flow past a sphere is a linear one and leads to a
   three-dimensional steady flow field with planar symmetry, i.e. it is of
   the `exchange of stability' type, consistent with experimental
   observations on falling spheres and linear stability analysis results.
   The second transition leads to a single-frequency periodic flow with
   vortex shedding, which maintains the planar symmetry observed at lower
   Reynolds number. As the Reynolds number increases further, the planar
   symmetry is lost and the flow reaches a chaotic state. Small scales are
   first introduced in the flow by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of the
   separating cylindrical shear layer; this shear layer instability is
   present even after the wake is rendered turbulent.}},

Abstract = {{We study the neutrino emissivity of strongly magnetized neutron stars
   due to the charged and neutral current couplings of neutrinos to baryons
   in strong magnetic fields. The leading order neutral current process is
   the one-body neutrino-pair bremsstrahlung, which does not have an
   analogue in the zero field limit. The leading order charged current
   reaction is the known generalization of the direct Urea processes to
   strong magnetic fields. While for superstrong magnetic fields in excess
   of 10(18) G the direct Urea process dominates the one-body
   bremsstrahlung, we find that for fields on the order 10(16) - 10(17) G
   and temperatures a few times 10(9) K the one-body bremsstrahlung is the
   dominant process. Numerical computation of the resulting emissivity,
   based on a simple parametrization of the equation of state of the
   npe-matter in a strong magnetic field, shows that the emissivity of this
   reaction is of the same order of magnitude as that of the modified Urea
   process in the zero field limit.}},

   and under both O-2-rich and butane-rich feed conditions. The study was
   carried out using a configuration by which butane was fed to the inner
   tube (tube-side) where the catalyst was mounted and O-2 was fed either
   entirely to the outer tube (shell-side) or distributed in a certain
   ratio between the tube- and shell-sides with a variation of the pressure
   difference across the membrane, Delta P. It was observed that the use of
   a butane-rich feed under this configuration gives a higher maleic
   anhydride yield and that both Delta P values and the way feed O-2 was
   distributed can have a significant effect on the reaction rate. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Partitioning of hydrophobic cations, tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) and
   triphenylphosphonium homologues ((Phe)(3)-P+-(CH2)(n)CH3, n = 0-6), into
   lipid bilayers was studied by chromatography on immobilized small and
   large unilamellar liposomes (SUVs with mean diam of 30 nm and LUVs with
   100 nm), The liposomes were immobilized stably in chromatographic gel
   beads by avidin-biotin (Yang et al, J. Chromatogr. B. 1998, 707, 131).
   By immobilized liposome chromatography (ILC), membrane partition
   coefficients (K-LM) Of the cations were measured. The K-LM values were
   coincident with molar partition coefficient, K-m, which was determined
   for some of cations by an ultrafiltration method. Temperature dependence
   of k(LM) Save the thermodynamic quantities of membrane partitioning,
   Delta H degrees (enthalpy change) and Delta S degrees (entropy change).
   The same quantities were also measured with isothermal titration
   calorimetry (ITC), and the values of both methods were similar to each
   other. This confirms the usefulness of ILC on the basis of its
   simplicity. Except for TPMP+ (n = 0), both Delta H degrees and Delta S
   degrees were positive, meaning that their membrane partitioning is
   entropy-driven. The values of both Delta H degrees and Delta S degrees
   did not depend on whether II was odd or even. Thus, the odd-even pattern
   of the activation energy for the planar lipid membrane transport of
   these phosphonium cations (Ono et al, Biochemistry 1994, 33, 4312-4318)
   originates from the odd-even pattern of the translocation process within
   the hydrophobic core of the bilayer membrane. The origin of the odd-even
   pattern was discussed.}},

   radical cation. These correspond to (a) a chemical electron transfer,
   where a reaction intermediate or a transition structure exist with the
   charge localized on the linker, and (b) a nonadiabatic electron
   transfer, where the bridge remains neutral. These processes coexist on
   the same potential energy surface. They are characterized by very
   different reaction coordinates and are thus distinct elements of the
   mechanistic spectrum of intramolecular electron transfer in organic
   radical cations. The energetically favored chemical electron-transfer
   process involves conventional reaction paths. In contrast, the
   nonadiabatic electron-transfer process involves an unconventional
   reaction path, which connects reactant and products via an un-avoided
   (i.e., real) crossing seam (i.e, an (n-1)-dimensional intersection,
   where n is the number of vibrational degrees of freedom of the system)
   between two different adiabatic potential energy surfaces. Our results,
   computed for a model compound, differ from Nelsen's experimental
   results, and thus demonstrate the importance of the hydrazine
   substituents and the aromatic spacer.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of structure and discrimination in simple chiral fluids is
   presented. The chiral molecules consist of a central carbon bonded to
   four distinct groups. Molecular-dynamics simulations have been performed
   on a one-component chiral fluid and on two racemic mixtures. For the
   racemates, discrimination, as measured by differences in pair
   distribution functions, is present but found to be small. Intermolecular
   pair interaction energies are found to be good predictors of the
   magnitude and the sign (mirror-image pairs favored) of the differences
   observed in site-site distribution functions. For the one-component
   fluid, the quality of structural predictions from the
   reference-interaction-site method and Chandler-Silbey-Ladanyi (CSL)
   integral equation theories, with the hypernetted chain (HNC) and
   Percus-Yevick closures, has been examined. These theories generally
   provide a qualitatively correct description of the site-site
   distributions. Extensions beyond the HNC level have been explored:
   Two-field-point bridge diagrams have been explicitly evaluated and
   included in the CSL theory. The inclusion of these diagrams
   significantly improves the quality of the integral equation theories.
   Since the CSL theory has not been used extensively, and bridge diagrams
   have been evaluated in only a few instances, a detailed analysis of
   their impact is presented. For racemic mixtures, diagram evaluation is
   shown to be crucial. Specifically, the differences in site-site
   distributions for sites on identical and mirror-image molecules are
   found to originate from bridge diagrams which involve interactions
   between four-site, or larger, clusters. Discrimination cannot be
   predicted from an integral equation theory which neglects these
   diagrams. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics. {[}S0021-

Abstract = {{We propose a model to describe energy transfer between donors and
   accepters chemically attached to the two different components of a
   polymer blend. The model describes the case of one polymer dispersed as
   spheres of identical diameter in a continuous matrix of the second
   polymer. The model takes explicit account of the segment distribution of
   the two polymers in the interface region. We used this model to
   characterize the interface between poly(butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) and
   poly(2-ethylhexyl methacrylate) (PEHMA) domains in a binary blend. The
   blend was prepared by casting films onto a solid substrate from mixed
   aqueous latex dispersions of the two polymers. The dispersions were
   prepared by emulsion polymerization under conditions in which both
   components were formed as spherical particles with a very narrow size
   distribution. By using a 14:1 particle ratio of PEHMA to PBMA, we
   obtained films in which the 120 nm PBMA particles were surrounded by the
   PEHMA matrix. For the ion-exchanged latex blend, the interface thickness
   in the film freshly prepared at room temperature was delta = 21 +/- 2 nm
   and upon annealing broadened to delta = 25 +/- 2 nm. Because of the low
   degrees of polymerization for the samples, it is difficult to have
   confidence in the value of the Flory-Huggins parameter chi calculated
   from the experimental value of delta, because the correction for the
   finite length of the component is larger than the term that depends on
   the interface width. Keeping in mind the limitations of this
   calculation, we estimate that chi is approximately equal to 0.02-0.03.}},

Abstract = {{N,N'-Bis{[}2-(1-piperidino)ethyl]-3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic
   diimide (PIPER), a perylene derivative, is a very potent and selective
   G-quadruplex DNA-interactive agent. It has been shown to inhibit DNA
   polymerase and telomerase by stacking externally to the G-tetrads in the
   G-quadruplex structures. Recently, we have demonstrated that this small
   molecule greatly accelerates the assembly of G-quadruplex structures in
   a cell-free system. In this report, we present data demonstrating that
   PIPER prevents the unwinding of G-quadruplex structures by yeast Sgs1
   helicase. Sgs1 belongs to the RecQ DNA helicase family whose members
   include other G-quadruplex DNA unwinding helicases, such as human
   Bloom's syndrome and human Werner's syndrome helicases. PIPER
   specifically prevents the unwinding of G-quadruplex DNA but not duplex
   DNA by Sgs1. Competition experiments indicate that this inhibitory
   activity is due to the interaction of PIPER with G-quadruplex structures
   rather than the helicase itself. These results combined with previous
   studies suggest a possible mechanism of action for these
   G-quadruplex-interactive agents inside cells: they might induce
   G-quadruplex formation in G-rich regions on genomic DNA, stabilize these
   structures, and prevent them from being cleared by enzymes such as
   helicases. The G-quadruplex structures may, in turn, disrupt some
   critical cellular events such as DNA replication, transcription
   regulation, and telomere maintenance.}},

Abstract = {{The final step of cysteine biosynthesis in plants is catalyzed by
   O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase (OAS-TL), which occurs as several isoforms
   found in the cytosol, the plastids and the mitochondria. Genomic DNA
   blot hybridization and isolation of genomic clones indicate single copy
   genes (oasA1, oasA2, oasB and oasC) that encode the activities of OAS-TL
   A, B and C found in separate subcellular compartments in the model plant
   Arabidopsis thaliana. Sequence analysis reveals that the newly
   discovered oasA2 gene represents a pseudogene that is still transcribed,
   but is not functionally translated. The comparison of gene structures
   suggests that oasA1/oasA2 and oasB/oasC are closely related and may be
   derived from a common ancestor by subsequent duplications. OAS-TL A, B
   and C were overexpressed in an Escherichia coli mutant lacking cysteine
   synthesis and exhibited bifunctional OAS-TL and beta-cyanoalanine
   synthase (CAS) activities. However, all three proteins represent true
   OAS-TLs according to kinetic analysis and are unlikely to function in
   cyanide detoxification or secondary metabolism. In addition. it was
   demonstrated that the mitochondrial OAS-TL C exhibits in vivo
   protein-protein interaction capabilities with respect to cysteine
   synthase complex formation similar to cytosolic OAS-TL A and plastid
   OAS-TL B. Multiple database accessions for each of the A. thaliana
   OAS-TL isoforms can thus be attributed to a specified number of oas
   genes to which functionally defined gene products are assigned, and
   which art responsible for compartment-specific cysteine synthesis. (C)

Abstract = {{To explore the spatial organization and functional dynamics of the
   citrate transport protein (CTP), a nitroxide scan was carried out along
   22 consecutive residues within the fourth transmembrane domain (TMDIV).
   This domain has been implicated as being of unique importance to the CTP
   mechanism due to (i) the presence of two intramembranous positive
   charges that are essential for CTP function and (ii) the existence of a
   transmembrane aqueous surface within this domain which likely
   corresponds to a portion of the citrate translocation pathway. The
   sequence-specific variation in the mobilities of the introduced
   nitroxides and their accessibilities to molecular O-2 reveal an
   alpha-helical conformation along the sequence. The accessibilities to
   NiEDDA are out of phase with accessibilites to O-2, indicating that one
   face of the helix is solvated by the lipid bilayer while the other is
   solvated by an aqueous environment. A gradient of NiEDDA accessibility
   is observed along the helix surface facing the aqueous phase, and the
   EPR spectral line shapes at these sites indicate considerable motional
   restriction. In the context of the model where TMDIV lines the
   translocation pathway, these data suggest a barrier to passive diffusion
   through the pathway. This paper reports the first use of site-directed
   spin labeling to study mitochondrial transporter structure.}},

Abstract = {{The type of counterion present in the Nafion component of a blend with
   poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is shown to affect phase separation and
   the crystalline polymorphism of the PVDF component. Nafion neutralized
   with ari alkali metal counterion, Na+, results in blends displaying
   large-scale phase separation upon heating to temperatures above the
   melting point of PVDF. In contrast, when the Nafion counterion is
   changed to a larger tetrabutylammonium counterion (TBA(+)), the melt is
   homogeneous, and with the exception of the PVDF crystallites,
   large-scale phase separation is not observed after the blend is cooled
   to room temperature. For the blends containing Na+-form Nafion, the
   crystalline morphology of the PVDF component develops in predominately
   the alpha crystal form, similar to pure PVDF crystallized from the melt.
   However, for blends containing TBA(+)-form Nafion, the PVDF component
   crystallizes with a higher content of the beta- and/or gamma-crystal
   forms. This effect of counterion type on the phase Separation behavior
   and crystal morphology is attributed to the strength of the
   electrostatic crosslinks within the Nafion component. Strong
   electrostatic cross-links induce gelation of the Nafion component
   leading to phase separation at elevated temperatures, whereas weak
   electrostatic cross-links provide a free-flowing melt that allows for a
   more favorable mixing with the PVDF component and is thus capable of
   influencing the crystallization process.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between Mg2+-dependent activity and the self-assembly
   state of HIV-1 integrase was investigated using different protein
   preparations. The first preparations, INCHAPS and INdial, were purified
   in the presence of detergent, but in the case of INdial, the detergent
   was removed during a final dialysis. The third preparation, IN,,, was
   purified without any detergent. The three preparations displayed
   comparable Mn2+-dependent activities. In contrast, the Mg2+-dependent
   activity that reflects a more realistic view of the physiological
   activity strongly depended on the preparation. INCHAPS was not capable
   of using Mg2+ as a cofactor, whereas INzn was highly active under the
   same conditions. In the accompanying paper {[}Deprez, E., et al. (2000)
   Biochemistry 39, 9275-9284], we used time-resolved fluorescence
   anisotropy to demonstrate that INCHAPS was monomeric at the
   concentration of enzymatic assays. Here, we show that LN,, was
   homogeneously tetrameric under similar conditions. Moreover, INdial that
   exhibited an intermediary Mg2+-dependent activity existed in a
   monomer-multimer equilibrium. The level. of Mg2+- but not Mn2+-dependent
   activity of INdial was altered by addition of detergent which plays a
   detrimental role in the maintenance of the oligomeric organization. Our
   results indicate that the ability of integrase to use Mg2+ as a cofactor
   is related to its self-assembly state in solution, whereas
   Mn2+-dependent activity is not. Finally, the oligomeric INzn was capable
   of binding efficiently to DNA regardless of the cationic cofactor,
   whereas the monomeric INCHAPS strictly required Mn2+. Thus, we propose
   that a specific conformation of integrase is a prerequisite for its
   binding to DNA in the presence of Mg2+.}},

Abstract = {{We previously purified a cytosolic phospholipase Al that could catalyze
   the preferential hydrolysis of phosphatidic acid in mixed-micelle
   assays. Here we studied the enzyme's interactions with unilamellar lipid
   membranes and examined effects of the lipids on enzyme binding,
   stability, and catalysis. A major finding was that membrane lipids could
   influence the stability, activity, and specificity of the enzyme under
   conditions where enzyme binding to the membranes was likely to be
   saturated. Thus, the enzyme was unstable at 37 degrees C in the absence
   of membranes but bound to membranes that contained anionic
   phosphoglycerides and could be stabilized by these membranes in the
   presence of albumin. The overall activity of the bound enzyme toward
   membrane phosphoglycerides, assayed in the presence of albumin,
   increased when phosphatidylethanolamine was substituted for
   phosphatidylcholine. Furthermore, the enzyme's catalytic preference for
   phosphatidic acid increased when cholesterol and diacylglycerol were
   included in the membranes,
   sn-1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoylphosphatidylethanolamine was substituted for
   sn-1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, and the concentration
   of phosphatidic acid was increased from 0 to 10 mol \% of the total
   membrane phosphoglycerides. Finally, changes in the relative contents of
   phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine in the membranes influenced
   the enzyme's catalytic preference for different molecular species of
   phosphatidic acid. These results provide the first available information
   about the enzyme's ability to interact with membranes and identify
   conditions that yield high enzyme activity toward membrane-associated
   phosphatidic acid.}},

Abstract = {{The repetitive electrochemical underpotential deposition (upd) and
   stripping of Ag on Au(111) in sulfuric acid in the presence of small
   amounts of chloride produce a substantially more noble Ag upd adlayer
   than that formed during initial depositions. The evidence for this
   increase in nobility is a gradual and direct replacement of the primary
   upd and stripping peaks in initial cyclic voltammograms by peaks at
   anodic potentials higher by roughly 80 mV. The transformation is
   quantitative and reversible and occurs with a smoothing of the gold
   substrates, as observed by scanning probe microscopies. The amount of
   transferred charge increases by about 20\% from the initial depositions
   (92 +/- 2 mu C/cm(2)) to the more noble state (110 +/- 2 mu C/cm(2)),
   indicating a change in the Ag adlattice from its initial 3 x 3 structure
   to a more densely packed structure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS) shows that the more noble Ag adlayer includes a stoichiometric
   amount of chloride and that its amount varies directly with the amount
   of silver that deposits at the higher oxidation potential. The combined
   results from electrochemistry and XPS reveal that chloride adsorbs onto
   the surface during the underpotential deposition of Ag, produces a
   weakly adsorbed chloride layer on gold when the silver layer is removed,
   and is responsible for producing a more noble Ag upd layer on gold.}},

Abstract = {{The cationic metalloporphyrin Mn-TMPyP activated by KHSO5 has been used

   fold into different quadruplex structures under 200 mM NaCl. We found
   that the oxo-metalloporphyrin was able to mediate efficient oxidative
   cleavage of the quadruplex. The location of damage showed that the
   metalloporphyrin was able to bind to the last G-tetrad of the quadruplex
   structure via an external interaction. This metalloporphyrin-G-tetrad
   interaction needs a relatively high flexibility of the single-stranded
   linker regions to allow the partial stacking of the metalloporphyrin
   with the last G-tetrad planar structure. The oxidative damage consisted
   of guanine oxidation within the interacting G-tetrad together with an
   1'-carbon hydroxylation of deoxyribose residues of the thymidine
   residues located on the neighboring single-stranded loop. So the

Abstract = {{A Eulerian rate formulation of finite elastoplasticity is a composite
   one composed of a rate equation for elastic behaviour and a flow rule
   for plastic behaviour as well as an evolution equation for hardening
   behaviour, in which objective Eulerian tensor rates are used. Among a
   large variety of objective rates (actually infinitely many), how to
   choose suitable ones has been one of the crucial points in finite
   elastoplasticity. It is realized that the foregoing composite
   formulation of elastoplasticity should fulfil certain consistency
   criteria in order to avoid inconsistencies or contradictions. These
   criteria narrow the choice of objective rates. These authors (Bruhns and
   co-workers and Xiao and co-workers) have recently introduced the
   self-consistency criterion: in a composite formulation of
   elastoplasticity, the rate equation intended for characterization of
   elastic behaviour should be exactly integrable to deliver an elastic
   relation. It has been demonstrated in the work of the aforementioned
   authors that if a composite formulation of elastoplasticity with
   objective rates is required to fulfil the just-stated self-consistency
   criterion, as it should be, then the newly discovered logarithmic rate
   is the only possible choice among all objective corotational rates,
   including the Zaremba-Jaumann rate and the Green-Naghdi rate, etc. In
   the aforementioned result, non-corotational rates, including Oldroyd
   rates, Cotter-Rivlin rate and Truesdell rate, etc., are not taken into
   consideration in general. It is the main goal of this paper to further
   establish the uniqueness of the logarithmic rate among all corotational
   and non-corotational objective rates. Essential to the attainment of
   this goal is the use of the yielding-stationarity criterion: the
   vanishing of the stress rate implies that the yield function is
   stationary. It is shown that the just-stated criterion is necessary for
   a composite Eulerian rate formulation of finite elastoplasticity to be
   consistent and means that the stress rate must be a corotational rate.
   The main goal of this article is, thus, attained by combining the
   just-stated result and the established result stated before.}},

Abstract = {{A vacuum-tight cell for infrared spectroscopic investigations of
   extremely corrosive melts, e.g., molten fluorides, has been constructed
   and tested up to 750 degrees C. The cell has a gold-lined sample chamber
   and a diamond window transparent for the infrared light. It can be
   furnished with a gold piston that enables the recording of
   short-pathlength FTIR spectra of liquid samples. Solutions of Nb(V) in
   LiF-NaF-KF eutectic (FLINAK) with and without oxide additions have been
   investigated by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. The presence of NbE72-,
   NbOF52-, and NbO2F43- complexes was established in the molten state at
   600 degrees C. After solidification NbF72- was still the only Nb(V)
   all-fluoro complex present. Three oxofluoro complexes, NbOF63-, NbOF52-,
   and NbO2F43-, have been identified in the solid state. Typical frequency
   regions for the different complexes are established. Finally, it was
   shown that K2NbF7 can be used as an indicator to determine the oxide
   content of the sample melts.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that the parasite Toxoplasma gondii manipulates
   the behaviour of its intermediate rat host in order to increase its
   chance of being predated by cats, its feline definitive host, thereby
   ensuring the completion of its life cycle. Here we report that, although
   rats have evolved anti-predator avoidance of areas with signs of cat
   presence, T. gondii's manipulation appears to alter the rat's perception
   of cat predation risk, ill some cases turning their innate aversion into
   an imprudent attraction. The selectivity of such behavioural changes
   suggests that this ubiquitous parasite subtly alters the brain of its
   intermediate host to enhance predation rate whilst leaving other
   behavioural categories and general health intact. This is in contrast to
   the gross impediments frequently characteristic of many other
   host-parasite systems. We discuss our results in terms of their
   potential implications both for the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis and
   the neurological basis of anxiety and cognitive processes in humans and
   other mammals.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral metallacrowns have been fused into layers using neutral copper
   benzoate paddlewheel dimers and nitrate anions to link each 12-MC-4
   molecule. The solid contains approximately 9 Angstrom channels that are
   filled with solvent and a benzoic acid guest. A related chain structure
   that is generated by connecting metallacrowns with the copper dimer, but
   which does not have nitrate bridges in the second dimension, also has
   channels of similar size. These observations suggest a generalizable
   strategy for the preparation of microporous chiral solids in bulk

Abstract = {{Temperature dependence of fluorescence spectra of Cr4+ in an aluminate
   glass in the range of 1.2-1.6 mu m was investigated from 15 to 300 K.
   The emission spectra were broadband centered at about 1.3 mu m, wider
   than 200 nm width. The emission intensity drastically increased with
   decreasing temperature and that of 15 K was 20 times larger than that of
   300 K. The bandwidth and mean energy of the emission band changed very
   slightly with temperature. The emission of Cr4+ in the glass fiber is
   expected as a tunable laser source and a broadband amplifier for the
   wavelength-division-multiplexed telecommunication. (C) 2000 American

Abstract = {{Granular potato starch and amylopectin potato starch were methylated to
   molar substitutions (MS) up to 0.29. Extensive alyha-amylase digestion
   gave mixtures of partially methylated oligomers. Precipitation of larger
   fragments by methanol yielded mainly alpha-limit dextrins (84-99\%).
   Methanol precipitates were extensively digested with beta-amylase
   yielding alpha,beta-limit dextrins. The average substitution level of
   branched glucose residues in the dextrins thus obtained was determined
   after per deuteriomethylation by using FAB mass spectrometry, and
   compared with that of the linearly linked glucose residues. The present
   work demonstrates that methylation does not show any preference for
   substitution at either branched or linearly linked glucose residues,
   taking into account the inherently lower amount of substitution sites at
   branched residues. The results corroborate earlier studies wherein it
   was found that substituents in branched regions are distributed almost
   randomly. In addition, the data enable the determination of the average
   degree of branching of partially methylated dextrins. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The preparation, X-ray structure, and detailed physical characterization
   are presented for a new type of single-molecule magnet
   {[}Mn-4(O2CMe)(2)(pdmH)(6)](ClO4)(2) (1). Complex 1 . 2MeCN . Et2O
   crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1, with cell dimensions at
   130 K of a = 11.914(3) Angstrom, b = 15.347(4) Angstrom, c = 9.660(3)
   Angstrom, alpha = 104.58(1)degrees, beta = 93.42(1)degrees, gamma =
   106.06(1)degrees and Z = 1. The cation lies on an inversion center and
   consists of a planar Mn-4 rhombus that is mixed-valent,
   (Mn2Mn2II)-Mn-III The pdmH(-) ligands (pdmH(2) is
   pyridine-2,6-dimethanol) function as either bidentate or tridentate
   ligands. The bridging between Mn atoms is established by either a
   deprotonated oxygen atom of a pdmH- ligand or an acetate ligand. The
   solvated complex readily loses all acetonitrile and ether solvate
   molecules to give complex 1, which with time becomes hydrated to give 1
   . 2.5H(2)O. Direct current and alternating current magnetic
   susceptibility data are given for 1 and 1 2.5B20 and indicate that the
   desolvated complex has a S = 8 ground state, whereas the hydrated 1 .
   2.5H(2)O has a S = 9 ground state. Ferromagnetic interactions between
   Mn-III-Mn-II and Mn-III-Mn-III pairs result in parallel spin alignments
   of the S = (5)/(2) Mn-II and S = 2 Mn-III ions. High-frequency EPR
   spectra were run for complex 1 . 2.5H(2)O at frequencies of 218, 328,
   and 436 GHz in the 4.5-30 K range. A magnetic-field-oriented
   polycrystallite sample was employed. Fine structure is clearly seen in
   this parallel-field EPR spectrum. The transition fields were
   least-squares-fit to give g = 1.99, D = -0.451 K, and B(4)degrees =2.94
   x 10(-5) K for the S = 9 ground state of 1 . 2.5H(2)O. A molecule with a
   large-spin ground state with D < 0 can function as a single-molecule
   magnet, as detected by techniques such as ac magnetic susceptibility.
   Out-of-phase ac signals (chi''(M)) were seen for complexes 1 and 1 .
   2.5H(2)O to show that these complexes are single-molecule magnets. A
   sample of 1 was studied by ac susceptibility in the 0.4-6.4 K range with
   the ac field oscillating at frequencies in the 1.1-1000 Hz range. A
   single peak in chi''(M) VS temperature plots was seen for each
   frequency; the temperature of the chi''(M) peak varies from 2.03 K at
   995 Hz to 1.16 K at 1.1 Hz. Magnetization relaxation rates were
   evaluated in this way. An Arrhenius plot gave an activation energy of
   17.3 K, which, as expected, is less than the 22.4 K value calculated for
   the thermodynamic barrier for magnetization direction reversal for an S
   = 8 complex with D = -0.35 K. The 1 . 2.5H(2)O complex with an S = 9
   ground state has its chi{''}(M) peaks at higher temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{A Boolean function is called k-convex if for any pair x,y of its true
   points at Hamming distance at most k, every point ``between{''} x and y
   is also true. Given a set of true points and a set of false points, the
   central question of Logical Analysis of Data is the study of those
   Boolean functions whose values agree with those of the given points. In
   this paper we examine data sets which admit k-convex Boolean extensions.
   We provide polynomial algorithms for finding a k-convex extension, if
   any, and for finding the maximum k for which a k-convex extension
   exists. We study the problem of uniqueness, and provide a polynomial
   algorithm for checking whether all k-convex extensions agree in a point
   outside the given data set. We estimate the number of k-convex Boolean
   functions, and show that for small k this number is doubly exponential.
   On the other hand, we also show that for large k the class of k-convex
   Boolean functions is PAC-learnable. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{We propose an interconnection structure for multicomputer networks,
   called recursive circulant. Recursive circulant G(N, d) is defined to be
   a circulant graph with N nodes and jumps of powers of d. G(N, d) is node
   symmetric, and has some strong hamiltonian properties. G(N, d) has
   recursive structure when N = cd(m), 1 less than or equal to c < d. We
   develop a shortest-path routing algorithm in G(cd(m),d), and analyze
   various network metrics of G(cd(m),d) such as connectivity, diameter,
   mean internode distance, and visit ratio. G(2(m),4), whose degree is m,
   compares favorably to the hypercube Q(m). G(2(m),4) has the maximum
   possible connectivity, and its diameter is {[}(3m - 1)/4]. Recursive
   circulants have interesting relationship with hypercubes in terms of
   embedding. We present expansion one embeddings among recursive
   circulants and hypercubes, and analyze the costs associated with each

Abstract = {{Based on the law of mass action (and its microscopic foundation) and
   mass conservation, we present here a method to derive consistent dynamic
   models for the time evolution of systems with an arbitrary number of
   species. Equations are derived through a mechanistic description,
   ensuring that all parameters have ecological meaning. After discussing
   the biological mechanisms associated to the logistic and Lotka-Volterra
   equations, we show how to derive general models for trophic chains,
   including the effects of internal states at fast time scales. We show
   that conformity with the mass action law leads to different functional
   forms for the Lotka-Volterra and trophic chain models. We use mass
   conservation to recover the concept of carrying capacity for an
   arbitrary food chain. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The protein catalytic subunit of telomerase (TERT) is a reverse
   transcriptase (RT) that utilizes an internal RNA molecule as a template
   for the extension of chromosomal DNA ends. In all retroviral RTs there
   is a conserved tyrosine two amino acids preceding the catalytic aspartic
   acids in motif C, a motif that is critical for catalysis, In TERTs,
   however, this position is a leucine, valine, or phenylalanine, We
   developed and characterized a robust in vitro reconstitution system for
   Tetrahymena telomerase and tested the effects of amino acid
   substitutions on activity. Substitution of the retroviral-like tyrosine
   in motif C did not change overall enzymatic activity but increased
   processivity, This increase in processivity correlated with an increased
   affinity for telomeric DNA primer. Substitution of an alanine did not
   increase processivity, while substitution of a phenylalanine had an
   intermediate effect. The data suggest that this amino acid is involved
   in interactions with the primer in telomerase as in other RTs, and show
   that mutating an amino acid to that conserved in retroviral RTs makes
   telomerase more closely resemble these other RTs.}},

Abstract = {{Counter-current chromatography is a real liquid-liquid chromatography.
   The retention volume of the solute can be calculated from the batch
   distribution ratio in organic separations. In the separations of metal
   ion, there are several complex and dissociation reactions involved in
   the two phases, and the retention volume cannot be always predicted from
   the batch distribution ratio. A mass transfer model is proposed in this
   paper and an expression of V-R is derived. The retention volume of metal
   ion is determined not only by the batch distribution ratio but also by
   the mechanism of the extraction reaction. When 25\%
   dihexyl-N,N-diethylcarbamoyl methylenephosphonate in cyclohexane is used
   as stationary phase and 2.91 mol/l HNO3 as mobile phase, the dynamic
   distribution ratios obtained from the chromatogram are not equal to but
   proportional to the batch distribution coefficients. These results are
   in agreement with the theoretical expression. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels an expressed in neurones and greatly
   influence neuronal activity by activating Ca2+-dependent K+ channels.
   The whole cell patch-clamp technique was used to compare the kinetic and
   pharmacological properties of voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents in two
   groups of sympathetic neurones identified by the fluorescent tracer Fast
   Blue: putative muscular sympathetic neurones (MSN) and putative
   cutaneous sympathetic neurones (CSN). The tracer was injected into the
   muscular part of the diaphragm (to mark MSN) and into the skin of the
   ear (to mark CSN). The capacitance of MSN (23.0 pF) was larger than the
   capacitance of CSN (12.6 pF). The maximum current in MSN (1.3 nA) was
   also larger than in CSN (0.93 nA). However, the current density was
   larger in CSN (77.3 pA/pF) than in MSN (57.7 pA/pF) and the current
   activation rate was faster in CSN (0.27 nA/ms) than in MSN (0.19 nA/ms).
   V-1/2 and slope factors of activation and inactivation were not
   significantly different for MSN and CSN. The majority of Ca2+ current
   was available for activation in both categories of neurones at resting
   membrane potential. Ca2+ currents in MSN and CSN were blocked by
   nifedipine (7.0 and 3.6\%. respectively), omega-Agatoxin-IVA (23.0 and
   25.6\%, respectively) and omega-conotoxin-GVIA (67.0 and 65.1\%,
   respectively). We found that CSN are twice as small, have higher Ca2+
   current density and their Ca2+ activation rate is faster in comparison
   to MSN. Such properties may lead to faster rise of Ca2+ concentration in
   the cytoplasm of the CSN comparing to MSN and more effectively dampen
   their activity due to more effective activation of Ca2+-dependent K+
   current. Both kinds of neurones express high proportion of N and P/Q
   Ca2+ current. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagellar adhesion between
   gametes of opposite mating types leads to rapid cellular changes, events
   collectively termed gamete activation, that prepare the gametes for
   cell-cell fusion, As is true for gametes of most organisms, the cellular
   and molecular mechanisms that underlie gamete activation are poorly
   understood. Here we report on the regulated movement of a newly
   identified protein kinase, Chlamydomonas aurora/Ipl1p-like protein
   kinase (CALK), from the cell body to the flagella during gamete
   activation. CALK encodes a protein of 769 amino acids and is the newest
   member of the aurora/Ipl1p protein kinase family. Immunoblotting with an
   anti-CALK antibody showed that CALK was present as a 78/80-kDa doublet
   in vegetative cells and unactivated gametes of both mating types and was
   localized primarily in cell bodies. In cells undergoing fertilization,
   the 78-kDa CALK was rapidly targeted to the flagella, and within 5 min
   after mixing gametes of opposite mating types, the level of CALK in the
   flagella began to approach levels normally found in the cell body,
   Protein synthesis was not required for targeting, indicating that the
   translocated CALK and the cellular molecules required for its movement
   are present in unactivated gametes. CALK was also translocated to the
   flagella during flagellar adhesion of nonfusing mutant gametes,
   demonstrating that cell fusion was not required for movement. Finally,
   the requirement for flagellar adhesion could be bypassed; incubation of
   cells of a single mating type in dibutyryl cAMP led to CALK
   translocation to flagella in gametes but not vegetative cells. These
   experiments document a new event in gamete activation in Chlamydomonas
   and reveal the existence of a mechanism for regulated translocation of
   molecules into an intact flagellum.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine the environmental regulation of
   flower initiation and subsequent development in heliotrope (Heliotropium
   aborescens L. cv. Marine). Five experiments were conducted, two examined
   whether flowering could be advanced by cool temperatures. The duration
   of cool temperature required to induce rapid flowering was also
   investigated. The final three experiments examined the effects of light
   integral, photoperiod and temperature on flower initiation and
   development.
   It was found that plants grown for 9 days at 10 degrees C and than
   transferred to 20 degrees C flowered significantly earlier (first
   flowering recorded after 55 days) than plants held constantly at 20
   degrees C (65.9 days to flowering). Plants grown at a constant
   temperature of 20 degrees C had significantly more leaves than all other
   treatments. This suggested that `cool' temperatures, prior to
   initiation, advanced flowering. In a transfer experiment, plants were
   moved from 10 to 20 degrees C at 3 days intervals post-pinching.
   Earliest flowering (by 20 days compared to the 20 degrees C constant
   treatment) occurred when plants were exposed to 10 degrees C for 9 days
   and then transferred to 20 degrees C.
   Photoperiod was shown to have no effect on either flower bud initiation
   or development (postinitiation). Both temperature and light integral
   strongly influenced flower development post-flower bud initiation.
   However, the response to temperature plotted in terms of the reciprocal
   of days to flowering was non-linear. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper dealt with a simple and efficient method for separating a
   mixture of different series of ionic, high polar, and hydrophilic
   conjugates of bile acids by high-performance ion-pair chromatography
   (HPIPC) with a new volatile ion-pair chromatographic reagent,
   di-n-butylamine acetate (DBAA), as a mobile phase additive. The
   substrates examined included eleven different classes of C-24 glycine-
   or taurine-amidated, 3-sulfated, 3-glucosylated,
   3-N-acetylglucosaminidated, and 3-glucuronidated conjugates of cholic,
   chenodeoxychoric, urosodeoxycholic, and deoxycholic acids, as well as
   their double-conjugated forms. The anionic conjugated bile acids were
   chromatographed on a C-18 reversed-phase ion-pair column, eluting with
   methanol-water (65:35, v/v) containing 5 mM of DBAA. as a counter ion.
   Satisfactory chromatographic separation and column performance were
   attained by DBAA, compared with conventionally used non-volatile
   tetra-n-butylammonium phosphate. The present HPIPC method with DBAA
   provides an insight into the separation and structural elucidation of
   these biologically important bile acid conjugates and may be proved to
   be applied to HPLC-mass spectrometric analysis. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{History and clinical findings: A 67 year old female patient presented
   herself to our emergency roam with paraesthesia in both hands, chronic
   diarrhea and continuous weight loss. From the past medical history, only
   an autoimmune hypothyroidism was known. On initial, examination leading
   features were carpopedal spasms and a pulse deficit. Her general
   condition, especially the nutritional status was low.
   Investigations: Serum levels of potassium (2.2 mmol/l) and calcium (1.45
   mmol/l) were low, as well as the levels of total protein (5.1 g/dl) and
   albumin (2.94 g/dl). Clotting time was prolonged (Quick 51\%). The ECG
   showed a ventricular bigeminus and a prolonged QT-period (120\% rel).
   Endoscopy and biopsy showed a total villous atrophy suggesting celiac
   disease as probable cause. This was emphasized by the high antibody
   levels against gliadin (1:80) and endomyosin (1:40). Furthermore, the
   Human Leukocyte Antigen molecules HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3 showed increased
   expression.
   Treatment and course: After normalizing the electrolyte imbalance
   intravenously the neurological symptoms disappeared as well as the
   arrythmia. The QT-period went back to normal. Under initial drip feeding
   and a strict gluten-free diet the general condition improved quickly and
   the diarrhea stopped. A followup investigation 3 months later showed the
   woman in a good condition having gained 10 kg weight and an improvement
   in histological findings, so that diagnosis of celiac disease could be
   proved.
   Conclusions:The possibility of ventricular arrhythmia and a prolonged
   QT-period in the ECC should be taken into account for patients diagnosed
   with celiac disease, especially in case of electrolyte imbalance. In
   these cases addition to a strict gluten free diet a rapid correction of
   the electrolyte imbalance is necessary because of the risk of sudden
   cardiac death. Furthermore associated disorders like autoimmune diseases
   expressing the same HLA-antigens (HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3) must be
   considered. Combined incidence of celiac disease and autoimmune
   hypothyroidism is well documented. For patients with celiac disease we
   therefore recommend a routine testing of thyroid hormone levels.}},

Abstract = {{RSKB, a 90-kDa ribosomal S6 protein kinase family (RSK) member with two
   complete catalytic domains connected by a linker, is activated through
   p38- and ERK-mitogen-activated protein kinases, The N-terminal kinases
   of RSKs phosphorylate substrates; activation requires phosphorylation of
   linker and C-terminal kinase sites. Unlike other RSKs, the activation
   loop phosphorylation sites of both catalytic domains of RSKB, Ser(196)
   and Thr(568), were required for activity. RSKB activation depended on
   phosphorylation of linker Ser(343) and Ser(360) and associated with
   phosphorylation of nonconserved Ser(347), but Ser(347)-deficient RSKB
   retained partial activity. The known protein kinase A and protein kinase
   C inhibitors, H89 and Ro31-8220, blocked RSKB activity. Treatment of
   HeLa cells with tumor necrosis factor, epidermal growth factor, phorbol
   12-myristate 13-acetate, and ionomycin but not: with insulin resulted in
   strong activation of endogenous RSKB, High RSKB activity and
   Ser(347)/Ser(360) phosphorylation persisted for 3 h in tumor necrosis
   factor-treated cells, in contrast to the short bursts of p38, ERK, and
   RSK1-3 activities. In conclusion, a variety of stimuli induced
   phosphorylation and activation of RSKB through both p38 and ERK
   pathways; the persistence of activation indicated that RSKB selectively
   escaped cell mechanisms causing rapid deactivation of upstream p38 and
   ERK and other RSKs.}},

Abstract = {{We have identified a rice gene encoding a DNA-binding protein that
   specifically recognizes the telomeric repeat sequence TTTAGGG found in
   plants. This gene, which we refer to as RTBP1 (rice telomere-binding
   protein 1), encodes a polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 70
   kDa, RTBP1 is ubiquitously expressed in various organs and binds DNA
   with two or more duplex TTTAGGG repeats. The predicted protein sequence
   includes a single domain at the C terminus with extensive homology to
   Myb-like DNA binding motif, The Myb-like domain of RTBP1 is very closely
   related to that of other telomere-binding proteins, including TRF1,
   TRF2, Taz1p, and Tbf1p, indicating that DNA-binding domains of
   telomere-binding proteins are well conserved among evolutionarily
   distant species. To obtain precise information on the sequence of the
   DNA binding site recognized by RTBP1, we analyzed the sequence-specific
   binding properties of the isolated Myb-like domain of RTBP1. The
   isolated Myb-like domain was capable of sequence-specific DNA binding as
   a homodimer, Gel retardation analysis with a series of mutated telomere
   probes revealed that the internal GGGTTT sequence in the two-telomere
   repeats is critical for binding of Myb-like domain of RTBP1, which is
   consistent with the model of the TRF1 DNA complex showing that
   base-specific contacts are made within the sequence GGGTTA. To the best
   of our knowledge, RTBP1 is the first cloned gene in which the product is
   able to bind double-stranded telomeric DNA in plants. Because the
   Myb-like domain appears to be a significant motif for a large class of
   proteins that bind the duplex telomeric DNA, RTBP1 may play important
   roles in plant telomere function in vivo.}},

Title = {{Hypocapnic constriction in rabbit basilar artery in vitro: triggering by
   N-G-monomethyl-L-arginine monoacetate and dependence on endothelin-1 and

Abstract = {{This study tested whether hypocapnic constriction of the rabbit basilar
   artery in vitro can be triggered by a nitric oxide (NO) synthase
   inhibitor, and whether the resulting constriction is (1) due to the
   alkaline pH associated with hypocapnia, and (2) endothelin-l mediated.
   Hypocapnic (25 mM NaHCO3; pH 7.76; pCO(2) 14.2) or isocapnic alkaline
   solution (50 mM NaHCO3; pH 7.73; pCO(2) 35.0) rarely altered basal
   tension. N-G-monomethyl-L-arginine monoacetate (L-NMMA; 0.1 mM)
   challenge in hypocapnic or isocapnic alkaline solution resulted in near
   maximal tension that was maintained for 2-2.5 h even following L-NMMA
   washout. L-NMMA challenge in normal solution (25 mM NaHCO3; pH 7.42;
   pCO(2) 36.9) also induced near maximal tension, although the tension was
   maintained for only 25 min (mean). Ac-D-Bhg-L-Leu-Asp-L-Ile-L-Ile-L-Trp
   (PD145065), homopiperidinyl-CO-leu-D-Trp(CHO)-D-Trp (BQ610), and
   N-cis-2,6-dimethyl-piperidinocarbonyl L-gamma-MeLeu-D-Trp (COOCH3)-Nle
   (B4788; 1-3 mu M), endothelin ETA/ETB, endothelin ETA, and endothelin
   ETB receptor antagonists, respectively, completely relaxed the tension
   that resulted from L-NMMA challenge in hypocapnic or isocapnic alkaline
   solution. These results demonstrate that constriction due to hypocapnia
   in vitro can be triggered by an NO synthase inhibitor and is
   endothelin-1 mediated. Additionally, alkaline pH in the absence of
   decreased pCO(2) is sufficient to elicit the constriction. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{p53 transcription factor is mutated in most skin cell carcinomas and in
   more than 50\% of all human malignancies, One of its transcriptional
   targets is MDM2, which in turn down-regulates p53, The role of the
   p53/MDM2 regulatory loop upon genotoxic stress is well documented, but
   less is known about its role in normal tissue homeostasis. We have
   explored this pathway during the different transitions of the human
   epidermal differentiation programme and after isolating stem cells,
   transit amplifying cells or differentiating cells from epidermis,
   Maximum expression of p53 was found in proliferating keratinocytes. A
   striking and transient induction of MDM2 and a down-modulation of p53
   characterized the transition from proliferation to differentiation in
   primary human keratinocytes. These changes were delayed in late
   differentiating carcinoma cells, and were clearly different in suspended
   primary fibroblasts. Interestingly, these changes correlated with an
   increase in cell size, at the time of irreversible commitment to
   differentiation. Induction of MDM2 was also associated with suppression
   of proliferation in normal, or hyperproliferative, psoriatic epidermis,
   Moreover, both proteins were induced as keratinocytes mere driven to
   leave the stem cell compartment by c-Myc activation, Overall, our
   results show a critical regulation of the p53/MDM2 pathway at the
   epidermal transition from proliferation to differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{The packaging of the eukaryotic genome in chromatin presents barriers
   that restrict the access of enzymes that process DNA(1,2). To overcome
   these barriers, cells possess a number of multi-protein, ATP-dependent
   chromatin remodelling complexes, each containing an ATPase subunit from
   the SNF2/SWI2 superfamily(3,4). Chromatin remodelling complexes function
   by increasing nucleosome mobility and are clearly implicated in
   transcription(5-7). Here we have analysed SNF2/SWI2- and ISWI-related
   proteins to identify remodelling complexes that potentially assist other
   DNA transactions. We purified a complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae
   that contains the Ino80 ATPase(8). The INO80 complex contains about 12
   polypeptides including two proteins related to the bacterial RuvB DNA
   helicase(9-11), which catalyses branch migration of Holliday junctions.
   The purified complex remodels chromatin, facilitates transcription in
   vitro and displays 3' to 5' DNA helicase activity. Mutants of ino80 show
   hypersensitivity to agents that cause DNA damage, in addition to defects
   in transcription(8). These results indicate that chromatin remodelling
   driven by the Ino80 ATPase may be connected to transcription as well as
   DNA damage repair.}},

Abstract = {{Coronal structures of the micelles spontaneously formed in water by
   poly(ethylene oxide)-b-polybutadiene (PEO-PB) were investigated using
   small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Selective deuterium labeling of
   the hydrophobic PB block was employed to enhance the neutron scattering
   contrast between the PEO and PB segments for subsequent structural
   characterization of their micelles. Analyses of the core- and
   corona-contrast SANS data based on the intramicellar interference
   factors led to determination of the segment density profiles of the
   micellar PEO brushes. Both spherical and cylindrical brushes proved to
   have coronal layers that are best described in form by a concave
   concentration profile. The results are consistent with the view that the
   PEO segments, despite favorable interactions with water molecules, are
   significantly accumulated near the hydrophobic interface, possibly due
   to the effect of the strong incompatibility of PB and water.}},

Abstract = {{Five Lewis(y)-based glycopeptide anti-cancer vaccine candidates have
   been designed and synthesized to target tumor-associated cell-surface
   glycoprotein antigens and to improve the immunizing performance in
   comparison to related vaccines. The peptide backbone consisted of two
   regions, a glycodomain AcNH-SSS-and a nonglycosylated sequence,-AVAV-.
   The resultant glycopeptide was conjugated, via an additional spacer, to
   the lipid carrier PamCysSer. In this series of totally synthetic
   molecular vaccine candidates, one or three of the sequentially arranged
   serine residues were glycosylated. Furthermore, the Le(y)
   tetrasaccharide determinant region was kept constant while the internal
   glycan core was systematically varied. Glycal assembly was used to
   prepare the glycosyl donors, and two strategies were applied to provide
   the serine-O-linked polysaccharide domains. In the first approach, a
   protected serine derivative was attached directly to the fully
   elaborated glycan. Following this course, both alpha- and beta-Ser
   derivatives were accessed. In the second route, a GalNAc-alpha-Ser was
   joined with a glycosyl donor to afford exclusively the desired
   a-serine-linked product. The glycopeptides were assembled using
   iterative solution phase peptide coupling. Following global
   deprotection, the lipid carrier was then coupled to the glycopeptide,
   resulting in the targeted constructs. The synthesis of these molecular
   vaccine candidates constitutes an important advance that should enable
   rationalization of carbohydrate-induced immune response as well as
   identification of optimal Le(y)-based anti-cancer vaccine leads.}},

Title = {{Quantitative stereochemical analysis of a reagent that exhibits
   asymmetric amplification, B-chlorodiisopinocampheylborane (Dip-Cl)}},

Abstract = {{We show that complexation of B-chlorodiisopinocampheylborane (Dip-Cl)
   with 8-hydroxyquinoline results in an air- and moisture-stable complex.
   Using enantiomerically pure (+)-alpha-pinene, the (+,+)-Dip-quinoline
   complex, {[}(+)-C10H17](2)B(eta(2)-N,O-C10H6NO), was isolated and
   characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic methods. When Dip-Cl
   is prepared from enantiomerically impure (+)-alpha-pinene a mixture of
   heterochiral, (+,-)-Dip-Cl, and homochiral, (+,+)-Dip-Cl and
   (-,-)-Dip-Cl, stereoisomers are formed. We have developed the
   8-hydroxyquinoline complexation method for quantification of these
   stereoisomers by chiral HPLC. Since this is the first quantitative
   analysis of a reagent that exhibits asymmetric amplification, it enables
   us to verify part of Kagan's model for this phenomenon and evaluate the
   terms beta and K which are measures of the relative amounts of
   stereoisomers. Our analysis shows that there is a preference for the
   formation of the heterochiral (+,-)-Dip-Cl isomer; therefore, the
   stereoisomers are not statistically distributed. This is beneficial for
   the asymmetric amplification process because it causes the heterochiral
   diastereomer to absorb the minor (-)-alpha-pinene enantiomer, thereby
   increasing the effective concentration of (+,+)-Dip-Cl that is formed
   from (+)-alpha-pinene. We also studied the distribution of stereoisomers
   as a function of the preparation temperature of the Dip-Cl reagent (0,
   10, 20 degrees C). Increasing the preparation temperature increases the
   relative amounts of the homochiral stereoisomers, suggesting that the
   activation energy for the formation of the homochiral isomers is greater
   than for the heterochiral isomer. Thus, at higher preparation
   temperatures greater amounts of (-,-)-Dip-Cl are formed from
   (-)-alpha-pinene. However, there is a surprising benefit as higher
   levels of asymmetric induction are observed, especially when low
   enantiomeric purity a-pinene is used. In addition, the reduction
   reactions proceed slightly faster when Dip-Cl is prepared at higher
   temperature. In sum, the complexation of Dip-Cl with 8-hydroxyquinoline
   and subsequent analysis by chiral HPLC provides considerable insight
   into the asymmetric amplification process observed with this reagent.
   Moreover, we have shown how the conditions used for the preparation of
   the reagent affect the asymmetric amplification process.}},

Year = {{2000}},

Abstract = {{We recently developed a simple and inexpensive method that complements
   established bone histomorphometry procedures by enabling the
   two-dimensional imaging of cancellous hone to be viewed within its
   three-dimensional contest with the marrow tissue in place and without
   detriment to the material for other histological purposes. The method,
   based on the preparation and superficial staining of slices 300 mu m
   thick, enables ``real{''} (i.e., unstained) trahecular termini to be
   separated from ``artifactual{''} (i.e., stained) termini, providing a
   direct measure of cancellous connectivity in osteopenic bone. The
   technique was applied to osteopenic age-matched, white, postmenopausal
   women (31 with and 22 without vertebral compression fractures) with a
   similar bone status, as measured at the spine by absorptiometry and at
   the iliac crest by histology (see part I of this study), Despite the
   similarity in the mass of trahecular bone at either site, the results
   showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) in the number of ``real{''}
   trabecular termini between the groups, such that the fracture group had
   almost four times as many termini (mean +/- SE: 1.98 +/- 0.51/30 mm(2))
   at the iliac crest as the nonfracture group (mean a SE: 0.53 +/- 0.31/30
   mm(2)). Previous histornorphometry of the same material failed to detect
   a structural distinction between the two groups using established
   variables. It was concluded that a mass-independent trabecular
   discontinuity contributes to skeletal failure and that determination of
   the number of ``real{''} disconnections (i.e., unstained termini) by the
   direct method proposed may provide a more sensitive discriminant of
   fracture than the present indirect procedures. A group of fracture and
   nonfracture men (see part I) suggested a similar distinction (fracture:
   0.69 +/- 0.30/30 mm(2); nonfrarture: 0.18 +/- 0.18/30 mm(2)), although
   the difference was not significant, (C) 2000 by Elsevier Science Inc.

Title = {{Association of intraoperative transcranial Doppler monitoring variables
   with stroke from carotid endarterectomy}},
Journal = {{STROKE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-The outcomes of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) are,
   in addition to patient baseline characteristics, highly dependent on the
   safety of the surgical procedure. During the successive stages of the
   operation, transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring of the middle cerebral
   artery (MCA) was used to assess the association of cerebral
   microembolism and hemodynamic changes with stroke and stroke-related
   death.
   Methods-By use of data pooled from 2 hospitals in the United States and
   the Netherlands, including 1058 patients who underwent CEA, the
   association of various TCD emboli and velocity variables with operative
   stroke and stroke-related death was evaluated by univariable and
   multivariable logistic regression analyses in combination with receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. The impact of basic
   patient characteristics, such as age, sex, preoperative cerebral
   symptoms, and ipsilateral and contralateral internal carotid artery
   stenosis, on the prediction of operative stroke was also evaluated.
   Results-We observed 31 patients with ischemic and 8 patients with
   hemorrhagic operative strokes. Four of these patients died. Emboli
   during dissection (odds ratio {[}OR] 1.5, 95\% CI 0.8 to 2.9) and wound
   closure (OR 2.3, 95\% CI 1.2 to 4.4) as well as greater than or equal to
   90\% decrease of MCA peak systolic velocity at cross-clamping (OR 3.3,
   95\% CI 1.3 to 8.5) and greater than or equal to 100\% increase of the
   pulsatility index of the Doppler signal at clamp release (OR 7.1, 95\%
   CI 1.4 to 35.7) were independently associated with stroke. The ROC area
   of this model was 0.69. Of the patient characteristics, only
   preoperative cerebral ischemia (OR 1.9, 95\% CI 1.0 to 3.7) and greater
   than or equal to 70\% ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis (OR
   0.5, 95\% CI 0.2 to 0.9) were associated with stroke. Adding these
   patient characteristics to the model, the area under the ROC curve
   increased to 0.73.
   Conclusions-In CEA, TCD-detected microemboli during dissection and wound
   closure, greater than or equal to 90\% MCA velocity decrease at
   cross-clamping, and greater than or equal to 100\% pulsatility index
   increase at clamp release are associated with operative stroke. In
   combination with the presence of preoperative cerebral symptoms and
   greater than or equal to 70\% ipsilateral internal carotid artery
   stenosis, these 4 TCD monitoring variables reasonably discriminate
   between patients with and without operative stroke. This supports the
   use of TCD as a potential intraoperative monitoring modality to alter
   the surgical technique by enhancing a decrease of the risk of stroke
   during or immediately after the operation.}},

Abstract = {{High-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of the bladder is a rare malignant
   turner with poor prognosis. We present the cytomorphologic features of
   six retrospectively identified cases which displayed high-grade tumors
   with neuroendocrine differentiation in bladder washings. Cytology
   specimens showed small-to-medium-sized tumor cells with powdery
   chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and ill-defined nuclear membranes.
   Tumor fragments showed prominent nuclear molding and single-cell
   necrosis. All cases also revealed a varying proportion of tumor cells
   resembling the usual transitional-cell carcinoma. Biopsy specimens from
   Jive cases demonstrated high-grade transitional-cell carcinoma with
   areas resembling small-cell carcinoma. In one case the entire tumor
   consisted of classic small-cell carcinoma and failed to show any areas
   of transitional-cell differentiation. All cases were positive for
   neuroendocrine markers. Neuroendocrine carcinomas of the urinary bladder
   are rare, with cytological features similar to high-grade neuroendocrine
   carcinomas seen in other organs. They can be accurately diagnosed
   cytologically, and an awareness of the cytomorphologic features is

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare the concentration of non-protein nitrogen (NPN)
   and free amino acids (FAA) in powdered and liquid commercial formulas
   with that in human milk.
   Methods: The non-protein nitrogen and FAAs in pooled breast milk was
   compared with that in 11 protein-modified starting infant formulas
   (seven powdered, four liquid whey-predominant formulas) and one powdered
   soy-formula. Human milk was collected at the end of each feeding
   (hindmilk) over 24 hours in a group of 40 healthy lactating women after
   delivery of full-term infants at age one month.
   Results: In human milk glutamic acid plus glutamine and taurine were the
   prevalent amino acids, accounting for around 50\% total FAA. In the
   analysed formulas the total FAA fraction was 10\% or even less than in
   human milk, mostly represented by taurine, while methionine was high in
   soy formula. The sum of glutamic acid and glutamine in all the formulas
   was much lower than in human milk.
   Conclusions: Breastfed infants are supplied with FAA, mainly glutamic
   acid and glutamine, compared to formula-fed counterparts. The different
   FAA intake might be the origin of some functional differences at the
   enteral level between breast- and formula-fed infants.}},

Abstract = {{We report here that the cyclic GMP-inhibited cyclic AMP specific
   phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) is expressed as a membrane-bound protein in
   clonal insulin-secreting BRIN-BD11 cells. This was shown using SKF94836
   (PDE3 inhibitor) which maximally inhibited membrane-bound cyclic AMP PDE
   activity by similar to 25-30\% and by RT-PCR. We also demonstrated that
   insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) activates PDE3B in BRIN-BD11 cells. We
   therefore evaluated the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and
   p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42/p44 MAPK) pathways in
   regulating this enzyme. We report here that the PI3K inhibitor,
   wortmannin, prevented the IGF-1-dependent stimulation of PDE3B activity.
   In contrast, the inhibitor of MEK-1 activation, PD098059 (which reduced
   IGF-1-stimulated p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation), had no effect on PDE3B
   activation. Furthermore, IGF-1-dependent stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK and
   PDE3B was abolished in serum-deprived cells and this was associated with
   apoptosis. We propose that the deregulation of the PI3K/PDE3B pathway
   might result in increased intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation, which
   promotes apoptosis. This was supported by the finding that the adenylyl
   cyclase activator, forskolin, also induced apoptosis. Finally, we found
   that orthovanadate (a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor) fully
   restored the activation of p42/p44 MAPK in serum-deprived cells, but had
   only a small effect on PDE activity. This confirmed that p42/p44 MAPK is
   on a separate pathway to PDE3B. Therefore, IGF-1-dependent regulation of
   PDE3B may be linked to cell survival through PI3K and not p42/p44 MAPK.

Abstract = {{Poly(o-toluidine) (POT) in emeraldine base form (EB) has been doped with
   picric acid (PA-doped POT) and dinitrophenol (DNP-doped POT). The
   conductivities of these doped polymers were found to be 10.52 and 4.82 x
   10(-3) S cm(-1), respectively. The large difference in conductivity of
   these polymers is attributed to the more acidic nature of picric acid
   (PA) than dinitrophenol (DNP). The disappearance of the peak at similar
   to 650 nm due to EB and the presence of the peak at similar to 850 nm
   due to localized polaron in the absorption spectra clearly reveal the
   dopant-induced protonation of POT. This is also supported from the XPS
   spectrum showing the disappearance of the peak at similar to 398.2 +/-
   0.1 eV due to the imine nitrogen component in EB and the appearance of
   the peak at similar to 402.16 +/- 0.1 eV owing to the iminium ion (-NH+
   =) of PA-doped POT. The PA-doped POT is thermally stable up to 140
   degrees C and completely dedoped at similar to 300 degrees C. The mass
   spectra recorded simultaneously with the thermal weight loss showed
   several fragments due to the decomposition of PA in the temperature
   region from 140 degrees C to 300 degrees C. The observed high
   conductivity of PA-doped POT film is attributed to the expanded
   coil-like conformation, which was proven with the help of the reduced
   viscosity measurement. The composite of PA-doped POT with insulating
   acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS) was prepared, and the
   percolation threshold for this composite was similar to 3 wt.\%, which
   was considerably low compared to that for a typical composite, e.g.,
   similar to 16 vol.\% for poly(3-alkylthiophenes) (P3ATs)/polystyrene
   (PSt) composite. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The incompressible, viscous flow over two-dimensional elliptic airfoils
   oscillating in pitch at large angles of attack, such that flow
   separation occurs, has been simulated numerically for a Reynolds number
   of 3000. A vortex method is used to solve the two-dimensional
   Navier-Stokes equations in vorticity/stream-function form using a
   time-marching approach. Using an operator-splitting method the
   convection and diffusion equations are solved sequentially at each time
   step. The convection equation is solved using a vortex-in-cell method,
   and the diffusion equation using a second-order ADI finite-difference
   scheme. Elliptic profiles are obtained by mapping a circle in a
   computational domain into the physical domain using a Joukowski
   transformation. The effects of several parameters on the how field are
   considered, such as: frequency of oscillation, mean angle of attack,
   location of pitch-axis and the thickness ratio of the ellipse. The
   results obtained are shown to compare favourably with available
   experimental results. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{mu SR and neutron experiments on Sr2.5Ca11.5Cu24O41 single crystal have
   been performed. The time-dependent muon polarization shows a significant
   change at around T-N similar or equal to 2.1 K indicating the onset of
   magnetic long-range order. Considering both the mu SR and neutron
   scattering data, a possible magnetic structure on the chain and ladder
   sites has been proposed. However. the lack of coherent mu SR precession
   signal strongly suggests that the distribution of the internal field is
   not homogeneous. This can be interpreted in line with the scenario that
   the singlet state and antiferromagnetic order coexist at ambient
   pressure and these localized hole pairs begin to move under pressure,
   resulting in the occurrence of superconductivity. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effects of spring-loaded posterior bite-blocks on masticatory
   muscles were investigated to evaluate the correlation between
   masticatory muscles and craniofacial form in long-faced children. The
   appliance was used in 10 subjects (6 girls and 4 boys) with a
   chronological mean age of 10.40 +/- 1.12 years for the treatment of
   skeletal anterior open bite. Electromyographic activity of the anterior
   and posterior temporal and masseter muscles was recorded before and
   after treatment during postural position, maximal biting, chewing,
   swallowing, postural position with the appliance in the mouth, and
   maximal biting with the appliance in the mouth. After treatment,
   increases in SNB and overbite (P < .05, P < .001, respectively) and
   decreases in ANB, SNGoAr, and overjet parameters were found to be
   statistically significant (P < .05, P < .01). When the measurements
   related to muscle activity were examined, increases in anterior temporal
   postural (P < .05), anterior temporal chewing (P < .01), masseter
   chewing (P < .05), posterior temporal chewing (P < .05), and masseter
   swallowing (P < .01) were found to be statistically significant. A
   positive correlation was found between ANB and anterior temporal
   postural and a negative correlation between SNGoAr and masseter
   swallowing. The increase in muscle activities was considered to occur as
   a result of the appliance used.}},

Abstract = {{Field studies were conducted in 1991 and 1992 on a sandy loam soil in

   averaged 16 t ha(-1) and rhizomes contributed 56\% of this. Rhizome
   removal from soil before planting maize significantly increased maize
   yield relative to hoe tillage or slashing of I. cylindrica shoots before
   planting maize. Digging up rhizomes before planting maize and weeding
   the crop twice gave a yield reduction of only 23\% compared with
   weed-free crops with rhizomes removed. Grain yield reduction was 51\% in
   plots where rhizomes were only. fragmented by hoe tillage and the crop
   was weeded twice. Grain yield was 62\% less when maize was grown in
   slashed plots with intact rhizomes that were weeded four times (farmers'
   practice). Slashing without additional weeding resulted in crop failure
   in maize.}},

Abstract = {{Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) accounts for >50\% of the
   registered visual disability among North American and Western European
   populations and has been associated both with environmental factors,
   such as smoking, and with genetic factors. Previously we have reported
   disease-associated variants in the ABCR (also called ABCA4) gene in a
   subset of patients affected with this complex disorder. We have now
   tested our original hypothesis, that ABCR is a dominant susceptibility
   locus for AMD, by screening 1,218 unrelated AMD patients of North
   American and Western European origin and 1,258 comparison individuals
   from 15 centers in North America and Europe for the two most frequent
   AMD-associated variants found in ABCR. These two sequence changes,
   G1961E and D2177N, were found in one allele of ABCR in 40 patients
   (similar to 3.4\%), and in 13 control subjects (similar to 0.95\%).
   Fisher's two-sided exact test confirmed that these two variants are
   associated with AMD at a statistically significant level (P < .0001).
   The risk of AMD is elevated approximately threefold in D2177N carriers
   and approximately fivefold in G1961E carriers. The identification of a
   gene that confers risk of AMD is an important step in unraveling this
   complex disorder.}},

   single-input nonlinear systems in strict feedback form is proposed. The

Abstract = {{Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) were used in this
   study to relate the structural parameters (electronic, topological,
   etc.) to the odor of 27 aliphatic esters previously evaluated by
   Rossiter. Rossiter used the Hansch approach, principal component
   analysis and comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) to predict the
   odor of these esters. Different structural parameters were selected,
   such as topological, physicochemical, and quantum-chemical indices, to
   find an equation to predict the molecular factors that determine the
   fruit odor of these compounds and to compare such results with those
   obtained by Rossiter. Two significant correlation equations were
   obtained with the following molecular descriptors: one with the
   electrotopological-state index related to the carbon atom of the
   carbonyl group (S-C=O), the Kappa index (K-2), and the topological-state
   index related to the oxygen on the alcoholic side of the molecule
   (T-O-), and the other with 2K, S-C=O, and the energy of the highest
   occupied molecular orbital (E-HOMO) The model found had a good
   predictive ability as established by cross-validation r(cv)(2) values
   and thus can he used to help in the prediction of odor of similar
   compounds. This method is simplier than the methods used by Rossiter and
   represents a reliable QSAR alternative in predicting the fruit odor of
   such aliphatic esters.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet, computer networks, and the digital economy have increased
   the demand for reliable and disturbance-free electricity. Banking and
   finance depend on the robustness of electric power, cable, and wireless
   telecommunications. Links between the power grid and telecommunications
   and between electrical power and oil, water, and gas pipelines continue
   to be a linchpin of energy supply networks.
   This strong interdependence means that an action in one part of one
   infrastructure network can rapidly create global effects by cascading
   throughout the same network or into other networks.
   The author explains how the Complex Interactive Network/Systems
   Initiative (CIN/SI), a joint industry-government initiative, is
   developing a mathematical basis and practical tools for improving the
   security, performance, reliability, and robustness of energy, financial,
   telecommunications, and transportation networks. One challenge is to
   develop appropriate models for this degree of complexity and create
   tools that let components adaptively reconfigure the network as needed.}},

Abstract = {{A quantitative estimate of cerebral blood oxygen saturation is of
   critical importance in the investigation of cerebrovascular disease
   because of the fact that it could potentially provide information on
   tissue viability in vivo. In the current study, a multi-echo gradient
   and spin echo magnetic resonance imaging sequence was used to acquire
   images from eight normal volunteer subjects. All images were acquired on
   a Siemens 1.5T Symphony whole-body scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).
   A theoretical signal model, which describes the signal dephasing
   phenomena in the presence of deoxyhemoglobin, was used for
   postprocessing of the acquired images and obtaining a quantitative
   measurement of cerebral blood oxygen saturation in vivo. With a
   legion-of-interest analysis, a mean cerebral blood oxygen saturation of
   58.4\% +/- 1.8\% was obtained in the brain parenchyma from all
   volunteers. It is in excellent agreement with the known cerebral blood
   oxygen saturation under normal physiologic conditions in humans.
   Although further studies are needed to overcome some of the confounding
   factors affecting the estimates of cerebral blood oxygen saturation:
   these preliminary results are encouraging and should open a new avenue
   for the noninvasive investigation of cerebral oxygen metabolism under
   different pathophysiologic conditions using a magnetic resonance imaging

Abstract = {{Absorption of non-polarized light by a uniaxial crystal has been

   and quantitative characteristics of uniaxial crystal absorption spectra.
   Nonpolarized light spectra of alkali nitrate single crystals, both pure
   and doped with thallium, have been studied. It is shown that the
   absorption band at 300 nm is due to two transitions, whose intensities
   depend on temperature in various ways. There is a weak band in a short
   wavelength range of the absorption spectrum of potassium nitrate
   crystal, whose intensity increases with thallium doping. The band
   parameters of alkali nitrate single crystals have been calculated.

Year = {{2000}},

Abstract = {{Background-The interaction of the integrin receptors with their ligands
   (collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and others) has a crucial role during
   the reorganisation of the extracellular matrix and the metastatic
   process. The presence of particular vascular patterns in uveal melanoma
   is associated with the development of metastases. There is some evidence
   that interactions between the tumour cells and the extracellular matrix
   are responsible for the shape of these patterns.
   Methods-The expression of VLA-2, VLA-3, and alpha(V) integrin receptors
   was examined by immunohistochemistry on paraffin embedded tumour
   specimens from 92 uveal melanomas (iris melanomas excluded). Possible
   correlations between these results and the tumour vascular patterns, the
   histological features of the tumours as well as the clinical outcome of
   the patients, were investigated.
   Results-The expression of VLA-2 in tumours was associated with the
   presence of vascular networks (p = 0.05). Tumours with less than 25\%
   VLA-3 positive cells infiltrated the sclera more frequently than those
   with more than 25\% VLA-3 cell positivity (p = 0.05). Tumours expressing
   less than 50\% alpha(V) positive cells were associated with the mixed or
   epithelioid cell type (p = 0.05) and, with less statistical precision,
   with the presence of extraocular growth (p = 0.07). The univariate
   logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of developing
   metastases within the first 5 years after diagnosis did not depend on
   the expression of the integrin receptors investigated.
   Conclusion-The potential biological importance of the associations
   between integrin expression and the histopathological features of the
   tumours found in the present study remains to be elucidated in future
   experiments. The immunohistochemical detection of VLA-2, VLA-3, and
   alpha(V) integrins had no prognostic value in our preliminary report.}},

Abstract = {{This paper amalgamates two topical issues in the economics of commodity
   taxation: the general case for non-uniformity, and the tax treatment of
   commodities that are either inputs to household production or close
   substitutes for household produced goods. Assuming a redistributive
   objective and that the government can implement a non-linear income tax
   system and linear commodity taxes we investigate if the existence of
   household production generates a natural case for non-uniform commodity
   taxation. Four main results are reported. First, when the set of
   commodities is partitioned into consumption goods and input goods, and
   commodity taxes are restricted to being within-group uniform, the
   composite commodity theorem can be used to characterize the optimal
   commodity taxes. Secondly, sufficient conditions for within-group
   uniform commodity taxes to be fully optimal are derived. Thirdly, we
   argue that an input good should be taxed at a higher rate than general
   consumption if and only if the degree of complementarity in household
   production (between the input good and a time-input) is larger than the
   degree of complementarity in consumption (between general consumption
   and the household produced good). Finally, we show that under simple
   normality, a market substitute for the household-produced good should be
   taxed at a lower rate than general consumption. The intuition for the
   last two results is that the suggested pattern of taxation discourages
   ``do-it-yourself{''} behaviour, which relaxes the self-selection
   problem.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To review intracranial hemorrhage originated in the
   subependymal germinal matrix region. Development. Incidence rates of
   germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage (GM IH) range from 20 to
   40\% of infants born before 32 weeks gestational age or with birth
   weight less than 1,500 g. Because the GMH is usually diagnosed during
   the first 72 postnatal hours, that is the optimal time to perform
   ultrasound scans. The pathogenesis of GMH is multifactorial and elated
   to vascular, intravascular and extravascular factors. The grading system
   relies on the detection of blood in the germinal matrix region and into
   the ventricular system. Ultrasound scans are the diagnostic method of
   choice, once it is easy to perform and has low costs. In a prospective
   study of 146 preterm infants (<2,200 g), the incidence of GMH in those
   weighing less than 1,501 g, was.36\%. GMH occurred mainly in the first
   week of life (65\%) and in 70\% of cases was classified as grade I. Risk
   factors found to be related to the GMH,were ere: general anesthesia
   cesarean section,Apgar score below 4 in the first minute or below 8 in
   the fifth minute, low birth weight, the presence of respiratory
   distress, patent ductus arteriosus; anemia, repeated arterial punctions
   and umbilical arterial catheterization. Mean gestational age, systolic
   and diastolic pressure in the first 24 hours of life and hematocrit were
   lower inpatients with GMH. Conclusions. GMH is frequent in the preterm
   infant, and occurs mainly in the first week of life. Ultrasound scans
   are the method of choice for the diagnosis and follow-up. Risk factors
   associated were hypoxia and excessive handling.}},

Abstract = {{Migration inhibitory factor-related protein (MRP)-8 and -14 belong to
   the S-100 protein family and are associated with myeloid cell
   differentiation. MRP is also expressed in some epithelia. However, there
   are few reports for the investigation on carcinomas,
   Using the monoclonal antibody 60B8 against MRP-14, we carried out the
   immunohistochemical evalution of MRP-14 expression in 70 cases of
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and examined the relation to tumor
   differentiation and vascular invasion. Positively stained tumor cells
   were detected in 32 cases, all of which belonged to grade II (7/30) or
   grade III (25/25) of the Edmondson-Steiner classification, In
   particular, the grade III HCC showed a significantly greater positive
   reaction, Immunopositivity in the non-carcinomatous hepatocytes and bile
   duct epithelia was not observed.
   These findings suggested that malignant hepatocytes newly express MRP-14
   and that the neo-expression in differentiated HCC is related to the
   tumor differentiation and shows higher correlation in the poorly
   differentiated carcinomas, Furthermore, the cholangiocellular carcinoma
   and metastatic adenocarcinoma as control materials also presented a more
   marked immunoreactivity for MRP-14 in the poorly differentiated
   carcinomas, in a similar manner with the findings of the HCC,
   Accordingly, MRP is considered to be frequently neo-expressed in poorly
   differentiated carcinomas,
   MRP-14 expression rate in the 48 HCC cases with vascular invasion was
   56\%, showing no significant difference compared with non-invasive
   tumors.}},

Abstract = {{Perorally inoculated budded particles of a nuclear polyhedrosis virus
   was used to infect Bombyx mori (BmNPV) (Lepidoptera; Bombycidae), aided
   by an optical brightener, Tinopal UNPA-GX (Tinopal:). BmNPV budded
   particles not occluded in the occlusion body do not infect successfully
   the host, B. mori, when administered perorally. It was found that
   feeding the host Tinopal enabled perorally delivered BmNPV budded
   particles to infect the host. B. mori larvae ingesting BmNPV budded
   particles (1.3 x 10(6) TCID50 units per larva) after they consumed an
   artificial diet containing 0.3\% Tinopal died of the viral infection.
   Peroral administration of these particles to host larvae with 1\%
   Tinopal also resulted in virus infection. Tinopal is a candidate for
   viral activity enhancing agent promoting viral insecticide infection in
   hosts. The results suggest that B. mori-BmNPV budded particles are
   convenient for detecting viral infection enhancement activity of a
   chemical of interest. Since recombinant baculovirus vectors are
   constructed by replacing the polyhedrin gene with the foreign gene of
   interest, they do nut produce occlusion bodies, i.e. polyhedra. Budded
   particles of a baculovirus vector not occluded in polyhedra cannot
   infect their hosts when administered perorally. The peroral inoculation
   of BmNPV budded particles by Tinopal leads to industrial pharmaceutics
   production using a baculovirus vector for a huge number of insect hosts,
   i.e. an `insect factory'. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Anaerobic muscle metabolism and local release of inflammatory mediators
   play key roles in the mechanism of postfatigue-induced activation of
   group IV muscle afferents. The present study focused on activation of
   these muscle afferents after a 3-min period of low-frequency muscle
   stimulation (LFMS) in different conditions of muscle oxygenation, such
   as occur in patients with respiratory insufficiency and subjects living
   at high altitude, In anesthetized rabbits, spontaneous activity of group
   IV afferents (conduction velocity = 1.52 +/- 0.13 m.s(-1)) from the
   tibialis anterior muscle was recorded at rest (baseline) and then after
   LFMS under normoxic (PaO2 = 113 mmHg), hyperoxic (PaO2 = 186 mmHg), or
   hypoxic (PaO2 = 35 mmHg) conditions. The maximal force decay at the end
   of LFMS did not differ significantly with respect to conditions of
   muscle oxygenation. Compared with normoxia, hypoxia significantly
   increased the baseline activity of group IV muscle afferents, whereas no
   effect was noted when hypoxia followed a period of hyperoxia,
   LFMS-induced activation of group IV afferents occurred in all
   circumstances, except when hypoxia was first tested. The activation of
   group IV muscle afferents after LFMS was markedly reduced when hypoxia
   followed normoxia (+14\% versus +27\%) or hyperoxia (+55\% versus
   +144\%), whereas it was accentuated when hyperoxia followed hypoxia
   (+25\% versus +8\%). We concluded that the sensorimotor control of
   skeletal muscles may be altered during acute hypoxia but facilitated
   after reoxygenation. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear PID (NPID) control is implemented by allowing the controller
   gains to vary as a function of system state. NPID control has been
   previously described and implemented, and recently a constructive
   Lyapunov stability proof has been given. The controllers arising with
   the constructive Lyapunov method will in general depend on knowledge of
   the full state vector. In the present work, NPID controllers that
   operate without knowledge of some state variables are demonstrated A
   general but conservative design method is presented with an experimental
   demonstration. Fora special case, complete necessary and sufficient
   conditions are established;for this case, simulation of a robotic force
   control application demonstrates well-damped control with no requirement
   for a force-rare signal. The extension to cases of partial stare
   knowledge is important for NPID control, which is most practical when
   some stare variables-particularly rare variables-are poorly known,
   confounding full-state feedback or other high-damping linear control
   designs. Extension of NPID control to MIMO systems and computed torque
   control is also shown.}},

Abstract = {{Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of cupric
   citrate (Cu-citrate) relative to cupric sulfate (CuSO4) as a Cu source
   for weanling and grow-finish pigs. In addition, the use of liver and
   bile Cu concentrations as indices of the bioavailability of Cu sources
   was investigated. Experiment one consisted of a nursery phase (35 d;
   initial BW=6.4 kg, final BW=21.4 kg) followed by a grow-finish phase
   (103 d; initial BW-21.5 kg, final BW-111.7 kg). Experiment two only
   consisted of a nursery phase (35 d; initial BW=6.3 kg, final BW-18.6
   kg). Dietary treatments were identical for both experiments and
   consisted of: control (10 ppm CuSO4); control+66 or 225 ppm CuSO4;
   control+33, 66, or 100 ppm Cu-citrate. An antibiotic was included in
   diets for Exp. 1 but not Exp. 2. In both experiments, growth performance
   variables were similar for pigs receiving Cu-citrate and CuSO4; however,
   growth performance was nor improved by high concentrations of CuSO4.
   Liver and bile Cu were increased (p<0.05) by 225 ppm CuSO4; however,
   lower dietary concentrations of Cu from either CuSO4 or Cu-citrate did
   nor affect the Cu concentration of liver or bile relative to that
   observed in the control pigs. Irrespective of Cu source, there was no
   linear (p>0.10) increase in plasma Cu with increasing Cu concentrations
   in the diet for both experiments. However, the plasma Cu concentrations
   were highest (p<0.10) in pigs receiving diets supplemented with 225 ppm
   CuSO4. Sixteen randomly chosen pigs per treatment in Exp. 1 were
   continued through the grow-finish phase. Body weight gain and feed
   intake were improved (p<0.10) by 66 ppm CuSO4, but other dietary Cu
   treatments did not alter pig performance compared to the control diet.
   Plasma Cu concentrations were increased (p<0.10) by 225 ppm CuSO4 in the
   growing phase and by 225 ppm CuSO4 and 100 ppm Cu-citrate in the
   finishing phase. These data reveal no consistent effect of CuSO4 on
   performance; therefore, it is difficult to assess the efficacy of these
   two Cu sources. In addition, these studies demonstrate that liver and
   bile Cu are not good indicators of Cu bioavailability in pigs fed
   adequate to pharmacological concentrations of Cu.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study was designed to compare the cytotoxic effects of an
   alpha-emitting radioimmunoconjugate, which hinds to osteosarcoma but not
   to bone marrow cells, with those of external gamma-irradiation.
   Materials and methods: The human osteosarcoma cell line, OHS-sl, and
   mononuclear cells from bone marrow (BM) harvested from healthy donors,
   were used for these experiments. Cells in suspension were added to
   various activity concentrations of the and-osteosarcoma monoclonal
   antibody TP-3 radiolabelled with At-211. Following incubation for 1h,
   unbound radioactivity was washed off and cell survival was determined
   from clonogenic assays. Microdosimetry was calculated based on binding
   and retention kinetics of At-211 to the cells, as well as cellular and
   nuclear diameters. For comparison, cell suspensions were irradiated with
   a single dose of Co-60 gamma-rays.
   Results: At-211-labelled TP-3 showed heterogeneous binding to OHS-sl
   cells, with a considerable variation among experiments. About 78\% of
   the initially bound At-211 decayed while associated with the OHS-sl
   cells. D-0 values estimated by microdosimetry were 0.33 (0.22-0.48,
   range) Gy and 1.18 (0.89-1.89) Gy for OHS-sl and BM cells, respectively,
   whereas D-0 values after external beam irradiation were 0.86+/-0.07 Gy
   and 1.71+/-0.22 Gy. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of
   At-211-labelled TP-3 at 37\% survival was 3.43 for OHS-sl and 1.55 for
   BM.
   Conclusions: High-LET targeted alpha-particle exposure killed
   osteosarcoma cells more effectively than bone marrow cells, although
   heterogeneous antigen expression among these tumour cells limited the
   magnitude of this effect.}},

Abstract = {{Apples are important dietary sources of potentially healthy phenolics.
   In three successive seasons, the changes in concentrations of flavonoids
   and chlorogenic acid in the skin of two apple cultivars `Jonagold' and
   `Elstar' during and after regular (RS) and ultra low oxygen storage
   (ULO) at 1 degrees C, were quantified by reversed-phase high performance
   liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with UV-VIS detector. There were no
   significant differences in the concentrations of flavonoids and
   chlorogenic acid between fruits stored under ULO and RS conditions.
   During storage of both `Jonagold' (3, 6 and 8 months) and of `Elstar'
   (2, 4 and 6 months), and during 1 or 2 weeks shelf life, the
   concentrations of cyanidin 3-galactoside and quercetin glycosides were
   relatively constant, while the concentrations of catechins, phloridzin
   and chlorogenic acid showed only minor changes. Exposing `Jonagold' and
   `Elstar apples' to white light during shelf life following storage
   increased the concentration of cyanidin 3-galactoside but not any of the
   other flavonoid classes. An explanation for this might be that the
   synthesis of different flavonoid classes may have different spectral
   sensitivity characteristics. It is concluded that flavonoids present in
   apples are stable and possibly not subject to net metabolic turnover
   during storage and shelf life. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study a comparison is made between the tensile static and
   fatigue behaviours of quasi-isotropic carbon/PEEK and carbon/epoxy
   notched laminates, selected as separate representatives of both tough
   and brittle matrix composites. Damage progression was monitored by
   various non-destructive (ultrasonic scanning and x-radiography) and
   destructive (deply and microscopic examinations) techniques, and by
   continuously measuring the change in stiffness, in order to identify the
   effect of damage on mechanical properties.
   The experimental observations indicated that fatigue damage in
   carbon/epoxy laminates consists of a combination of matrix cracks,
   longitudinal splitting and delaminations which attenuate the stress
   concentration and suppress fibre fracture at the notch; as a
   consequence, fatigue failure can be reached only after very high numbers
   of cycles while tensile residual strengths continuously increase over
   the range of lives investigated (10(3)-10(6) cycles). Due to the
   superior matrix toughness and the high fibre-matrix adhesion, the nature
   of fatigue damage in carbon/PEEK laminates strongly depends on the
   stress level. At high stresses the absence of early splitting and
   delaminations promotes the propagation of fibre fracture therefore
   resulting in poor fatigue performances and significant strength
   reductions; while at low stress levels damage modes are matrix
   controlled and this again translates into very long fatigue lives. These
   results indicate a strong influence of the major damage mechanisms
   typical of the two material systems on the behaviour of the laminates,
   with the nature, more than the amount, of damage appearing as the
   controlling parameter of the material response up to failure.}},

Abstract = {{The nitrogen content of plant tissue is low relative to that of
   herbivores; as a consequence, dietary N can limit the: growth and
   reproduction of herbivores and select for attributes that increase N
   acquisition. Bark beetles face a particularly severe challenge because
   the phloem that they consume is very low in nitrogen and phosphorus
   relative to their requirements. We quantified variation in the phloem
   concentrations of N and P in the host tree, Pinus taeda, and evaluated
   the following hypotheses regarding the role of sym-host biotic fungi in
   nutrient budgets of the herbivore Dendroctonus frontalis: D, frontalis
   experience variation in phloem nutrient concentrations across several
   spatial scales (H-1); mycangial fungi enhance the diet of D. frontalis
   larvae by contributing to the acquisition of N and P (H-2); Ophiostoma
   minus, an apparently antagonistic fungal symbiont, hinders D, frontalis
   larvae because it does not enhance nutrient concentrations of the phloem
   as much as mycangial fungi do (H-3); and larvae of bark beetle species
   that lack mycangial fungi must consume more phloem to accomplish the
   same growth as larvae of D. frontalis (H-4). In addition, we developed a
   general model for the N budgets of herbivorous insects that identifies
   the possible combinations of dietary and physiological parameters that
   can allow developmental success on low-nutrient diets.
   Spatial variation in phloem N was mostly at the level of trees within
   sites (a scale of meters) while P mostly varied among sites (a scale of
   kilometers). Trees with higher N content produced larger D. frontalis
   adults. Prior to infestation by beetles, phloem nutrient concentrations
   were very uniform within trees and very low relative to that of the bark
   beetles (N and P concentrations of D. frontalis adults were 28 and 8
   times greater, respectively). During infestation, phloem nutrient
   concentrations increased overall and be came highly variable within
   trees, Nitrogen concentrations increased from 0.40 +/- 0.01\% (ean +/-
   SE) in uninfested phloem to 0.86 +/- 0.03\% in the phloem surrounding
   successfully developing D. frontalis larvae, which are typically
   associated with one or two species of mutualistic mycangial fungi.
   Nitrogen concentrations were intermediate in other microhabitats within
   infested trees, including regions with no adult colonization, with
   failed larval development, or colonized by the antagonistic bluestain
   fungus O. minus. We parameterized a general nutrient-budget model for D.
   frontalis and a sympatric non-mycangial bark beetle, Ips grandicollis,
   which indicated that (1) mycangial fungi provide their benefits by
   concentrating dietary N for larvae; (2) O. minus may exert its
   antagonistic effects on D. frontalis larvae by failing to concentrate
   dietary N as much as mycangial fungi do; (3) non-mycangial bark beetles
   meet their N budgets through high consumption of unaltered, low-N
   phloem; and (4) larvae should easily meet their P requirments with any
   combination of consumption rate and development time that allows them to
   meet their N requirements. Alternative strategies for N acquisition may
   have general consequences for the population dynamics and community
   interactions of bark beetles.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Currently there is no standard adjuvant treatment following
   surgical resection of metastatic melanoma. We investigated whether
   surgery followed by autologous tumor cell-BCG vaccination was beneficial
   for malignant melanoma patients. In this study we focus on the
   prognostic value of DTH response following vaccination therapy.
   Patients and methods: Eighty-one patients with AJCC stage III and IV
   melanoma were selected. Whenever feasible, radical metastasectomy was
   performed. ASI was initiated by the administration of three weekly
   intra-cutaneous vaccinations with 10(7) irradiated autologous tumor
   cells, starting four weeks after surgery. Depending on the size of DTH
   response to the first three injections, subsequent vaccinations were
   planned. The first two vaccines also contained 10(7) BCG organisms as an
   immune stimulatory adjuvant.
   Results: Induration as well as erythema correlated strongly with
   survival (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0004). After radical metastasectomy in
   stage III melanoma patients a five-year survival of 48\% was observed.
   In stage IV disease, a five-year survival of 34\% was seen, after
   radical surgery had been performed. When macroscopic disease was present
   at start of vaccination treatment, no clinical responses occurred. Apart
   from transient skin ulceration at the site of BCG-containing
   vaccinations, no serious side effects were observed.
   Conclusions: This study shows that large-scale preparation of autologous
   melanoma cell vaccines is feasible, while vaccination results in DTH
   responses that correlate significantly with survival. ASI seemed to be
   beneficial in stage III and stage IV melanoma when given in the adjuvant
   setting, while causing only very mild side effects.}},

Abstract = {{Antiestrogen resistance is frequently observed in patients after
   long-term treatment with tamoxifen, a nonsteroidal antiestrogen widely
   used for endocrine therapy of breast cancer. In vitro studies in
   resistant cells showed that the expression of natural
   estrogen-responsive genes is frequently altered. Using MVLN cells, an
   MCF-7-derived cell model, we previously demonstrated that
   4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) treatment irreversibly inactivated an
   estrogen-regulated chimeric luciferase response by a direct effect of
   the drug and not through a cell selection process (E. Badia et al.,
   Cancer Res., 54: 5860-5866, 1994), In the present study, we present
   tamoxifen-resistant but still estrogen-dependent clones isolated after
   long-term treatment of MVLN cells with OHT and show that progesterone
   receptor (PR) expression was irreversibly decreased in some of these
   clones, whereas the PRA:PRB ratio of residual PR remained unchanged. The
   irreversible inactivation of both chimeric luciferase gene and PR gene
   expression was associated with the disappearance of DNase
   I-hypersensitive sites. In the case of the chimeric gene, at least one
   of these sites was close to the estrogen responsive element. Genomic
   sequencing analysis of a clone with very low PR content did not reveal
   any methylation on CpG dinucleotides or any mutation in the PR gene
   promoter region. In all of the resistant clones tested and independently
   of their PR content, estrogen receptor expression was only lowered by
   half and remained functional, whereas pS2 expression was not modified.
   We also observed that the residual luciferase activity level (1-2\%) of
   the MVLN clones, the luciferase expression of which had been
   irreversibly inactivated, was raised cl-fold by trichostatin A
   treatment. We conclude that long-term OHT treatment may modify the
   chromatin structure and thus could contribute to differentially
   silencing natural target genes.}},

   oxidation of individual minerals and the formation of water-soluble Ni,

Abstract = {{Objective. A number of studies have indicated that rheumatoid arthritis
   (RA) is a less severe disease in Mediterranean countries than in
   Northern Europe, We investigated whether differences in the frequency of
   class II MHC antigens might contribute to this variation in disease
   severity.
   Methods. Typing at HLA-DR and -DQ loci was carried out at low and high
   resolutions by polymerase chain reaction amplification in patients with
   early RA of less than 6 months' duration (68 patients in Madrid and 68
   in Bath) and in control subjects (929 in Madrid and 226 in Bath). Only
   ethnic Spanish and British individuals were included as patients and
   controls.
   Results. Shared epitope (SE) alleles represented 19.8 and 28.9\% of the
   total number of class II MHC alleles in controls from Madrid and Bath
   respectively (P = 0.00001), this difference being largely due to
   increased numbers of DRB1{*}0401 individuals in the British subjects (P
   = 0.0000001). Analysis of the patients showed the expected increase in
   SE alleles when compared with their respective control groups (Madrid,
   31.6 vs 19.8\%; Bath, 42.6 vs 28,9\%). In Bath the SE was mainly encoded
   by HLA-DR4 alleles (74.1\%), while in Madrid it was encoded almost
   equally by DR4 (51.1\%) and DR1 (44.7\%) alleles. The risk of developing
   RA in carriers of SE alleles was similar in the two cities (Bath, odds
   ratio 1.83, 95\% confidence interval 1.23-2.78, Madrid, odds ratio 1.87,
   95\% confidence interval 1.25-2.77), and was largely accounted for by
   HLA-DRB1{*}0401 alleles.
   Conclusion. We conclude that rheumatoid patients in Bath differ from
   their Spanish counterparts in class II antigen expression and allele
   frequency. This may be explained partly by genetic differences between
   the control populations in the two centres, and may help to explain the
   greater incidence of more severe rheumatoid disease expression seen in
   RA patients In the UK.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The quantitative gated SPECT (QGS) software is able to
   calculate LV volumes and visualize LV wall motion and perfusion
   throughout the cardiac cycle using an automatic edge detection algorithm
   of the left ventricle, We evaluated the reliability of global and
   regional LV function assessment derived from QGS by comparing it with
   the results from left ventriculo-cineangiography (LVG), Patients In 20
   patients with left ventricular dysfunction who underwent ECG gated
   Tc-99m-tetrofosmin SPECT, the end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic
   volume (ESV) and ejection fraction (LVEF) were calculated. The
   QGS-assessed regional wall motion was determined using the cinematic
   display.
   Results QGS-derived EDV, ESV and LVEF correlated well with those by LVG
   (p<0.001 for each), There was a good correlation between wall motion
   score (WMS) derived from the QGS and the LVG (r=0.40, p<0.05). In some
   patients with extensive myocardial infarction, there was a discrepancy
   in the regional wall motion results between QGS and LVG,
   Conclusions The EGG-gated SPECT using QGS is useful to evaluate global
   and regional LV functions in left ventricular dysfunction.}},

   differences in the nature of the outer coating enclosing both embryo
   types, somatic embryos of E. nitens were observed to have strong
   similarities with zygotic embryos in seeds in terms of their overall
   size, morphology and internal cellular organization. Many cells in both
   sexually produced and somatic embryos contained numerous lipid-rich
   globular bodies. The wider significance of these observations is

   manganese sulphate solution. Significant differences were found between
   varieties for grain yield, Mn concentration and Mn uptake with the
   addition of Mn. The grain yield of wheat under Mn stress condition was
   1.50-4.40 tonnes/ha. Though all the varieties responded to foliar
   application of Mn, the increase in grain yield varied from 13.6 -
   73.3\%. The Triticum durum varieties ('PBW 34' and `PDW 233') responded
   more to Mn than the Triticum aestivum ('PBW 373','Raj 3765' and `PBW
   343') varieties. Further trials at 6 locations with varying levels of Mn
   deficiency showed increase in the wheat grain yield with foliar sprays
   of Mn, emphasizing the importance of Mn fertilization when wheat is

Abstract = {{A randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded study was conducted in 40

   propofol target-controlled infusion was started at 4 mu g.ml(-1) and
   incrementally titrated to loss of verbal contact, Muscle relaxation was
   provided by cisatracurium. The study drug was given three minutes later
   over 30 seconds, and 90 seconds later the patient's trachea Il,as
   intubated under direct laryngoscopy. Baseline noninvasive blood pressure
   an heart rate recordings were made prior to starting target-controlled
   infusion, then at one-minute intervals after loss of verbal contact for
   the duration of the study. Demographic data and target-controlled
   infusion rate at intubation was similar for the groups. Following
   intubation, heart rate increased by 15\% in the placebo group, 10\% iii
   I mu g.kg(-1) group, with no changes in 2 mu g.kg(-1) and 4 mu g.kg(-1)

Abstract = {{Deep and severe burns often present with the exposure of musculoskeletal
   structures and severe deformities. Skeletal fixation, suspension and/or
   traction are part of their comprehensive treatment. Several factors put
   burn patients at risk for osteomyelitis, osteosynthesis material being
   one of them. In order to determine the safety of skeletal fixation, we
   reviewed all pediatric patients treated with pin insertion during the
   past 10 years. Forty-one severely burned children (61 +/- 3\% TBSA Full
   thickness burns), had a total of 357 skeletal fixation procedures. Pins
   were maintained an average of 25.3 +/- 1.7 days. Thirteen pins (3.6\%)
   were loose before the expected time of removal, two patients (4.8\%)
   presented with cellulitis of the pin site and two patients (4.8\%)
   presented with osteomyelitis. Loose pins, pin site cellulitis, burn
   wound infection and sepsis were not associated with ostemyelitis.
   Skeletal fixation in severely burned patients presents with a low
   incidence of infectious complications. Its use should be considered in
   patients affected by severe burns that present with exposed deep
   structures and for positioning purposes. The exact timing for pin
   removal in burned patients is still to be defined. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We provide a competitive analysis framework for online prefetching and
   buffer management algorithms in parallel I/O systems, using a read-once
   model of black references. This has widespread applicability to key
   I/O-bound applications such as external merging and concurrent playback
   of multiple video streams. Two realistic lookahead models, global
   lookahead and local Lookahead, are defined. Algorithms NOM and GREED,
   based on these two forms of lookahead are analyzed for shared buffer and
   distributed buffer configurations, both of which occur frequently in
   existing systems. An important aspect of our work is that we show how to
   implement both of the models of lookahead in practice using the simple
   techniques of forecasting and flushing.
   Given a D-disk parallel I/O system and a globally shared I/O buffer that
   can hold up to M disk blocks, we derive a lower bound of Omega(root D)
   on the competitive ratio of any deterministic online prefetching
   algorithm with O(M) lookahead. NOM is shown to match the lower bound
   using global M-block lookahead. In contrast, using only local lookahead
   results in an Omega(D) competitive ratio. When the buffer is distributed
   into D portions of M/D blocks each, the algorithm GREED based on local
   lookahead is shown to be optimal, and NOM is within a constant factor of
   optimal. Thus we provide a theoretical basis for the intuition that
   global lookahead is more valuable for prefetching in the case of a
   shared buffer configuration, whereas it is enough to provide local
   lookahead in the case of a distributed configuration. Finally, we
   analyze the performance of these algorithms for reference strings
   generated by a uniformly-random stochastic process and we show that they
   achieve the minimal expected number of I/Os. These results also give
   bounds on the worst-case expected performance of algorithms which employ
   randomization in the data layout. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks for South America are computed
   using four 1:5,000,000 scale soil data sets of different spatial
   resolution. These are the 60' by 60' resolution Zobler soil data file,
   the 30' by 30' resolution World Inventory of Soil Emission Potentials
   (WISE) database, a 5' by 5' raster version of the Digital Soil Map of
   the World (DSMW), and a vector-based Soil and Terrain Database (SOTER).
   Estimates for total, regional stocks of organic carbon (SOC) range from
   146.1 Pg C (Zobler) to 159.7 Pg C (SOTER) for the first 1 m of soil.
   More pronounced differences are observed among the four data sets when
   values for SOC stocks are compared at the level of the major soil
   grouping and their component soil units. In the case of Ferralsols, for
   example, the estimates for SOC stocks are 31.1 Pg C (SOTER), 41.4 Pg C
   (DSMW), 41.6 Pg C (WISE), and 58.3 Pg C (Zobler), respectively. In the
   case of Xanthic Ferralsols (Fx), the SOC stocks estimated with the
   Zobler and DSMW sets differ by about 14 Pg C (approximate to 157\%). By
   and large, the observed differences are due to varying areal estimates
   for the various soil units for the data sets under consideration, and
   the selection of soil profile data used. This study illustrates (a) the
   importance of the aggregation procedure used to account for the mapped
   spatial variation in soil conditions and (b) the need for updating the
   soil geographic and attribute data for the world in SOTER, so as to
   provide modelers with up-to-date soil data for studying interactions of
   human and natural systems at the regional and continental level within
   the context of global change. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background. In multiple myeloma 5 different infiltration patterns can be
   differentiated: 1. normal appearance of bone marrow, 2. focal
   involvement, 3. homogeneous diffuse infiltration, 4. combined diffuse
   and focal infiltration, 5.{''}salt- and pepper{''} pattern with
   inhomogeneous bone marrow with interposition of fat islands.
   Methods. For the fast and total acquisition of all patterns a
   combination of a T1-weighted spin echo sequence and a fat suppression
   technique is superior. The focal involvement is clearly demonstrated as
   areas of high signal intensity on e.g. STIR images. Diffuse involvement
   can be quantified objectively by calculation of the percentage of signal
   intensity increase after contrast material injection. MRI is superior to
   X-ray in focal and diffuse involvement. With ultrafast sequences a
   ``screening{''} of the whole red bone marrow as for myeloma infiltration
   is possible.
   Prognosis. In prognosis studies diffuse infiltration is inferior to
   focal involvement. Patients without bone marrow infiltration have a
   significantly longer survival than patients with bone marrow
   infiltration in MRI at the time of diagnosis. However, even patients in
   stage one of disease (Durie and Salmon) a nd negative X-ray films can
   show bone marrow infiltration in MRI. Those patients often show an early
   disease progression. Good response to therapy in focal involvement are:
   reduction of signal intensity on T2- weighted spin echo images, lack or
   rim-like enhancement after contrast material injection or even a
   normalisation of bone marrow signal. In case of diffuse involvement a
   partly patchy reconversion to fatty marrow can be seen.}},

Abstract = {{Geometrical uncertainties (organ boundary variation and electrode
   position uncertainties) are the biggest sources of error in estimating
   electrical resistivity of tissues from body surface measurements. In
   this study, in order to decrease estimation errors, the statistically
   constrained minimum mean squared error estimation algorithm (MiMSEE) is
   constrained with a priori knowledge of the geometrical uncertainties in
   addition to the constraints based on geometry, resistivity range,
   linearization and instrumentation errors. The MiMSEE calculates an
   optimum inverse matrix, which maps the surface measurements to the
   unknown resistivity distribution. The required data are obtained from
   four-electrode impedance measurements, similar to injected-current
   electrical impedance tomography (EIT). In this study, the surface
   measurements are simulated by using a numerical thorax model. The data
   are perturbed with additive instrumentation noise. Simulated surface
   measurements are then used to estimate the tissue resistivities by using
   the proposed algorithm. The results are compared with the results of
   conventional least squares error estimator (LSEE). Depending on the
   region, the MiMSEE yields an estimation error between 0.42\% and 31.3\%
   compared with 7.12\% to 2010\% for the LSEE. It is shown that the MiMSEE
   is quite robust even in the case of geometrical uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{In a series of papers by Hill and co-workers, a number of exact
   integrals are derived for plane strain, plane stress, and axially
   symmetric deformations of an isotropic, incompressible Varga elastic
   material. Here we show for more general plane strain deformations with
   transverse stretch that the angle psi appearing in these integrals is,
   in fact, the local rigid-body rotation angle in the polar decomposition
   of the deformation gradient. The result is independent of any internal
   constraint and of the particular constitutive description of the
   material response for which the general first integrals were obtained.
   This physical identification of psi will greatly assist in terms of
   exploiting these integrals for the subsequent solution of practical
   problems. It is also shown that the general integrals do not include a
   non-homogeneous, local simple shear deformation.}},

Abstract = {{Using the single-strand conformation polymorphism and heteroduplex
   analyses, the P53 and RE genes were analyzed in cell samples from
   twenty-eight patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) both at

   alterations of the P53 or RE genes were found in any of the chronic
   phase (CP) samples, Structural abnormalities of the P53 gene were
   observed in ten of twenty-eight AP samples within exons 4, 5, 7 and 9.
   Of the ten cases of AP disease with altered P53 genes, five patients
   also suffered from the deletion of the other allele. Alterations of the
   RE gene could be detected in six AP samples, and aberrant band patterns
   were found in the analysis of exons 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 13, 14, 17, 21 and

   alterations of both P53 and RE genes were observed in two AP samples.
   Our data strongly suggest that abnormalities of the P53 and RB genes and

Abstract = {{The liberalised economic policies have exposed Indian Industry to
   several challenges. In response to this the Indian economy has witnessed
   a sharp increase in mergers and acquisitions. An attempt has been made
   in this paper to analyse the significance of such mergers and its
   characteristics. The study suggests that the acceleration of the merger
   movement in the early 1990s is accompanied by the dominance of mergers
   between firms belonging to the same business group or house with similar
   product lines. But, there are signs that mergers between unrelated
   firms, though numerically less significant, have been gaining ground.
   The study argues that though the merger movement in the early nineties
   might have contributed to an increase in product or asset concentration
   measured on a firmwise basis, it could not have contributed to an
   increase in concentration as measured by the relative shares of business
   groups. However, it is evident that mergers contributed significantly to
   asset-growth in only one-fifth of the sample firms studied. Most of the
   sample firms mobilised a large share of resources through capital
   markets, borrowing,and current liabilities to finance their expansion
   during 1989-90 to 1994-95. Therefore the study concludes that the merger
   wave in the early nineties were more a means of internal restructuring
   than an instrument of further product market or asset share.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Background Although the etiology of the depigmentation disorder vitiligo
   is still not completely understood, many investigators believe that an
   autoimmune reaction may play a major role. In this regard,
   T-lymphocyte-mediated immunity has been implicated frequently in the
   pathogenesis of the disease. Most studies have applied in vitro testing
   of cell-mediated immunity, however, rather than in vivo measurements.
   Therefore, our study was undertaken to define the cutaneous delayed-type
   hypersensitivity (DTH) in vivo reaction in association with the
   absence/presence of serum thyroid autoantibodies, which are a good
   representative marker for autoimmunity in patients with vitiligo,
   Methods DTH was evaluated in the normal pigmented skin of 109 vitiligo
   patients (29 men and 80 women) and in the depigmented skin of 27 of this
   group (5 men and 22 women) using the dermal application of seven common
   recall antigens together with a negative control. Individuals were
   considered to be hypoergic if the DTH sum score was less than or equal
   to 5 mm in women or less than or equal to 10 mm in men, or ii they
   responded to only one or two antigens.
   Results The mean sum score was 10.2 +/- 8.4 with an average of 2.3 +/-
   1.6 positive reactions in depigmented skin vs. a sum score of 12.4 +/-
   9.0 with an average number of 2.6 +/- 1.6 positive reactions in normal
   pigmented skin. There was no statistically significant difference
   between depigmented and normal pigmented skin using the paired t-test (P
   > 0.05). Further evaluation of these data showed no significant
   correlation between the presence of thyroid autoantibodies as well as
   selected clinical parameters and an aberration in cutaneous DTH
   Conclusions In contrast to earlier reports, our in vivo studies of
   cutaneous DTH reactions revealed no clinically significant aberrant
   cellular immunity in this patient group. These results indicate that the
   immune reaction in vitiligo may be only a secondary event in the
   pathogenesis of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{The investigation of the consequences of trying to blend tropical
   Pacific observations from the Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean (TAO) array into
   the dynamical framework of an intermediate coupled ocean-atmosphere
   model is continued. In a previous study it was found that the model
   dynamics, the prior estimates of uncertainty in the observations, and
   the estimates of the errors in the dynamical equations of the model
   could not be reconciled with data from the 1994-95 period. The error
   estimates and the data forced the rejection of the model physics as
   being unacceptably in error. In this work, data from two periods
   (1995-96 and 1997-98) were used when the tropical Pacific was in states
   very different from the previous study. The consequences of increasing
   the prior error estimates were explored in an effort to find out ii it
   is possible at least to use the intermediate model physics to assist in
   mapping the observations into fields in a statistically consistent way.
   It was found that such a result is possible for the new data periods,
   with larger prior error assumptions. However. examination of the
   behavior of the mapped fields indicates that they have no dynamical
   utility. The model dynamical residuals, that is, the size of the
   quantity that is left after evaluating all of the terms in each
   intermediate model equation, dominate the terms themselves. Evidently
   the intermediate model is not able to add insight into the processes
   that caused the tropical Pacific to behave as it was observed to, during
   these time intervals.
   The inverse techniques described here together with the relatively dense
   TAO dataset have made it possible for the unambiguous rejection of the
   nonlinear intermediate model dynamical system. This if the first time
   that for the unambiguous rejection of the nonlinear intermediate model
   dynamical system.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{57-74}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Environmental desulphurization is an attractive alternative for
   management of acid generating tailings. This process placed at the end
   of the primary process treatment circuit will reduce a large amount of
   the problematic tailings by concentrating the sulphide fraction. To
   produce desulphurized tailings, non-selective froth flotation is the
   most adapted method. The desulphurization level is fixed by the sulphide
   content of the tailings and their neutralization potential (NP). The
   final residue should have enough NP to safely compensate for its acidity
   potential (AP).
   In this paper, the authors present the results of a battery of tests
   conducted in Denver cells to study the sulphide flotation kinetics of
   four different mine tailings samples which contain 2.9 S\%, 3.4 S\%,
   16.2 S\% and 24.2 S\%, respectively. Tailings P, M, and G are cyanide
   free and can be floated at pH values of less than 10 by using amyl
   xanthate as the collector agent. However, tailings D, which come from a
   gold cyanidation process, did not provide good sulphide recovery because
   of pyrite depression (even after cyanide elimination followed by a
   sulphide surface activation and a pH decrease). To successfully overcome
   this problem, amine acetate was used.
   This collector allows easy flotation without a pretreatment stage.
   Dosage of the two type of collector were optimized for the tailings
   studied. The results of all kinetic tests and collector dosage
   optimization were combined to establish a model which will estimate the
   cost of desulphurization. A preliminary analysis shows that the expense
   of the implementation of this desulphurization technology is comparable
   to other rehabilitation methods. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to compare 2 methods of analog-to-digital
   video conversion in anticipation of improving, refining, and
   standardizing digital video production for medical education, diagnosis
   support, and telemedicine. A video workstation was devised containing 2
   analog-to-digital video conversion systems: a digital video media
   converter with fire wire card and a video capture card. A procedure for
   final digital video production was created that used equivalent
   compression, pixel resolution, frame rate, and data rate for both
   systems. A subjective test was performed in which 12 archived analog
   videotapes, consisting of magnetic resonance angiograms, ultrasounds,
   neurosurgeries, and telemedicine applications, were converted digitally
   using the 2 methods. Randomized side by side video comparisons were
   analyzed and rated by subjective quality. An objective test was
   performed by videotaping a gray-scale test pattern off a computer
   monitor, digitally converting it by the 2 methods, and comparing the
   gray-scale values to the original pattern. There was no significant
   difference in overall video quality (P = .31) or gray-scale reproduction
   using the 2 methods of analog-to-digital conversion. When performing
   simple analog-to-digital video conversion, a video capture card is equal
   in quality and costs less than a digital video (DV) media converter or

Abstract = {{preparations for the third UN Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful
   Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE III) were intense. The conference itself
   was a success. But what: forms will the follow-up take? Just reading the
   150-page report is an effort in itself. Having played a central part in
   the preparations and organization, Europe fully appreciates the need to
   build on the spirit of cooperation which emerged from UNISPACE III. In
   November 1999, the European States gathered to analyze the results of
   the conference and to set a course for their future participation in the
   United Nations Programme on Space Applications (UNPSA), which is mainly
   done through ESA, and for their participation in the United Nations
   Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS), which is done
   through coordination among ESA Member States. This article presents the
   authors' personal accounts of the results of the European efforts around
   UNISPACE III and shows how `European foreign policy' can work in
   international space policy. It also seeks to illustrate Europe's
   commitment to putting space technology to work for the benefit of
   development throughout the world. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Despite the near-ubiquity of plasmids in bacterial populations and the
   profound contribution of infectious gene transfer to the adaptation and
   evolution of bacteria, the mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of
   plasmids in bacterial populations are poorly understood. In this
   article, we address the question of how I,plasmids manage to pcr-sist
   over evolutionary time. Empirical studies suggest that plasmids are not
   infectiously transmitted at a rate high enough to be maintained as
   genetic parasites. In PART I, eve present a general mathematical proof
   that if this is the case, then plasmids will not be able to pcr sist
   indefinitely solely by carrying genes that are beneficial or sometimes
   beneficial to their, host bacteria. Instead, such genes should, in the
   long run, be incorporated into the. bacterial chromosome. If the
   mobility of host-adaptive genus imposes a cost, that mobility will
   eventually be lost. In PART II, we illustrate a Pail of mechanisms bt
   which I,plasmids can be maintained indefinitely when when their rates of
   transmission are coo lo for them to be genetic parasites. First,
   plasmids may. persist because they can transfer locally adapted genes to
   newly arriving strains bearing evolutionary innovations, and thereby
   preserve the local adaptations in the face of background selective
   sweeps. Second, plasmids may persist because of their ability to shuttle
   intermittenly favored genes back and forth between various
   (noncompeting) bacterial strains, ccotypes, or even species.}},

Abstract = {{A study is made of a magnetoelastic (ME) superstructure in a film of a
   uniaxial ferromagnet with the easy magnetization axis parallel to its

   entirely by the magnetostriction coupling of magnetization to lattice
   deformation at the ferromagnet-substrate interface. In the vicinity of
   the second-order magnetic orientational phase transition (OPT) induced
   by an external magnetic field H the static distribution of magnetization
   and elastic strain in the domain phase is found to be closed to the
   distribution for the critical Love mode in the homogeneous phase. Apart
   from the OPT the width of domains increases drastically with H
   decreasing. It is shown that the singular defects (dislocations and
   disclinations) appear in the regular domain structure in the vicinity of
   the OPT, and such defects destroy the long-range order in the ME
   superstructure. The calculation is extended to ME superstructures in a
   film of a two-sublattice orthoferrite.}},

Abstract = {{ESA has developed a multidisciplinary Earth-observation instrument that

   Spectrometer (MERIS) will provide a remote-sensing capability for

   wide-field imaging spectrometer, is a nadir-looking sensor operated in a
   push-broom mode. The instrument measures the solar reflected radiation
   in fifteen spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared parts of the
   spectrum. Of particular interest is the ability to programme the
   position and width of the spectral bands in flight. This allows a large
   set of applications, making the instrument concept also attractive for
   future Earth Watch missions. ESA will produce a set of validated data
   products, such as chlorophyll concentration, water vapour and global

Abstract = {{Objectives-After stroke, abnormal arm posture due to spasticity in a
   functionally useless arm may interfere with self care tasks. In these
   patients botulinum toxin treatment presents an opportunity to reduce
   disability. The purpose was to investigate whether reduction in
   spasticity after botulinum toxin treatment translates into reduction in
   disability and carer burden.
   Methods-Forty patients with stroke with spasticity in a functionally
   useless arm (median duration 3.1 years) were randomised to receive
   intramuscular botulinum toxin type A (BT-A; Dysport) (n=20) or placebo
   (n=20) in a total dose of 1000 MU divided between elbow, wrist, and
   finger flexors. Spasticity (using the modified Ashworth scale), muscle
   power, joint movement, and pain were assessed. Disability and carer
   burden were measured using an eight item and a four item scale
   respectively. Two baseline and three posttreatment assessments (weeks 2,
   6, and 12) were made. Concurrent treatments as far as possible remained
   unchanged and not optimised.
   Results-Disability improved at week 6 with BT-A compared with placebo.
   This effect, present at week 2, wore off by week 12. Reduction in carer
   burden was seen at week 6 with BT-A and continued for at least 12 weeks.
   Forearm flexor spasticity was reduced with BT-A up to 12 weeks after
   treatment. Although significant improvement in elbow flexor spasticity
   was seen at week 2 with BT-A compared with placebo, this effect was not
   evident at weeks 6 and 12. Arm pain was not improved after BT-A. Grip
   strength was reduced with BT-A. No serious BT-A related adverse effects
   were reported.
   Conclusion--BT-A is useful for treating patients with stroke who have
   self care difficulties due to arm spasticity. The decision to treat
   should also include relief of carer burden. As muscle weakness may
   occur, its potential impact on functional activities must be assessed
   before intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Under Section 402(a)(3) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act the
   distribution of foods which may contain repulsive or offensive matter,
   considered as filth, is prohibited. Filth includes contaminants such as
   rat, mouse, and other animal hairs and excreta; whole insects, insect
   parts, and excreta; and other extraneous materials which, because of
   their repulsiveness, would not knowingly be eaten or used. The presence
   of such filth renders food adulterated. Some foods, even when produced
   under good manufacturing practice, contain low level of natural or
   unavoidable defects such as dirt, insect parts, and hair that are not
   hazardous to health. Although the health hazard is eliminated, most
   consumers find the presence of ``any{''} visible filth contaminant such
   as hair in a food product objectionable. The objective of this study was
   to determine when a defect (hair) in a food (mushrooms) is visible to a
   consumer by testing the visual acuity of a consumer panel under
   controlled laboratory conditions. Of the panelists participating in the
   study, when presented with a single hair on a flat surface with a
   solid-colored background, 27\% were able to detect a l-mm hair, 58\%
   were able to detect a 3-mm hair, and 75\% were able to detect a 10-mm
   hair. Twenty-five percent of the panelists surveyed were able to detect
   a 5- or 10-mm hair on sliced, canned mushrooms. The experimental design
   and results of this study are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Users who need to run mission-critical applications on the Internet will
   require functionality unlikely to be available in the Next-Generation
   Internet (NGI). Traditionally, critical networked applications have
   exploited physical or logical separation to justify a style of reasoning
   that considers each application independently. Migrating systems to a
   shared network infrastructure, however, frequently means isolation loss,
   compromising the safety argument. Thus a means of achieving and
   validating safety for NGI applications is necessary. This requires
   devising a way to isolate applications from one another in shared
   settings.
   The author proposes a new networking isolation capability, termed a
   virtual overlay, network, or VON. Although a VON offers a response to
   the reliability and security needs of critical applications, it would be
   prohibitively costly to implement using contemporary technologies. This
   article explains VONs and how extending an existing router feature and
   coupling it with well-understood group communication techniques could
   support VONs at low cost, with good scalability.}},

Abstract = {{inflammation is an essential component of asthma pathophysiology. While
   beta(2)-agonists are often used for short-term relief of acute
   bronchospasm, anti-inflammatory agents are required for the long-term
   management of chronic inflammation in this disease. Corticosteroids have
   emerged as the first-line anti-inflammatory therapy for asthma
   management. However, in some patients, especially children, the high
   doses of corticosteroids that may be required to control features of
   hyperresponsiveness, including exercise-induced asthma, raise safety
   concerns. Thus, there is a need for complementary anti-inflammatory,
   steroid-sparing agents in asthma therapy. Several inflammatory mediators
   have been targeted in an attempt to thwart this inflammatory process,
   but so far with little success.
   The cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT), LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, have been
   shown to be essential mediators in asthma, making them obvious targets
   for therapy. These cysteinyl leukotrienes, previously known as the
   slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), mediate many of the
   features of asthma, including bronchial constriction, bronchial
   hyperreactivity, edema, and eosinophilia. Data show that selective
   cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists (CysLTRAs) effectively
   reverse these pathologic changes. Corticosteroids do not inhibit the
   production of CysLTs in vivo, suggesting that CysLTRAs and
   corticosteroids affect different targets. The bronchodilator properties
   of CysLTRAs seem to be additive to those of beta(2)-agonists and
   corticosteroids.
   These data suggest that CysLTs are important therapeutic targets in the
   management of inflammation in asthma. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{At the end of their Cretaceous-Tertiary subduction-collision history,
   the Alps underwent a complex brittle reworking. An integrated study has
   been undertaken in order to explain the Miocene to Present kinematic
   evolution of the north-western Alps. Data from remote sensing,
   structural geology, seismotectonics and thermochronology have been
   analysed and compared. Remote sensing and structural analysis evidence
   that the Pennine-Graian nappe stack constitutes a continuous block,
   characterised by high-strain border-zones and by a quite homogenous
   internal deformation. The border-zones of this block are: (i) the normal
   SW-dipping Simplon fault; (ii) the broad dextral strike-slip system,
   constituted by the Phone and Chamonix lines and by the Penninic and
   Brianconnais reactivated frontal thrusts, and, to the SE of the block,
   (iii) the recently discovered sinistral strike-slip Ospizio Sottile
   fault. A complex network of faults and fractures dissects the
   Pennine-Graian block, the most important being the E-W striking
   Aosta-Ranzola fault system. Even if these faults do not generally show
   large displacements in the Miocene, they constitute an important strain
   marker, since they have a regular frequency and indicate a general NE-SW
   extension of the block. Seismicity is mainly concentrated along the
   strike-slip border-zones and focal plane solutions generally agree with
   surface data (within discussed errors). Thermochronology indicates that,
   from the Late Miocene onwards, no major changes took place in the
   exhumation pattern, and hence in the overall kinematics. This evidence
   supports the general agreement between present-day deformation
   (seismotectonic data) and kinematics in the recent-past (structural
   geology data). Different tectonic reconstructions are checked with the
   discussed data set. In the authors' opinion, the SW-ward orogen-parallel
   escape model better explain the presented body of structural,
   seismotectonic and thermochronology evidences. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Aims-To describe the clinical and histopathological features of a rare
   variant of naevoid melanoma, small cell melanoma, and discuss the
   histological differential diagnoses.
   Methods-The clinical and histological features of cases of malignant
   melanoma with the histological features of small (non-Merkel like)
   melanoma were reviewed and documented. In addition, five cases had
   available material for immunohistochemistry and this was performed using
   antibodies to the S100 protein and melan-A, and the HMB-45 antibody.
   Results-There were 15 cases of small cell melanoma from 14 (10 female,
   four male) patients, aged between 30 and 77 (mean, 48.6) years. The
   trunk was the most common location. In more than half the cases, the
   provisional diagnosis was melanoma/borderline lesion. All shared similar
   histological appearances of an intraepidermal component of in situ
   melanoma and a dermal component of nests of cells with hyperchromatic
   nuclei and scanty cytoplasm, usually in tightly packed nests. All
   components (junctional and intradermal) of the lesions investigated by
   immunohistochemistry were positive both for S100 protein and melan-A.
   All junctional components were positive with HMB-45, but with variable
   staining of the dermal components with this antibody.
   Conclusions-Small cell malignant melanoma is postulated to be a distinct
   histopathological entity and a rare variant of naevoid melanoma, Such
   lesions can be difficult to interpret and easily missed at scanning
   magnification because the cells of the dermal component mimic benign
   naevus cells.}},

   calculated clinical significance}},
Journal = {{CHEST}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{118}},

Abstract = {{Background: The flow in the human trachea is turbulent. Thus, the
   tracheal resistance (R) and the pressure gradient (Delta P) required to
   maintain a given flow across the trachea is inversely related to its
   radius raised to the fifth power. If the caliber reduction ratio (X)
   after endotracheal intubation is calculated as X = radius of the
   endotracheal tube (rETT)/radius of the trachea (rT), then Delta P and/or
   R will be increased by (1/X)(5).
   Study objectives: To measure the actual ratio between rETT and rT
   following endotracheal intubation of pediatric patients with respiratory
   failure and to calculate the resulting increase in the tracheal R and
   Delta P for a given inspiratory flow rate.
   Design: Retrospective chart review.
   Setting: Pediatric ICU in a tertiary-care teaching children's medical
   center.
   Patient enrollment: Twenty consecutive pediatric patients (mean {[}+/-
   SD] age, 6.4 +/- 7.2 years) whose tracheas had been intubated for
   various causes of respiratory failure, and who had received a CT scan,
   were included in our study. All patients received an endotracheal tube
   the size of which was derived from the following formula: (age in
   years/4) + 4.
   Measurements and main results: rT and rETT were measured from CT scan
   sections at and around the level. of the thoracic inlet, and the average
   values were used to calculate X. These values ranged from 0.33 to 0.65
   (mean, 0.55 +/- 0.8). The factor (1/X)(5) was calculated for each
   patient and then was multiplied by the known normal value for tracheal R
   for adolescents and adults (0.07 cm H2O/L/s) to obtain the value of R
   resulting from the artificial airway, (1/X)(5) x 0.07. Our results
   showed that tracheal R increased due to caliber reduction of the trachea
   after endotracheal intubation by 33.9 +/- 52.5-fold (range, 8.6- to
   255.5-fold). In order to maintain an inspiratory flow of 1 L/s, the
   value of P for the intubated trachea would increase from 0.07 cm H2O to
   a mean of 2.4 +/- 3.7 cm H2O (range, 0.6 to 18 cm H2O). In two of our
   patients, the rT/rETT ratios were < 0.5 (0.33 and 0.44, respectively);
   this translated into a more significant increase in the calculated Delta
   Ps, 18 and 4.2 cm H2O, respectively.
   Conclusions: The common value of X due to endotracheal intubation is
   between 0.5 and 0.6, which in and of itself results in an increase in R
   across the intubated trachea up to 32-fold. The calculated increase in P
   as a result of this is between 2 and 3 cm H2O for adolescents or young
   adults. The addition of pressure support of at least 3 cm H2O during
   spontaneous ventilation via an endotracheal tube, which is common
   practice in pediatric critical care, should alleviate any respiratory
   distress emanating from the increased R. However, a value for X < 0.5,
   which was found in 10\% of our patients (2 of 20 patients), results in a
   much higher calculated increase in the pressure gradient and, therefore,
   a higher level of pressure support is required to overcome this
   increase.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach combining high-energy laser fragmentation (HELF) with
   excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMS) was used to study colored
   dissolved organic material (CDOM) in rivers feeding the Tampa Bay
   Estuary, Results presented as difference spectra showed that fluorescent
   material destroyed had two distinct peaks for all samples at all
   degradation wavelengths of 320 nm or greater. All samples showed highest
   loss of UV-C (220-280 nm) stimulated fluorescence, even when irradiated
   at 390 nm, with lower loss of UV-B (280-320 nm) stimulated fluorescence
   centered around the wavelength used for degradation. In contrast to
   spectra for the initial and residual fingerprints, loss spectra showed
   the rounded contours expected for a pure organic fluorophore. These
   observations suggest that laser irradiation targets a specific
   fluorophore or restricted group of fluorophores in the original mixture,
   some of which have a double excitation maximum and single emission
   maximum. By varying the degradation wavelength, eight distinct
   fluorophore groups were identified in the sample set, some of which were
   unique to either river or estuarine samples and some of which were
   common to samples from both environments.}},

Title = {{Do peritoneal catheters remove pro-inflammatory cytokines after

Abstract = {{Background. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in neonates induces a
   cytokine-mediated capillary leak syndrome that can cause organ
   dysfunction. Removing harmful cytokines after CPB may attenuate this
   response. This study measured the concentrations of serum and peritoneal
   fluid (PF) cytokines after CPB to determine if harmful cytokines can be
   removed with peritoneal catheters.
   Methods. Neonates (n = 18) had cardiac surgery using CPB with
   circulatory arrest. Peritoneal catheters were placed at the end of
   surgery to drain excess fluid. Serum samples were obtained before and
   after CPB, and PF after CPB. Cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay.
   Results. Tumor necrosis factor-cu and interleukin-lp (IL-1 beta) were
   not detected in any serum or PF sample. Serum concentrations of IL-6,
   IL-8, and IL-10 increased significantly after CPB. PF concentrations of
   IL-6 and IL-8 exceeded serum concentrations, whereas IL-10
   concentrations were higher in the serum. There was a significant
   negative correlation between serum and PF concentrations of IL-6 after
   CPB (r = -0.63; p < 0.05).
   Conclusions. PF has very high concentrations of the proinflammatory
   cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8, after CPB but not the antiinflammatory
   cytokine IL-10. The PF may be a depot for the harmful inflammatory
   cytokines after CPB, and removing the PF could lower serum
   concentrations. (C) 2000 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.}},

Abstract = {{The photodecarboxylation reaction of 2-(3-benzoylphenyl)propionate
   (ketoprofen anion, KP) was studied in water and in 0.1 M phosphate
   buffer solutions in the pH range 5.7-11.0 by laser-induced optoacoustic
   spectroscopy (LIOAS, T range 9.5-31.6 degrees C). Upon exciting KP with
   355 nm laser pulses under anaerobic conditions, two components in the
   LIOAS signals with well-separated lifetimes were found (tau(1) < 20 ns;
   250 < tau(2) < 500 ns) in the whole pH range, whereas a long-lived third
   component (4 < tau(3) < 10 mu s) was only detected at pH less than or
   equal to 6.1. The heat and structural volume changes accompanying the
   first step did not depend on pH or on the presence of buffer. The
   carbanion resulting from prompt decarboxylation within the nanosecond
   pulse (<10 ns) drastically reduces its molar volume ({[}-18.9 +/- 2.0]
   cm(3)/mol) with respect to KP and its enthalpy content is (256 +/- 10)
   kJ/mol. At acid pH (ca 6), a species is formed with a lifetime in the
   hundreds of ns, The enthalpy and structural volume change for this
   species with respect to KP- are (181 +/- 15) kJ/mol and (+0.6 +/- 2.0)
   cm(3)/mol, respectively. This species is most likely a neutral biradical
   formed by protonation of the decarboxylated carbanion, and decays to the
   final product 3-ethylbenzophenone in several mu s. At basic pH (ca 11),
   direct formation of 3-ethylbenzophenone occurs in hundreds of ns
   involving a reaction with the solvent, The global decarboxylation
   reaction is endothermic ({[}45 +/- 15] kJ/mol) and shows an expansion of
   (+14.5 +/- 0.5) cm(3)/mol with respect to KP-. At low pH, the presence
   of buffer strongly affects the magnitude of the structural volume
   changes associated with the intermolecular proton-transfer processes of
   the long-lived species due to reactions of the buffer anion with the
   decarboxylated ketoprofen anion.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Human chondrocytes produce different C-X-C and C-C chemokines
   under basal conditions and upon activation with proinflammatory
   cytokines. We investigated whether human chondrocytes also have
   chemokine receptors and examined the effects of chemokines on
   chondrocyte activity.
   Methods. The expression of chemokine receptors was determined by
   immunochemical analysis of frozen sections from normal and
   osteoarthritic cartilage and by flow cytometry of isolated cells. The
   messenger RNA expression for chemokine receptors was studied by reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Isolated chondrocytes were
   stimulated with different chemokines, and the responses were evaluated
   by assaying the release of matrix metalloprotease 3 (MMP-3) and of the
   lysosomal enzyme N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase in the supernatants.
   Results. A wide variety of chemokine receptors (CCR-1, CCR-2, CCR-3,
   CCR-5, CXCR-1, and CXCR-2) was detected on human chondrocytes.
   Interaction of these receptors with the corresponding ligands induced
   the release of MMP-3. This response was abrogated by pretreatment of the
   cells with Bordetella pertussis toxin, demonstrating involvement of G
   proteins of the G(i) type. The response decreased in the presence of
   cycloheximide, indicating dependence on protein synthesis. Chemokines
   also induced the exocytosis of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, which
   was prevented by receptor blockage,vith anti-CCR-3 and by treatment with
   B pertussis toxin, Chondrocytes obtained from osteoarthritic tissue
   showed an increased expression of CCR-3 and possibly of CXCR-1, and an
   augmented release of matrix-degrading enzymes compared with chondrocytes
   from normal donors.
   Conclusion. Our findings suggest the existence in human chondrocytes of
   a novel catabolic pathway, primed by chemokines and their receptors,
   that leads to the breakdown of cartilage matrix components.}},

Abstract = {{We have recently developed a simple method to investigate the colonic
   response to food (CRF). This study describes the modifications of CRF
   induced by treatment with oral pinaverium bromide in irritable bowel
   syndrome (IBS) patients.
   Thirty healthy subjects and 43 patients suffering from IBS were studied.
   Colonic transit Lime (CTT) was measured in fasting conditions and after
   eating a standard test meal. Colonic response to food was quantified by
   calculating the variation in number of markers in each zone of interest
   of the large bowel between the X-ray films of the abdomen taken before
   and after eating.
   CRF is characterized by caudal propulsion of colonic contents in the two
   groups. In controls, there is emptying of the caecum-ascending colon
   region and filling of the rectosigmoid. In IBS patients, only the left
   transverse colon and the splenic flexure empty. Pinaverium bromide
   exerts no effect in controls but reverses the CRF of the right colon in
   IBS patients by inhibiting right colon emptying.
   These results suggest that the inhibitory action of pinaverium bromide
   on CRF may support the clinical efficacy of this calcium channel blocker
   in the treatment of IBS. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales

Abstract = {{The knowledge of the actual temperature of a metal line is fundamental
   in electromigration tests. It depends on the feasibility of thermal
   resistance measurements on the test structures. This work deals with the
   typical problems associated with the evaluation of the thermal
   resistance of Al-Cu test structures. As a consequence of significant
   copper-precipitation-induced resistance drops during high temperature
   electrical and thermal characterisation of the lines, it is shown that
   the derived thermal resistance value is a decreasing function of the
   measurement elapsed time. Thermal characterisations performed at
   temperatures lower than those typically used allowed us to overcome this
   kind of problem. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic technique, Raman scattering and NMR spectroscopy are employed
   to study the structural and dynamical properties of aqueous solutions of
   alpha.alpha-trehalose, at different temperature and concentration
   values. What emerges is that trehalose, whose hydration number keeps
   almost constant with temperature, shows a destructuring effect on the
   tetrahedral network of water. The outstanding feature of this result is
   that trehalose, by such a destructuring effect, reduces the
   microviscosity experienced by the diffusive entities. This is confirmed
   by a test of the Stokes-Einstein relation, where an anomalous
   translational diffusive process, consisting in an enhanced diffusion
   with respect to that predicted by hydrodynamic theory under stick
   conditions, is revealed. This latter finding, connected with the
   presence of strong solute-solvent interactions, supports the role of
   trehalose as a structure-breaker. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   The analysis is carried out in an OLG model with two types of

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{529-554}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper assesses the effects of Berle and Means' study of the
   separation of corporate ownership from control on corporate financial
   reporting theory, research and policy. Their focus on shareholders and
   managers provided a starting point for the subsequent development of
   agency theory such that this relationship has come to dominate capital
   markets research and policy, to the virtual exclusion of parallel issues
   involving other parties. Berle and Means' omission of the role of
   investment funds led them to conclude that the separation of ownership
   from control problems was located between shareholders and company
   managers. We document the inaccuracy of this conclusion using historical
   and contemporary US evidence and contemporary evidence for Germany,
   Japan, South Africa, and Canada. In contrast to Berle and Means, we find
   that investment fund influence and control over companies is pervasive
   and probably a common characteristic of modern capital markets. Our
   analysis shows how viewing the capital markets setting from a richer,
   two-tier perspective involving investors, investment managers, and
   company managers results in quite different and better perspectives on
   financial reporting issues, particularly in terms of company reporting
   to funds, and fund reporting to investors. Consequently, we suggest that
   our understanding of capital markets may be improved by studying and
   portraying more diverse types of parties and their relationships than
   just managers and owners. This perspective subsumes the single-tier
   principal-agent model and allows multiple relationships to be portrayed
   and studied. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The author explores the relationship between rationality, ethics, and
   space. He argues that the contemporary ethical project involves a
   derationalisation of ethics through a recorporealisation of space. There
   is a move away from the abstract space of liberal- individualist notions
   of justice to more enclosed and local spaces of communitarian loyalties
   and intersubjective communication. Postmodern interventions into the
   ethical realm lead us to a corporealised, intimate space that recognises
   difference and is heavy with phenomenological presence. The author
   argues that the conception of agency which explains adherence to
   community norms and the acknowledgement of difference is strategically
   rational self-interest. Situated practices and understandings of the
   other rely on rational assumptions. The time - space conditions of late
   modernity bring unlike others into more regular contact and open up the
   possibilities for more universalist forms of strong (ethical) social
   coordination based on expanded strategic rationality.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical models suggest a higher vulnerability of chronic
   schizophrenic patients for critical life events and rapid change of
   objective living circumstances. On the basis of these models one may
   hypothesise that the political change in East Germany in 1989/90 was
   objectively or subjectively distressing to such patients and had a
   negative impact on their illness. In a retrospective longitudinal study,
   we investigated patients' assessment of political change, life events
   that were potentially related to the political changes, impact of the
   changes on subjective quality of life, and hospitalization rates during
   five year periods prior to and following the change. 120 patients with
   chronic schizophrenia in East Berlin and 70 in Chemnitz were examined
   using quantitative and qualitative methods. Patients reported more
   individual freedom and better care after 1989. They complained about
   stress due to loss of employment, financial disadvantages and rising
   crime rates. Despite the occurrence of potentially change-related life
   events after 1989, patients stated very little impact of the changes on
   their illness. Retrospectively, patients in East Berlin reported a
   significantly better subjective quality of life in 1994 than in 1984.
   Hospitalization rates did not increase after 1989. The findings are not
   consistent with the hypothesis and do not suggest that political changes
   in East Germany in 1989/90 had - subjectively or objectively - a
   substantial negative effect on the illness of patients with chronic

Abstract = {{An endogenous kappa-opioid agonist reduces the duration of phasic bursts
   in vasopressin cells. Non-synaptic post-spike depolarizing
   after-potentials underlie activity during bursts by increasing
   post-spike excitability and kappa-receptor activation reduces
   depolarizing after-potential amplitude in vitro. To investigate the
   effects of kappa-opioids on post-spike excitability in vivo, we analysed
   extracellular recordings of the spontaneous activity of identified
   supraoptic nucleus vasopressin cells in urethane-anaesthetized rats
   infused with Ringer's solution (n = 17) or the kappa-agonist, U50,488H
   (2.5 mu g/h at 0.5 mu l/h; n = 23), into the supraoptic nucleus over 5
   days. We plotted the mean hazard function for the interspike interval
   distributions as a measure of the post-spike excitability of these
   cells. Following each spike, the probability of another spike firing in
   vasopressin cells recorded from U50,488H infused nuclei was markedly
   reduced compared to Ringer's treated vasopressin cells. To determine
   whether U50,488H could reduce post-spike excitability in cells that
   displayed spontaneous phasic activity, we infused U50,488H (50 mu g/h at
   1 mu l/h, i.c.v.), for 1-12 h while recording vasopressin cell activity.
   Nine of 10 vasopressin cells were silenced by i.c.v. U50,488H 15 +/- 5
   min into the infusion. Six cells exhibited spontaneous phasic activity
   before U50,488H infusion and recordings from three of these phasic cells
   were maintained until activity recovered; during U50,488H infusion, the
   activity of these three cells was irregular. Generation of the mean
   hazard function before and during U50,488H infusion revealed a reduction
   in post-spike excitability during U50,488H infusion. Thus,
   kappa-receptor activation reduces post-spike excitability in vivo; this
   may reflect inhibition of depolarizing after-potentials and may thus
   underlie the reduction in burst duration of vasopressin cells caused by
   an endogenous kappa-agonist in vivo.}},

   of `Holiday Which' finds that respondents generally experience
   considerably higher rates of victimisation as tourists than they are
   likely to experience while at home (when compared to the results of the
   British Crime Survey). In terms of respondents' fears of crime while on
   holiday it is found that neither crime nor incivilities are seen as a
   major issue. It is concluded that tourism crime rates that are far
   higher than crime rates within Britain have not, as yet, been translated
   into a tourism and crime problem. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Because the extracellular matrices of dentin and bone are composed
   mainly of type I collagen, their characteristics are determined by the
   nature of noncollagenous proteins (NCPs), Among these NCPs, some
   proteoglycans (PGs) belong to the small leucine-rich proteoglycans
   (SLRPs). Recently, osteoadherin (OSAD) has been described as a new
   member of this family, that is expressed by mature bovine osteoblasts,
   Here, we report the expression of OSAD messenger RNA (mRNA) in human
   dental tissues and during the development of rat molars, using in situ
   hybridization. For this purpose, we constructed a probe fur OSAD mRNA
   transcripts from human odontoblast cells cultured in vitro. Our results
   indicate that the mature human odontoblasts overexpress the OSAD gene as
   compared with cells present in the pulp core. In rat developing molars,
   mRNA transcripts were first detected in alveolar hone in 19-day-old
   embryos. At the same age, no signal was detected in any cell of the
   first molar. In more mature teeth (newborn and 2-day-old rats), OSAD
   expression starts in the polarized odontoblasts and increases in the
   secretory and mature odontoblasts, respectively. Interestingly, a
   similar pattern of expression was observed in the ameloblast layer
   responsible for the deposition of enamel mineralized matrix. Together,
   these results lead us to speculate that OSAD may be implicated in
   biomineralization processes. (C) 2000 by Elsevier Science Inc. All

Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To determine, in a preliminary cross sectional study of
   patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptured knees, which of
   the radiographic features-subchondral cortical plate thickness,
   trabecular sclerosis, and osteophytosis-appears before or in association
   with changes in joint space width (JSW) as a surrogate for articular
   cartilage thickness in patients with ruptured knees.
   Methods-19 patients (14 men), mean (95\% CI) age 28.7 (23.6 to 33.8)
   years, had ACL rupture in one knee only, confirmed by arthroscopy.
   Anterior draw, Lachman's test, and pivot shift tests were performed and
   x5 posteroanterior macroradiographs of both knees in a standing
   semiflexed view were taken at a mean (95\% CI) time from injury of 34.3
   (26.9 to 41.7) months. In each radiograph, computerised methods were
   used to measure minimum JSW and fractal signature analysis (FSA) to
   quantify the vertical and horizontal trabecular organisation, osteophyte
   area, and the subchondral cortical plate thickness, in the medial and
   lateral tibial compartments of all knees.
   Results-Physical examination confirmed the presence of joint laxity in
   the injured knees. No statistical difference in either medial or lateral
   JSW and subchondral cortical plate thickness was detected between ACL
   ruptured and uninjured knees. FSA showed a significant decrease in
   fractal dimension for the horizontal trabeculae (size 0.42 mm) in the
   medial compartment of the ACL ruptured knees compared with the uninjured
   knees (p<0.01, multivariate analysis of variance). There was an inverse
   correlation (R -0.74) between the time since knee injury and the
   difference in FSA values for ACL ruptured and uninjured knees in medial
   compartment horizontal trabeculae (size 0.4 mm). No significant changes
   were detected in the lateral compartment. Osteophytes were detected in
   the medial compartment of nine ACL injured knees.
   Conclusion-Compared with the uninjured knee, ACL rupture leads to
   thickening of subchondral horizontal trabeculae (decreased FSA) in the
   medial tibial compartment of all knees, reaching significance at about
   four years after injury. Osteophytes were present in the same
   compartment in 9/19 knees. No changes in JSW and subchondral cortical
   plate thickness were detected. Whether the bony changes detected in
   these ACL ruptured knees presage those of early osteoarthritis requires
   further study.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to evaluate the magnitude of reduction in
   cooling and reheat energy when a heat pipe system is incorporated with
   the cooling coil of an air-conditioning system. The heat pipe/cooling
   coil (HP/CC) system performance is determined by several parameters that
   are related to both the air-conditioner cooling coil and the heat pipe
   physical characteristics as well as the condition of the air entering
   and leaving the system. In order to appreciate the impact of these
   parameters and their relative influence on energy consumption and the
   required indoor air conditions, a simple mathematical model
   incorporating the parameters of HP/CC is formulated. The model describes
   the overall system performance at varying entering and leaving air
   conditions. The model is then applied to a case study as an example of
   an application to investigate these relationships for a better
   understanding of the system behaviour and the influencing design
   parameters, It is evident that due to the coupling nature of the heat
   pipe and the cooling coil actions, a unique system performance will be
   obtained for each combination of heat pipe effectiveness and cooling
   coil by-pass factor. A proper selection of both the heat pipe and the
   cooling coil characteristics is found to be necessary for a satisfactory
   performance under the given operating conditions. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Historically, emulsified acids have primarily been used in fracture
   acidizing. By combining information from theoretical studies,
   experimental studies, and field testing, a better understanding has
   recently been gained of the application of emulsified acids in matrix
   acidizing. This paper discusses the use of emulsified acid as a
   stimulation fluid for matrix treatments in heterogeneous carbonate
   formations.
   Emulsified acid is diffusion retarded which makes it an effective
   wormholing fluid at low injection rates that occur, for example, in low
   permeabiliy or damaged formations. At these low rates, plain HCl acid
   will mostly spend on the formation face and is unable to create
   wormholes that penetrate deep into the formation.
   In this paper, results of flow tests are presented that compare the
   efficiency of emulsified acid with that of plain HCl acid. Several
   emulsified acid systems were tested. The effects of the injection rate,
   viscosity, and acid/oil volume ratio were analyzed on core samples.
   Rheological properties and temperature stability (up to 250 degrees F)
   of the emulsion systems were analyzed by means of Fann-50 tests.
   Acid-in-oil emulsions are effective stimulation fluids in large
   intervals where streaks of high permeability can act as thief zones.
   This is shown by means of example calculations of the fluid flow and
   distribution in a well.}},

Abstract = {{It is established that the magnitude of the discontinuity in the slope
   of a pulse-switching curve defined as the ratio between the switching
   coefficients S-w1 and S-w2 corresponding to the first and second parts
   of the switching curve, respectively, decreases with an increase in the
   thickness of a ferrous borate single crystal. This change is generally
   caused by a decrease in the coefficient S-w1, whose magnitude is
   inversely proportional to the sample's thickness. In order to analyze
   the results obtained, we used the early proposed expression tau(-1) =
   aH(s) - bA(2), connecting the switching rate tau(-1) with the amplitude
   of the magnetic field H-s and the intensity A of the magnetoelastic
   vibrations accompanying the pulse switching. It is found that the
   coefficient a depends only slightly on the sample's thickness, while the
   coefficient b is inversely proportional to the thickness squared. Thus,
   the main part of the energy losses due to magnetoelastic vibrations is
   associated with elastic lattice vibrations. (C) 2000 MAIK

Abstract = {{ICP27 is an essential herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)
   immediate-early protein that regulates viral gene expression by poorly
   characterized mechanisms. Previous data suggest that its carboxyl
   (C)-terminal portion is absolutely required for productive viral
   infection. In this study, we isolated M16R, a second-site revertant of a
   viral ICP27 C-terminal mutant, M16R harbors an intragenic re-version, as
   demonstrated by the fact that its cloned ICP27 allele can complement the
   growth of an HSV-1 ICP27 deletion mutant. DNA sequencing demonstrated
   that the intragenic reversion is a frameshift alteration in a
   homopolymeric run of C residues at codons 215 to 217. This results in
   the predicted expression of a truncated, 289-residue molecule bearing 72
   novel C-terminal residues derived from the +1 reading frame. Consistent
   with this, M16R expresses an ICP27-related molecule of the predicted
   size in the nuclei of infected cells. Transfection-based viral
   complementation assays confirmed that the truncated, frameshifted
   protein can partially substitute for ICP27 in the context of viral
   infection. Surprisingly, its novel C-terminal residues are required for
   this activity. To see if the frameshift mutation is all that is required
   for M16R's viability, we re-engineered the M16R ICP27 allele and
   inserted it into a new viral background, creating the HSV-1 mutant
   M16exC. An additional mutant, exCd305, was constructed which possesses
   the frameshift in the context of an ICP27 gene with the C terminus
   deleted. We found that both M16exC and enCd305 are nonviable in Vero
   cells, suggesting that one or more extragenic mutations are also
   required for the viability of M16R, Consistent with this interpretation,
   we isolated two viable derivatives of exCd305 which grow productively in
   Vero cells despite being incapable of encoding the C-terminal portion of
   ICP27, Studies of viral DNA synthesis in mutant-infected cells indicated
   that the truncated, frameshifted ICP27 protein can enhance viral DNA
   replication. In summary, our results demonstrate that the C-terminal
   portion of ICP27, conserved widely in herpesviruses and previously
   believed to be absolutely essential, is dispensable for HSV-1 lytic

Abstract = {{The recently discovered, nearby young supernova remnant in the southeast

   measurements of nitrate abundances in Antarctic ice cores. Such an
   interpretation of this 20-year-old ice-core data would provide a more
   accurate dating of this supernova than is possible purely using
   astrophysical techniques. It permits an inference of the supernova's
   Ti-44 yield purely on an observational basis, without reference to
   supernova modelling. The resulting estimates of the supernova distance
   and light-arrival time are 200 pc and 700 years ago, implying an
   expansion speed of 5000 km/s for the supernova remnant. Such an
   expansion speed has been argued elsewhere to imply the explosion to have

Abstract = {{We have investigated the magnetic properties of three differently
   prepared samples of the spinel ZnFe2 O-4 with mu SR, neutron
   diffraction, Mossbauer effect and magnetization measurements. Below T-N
   = 10.5 K, the first sample (annealed) shows long-range antiferromagnetic
   order in coexistence with short-range magnetic order. The second sample
   (rapidly quenched) shows only short-range magnetic order. The third
   sample (nanostructured with an average particle size of about 9 nm)
   exhibits ferromagnetism below T-c approximate to 460 K combined with
   superparamagnetism. Below the blocking temperature of similar to 50 K
   the nanostructured sample exhibits a dependence on applied magnetic
   fields similar to that observed in spin glass systems. The roles of
   cation-site occupation and magnetic couplings in governing the different
   magnetic behaviors exhibited by the samples are discussed. (C) 2000

   pattern in rat cortex was investigated by functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) using the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)

   compare a conventional, loud fMRI sequence with a new sequence, in which
   the noise level was reduced by about 30 dB. In the second approach, the
   inner ear of the animal was destroyed, resulting in deafness. We
   compared the activation patterns obtained with both sequences before and
   after cochleotomy. The activated area was larger when data were sampled
   with background noise, and was also larger before cochleotomy than
   after. Thus, facilitation of somatosensory activation is induced by

Abstract = {{Case management was originally a specific, tightly defined, role
   developed for the care of de-institutionalised psychiatric patients in

   is now widely used throughout mental health care (and beyond).
   Predictably it is now sur rounded by ambiguity and controversy. This
   paper explores its history-from the age of innocence, through that of
   controversy, to consolidation. It attempts to identify what, if
   anything, is unique to the approach by examining the reported features
   of its most developed form (Assertive Community Treatment). It goes on
   to speculate on whether such a `generic' role will survive the
   increasing range of evidence based mental health interventions that are

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate further the role of chlamydiae
   as pathogens in the genital tracts of sows at slaughter. Genital tracts
   of 101 randomly selected sows were collected and specimens of genital
   tract localizations were systematically examined for chlamydiae using
   immunohistochemistry and PCR. In the genital tracts of 10 sows,
   Chlamydia psittaci DNA was detected by PCR, and was further typed as
   `serotype 1' in nine cases and as avian strain 6 BC in one animal.
   However, all specimens examined by immunohistochemistry were negative
   for chlamydiae. Pooled samples of scalding tank water were additionally
   investigated for 95 animals. Of these samples, 63.2\% contained
   chlamydial DNA, mostly C. trachomatis, and in one sample C. psittaci
   `serotype 1'. Although in most cases contamination through influx of
   faecally contaminated scalding water is a possible reason for thr
   positive PCR results in the genital tract, latent infection cannot be
   excluded. In conclusion, the results obtained suggest that chlamydiae
   are of no or only minor importance in the examined group of Swiss
   breeding sows. Nevertheless, the role and significance of chlamydiae as
   pathogens in porcine reproductive disorders remain unresolved and
   require further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. TO determine whether the calcium channel blocker
   D-cis-diltiazem promotes photoreceptor survival in rats with the
   Pro23His rhodopsin mutation.
   METHODS. Heterozygous Pro23His rhodopsin line 1 rats (n = 11) were
   treated daily, according to a protocol applied successfully in rd mice,
   with D-cis-diltiazem hydrochloride increased incrementally from 21 to 54
   mg/kg in a divided dose (8 AM and 8 PM) administered by intraperitoneal
   (IP) injection for 21 days, beginning on days of age 10 through 12.
   Saline-treated line 1 rats (n = 6) received IP injections of an equal
   volume of 0.9\% saline. Analysis on day 35 of age included dark-adapted
   corneal electroretinogram (ERG) b- and a-waves recorded from threshold
   to 0.63 log candela-seconds {[}cd-s]m(2), saturated a-waves elicited
   with a 2.1 log cd-s/m(2) flash, and morphometry of the outer nuclear
   layer (ONL) and rod outer segments (ROS).
   RESULTS. ONL width and cell counts of diltiazem-treated and
   saline-treated animals at 35 days were reduced to 64\%-68\% of
   15-day-old untreated P23H line 1 retinas. No photoreceptor rescue was
   found by measuring ONL width (P = 0.84), cell count (P = 0.42), or ROS
   length (P = 0.85). Functional assays by ERG b-wave threshold (P = 0.57),
   b-wave maximum amplitude (P = 0.46), and saturated a-wave amplitude (P =
   0.53) also showed no rescue.
   CONCLUSIONS. D-cis-Diltiazem did not rescue photoreceptors of Pro23His
   rhodopsin mutation line 1 rats treated according to the protocol used in
   rd mouse.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze various scenarios for entangling two initially unentangled

   the fidelity of its performance (i.e., the distance between the output
   and the ideally entangled-symmetrized state) does not depend on the
   input and takes the constant value F = (9 + 3 root 2)/14 similar or

Abstract = {{The concept of a fibrant extension of compacts can he used in the study
   of some properties related to different conditions of movability. For
   example, ``empty{''} strong shape components of a given compact metric
   space X correspond to those path components of a fibrant extension (X)
   over tilde of X which do not intersect X. The fibrant extension (X) over
   tilde can be constructed as a cotelescope of an ANR-sequence associated
   with X. Using this representation of (X) over tilde, we prove the
   following: If a continuum is movable and virtually pointed 1-movable,
   then it is pointed movable.
   As a corollary, we get immediately that movable continua, which do not
   have ``empty{''} strong shape components, are pointed movable. In
   particular, continua, both fibrant and movable, are of this kind. In
   fact, they are locally path connected approximate polyhedra.}},

Abstract = {{Two numerical methods for reliability assessment for composite

   (MC) technique that assigns discrete failure probabilities from local
   stresses and empirical failure probabilities, and a parametric
   probability product (PP) method where the joint probability of survival
   is from a product over a set of heterogeneous finite elements. The two
   methods are verified for known cases and then applied to random
   composite microstructures that are not amenable to direct analysis.
   While the MC method is computationally more expensive and less accurate
   than the PP method, it produces a distribution of failure predictions.
   The distribution places confidence intervals on survival probabilities
   or estimates for the number of physical experiments required to predict
   Weibull parameters. A composite microstructure does not have a failure
   distribution of the same form as its homogeneous composite parts, but
   its form is readily understood. (C) 2000 Acra Metallurgica inc.

   compare the timing of large political changes to the dating of these
   structural breaks. We find that changes in party control of either a

   timing of real rate shifts, while changes in the Federal Reserve chair
   are generally inconsistent with real rate regime shifts.}},

Abstract = {{The following considerations are intended to show that some
   philosophical insights of Quine and Davidson about interpretation and
   translatability are also profitable for social scientists interested in
   the topic of intercultural understanding and intercultural
   communication. In the first part of the paper (sections II, III), a
   reconstruction of the problem of the ``indeterminacy of translation{''}
   (Quine) is undertaken; then a discussion of the pros and cons of the
   ``principle of charity{''} (Quine and Davidson) with its implications
   far the limitation of relativism follows.
   In the second part of the paper (sections IV, V), the thesis is advanced
   that openness of analytical philosophy toward the social sciences - an
   openness whose seeds are already present in Quine and Davidson - is one
   essential condition for dealing adequatly with the problem of
   relativism. On the other hand, it is argued that scepticism toward the
   understanding and mediation of cultural strangeness might benefit from
   Davidson's critical approach to the idea of different and
   incommensurable ``conceptual schemes{''}. The topic of the convergence
   of analytical thinking and the social sciences, finally, is taken up
   again and deepened in section VI in the contest of the connection
   between language, meaning, rule, and understanding (ethnomethodology; A.
   Schutz). The conclusion is that the understanding and mediation of
   cultural strangeness begins in each person's own cultural community. In
   Quine's and Davidson's words: ``radical translation begins at home.{''}}},

Abstract = {{It is now well know that a small addition of salt to a micellar solution

   Go (the elastic modulus) or tau(R) (the relaxation time) are in
   agreement with the hypothesis of a diminution of the mean micellar
   length when, after the maximum go, the salt content increases. In the
   non-linear behaviour (non-Newtonian viscosity) the evolution of (gamma)
   over dot(c) (which defines the occurrence of the shear thinning) with

   sex/school-attendance/age-structured population dynamic model was used
   to predict trends in infection and early disease. Four treatment dt
   livery strategies were compared: school-based (coverage of 85\%) and
   school-aged targeted (coverage of 25, 50 and 85\%;). The school-aged
   targeted strategies also included the school-based programme. For each
   alternative strategy, the maximum unit cost was calculated to obtain a
   cost-effectiveness ratio equal or smaller to the one obtained with the
   school-based programme (unit cost of US\$ 0.60). The analysis showed
   that, for S. mansoni in Lower Egypt, a programme where only 85\% of
   children attending school were treated would still prevent 77\% of the
   early disease cases prevented with a programme where 85\% of all
   school-ago children were treated. However, using the school-aged
   targeted strategy, from US\$ 0.06 to US\$ 1.03 extra unit costs could be
   spent to reach lion-enrolled children and still be more cost-effective.
   Treating non-enrolled children is an important consideration in
   maximizing the effectiveness of treatment programmes while maintaining a
   cost-effectiveness comparable to school-based delivery.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a back care

   practical performance and a back care knowledge test. Forty-two subjects
   and 36 controls performed a pre-test and were tested within 1 wk after
   the programme. To monitor effects and follow-up effects on a larger
   sample, 82 different pupils were tested within 1 wk after the programme
   and 116 other children 3 mo after. Both larger samples were compared
   with one group of 129 controls. Interrater reliability for the test
   items of the practical assessment was high; intraclass correlation
   coefficients varied from 0.785 to 0.980. In the pre/post design study,

   higher sum scores for the knowledge test and for all practical
   assessment items were found in the intervention groups, tested within 1
   wk and 3 mo after the programme, in comparison with the control group (p
   < 0.001).
   Conclusion: The effectiveness of a primary educational prevention
   programme back care principles was demonstrated in this study.
   Effectiveness, long-term outcomes and behavioural changes need further
   evaluation to optimize back care prevention programmes for elementary
   schoolchildren.}},

Abstract = {{Institutions are rules that constrain political behavior. Although there
   is consensus that being written down is neither necessary nor sufficient
   for an institution to be effective, much research on comparative
   institutions focuses on formal, parchment, institutions. This article
   argues that parchment can contribute to the generation of shared mutual
   expectations among political actors, which are essential to the
   effectiveness of institutions. Next, the article distinguishes between
   research that emphasizes the role of institutions in aggregating
   preferences into political decisions and research that relies on
   coordination models to identify conditions favoring certain equilibrium
   outcomes when multiple equilibria are possible. The article notes the
   increasing prominence of such coordination models in research on
   comparative institutions and concludes with some reflections about the
   prospects for this trend to foster connections between institutional
   analysis and the field of comparative politics more broadly.}},

   and technological ideas and practices stemming from the Scientific
   Revolution and the Enlightenment. A definition of `network' is
   introduced in this paper as a methodological tool to characterize the
   estrangeirados. We argue that given their heterogeneous social origins,
   backgrounds and careers, they should not be seen as a homogeneous group.
   Rather, they were part of a fluid network, although they did not
   consider themselves as such. What they definitely shared was a common
   scientific culture. Analysis of the links they established on a
   voluntary and often informal basis accordingly enables us to identify
   the aims and strategies deployed to introduce the new sciences in
   18th-century Portugal, and to understand better why their reforming
   endeavours had so little practical impact. In effect, the estrangeirados
   formed an elite which remained marginal to Portuguese society at large.
   In many instances their political options and their links to central
   power made them vulnerable to political and religious persecution. This
   considerably undermined their agenda, which aimed at bringing the
   country into the forefront of advanced European nations.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{48}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{One of the most serious late complications of the intraatrial baffle
   procedure (Mustard or Senning correction) in patients suffering from
   transposition of the great arteries, (TGA) is the late systemic right
   ventricular failure. Nearly all patients presenting with right
   ventricular dysfunction have severe associated tricuspid regurgitation.
   The surgical options for these patients include tricuspid valve
   reconstruction or replacement, staged conversion to the arterial switch
   operation and orthotopic heart transplantation. Review of 189 operative
   survivors who underwent the Mustard or Senning operation for TGA between
   1970 and 1993 in our institution revealed 12 patients (6.3 \%) who died
   from severe systemic right ventricular dysfunction (mean follow-up
   16+/-3.5 years), which was the most common cause of late death. All of
   them had concomitant severe tricuspid regurgitation. 7 patients (3.7 \%)
   died from sudden cardiac death. The actuarial survival at 10 years is 93
   \% for simple TGA and 85 \% for TGA associated with ventricular septum
   defect or coarctation. At our institution, 4 adolescent or adult
   patients underwent tricuspid valve surgery; tricuspid valve replacement
   was performed in 2 patients and valve repair in 2 patients. In the
   mid-term follow-up, 2 of these patients died. Two additional patients
   underwent orthotopic heart transplantation, and one died on the waiting
   list. Staged conversion from the Senning/Mustard atrial repair to the
   arterial switch operation was initially reported by Mee. The procedure
   for pulmonary artery banding starts with inducing left ventricular
   reconditioning with subsequent arterial switch. The mortality of this
   two-staged procedure was as high as 20 \% to 30 \% in our early
   experience, and some of the candidates underwent heart transplantation.
   Tricuspid valve repair or replacement do not improve right ventricular
   function in patients with a failing right ventricle following the
   Mustard/Senning operation. Staged conversion to arterial switch may
   improve right ventricular function by decreasing the work load of the
   right ventricle and provides anatomic repair with left
   ventricle-to-aorta continuity. Orthotopic heart transplantation is the
   only alternative if the left ventricle does not respond to pulmonary
   artery banding.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines existing equation sets describing neural membrane
   ionic currents, such as the Hodgkin-Huxley (1952) equations, used to
   define the membrane currents in a numerical model of the auditory neuron
   and determines their adequacy for modeling the summation and refraction
   properties of auditory neurons in response to electrical stimulation.
   Specifically, the summation and refraction time constants of each
   equation set are compared to physiological measures of these time
   constants. Since previous studies have shown the cell body and
   peripheral process of the auditory neuron may influence the measurement
   of neural time constants, the physiological time constants used for
   comparison are those which were recorded using intrameatal electrical
   stimulation. The intrameatal electrode should stimulate the neuron in an
   area where the axon has a uniform geometry. Accordingly, the neural
   model used to duplicate this experiment was also of uniform geometry. Of
   the membrane equation sets evaluated, none was clearly superior for
   modeling both the refraction and summation properties of the auditory
   neuron, though some equation sets were capable of accurately modeling
   either the refraction or the summation properties, provided operating
   temperatures were adjusted to provide appropriate kinetics. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Entrainment of 0 + riverine fish (mostly pelagic cyprinids) by a power

   shortly after dusk. Entrainment and drift of benthic species, and of
   fish older than 0 +, were negligible. Mortality following entrainment
   was 100\%. Impingement of fish on the intake screens was negligible,
   probably because individuals larger than the screen mesh were able to
   escape the intake current. The species composition and
   length-frequencies of the drifting fish, but not their overall
   abundance, showed some variation with distance from the river margin. It
   is argued that the fish vulnerable to entrainment are those 0 +

   system was a subsystem of a telecommunications product and was developed
   using the Shlaer-Mellor method. From this study, we found that there was
   little use of OO constructs such as inheritance and, therefore,
   polymorphism. It was also found that there was a significant difference
   in the defect densities between those classes that participated in
   inheritance structures and those that did not, with the former being
   approximately three times more defect-prone. We were able to construct
   useful prediction systems for size and number of defects based upon
   simple counts such as the number of states and events per class.
   Although these prediction systems are only likely to have local
   significance, there is a more general principle that software developers
   can consider building their own local prediction systems. Moreover, we
   believe this is possible, even in the absence of the suites of metrics
   that have been advocated by researchers into OO technology. As a
   consequence, measurement technology may be accessible to a wider group

Abstract = {{When submitted to successive shear stress steps, the elastic shear
   modulus of a concentrated dispersion of soft gel particles shows an
   exponential increase from 50 to 110 Pa. A slow relaxation time ( tau(r)
   similar or equal to 500 s) attributed to the mobility of the gel
   particles within their free volume is obtained. The amplitude of the
   relaxation time distribution decreases with the number of shear stress
   sequences, indicating a progressive decrease in the free volume
   available per particle. The results are explained by an increase in the
   packing density as grains rearrange under the external constraint. A
   rate constant is determined from the evolution of the dispersion's
   elastic modulus (K similar or equal to 4 x 10(-4) s(-1)). The rate of
   compaction shows a logarithmic decrease when the initial particle's
   packing fraction is increased.}},

Abstract = {{In humans, defects of the corticospinal tract have been attributed to
   mutations in the gene encoding L1 CAM, a phenotype that is reproduced in
   L1-deficient mice. Using coculture assays, we report that Sema3A
   secreted from the ventral spinal cord repels cortical axons from
   wild-type but not from L1-deficient mice. L1 and neuropilin-1 (NP-1)
   form a stable complex, and their extracellular domains can directly
   associate. Thus, L1 is a component of the Sema3A receptor complex, and
   L1 mutations may disrupt Sema3A signaling in the growth cone, leading to
   guidance errors. Addition of soluble L1Fc chimeric molecules does not
   restore Sema3A responsiveness of L1-deficient axons; instead, it
   converts the repulsion of wild-type axons into an attraction, further
   supporting a function for L1 in the Sema3A transducing pathways within
   the growth cone.}},

Abstract = {{The vasoconstrictor effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the
   internal carotid bed of anaesthetised dogs with bilateral
   vagosympathectomy are mainly mediated by both 5-HT1B and 5-HT2
   receptors. The blockade of this vasoconstrictor effect of 5-HT by the
   combined use of the antagonists, GR127935 (5-HT1B/1D) and ritanserin
   (5-HT2,), unmasks a dose-dependent vasodilator effect of 5-HT, but not
   of sumatriptan. Therefore, the present study set out to analyse the
   pharmacological profile of this vasodilator 5-HT receptor in the
   internal carotid bed of vagosympathectomized dogs systematically
   pretreated with intravenous (i.v.) injections of GR127935 (30 mu g/kg)
   and ritanserin (100 mu g/kg). One-minute (l-min) intracarotid (i.c.)
   infusions of 5-HT (0.1-10 mu g/min), 5-carboxamido-tryptamine (5-CT;
   0.01-0.3 mu g/min), 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeO-T; 1-100 mu g/min) and
   acetylcholine (ACh; 0.003-0.1 mu g/min) resulted in dose-dependent
   increases in internal carotid blood flow (without changes in blood
   pressure or heart rate) with a rank order of agonist potency of ACh >
   5-CT >> 5-HT greater than or equal to 5-MeO-T. The internal carotid
   vasodilator responses to 5-HT, 5-CT and 5-MeO-T, which remained
   unaffected after saline (0.03 ml/kg and 0.1 ml/kg, i.v.), were
   specifically and dose-dependently blocked by i.v. administration of
   lisuride (10 mu g/kg and 30 mu g/kg), clozapine (1000 mu g/kg),
   mesulergine (300 mu g/kg and 1000 mu g/kg) and LY215840 (300 mu g/kg and
   1000 mu g/kg) with the following apparent rank order of potency:
   lisuride >> mesulergine = LY215840 greater than or equal to clozapine.
   The above results suggest that the 5-HT receptor mediating internal
   carotid vasodilatation in vagosympathectomized dogs pretreated with
   GR127935 and ritanserin is operationally similar to other 5-HT7
   receptors mediating vascular and non-vascular responses.}},

Abstract = {{1 The effects of adenosine and adenine on the gating of native sheep
   cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels were investigated. By
   examining the mechanisms underlying channel activation and by using
   comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) we have investigated the
   structural features of adenine-based ligands involved in channel
   activation.
   2 In the presence of 10 mu M cytosolic Ca2+, adenosine and adenine both
   activate the channel but only to a level approximately 10 and 20\%
   respectively of that of ATP indicating that both are partial agonists of
   low efficacy.
   3 Adenosine was able to antagonize the ATP-induced increase in open
   probability (Po) as expected for a partial agonist of low efficacy at
   the ATP sites on the cardiac RyR.
   4 GTP (100 mu M-10 mM) had no effect on channel gating indicating that
   the adenine ring structure is important for agonist activity at the
   ATP-sites on RyR.
   5 CoMFA revealed an extremely strong correlation between the structural
   features of the five ATP analogues and the ability to increase (Po). Our
   model indicates that the high efficacy of ATP results primarily from the
   large electrostatic field established by the ionized phosphate groups.
   Reducing the number of phosphate groups lowers the strength of this
   field, leading to ligands with lower efficacy. In addition, steric
   interactions between the alpha-phosphate and ribose moieties and the RyR
   are correlated with low Po.}},

   in 2D C-strings in a matrix, and an efficient range checking operation
   can be used to support pictorial query, spatial reasoning and similarity
   retrieval; therefore, they are efficient enough as compared to the
   previous approaches. From our simulation, we show that the proposed UID
   matrix strategy requires shorter time to convert the input data into the
   corresponding representation than the 2D C-string strategy, so is the
   case with query processing. Moreover: our proposed UID matrix strategy
   may require lesser storage cost than the 2D C-string strategy in some
   cases. (C) 2000 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Tympanometry for diagnosis and treatment of otitis media in general
   practice}},
Journal = {{FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of
   tympanometry for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of otitis media in
   general practice.
   Methods. The results from otoscopy performed by 40 physicians in general
   practice in Vejle County, Denmark were combined with the clinical
   condition and this was recorded as the preliminary decision about
   diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. Subsequently, tympanometry was
   performed in 3176 children aged between 1 month and 16 years; a total of
   6352 tympanometries. With this added knowledge, a final decision about
   diagnosis, treatment and follow-up was recorded. The practitioners were
   trained in performing tympanometry including the interpretation of the
   results. Simultaneously, they were involved in the establishment of
   guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of otitis media in
   general practice. The main outcome measures were changes between
   preliminary and final decisions about diagnoses, treatments and
   follow-up regimens.
   Results. Tympanometry was performed successfully in 87.7\% of the
   children, and in 26.4\% changes in diagnoses were found. However,
   tympanometry did not influence the distributions of the main outcome
   measures in the sample as a whole. Uncomplicated cases were checked in
   general practice and referrals to specialists were not increased.
   Conclusion. Tympanometry can be performed successfully in general
   practice after appropriate instruction. In 26.4\% of children, the
   diagnoses were changed, which may result in more appropriate treatment
   and follow-up. Tympanometry is a clinically relevant supplement to the
   examination of a child in general practice.}},

Abstract = {{SETTING: Cases of rifampin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the
   prison population in Madrid and from the general population in Spain.
   OBJECTIVE: To identify the rpoB mutations associated with resistance to
   rifampin and to investigate rpoB genotyping as an epidemiological marker
   in rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis.
   DESIGN: Twenty-nine rifampin-resistant clinical isolates of M.
   tuberculosis, 15 obtained from the prison population in Madrid and 14
   from the general population in Spain, were characterized by sequence
   analysis of the 81-bp core region of the rpoB gene and IS6110 DNA
   fingerprinting.
   RESULTS: All the isolates had mutations in rpoB, with those in codon 531
   accounting for 41\% of the total. Twenty-three (79\%) isolates were
   highly resistant to rifampin (minimum inhibitory concentration greater
   than or equal to 64 mg/L). Nineteen different IS6110 fingerprints were
   observed: one was shared by seven isolates, one by three, two by two,
   and 15 were unique. Two IS6110 clusters could be divided into
   subclusters on the basis of rpoB analysis. Epidemiologic links were
   identified among patients whose isolates had identical IS6110 patterns
   and rpoB genotypes, but not between those with identical IS6110 patterns
   and different rpoB genotypes.
   CONCLUSION: Characterization of rpoB mutations can provide information
   about susceptibility to rifampin and be a useful epidemiological tool
   for discrimination of rifampin-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis with
   identical IS6110 fingerprints.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to determine if uterine vascular impedance
   increases with advancing age in women undergoing ovarian stimulation for
   IVF. A group of 162 women who had undergone conventional IVF and embryo
   transfer was subdivided into three subgroups by age: 30-34 years (n =
   49), 35-39 years (n = 79) and 40-44 years (n = 34). The pulsatility
   index (PI) and resistance index (RI) of the right and left uterine
   arteries were measured at baseline, on the day of oocyte retrieval, and
   at the mid-luteal phase. There were no differences in the average PI or
   RI by age at any phase of the cycle. In all age groups, the luteal phase
   values of PI and RI were lower than those observed earlier in the cycle.
   Endometrial thickness was not associated with age. There was no
   significant correlation between PI, RI and serum oestradiol and
   progesterone concentrations at any phase of the cycle. Ovarian response,
   as measured by average number of oocytes retrieved, decreased
   significantly with age. Thus, reduced pregnancy rates in older women
   undergoing ovarian stimulation are more likely to occur because of
   oocyte quality and quantity rather than uterine senescence. If future
   studies determine that the use of ovarian stimulation does decrease
   implantation rates more in older versus younger women, mechanism other
   than increased uterine vascular impedance must be sought.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive study on plasma-process-induced damage (P21D) in
   sputtered TiN metal-gated devices with 4 nm N2O-nitrided oxide was
   performed. We found that the TiN metal-gated devices exhibit a
   significant 8 Angstrom reduction in the effective oxide thickness, due
   to physical damage caused by sputtering and/or oxide consumption during
   the postannealing step. We also found that the postdeposition rapid
   thermal annealing (RTA) temperature affects both the flat-band voltage
   (V-fb) and the interface state density (Di,). Furthermore, degradation
   in the gate-oxide integrity caused by severe charging damage by the
   additional plasma processes in the TiN metal gate process flow was also
   observed. The P2ID leads to significant degradation in the
   charge-to-breakdown and a gate leakage current increase, even for the
   genuinely robust nitrided oxide used in this study. Finally, Nz plasma
   posttreatment was proposed as an effective method for suppressing the
   gate leakage current.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal parameter-based criterion functions are of great practical
   importance to predict dispersed microporosity in castings. Using an
   experimental approach, the present study is a pioneering application of
   the thermal parameter-based criterion functions to predict the
   microporosity formation in lost foam casting (LFC) of A356 alloy. A
   series of plate castings with controlled hydrogen content were made with
   various thermal conditions by varying the dimensions of feeders and in
   gate design. Extensive analysis of the thermal parameters shows that
   changing the gate and feeder design modifies the distribution of the
   thermal parameters; furthermore, it influences the distribution of
   microporosity along the central line of the plate castings. The thermal
   parameters and criterion functions based on Darcy's law show
   consistency, thus supporting the interdendritic feeding mechanism of
   microporosity formation. The criterion functions such as Niyama, LCC,
   and KCL can he used to predict microporosity formation during
   solidification of LPC, depending on the hydrogen content in the casting.
   The limitation of the interdendritic feeding mechanism and the effect of
   hydrogen on the gas pore formation are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The Helicoverpa armigera single-nucleocapsid nucleopslyhedrovirus
   (HearNPV) has been registered and is commercially produced in China as a
   biopesticide to control the bollworm in cotton. However, the virus has a
   relatively slow speed of action. To improve its efficacy, recombinant
   HearNPVs were generated by deleting the ecdysteroid
   UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt) gene (HaCXW1 and HaLM2) or by inserting
   the insect-specific toxin gene AaIT in the egt locus (HaCXW2) of HearNPV
   using conventional recombination strategies in insect cell culture. The
   various recombinants remained genetically stable when cultured in HzAM1
   insect cells. Bioassay data showed a significant reduction in the time
   required for all HearNPV recombinants to kill second instar H. armigera
   larvae. The LT50 of the egt deletion recombinants HaCXW1 and HaLM2 was
   about 27\% faster than that of wild-type HearNPV. The largest reduction
   in LT50 was achieved by inserting the gene for the insect-specific
   neurotoxin, AaIT, in the egf locus, giving a reduction in LT50 of 32\%
   compared to wild-type HearNPV, The ability to genetically improve the
   properties of HearNPV as a biopesticide provides a further opportunity
   to develop this virus into a commercially viable product to control the
   bollworm in China. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Urea occurs naturally in many food products, and its presence affects
   food quality. However, little is known about its impact on flavor
   generation in food production. In this study, the urea contents in beef,
   pork, and chicken were determined. The effects of urea and pH on thermal
   flavor generation were investigated using the model system of cysteine
   with ribose, which was heated to the roasting temperature of 180 degrees
   C for 2 h at pH 5 and pH 8.5. The results revealed relatively large
   amounts of urea in these meats and demonstrated that pH affects aroma
   generation. Volatiles identified from the reaction system of ribose and
   cysteine showed that sulfur-containing compounds such as thiophenes,
   thiazoles, and thiophenethiols were the most abundant compounds. The
   addition of urea into the reaction mixture caused the disappearance or
   reduction in content; of some sulfur-containing compounds but resulted
   in the generation of several important nitrogen-containing volatiles,
   like pyrazine, methylpyrazine, 2,5- (and 2,6-)dimethylpyrazine and other
   alkylpyrazines, which are known to elicit roasty, nutty flavor notes. A
   plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that ammonia can be
   released from urea upon heating and the formed ammonia competes with
   hydrogen sulfide to react with Maillard reaction precursors to produce
   nitrogen-containing compounds such as alkylpyrazines.}},

Abstract = {{Bilayer vesicles form readily from mixtures of charged and neutral
   surfactants. When such a mixed vesicle binds an oppositely charged
   object, its membrane partially demixes: the adhesion zone recruits more
   charged surfactants from the rest of the membrane. Given an unlimited
   supply of adhering objects one might expect the vesicle to remain
   attractive until it was completely covered. Contrary to this
   expectation, we show that a vesicle can instead exhibit adhesion
   saturation, partitioning spontaneously into an attractive zone with
   definite area fraction, and a repulsive zone. The latter zone rejects
   additional incoming objects because counterions on the interior of the
   vesicle migrate there, effectively reversing the membrane's charge. The
   effect is strongest at high surface charge densities, low ionic
   strength, and with thin, impermeable membranes. Adhesion saturation in
   such a situation has recently been observed experimentally {[}H.

Abstract = {{Background Although Helicobacter pylori has been identified as a major
   cause of chronic gastritis, not all infected patients develop ulcers,
   suggesting that other factors such as lifestyle may be critical to the
   development of ulcer disease. . Obiective To investigate the role
   physical activity may play in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease. .
   Methods The participants were men (n = 8,529) and women (n = 2,884) who
   attended the Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research, Dallas, Texas,
   between 1970 and 1990. The presence of gastric or duodenal ulcer disease
   diagnosed by a physician was determined from a mail survey in 1990.
   Participants were classified into 3 physical activity groups according
   to information provided at the baseline clinic visit (before 1990):
   active, those who walked or ran 10 miles or more a week; moderately
   active, those who walked or ran less than 10 miles a week or did another
   regular activity; and the referent group consisting of those who
   reported no regular physical activity. . Results With the use of
   gender-specific proportional hazards regression models that could be
   adjusted for age, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, and
   self-reported tension, active men had a significantly reduced risk for
   duodenal ulcers (relative hazard {[}95\% confidence interval] for the
   active group, 0.38 {[}0.15-0.94], and 0.54 {[}0.30-0.96] for the
   moderately active group). No association was found between physical
   activity and gastric ulcers for men or for either type of ulcer for
   women. a Conclusion Physical activity may provide a nonpharmacologic
   method of reducing the incidence of duodenal ulcers among men.}},

Abstract = {{Crevice corrosion beneath the holidays of a disbonded coating is a
   common problem on underground pipelines. In low-conductivity soils,
   cathodic protection has not been able to mitigate the corrosion properly
   because the coating acts as a shield, blocking the flow of cathodic
   current to the pipe surface. Cathodic protection changes the chemical
   environment inside the crevice. Hydroxyl ions (OH-) are produced by an
   oxygen reduction reaction on the metal surface and increase the pH of
   solution inside the crevice. OH- also cause positively charged cations
   in the soil to migrate into the crevice and, thus, increase the ionic
   strength and solution conductivity of the crevice solution. In this
   study, a two-dimensional, steady-state, mathematical model was developed
   to predict the chemical environment changes and current/potential
   distribution within a cathodically protected crevice by taking into
   account the oxygen reduction reaction on the metal surface and the
   transport of Na+, Cl-, OH-, and dissolved O-2 into the crevice. The
   model assumed that no hydrogen ion reduction or other homogeneous
   chemical reactions were taking place inside the crevice. Numerical
   results are presented for the local current density, solution potential,
   and concentration changes of the chemical species in the crevice for a
   range of solution conductivity from 10(-3) Omega-m to 5 Omega-m.
   Dissolved 02 mostly was consumed by a cathodic reduction reaction on the
   metal surface facing the holiday opening. The remaining oxygen diffused
   into the crevice only to a depth of 4 to 5 times the crevice thickness.
   The predicted pH and solution conductivity changes agree with published
   experimental results of cathodic protection in low-conductivity
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{We sought to determine whether selected cytokines, known to stimulate
   profoundly B-cell activation and differentiation, also have as yet
   unrecognized effects upon the glycosylation of secreted Ig and/or
   membrane-associated proteins. The glycosylation of both secreted IgM and
   membrane-bound MHC Class-I synthesized by CH12LX cells was detected by
   enzyme-lectin conjugates in immunoabsorption assays. Stimulation of B
   cells with IL-4 plus IL-5 significantly decreases the terminal
   glycosylation of secreted IgM, whereas LPS has a minor effect, despite
   the fact that both stimuli are equipotent for IgM secretion, Neither LPS
   nor IL-4 plus IL-5 affect MHC Class-I expression. However, IL-4 plus
   IL-5 substantially increases the terminal glycosylation of MHC Class-I
   produced from both mIgM(+) and mIgA(+) CH12LX cells, LPS has no or a
   modest effect on the terminal glycosylation of MHC Class-I produced from
   CH12LX cells. These results suggest that Th-2-derived cytokines
   differentially influence the glycosylation of secreted and
   membrane-associated glycoproteins of B cells. In turn, this might
   elucidate the basis of aberrant glycosylation reported in conditions
   such as IgA nephropathy, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Medicare pays for 80\% of the cost of immunosuppressant agents needed
   within the first 3 years of solid organ transplantation; however, many
   patients cannot afford the remaining 20\%. Furthermore, many patients
   who are beyond 3 years post-transplantation and have prescription
   coverage cannot afford the co-payment for these medications. Other
   patients may not be able to afford their medications due to limited or
   no insurance coverage. The Medical College of Georgia (MCG) has been
   giving immunosuppressant medications to renal transplant patients if
   they cannot afford to pay for them. To assist MCG with drug cost for
   medications and maintain quality care for renal transplant patients, a
   clinical pharmacist-managed medication assistance program was
   implemented to procure immunosuppressants from pharmaceutical
   manufacturers.
   Methods: All patients enrolled in medication assistance programs from 1
   January 1998 through 31 December 1998 were included in this analysis.
   Medication acquisition costs with and without Medicare reimbursement and
   the cost of implementing the clinical pharmacist-managed medication
   assistance program were used to determine the value of implementing this
   service.
   Results: Sixty-one patients were enrolled in manufacturers' assistance
   programs and a net cost avoidance of \$124,793 was realized for the year
   of the program (benefit-to-cost ratio of 7.5:1). Assuming that the
   hospital collected the maximum amount allowed for patients receiving
   Medicare benefits, a cost avoidance of \$69,233 was calculated
   (benefit-to-cost ratio of 4.16:1).
   Conclusions: A clinical pharmacist-managed medication assistance program
   in a renal transplant clinic produced substantial cost savings over this
   1-year study period. For each dollar spent in pharmacist's time, a
   minimum of \$4 was returned to the institution.}},

Abstract = {{In May 1997, all Army dentists assigned full-time to clinical duties
   (1,100) were sent a mail survey that queried how often they deliver
   dental health promotion and preventive dentistry services and the type
   and source of their patient educational materials. By August, 606
   dentists had responded. Simple frequencies were generated using SPSS.
   Results show that tobacco, oral hygiene, and periodontal counseling and
   oral cancer and blood pressure screening are delivered frequently,
   whereas nursing caries, mouthguard, sealant, and nutrition services are
   delivered infrequently. Army dentists relied almost exclusively on oral
   presentations to deliver health promotion messages. Few used more than
   one source for health promotion materials. These results suggest that
   the delivery of dental health promotion and preventive dentistry
   services in the Army is suboptimal. A campaign to heighten provider
   awareness of the importance of delivering these services should be
   launched. The campaign should also teach providers how to make their
   health promotion efforts maximally effective through the application of
   proven health marketing techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To ascertain the feasibility and reliability of comparative
   genomic hybridization for cytogenetic evaluation of macerated
   stillbirths.
   Materials: We examined ten stillborn fetuses above 15 weeks' gestation
   whose karyotypes were unknown because of tissue culture failure. Sixteen
   fetuses that were successfully karyotyped using prenatal or postnatal
   tissues were also examined as controls, including five pregnancy
   terminations with autosomal aneuploidy, one with sex chromosome
   aneuploidy, one with a chromosomal deletion; five macerated fetuses with
   normal karyotypes, three with autosomal aneuploidy, and one with sex
   chromosome aneuploidy and discrepancy between chorionic villi and fetus.
   Results: All comparative genomic hybridization analyses in fresh and
   macerated tissues were successful except for one. All normal karyotypes
   and aneuploidies were confirmed. Comparative genomic hybridization
   failed in one fetus with a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 18.
   In the stillborn fetuses without known karyotypes, one aberrant profile
   was found; however, the results were not confirmed with interphase
   fluorescence in situ hybridization. In one fetus triploidy was diagnosed
   with DNA flow cytometry.
   Conclusion: Comparative genomic hybridization is a valuable backup
   technique for aneuploidy screening in tissues from macerated stillborn
   fetuses when tissue culture fails. Gains or losses can subsequently be
   confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, using DNA probes that
   focus on specific loci of a chromosome. ((C) 2000 by The American

Abstract = {{Honeycombs and foams, loaded at low temperatures (T < 0.3 T-m) deform by
   elastic deformation, elastic buckling and plastic collapse of their cell

   deformation, which becomes time dependant. Deformation by the
   creep-bending of cell walls has been analysed in some detail, but
   deformation by creep-buckling has not. In this paper we analyse for the

Abstract = {{We previously isolated and sequenced two genomic segments of
   Mycobacterium avium subsp.paratuberculosis, namely, f57, a
   species-specific sequence, and the p34 gene, coding for a 34-kDa
   antigenic protein. Comparison of sequences upstream of the p34 open
   reading frame (us-p34) from M. avium subsp, paratuberculosis and M.
   tuberculosis showed a 79-base deletion in M. tuberculosis. Sequence
   analysis of the p34 genes in another two species, M. bovis (strain BCG)
   and M, avium (strain D4), confirmed the differences observed between
   tuberculous and nontuberculous species. A duplex diagnostic PCR strategy
   based on coamplification of nonhomologous us-p34 and species-specific
   f57 sequences was therefore developed. Duplex PCR yielded three
   different patterns, specific either for tuberculous bacilli (M.
   tuberculosis, M. bovis, and M. africanum), for both nontuberculous
   mycobacteria M. avium and M. intracellulare, or for M, avium subsp,
   paratuberculosis. The specificity of this single-step DNA-based assay
   was assessed on DNA from cultured mycobacterial strains, as well as on a
   panel of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues from cattle.
   Molecular assay results from tissular DNA were compared to conventional
   bacteriological and histological test results, including those obtained
   by Ziehl-Neelsen staining on tissue biopsy specimens. Molecular
   discrimination was successful and confirmed the value of duplex us-p34
   and f57 sequence amplification for differential diagnosis of
   tuberculosis, paratuberculosis, or infections caused by other members of
   the M. avium complex.}},

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{3480-3487}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{The nonlinear impedance of a point Josephson junction is calculated
   under various conditions for the resistively shunted junction model in
   the presence of noise. The calculation proceeds by solving the Langevin
   equation for the mechanical problem of a Brownian particle in a tilted
   cosine potential in the presence of a strong ac force ignoring inertial
   effects. The exact solution of the infinite hierarchy of equations For
   the moments (expectation values of the Fourier components of the phase
   angle), which describe the dynamics of the junction, is expressed in
   terms of a matrix continued fraction. This solution allows one to
   evaluate the nonlinear response of the junction (nonlinear microwave
   impedance, for example) to an ac microwave current of arbitrary
   amplitude. Strong nonlinear effects in the resistance and the reactance
   are observed for large ac currents as is demonstrated by plotting the
   nonlinear response characteristics as a function of the model
   parameters. For weak ac currents and low noise strengths, our results
   agree closely with previously available linear response and nonlinear
   response noiseless solutions, respectively. Applications of the model to
   the interpretation of recent experimental data found in the literature
   for the nonlinear behavior of microwave impedance of superconducting
   weak links are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The use of an internal thoracic artery rather than a saphenous vein
   graft for left anterior descending coronary artery bypass is associated
   with improved long-term outcome. Hence, expanded use of arterial
   conduits for other coronary targets has been advocated. The radial
   artery possesses a number of anatomic features that are technically
   advantageous compared with other arterial conduits. This study will
   determine the relative patency of the radial artery compared to the
   saphenous vein for right and circumflex coronary bypass. Patients with
   graftable multivessel coronary disease and an estimated left ventricular
   ejection fraction greater than or equal to 35\% undergoing nonemergent
   primary isolated coronary bypass surgery are eligible. The right and
   circumflex vessels must have high-grade lesions (greater than or equal
   to 70\% diameter stenosis), with target segments of reasonable quality
   greater than or equal to 1.5 mm in diameter. Patients serve as their own
   controls. The radial artery is randomly allocated to bypass the right or
   circumflex territory and a saphenous vein is used for the nonradial
   site. An internal thoracic artery is used for the left anterior
   descending coronary artery in all cases. Randomization is stratified by
   center. The primary study endpoint is graft patency as determined by
   angiography, 8-12 months postoperatively. The relative patency of the
   radial artery compared with the saphenous vein will be determined using
   McNemar's test. A sample size of 464 patients will provide 80\% power
   for a two-tailed test (alpha = 0.05) for a 40\% relative reduction in
   the rate of distal anastomotic occlusion from 12\% in the saphenous vein
   to 7.2\% in the radial arteries assuming a 20\% within-patient
   correlation. A single interim analysis will be performed following
   completion of 232 angiograms. To allow for lack of follow-up angiography
   in up to 20\% of enrolled patients, we plan to randomize a total of 560
   patients. It is also our intention to assess the long-term patency (5-10
   years) of radial artery relative to saphenous vein grafts in follow-up
   studies. Three hundred patients were recruited from 12 Canadian,
   university-affiliated sites from November 1996 until February 1999, of
   which 128 patients have undergone follow-up angiography. Approximately
   80\% of those who have been followed for more than 1 year have undergone
   follow-up angiography. This trial will determine the 8-12 month patency
   of the radial artery relative to the saphenous vein for non-left
   anterior descending coronary bypass using a novel study design which
   helps control for potential bias from individual patient and vessel
   factors. Positive results would support the use of the radial artery in
   particular, and multiple arterial grafts in general. (C) Elsevier

Abstract = {{Successful radiosensitization requires that tumor cells become more
   radiosensitive without causing an equivalent reduction in the survival
   of cells of the surrounding normal tissues. Since tumor cell
   radiosensitivity can be influenced by RAS oncogene activation, we have
   hypothesized that inhibition of oncogenic RAS activity would lead to
   radiosensitization of tumors with activated RAS. We previously showed in
   tissue culture that prenyltransferase treatment of cells with activated
   RAS resulted in radiosensitization, whereas treatment of cells with
   wild-type RAS had no effect on radiation survival. Here we ask whether
   the findings obtained in vitro have applicability in vivo. We found that
   treatment of nude mice bearing T24 tumor cell xenografts with
   farnesyltransferase inhibitors resulted in a significant and synergistic
   reduction in tumor cell survival after irradiation. The regrowth of T24
   tumors expressing activated RAS was also significantly prolonged by the
   addition of treatment with farnesyltransferase inhibitors compared to
   the regrowth after irradiation alone. In contrast, there was no effect
   on the radiosensitivity of HT-29 tumors expressing wild-type RAS. These
   results demonstrate that specific radiosensitization of tumors
   expressing activated RAS oncogenes can be obtained in vivo. (C) 2000 by

Abstract = {{Background: Sixty-three consecutive patients with recurrent traumatic
   anterior shoulder instability underwent operative repair. The decision
   to select either arthroscopic Bankart repair or open capsular shift was
   based on the findings of an examination under anesthesia and the
   findings at the time of arthroscopy, Thirty-nine patients,sith only
   anterior translation on examination under anesthesia and a discrete
   Bankart lesion underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair with use of
   absorbable transfixing implants. Twenty-four patients with inferior
   translation in addition to anterior translation on examination under
   anesthesia and capsular laxity or injury on arthroscopy underwent an
   open capsular shift.
   Methods: Treatment outcomes for each group were determined according to
   the scoring systems of Rowe ct al,, the American Shoulder and Elbow
   Surgeons, and the Short Form-36, Failure was defined as recurrence of
   dislocation or subluxation or the finding of apprehension. Fifty-nine
   (94 percent) of the sixty-three patients were examined and filled out a
   questionnaire at a mean of fifty-four months (range, twenty-seven to
   seventy-two months) following surgery.
   Results: There were no significant differences between the two groups
   with regard to the prevalence of failure or any of the other measured
   parameters of outcome. An unsatisfactory outcome occurred after nine (24
   percent) of thirty-seven arthroscopic repairs and after four (18
   percent) of twenty-two open reconstructions. All cases of recurrent
   instability resulted from a reinjury in a contact sport or a fall less
   than two years postoperatively. The treatment groups did not differ with
   regard to patient age, hand dominance, mechanism of initial injury
   duration of follow-up, or delay until surgery. Measured losses of motion
   were minimal and, with the exception of forward elevation, slightly more
   of which was lost after the open capsular shifts (p = 0.05), did not
   differ between the two forms of treatment. Approximately 75 percent of
   the patients in each group returned to their favorite recreational
   sports with no or mild limitations. As rated by the patients, the result
   was good or excellent after thirty-one (84 percent) of the arthroscopic
   procedures and after twenty (91 percent) of the open procedures.
   Conclusions: Arthroscopic and open repair techniques for the treatment
   of recurrent traumatic shoulder instability yield comparable results if
   the procedure is selected on the basis of the pathological findings at
   the time of surgery.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the developmental progression and pattern of self-reported
   symptoms of social phobia (SP) and separation anxiety (SA) in community
   (n = 2,384) and clinical (n = 217) samples of children and adolescents,
   using a cross-sectional method. Method: Subjects were cross-classified
   by age, gender, and race. Using mean scores on the SP and SA subscales
   of the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, 4 categories of
   children were established: HighSP/HighSA, HighSP/LowSA, LowSP/HighSA,
   and LowSP/LowSA. Data were analyzed using a generalized legit model.
   Results: Community sample: Preadolescents and females reported more
   symptoms of HighSP/HighSA and LowSP/HighSA than adolescents and males.
   White children reported more symptoms of HighSP/LowSA, while the
   opposite pattern was found among African-American children. Clinical
   sample: Similar to the community sample, preadolescents reported more
   symptoms of HighSP/HighSA. However, clinical males reported more
   symptoms of LowSP/HighSA than clinical females. Conclusions: In general,
   adolescents endorsed more symptoms of SP and fewer symptoms of SA than
   preadolescent children. Irrespective of age, white children endorsed
   more symptoms of SP and fewer symptoms of SA than African-American
   children. In the community sample, preadolescent boys endorsed more
   symptoms of SA and fewer symptoms of SP, suggesting a possible referral
   bias. .}},

   DeMets et al. (1988) looked for, but did not find, evidence of a

   hypothesis that the large (M-W=8.2), strike-slip, 1998 Antarctic
   earthquake lies on the boundary of a microplate there termed
   ``Balleny{''}) south of the SEIR that explains the plate motion
   discrepancy. A small circle about an Antarctic-Balleny Euler pole,
   determined by plate closure, fits the east-west band of aftershocks,
   consistent with a strike-slip boundary. However, the Antarctic-Balleny
   pole predicts right-lateral slip, while the seismicity exhibits
   left-lateral, strike-slip motion. The opposite sense of slip not only
   rules out the Balleny plate hypothesis, but requires deformation
   elsewhere to accommodate both the plate motion differences along the
   SEIR and the strain accumulated from the Antarctic event.}},

Abstract = {{Online sexuality has become a much discussed topic in the 90's however
   most people continue to have a narrow and uninformed view of what this
   area truly consists of. This paper provides an overview of the
   ubiquitous and explosive effect of the Internet on sexuality and
   summarizes the following key dimensions including: internet
   relationships and how they influence face to face relationships,
   alternative communities and sexually disenfranchised people, commercial
   aspects of internet sexuality, concerns about employee morality and
   productivity, and, sexual information and education in the 21st century.
   The internet and associated technological advances will have a
   tremendous influence on every aspect of sexuality in this new
   ``information age{''} and thus we encourage professionals involved in
   this area to get informed and thereby have a say in shaping the future.
   In addition, those keeping current with these rapid developments will be
   in a position to both warn people as to the pathological aspects of
   cybersexual behavior, as well as educate them as to the more adaptive
   and expansive sex-positive opportunities offered by the internet.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this investigation was to assess the feasibility of
   secondary sewage effluent for pisciculture of Cyprinus carpio and
   Oreochromis mossambicus by considering oxidative enzymes and gill
   structure as indices. These fish were fed with a rationed amount of
   tubificid worms during acclimation and then cage-cultured in secondary
   sewage effluent for 28 days. This was followed by depuration for the
   same period when the fish were fed with the same food. During the
   experimental period respiratory quotient and activities of enzymes
   Isocitrate dehydrogenase, Succinic dehydrogenase and Lactate
   dehydrogenase were investigated at regular intervals. Gill histology was
   studied from control and experimental fish at the end of 28 days and
   after the depuration period. Cyprinus carpio cultured in secondary
   sewage effluent revealed starvation and histopathological changes in the
   gill structure which was less extensive in well-fed Oreochromis
   mossambicus. Study of correlation coefficients between respiratory
   quotient and oxidative enzymes indicate use of aerobic and anerobic
   pathways in control fish. This relationship was reversed during exposure
   in both the fish and normalcy was regained during depuration in Cyprinus
   carpio but not in Oreochromis mossambicus as they continued to show
   depressed activity of oxidative enzymes. To summarise, the fish under
   investigation behaved differently when exposed to secondary sewage
   effluent and during depuration. But the responses suggest against the
   use of secondary sewage effluent as a culture medium for these fish. (C)

Abstract = {{Cell loss in the hippocampal formation is a common event in patients
   with temporal lobe epilepsy. The belief that dentate granule neurons are
   relatively resistant to excitotoxic injury has recently been challenged
   both, in epileptic patients and in animal models of temporal lobe
   epilepsy. The nature of dentate granule cell damage in epilepsy has been
   reported as either apoptotic, necrotic or both. The lack of a consensus
   on this topic stems from use of different animal models and different
   experimental techniques for characterizing the apoptotic/necrotic
   process. Using electron microscopy for defining the, nature of cell loss
   and one of the main animal models of status epilepticus (SE) we have
   focussed on the nature of the degenerative process in dentate granule
   cells. Ultrastructural morphological changes of these cells were
   evaluated 2.5-48 h after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. A
   variety of morphologies ranging from apoptosis to necrosis, could be
   seen at 2.5 h after SE onset and continued at least over the following
   48 h. Some cells displayed coalescence of chromatin against nuclear
   membranes. In such cases however, chromatin did not have well-defined
   edges las it should, if it were apoptosis). Condensation of cytoplasm.
   present in both processes was also frequently found. Neither obvious
   apoptotic budding-off of cytoplasm nor typical membrane-bound apoptotic
   bodies were found. Our results indicate that in the dentate granule cell
   layer pilocarpine-induced SE promotes a degenerative process in which
   apoptotic and necrotic features overlap. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) vertical-component seismic noise can be reduced
   by 25 dB or more at seafloor seismic stations by subtracting the
   coherent signals derived from (1) horizontal seismic observations
   associated with tilt noise, and (2) pressure measurements related to
   infragravity waves. The reduction in effective noise levels is largest
   for the poorest stations: sites with soft sediments, high currents,
   shallow water, or a poorly leveled seismometer. The importance of
   precise leveling is evident in our measurements: low-frequency
   background vertical seismic spectra measured on a seafloor seismometer
   leveled to within 1 x 10(-4) radians (0.006 degrees) are up to 20 dB
   quieter than on a nearby seismometer leveled to within 3 x 10(-3)
   radians (0.2 degrees). The noise on the less precisely leveled sensor
   increases with decreasing frequency and is correlated with ocean tides,
   indicating that it is caused by tilting due to seafloor currents flowing
   across the instrument. At low frequencies, this tilting generates a
   seismic signal by changing the gravitational attraction on the geophones
   as they rotate with respect to the earth's gravitational field. The
   effect is much stronger on the horizontal components than on the
   vertical, allowing significant reduction in vertical-component noise by
   subtracting the coherent horizontal component noise. This technique
   reduces the low-frequency vertical noise on the less-precisely leveled
   seismometer to below the noise level on the precisely leveled
   seismometer. The same technique can also be used to remove
   ``background{''} noise due to the seafloor pressure field (up to 25 dB
   noise reduction near 0.02 Hz) and possibly due to other parameters such
   as temperature variations.}},

Abstract = {{Because they are sparsely distributed in tissues, dendritic cells (DC)
   present in nonlymphoid organs are difficult to isolate. Only DC from
   skin and lung have been successfully studied in culture. The objective
   of the present work was to investigate the possibility of isolating and
   culturing DC from an endocrine organ, the thyroid gland, which is
   particularly susceptible to the development of autoimmune processes. The
   study was conducted on pig thyroid glands to have sufficient amounts of
   starting material. This choice required the characterization of
   immunological reagents capable of recognizing DC markers in the pig
   species. Using a discontinuous trypsinization procedure, a DC population
   representing 2\% to 3\% of the thyroid cell suspension was reproducibly
   obtained. Isolated DC quantitatively attached to tissue culture-treated
   dishes and segregated from thyrocytes. DG identified as cells expressing
   major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, the mannose
   receptor, and the S100 protein were found to have a high capacity to
   internalize labeled ligands, dextran, and mannosylated albumin. These
   cells had a phenotype of immature DC. Secondarily, a fraction of DC
   detached from culture dishes, and floating DC had low or no endocytic
   activity, a characteristic of mature DG. Treatment of DC/thyrocytes
   cocultures with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) activated the
   transformation of immature DC into mature DC. These data show that DG
   isolated from the thyroid gland can be maintained immature or activated
   to undergo maturation in primary culture. The procedure of cell
   isolation and culture should be adaptable to human thyroid tissue for in
   vitro analyses of DG-mediated immune responses.}},

Abstract = {{A rainfall simulator study of total nutrient movement due to overland
   flow on forest skid trails and general harvesting areas (GHA) in the
   native eucalypt forests of southeastern Australia, confirmed that the
   disturbed and compacted areas were the dominant sources of
   sediment-bound pollutants. Low runoff production and low sediment
   availability on the rough surfaces of the Gl-IA reduced total nutrient
   yields. On the more recently disturbed and burnt sites, the solution
   pathway may have been more dominant due to runoff coming in contact with
   surface ash and charcoal. We also recorded significant reductions in the
   total nutrient yields as runoff from the skid trail was delivered to the
   adjacent hillslope via a cross bank (water bar). This was due primarily
   to coarse-grained sediment deposition at the base of the banks. Nutrient
   concentrations in the eroded sediment at the cross bank outlets,
   however, remained 9 times higher than the in-situ surface soils, due to
   the preferential delivery of fine aggregate material to the adjacent
   hillslope. Further reductions in total nutrient yields occurred as
   overland flow passed through the GHA, illustrating the effectiveness of
   vegetative filtering in reducing runoff volumes and sediment fluxes.
   Temporal trends in the data highlighted significant reductions in total
   nutrient movement on both areas of disturbance as sites regenerated over
   a period of similar to 5 years. Water pollution abatement practices in
   these environments should aim to locate skid trails to maximise the
   redistribution of runoff and sediment from highly disturbed areas to
   more vegetated parts of the hillslope, and by appropriate cross bank
   spacing, reduce the volume of overland flow carrying sediment and
   nutrients.}},

Abstract = {{In order to extend plasma accelerators, the laser beam has to be guided
   inside gas or plasma over a distance of the order of the dephasing
   length, which is typically much larger than the diffraction length z(R)
   of the laser. A capillary tube can be used as a waveguide for
   high-intensity laser pulses over distances well in excess of z(R).
   Experimental demonstration of monomode guiding over 100 z(R) of 10(16)
   W/cm(2) pulses has been obtained in evacuated capillary tubes (45-70-mum
   inner diameter). A drop of transmission has been observed when the
   intensity of the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) is high enough to
   ionize the capillary tube entrance. Propagation in helium gas-filled
   (10-40 mbar) capillary tubes has been studied at intensities up to
   10(16) W/cm(2): a plasma column with on-axis density of the order of
   10(17) cm(-3) has been created on a length of the order of 4 cm, The use
   of a capillary tube for an extended accelerator is discussed for the
   case of linear, resonant excitation of plasma waves by laser wakefield.}},

Abstract = {{Stress response proteins can play integral roles as modulators of
   cellular function and can be involved in mechanisms that are important
   to immune function. Metallothionein (MT), a cysteine rich stress
   response protein, has been shown to play numerous roles in the cell: it
   serves as a reservoir of essential heavy metals, it scavenges free
   radicals, and it can sequester heavy metals. These various functions
   suggest that MT may also participate in modulating immune responses. In
   previous work, we have shown that exogenous metallothionein can suppress
   the developing humoral immune response when coinjected with antigen. The
   present study was designed to evaluate the effects of endogenous MT on
   the development of humoral immunity. We compared the humoral immune
   function of animals with a targeted disruption of Mt-1 and -2 genes
   (MTKO) and their wild-type counterparts. MTKO mice displayed a
   significantly higher humoral response to challenge with ovalbumin (OVA)
   compared to wild-type controls. The secondary anti-OVA response in MTKO
   mice is as much as 58\% higher than the response in control mice
   injected at the same time. Overall circulatory immunoglobulin levels are
   also substantially higher in MTKO mice (0.039 mg/ml IgM and 0.42 mg/ml
   IgG) than wild-type controls. MTKO mice displayed increased B cell
   differentiation following OVA challenge and an enhanced
   lymphoproliferative response to mitogenic stimulation. These changes in
   immune functional capacity occur in the context of changes in the makeup
   of the lymphoid compartments of the blood and spleen. There are
   substantially fewer T and B cells in the circulation of MTKO mice, but
   more T cells in the spleen of these mice than in control animals.
   Finally, we have found that splenocytes from MTKO animals displayed
   significantly elevated levels of NF-KB activity compared to wild-type
   controls. In conclusion, we have provided evidence that endogenous
   metallothionein can modulate the immune response in vivo and that
   intracellular MT may modulate immune function by regulation of
   transcription factor activity. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that in the non-depleted pump approximation, the
   efficiency of a second harmonic generation (SHG) of a guided mode in a
   non-linear optical waveguide increases quadratically with the
   interaction length (P-2 proportional to L-2), and linearly (P-2
   proportional to L) in the Cerenkov regime. The efficiency of the
   Cerenkov SHG in the waveguide with a non-linear substrate and linear
   guiding layer is known to be strongly peaked at a particular pump
   wavelength and a particular waveguide thickness, with the Cerenkov angle
   approaching zero. The known theory predicts an infinite efficiency value
   at the peak, however. In this contribution, a simple integral expression
   for the SHG efficiency in the Cerenkov regime is derived. For large
   Cerenkov angles and interaction lengths it yields the expected P-2
   proportional to L dependence, while in the limit of small Cerenkov
   angles the dependence is found to have the form of P proportional to
   L-3/2, possessing also a finite value at the efficiency peak. The
   condition determining the accurate position of the efficiency peak in
   the waveguide thickness pump wavelength plane is given, too.}},

Abstract = {{Population-based studies, including those of Ashkenazi Jews, have
   observed that at least 50\% of women with early-onset breast cancer who
   carry a germ line mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 do not report a family
   history of the disease. That is, the majority of ``hereditary{''} cases
   are ``sporadic,{''} Furthermore, the great majority of ``familial breast
   cancers{''} are not hereditary. We conducted a simulation study to
   evaluate the probability that a woman with early-onset breast cancer is
   a mutation carrier, given the number of affected relatives, for a range
   of plausible values of allele frequency (0.001-0.01), and increased risk
   in mutation carriers (5-20, equivalent to cumulative risks to age 70 of
   25-70\%, respectively, for Australian women). Families consisted of a
   case proband and her mother, sisters, and maternal and paternal
   grandmothers, and aunts. The numbers of sisters and aunts were generated
   according to Poisson distributions, and ages were assigned according to
   a Weibull distribution. The simulated distributions of family history
   and of the prevalence of mutation carriers among case probands were in
   general similar to those observed in population-based studies, although
   there was a suggestion of heterogeneity of breast cancer risk in
   mutation carriers. As is being observed empirically in population-based
   samples, a family history of breast cancer was not a strong predictor of
   mutation status; each affected female relative increased the risk of
   being a mutation carrier by only 2- to 3-fold. The probability of being
   a mutation carrier was generally low, except in families with extreme
   histories of breast cancer.}},

   on beard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory-heliumlike 1s2s S-3(1)
   -1s2p P-3(0,2) transitions in the highly ionized species Ne8+, Na9+,
   Mg10+, and Si12+ were observed. The spectral lines were emitted by
   high-temperature solar hare plasmas. In this paper, we report on
   wavelength measurements of the He-like lines identified in the recorded
   spectra. The wavelength uncertainties we obtained from the solar
   measurements are less than or equal to 20 m Angstrom(1 sigma), and in
   one case less than or equal to 30 m Angstrom. This is comparable to or
   better than the best determinations so far achieved for these heliumlike
   1s2s S-3(1) -1s2p P-3(0,2) transitions with instrumentation in the
   laboratory. For the Na9+ S-3(1)-P-3(2) transition we report what is to
   our knowledge the first wavelength measurement. The knowledge of the
   accurate wavelengths can provide important checks on atomic structure
   calculations.}},

Abstract = {{We find that the planar and apical O-17 NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate
   (1/T-1) and the spin-echo decay rate (1/T-2) are spatially dependent in
   the mixed state of YBa2Cu3O7 For both sites, 1/T-1 and 1/T-2 increase by
   a factor of 2 to 3 for nuclei close to the vortex cores. The data
   suggest that fluctuating fields from the low-frequency vibrations of the
   vortex lattice give rise to the similar echo decay observed at both
   sites. These vibrations also dominate 1/T-1 for both sites below T less
   than or similar to 25K. Above this temperature, the planar 1/T-1 is
   dominated by spin-flip scattering with delocalized quasiparticles
   associated with the nodes in the superconducting gap showing that the
   position dependence arises from the effect of the supercurrents on the
   quasiparticle energy spectrum.}},

   Some treatments were evaluated from a field trial by examining aspects

   and 100 Kg/ha of N, P2O5 and K2O), and plots amended with SS, with doses
   of 20 and 40 t/ha of wet SS applied to and in between the planting row
   after the first harvest: SS (20), SS (20+20), SS (40) and SS (40+40) of
   the t/ha. To evaluate the effect of SS in soil fertility, samples were
   taken from a depth of 0 to 20 and 20 to 50 ems, four months after the
   first harvest of sugar cane plants.
   The samples were analysed by the IAC method and had the heavy metals
   extracted with the DTPA method and analysed by ICP. By the time the
   sugar cane ripened and the stem was harvested, the root distribution was
   evaluated in the six treatments previously defined.}},

Abstract = {{Preventive and/or therapeutic vaccines against Human Immunodeficiency
   Virus (HIV-1) are urgently required. Induction of cellular immunity is
   favoured since these responses correlate with control of HIV-1.
   Recombinant fowlpoxvirus (FPV) vaccines encoding both HIV-1 gag/pol and
   interferon-gamma (FPV gag/pol-IFN gamma) were hypothesised to enhance
   HIV-specific cellular immunity and were further evaluated in macaques
   previously infected with HIV-1. A novel assay to detect IFN gamma
   secretion following HIV antigen stimulation of whole blood was developed
   to further assess the safety and immunogenicity of the FPV gag/pol-IFN
   gamma vaccine. Immunisation with FPV gag/pol-IFN gamma safely enhanced
   HIV-specific IFN gamma secretion following ex vivo stimulation of whole
   blood, greater than that observed following FPV gag/pol vaccination not
   co-expressing IFN gamma. Both HIV-specific IFN gamma-spot-forming cells
   by ELISPOT and CD69 expression by CD4(+) lymphocytes were also enhanced
   following FPV gag/pol-IFN gamma vaccination. Hence, the FPV-HIV vaccine
   co-expressing IFN gamma stimulated HIV-specific T cell responses in
   macaques, and should be further evaluated as a therapeutic or preventive

Abstract = {{Objective: To use an established dysphagia clinical screening system to
   evaluate outcomes in acute stroke patients.
   Design: Case-control study.
   Setting: Tertiary care center.
   Participants: Acute stroke patients (n = 56) consecutively referred to a
   speech pathology service.
   Main Outcome Measures: Outcomes (ie, pneumonia, dietary status at
   discharge) in patients who were referred for a videofluoroscopic swallow
   study (VSS) based on results of a previously validated clinical
   screening system were compared with outcomes in patients who were not
   referred for VSS based on the clinical evaluation.
   Results: Thirty-eight of 56 patients (68\%) presented with 2 or more
   clinical predictors of moderate to severe dysphagia and were further
   evaluated with VSS, whereas 18 patients (32\%) had fewer than 2 clinical
   features and were not evaluated radiographically. Based on patient
   outcomes and VSS results, identification of at least 2 clinical
   predictors significantly distinguished patients with moderate to severe
   dysphagia from patients with mild dysphagia or normal swallowing. None
   of the patients in either group developed pneumonia while following
   recommendations of the clinical or dynamic swallowing evaluation, and
   93\% of the patients returned to a regular diet.
   Conclusions: These data demonstrate that clinical use of this screening
   system can objectively identify acute stroke patients who warrant
   further diagnostic studies and can safely determine which patients need
   no further deglutitive evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{The main memory access latency can significantly slow down the overall
   performance of a computer system due to the fact that average cycle time
   of the main memory is typically a factor of 5-10 times higher than that
   of a processor. To cope with this problem, in addition to the use of
   caches, the main memory of a multiprocessor architecture is usually
   organized into multiple modules or banks. Although such organization
   enhances memory bandwidth, the amount of data that the multiprocessor
   can retrieve in the same memory cycle, conflicts due to simultaneous
   attempts to access the same memory module may reduce the effective
   bandwidth. Therefore, efficient mapping schemes are required to
   distribute data in such a way that regular patterns, called templates,
   of various structures can be retrieved in parallel without memory
   conflicts. Prior work on data mappings mostly dealt with conflict-free
   access to templates such as rows, columns, or diagonals
   of(multidimensional) arrays, and only limited attention has been paid to
   access templates of nonnumeric structures such as trees. In this paper,
   we study optimal and balanced mappings for accessing path and subtree
   templates of trees, where a mapping will be called optimal if it allows
   conflict-free access to templates with as few memory banks as possible.
   An optimal mapping will also be called balanced if it distributes as
   evenly as possible the nodes of the entire tree among the memory banks
   available. In particular, based on Latin squares, we propose an optimal
   and balanced mapping for leaf-to-root paths of q-ary trees. Another
   (recursive) mapping for leaf-to-root paths of binary trees raises
   interesting combinatorial problems. We also derive an optimal and
   balanced mapping to access complete t-ary subtrees of complete q-ary
   trees, where 2 less than or equal to t less than or equal to q, and an
   optimal mapping for subtrees of binomial trees. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Title = {{Experimental verification of the mechanisms causing stick-slip motion
   originating from relative deceleration}},
Journal = {{WEAR}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{243}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{48-59}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In literature, the stick-slip phenomenon is usually explained from an
   initial stick-phase. The stability conditions with respect to stick-slip
   (the occurrence or not) are also derived by checking the reoccurrence of
   a relative standstill (stick-phase) after the slip-phase that has been
   following an initial stick-phase. However, stick-slip can also arise
   from an initial situation of pure slip. In this paper, it is
   experimentally shown that friction induced tangential oscillations
   during stick-slip can merge into stick-slip during an impressed
   deceleration, if their amplitude is sufficiently large. Owing to the
   interaction between friction phenomena and the dynamic behaviour of the
   mechanical system of which the friction interface is a part, the
   (negative) friction force-relative speed gradient (dF/d nu(rel)), which
   gives rise to the tangential oscillations and has to be considered for
   the study of stick-slip, must be derived from changes of the relative
   speed with the same time-constant as the mechanical system. It is also
   experimentally shown that the risk of stick-slip during deceleration is
   enhanced by an increase of the time-length of deceleration and by an
   increase of the tangential stiffness of the mechanical system. The
   correlation of the experimental results with previous theoretical
   analysis is clarified. As a result, some widely accepted models for the
   friction as a function of the relative speed have to be put in question.
   It is also shown that the major problem in determining the gradient dF/d
   nu(rel) is the inadequateness of the classical friction test rigs. (C)

Title = {{Assessment of length-dependent regulation of myocardial function in
   coronary surgery patients using transmitral flow velocity patterns}},
Journal = {{ANESTHESIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{374-381}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: In a subset of coronary surgery patients, a transient
   increase in cardiac load by leg elevation resulted in a decrease in
   maximal rate of pressure development (dP/dt(max)) and a major Increase
   in end-diastolic pressure (EDP). This impairment of left ventricular
   (LV) function appeared to be related to a deficient length-dependent
   regulation of myocardial function. The present study Investigated
   whether analysis of transmitral flow patterns with transesophageal
   echocardiography constituted a noninvasive method to identify these
   patients.
   Methods: High-fidelity LV pressure tracings and transmitral flow signals
   were obtained in 50 coronary surgery patients during an increase in
   cardiac load by leg elevation. Using Linear regression analysis, changes
   in transmitral E-wave velocity and deceleration time (DT) were related
   to changes in dP/dt(max) and EDP.
   Results: Changes in dP/dt(max) with leg elevation were closely related
   to corresponding changes in E-wave velocity (r = 0.81; P < 0.001) and to
   changes in DT (r = 0.78; P < 0.001), Similarly, changes in EDP were
   related to changes in E-wave velocity (r = 0.83; P < 0.001) and to
   changes in DT (r = 0.84; P < 0.001), The decrease in dP/dt(max) and the
   major increase in EDP in some patients was associated with an increase
   in E-wave velocity and a decrease in DT, indicating development of a
   restrictive LV filling pattern.
   Conclusions: Impairment of LV function with leg elevation was associated
   with the development of a restrictive transmitral filling pattern.
   Analysis of transmitral flow patterns by means of transesophageal
   echocardiography therefore allowed noninvasive identification of a
   subset of coronary surgery patients with impaired length-dependent
   regulation of LV function.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of autonomic balance characterized by increased sympathetic
   activity and decreased vagal activity has been implicated as a major
   cardiovascular risk factor. Aspirin's cardioprotective abilities involve
   a multitude of physiologic processes. However, the effects of aspirin on
   cardiac autonomic activity are unknown. In a double-blind crossover
   study, 22 subjects randomly received either aspirin or placebo in the
   amounts of 325 mg with each meal (three times per day) over a 2.5-day
   period. The total amount of aspirin ingested was 2,275 mg, which
   resulted in plasma levels of 3.3 mg/dl. At the conclusion of each
   treatment, subjects were evaluated for autonomic physiology activity
   using standard autonomic tests. Power spectral analyses of the
   electrocardiograms were used to delineate autonomic function. A 2 x 4
   repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant and
   favorable changes in autonomic activity after the use of aspirin.
   Specifically, at rest high-frequency (HF) power was significantly higher
   (mean, 1,090 +/- 1,463.5 msec(2)) compared with the placebo (mean, 692
   +/- 742 msec(2)) (p <0.05). Low-frequency (LF) power was significantly
   reduced (mean, 963 +/- 745 msec(2)) after aspirin compared with placebo
   (mean, 1,100 +/- 906 msec(2)). After the aspirin treatment, a
   significantly lower LF-to-HF power ratio (mean, 1.7 +/- 2 msec(2)) was
   noted at rest when compared with the placebo (mean, 2.5 +/- 2.7 msec(2))
   (p <0.05). Similar significant trends were seen during the sustained
   isometric contraction after aspirin therapy for HF power (mean 210 +/-
   2.15 msec(2)) compared with placebo (mean, 213 +/- 184 msec(2)) (p
   <0.05). Accordingly, the LF-to-HF power ratio was lower as well when
   compared to placebo treatment (mean, 2.3 +/- 3.5 msec(2)) (mean, 5.3 +/-
   8.4 msec(2)) (p <0.05). No differences were found in breathing rates for
   hemodynamic variables between any of the protocols. The significant
   reduction of LF-to-HF ratio, a marker of sympathovagal balance, for both
   protocols appeared to be largely due to a withdrawal of LF modulation
   and concomitant but lesser increase in HF modulation. Favorable
   alterations in autonomic outflow through prostaglandin inhibition may be
   one of the mechanisms by which low therapeutic amounts of aspirin
   provide prophylactic cardioprotection.}},

Abstract = {{One of the characteristics of modern industrial development is the
   emergence of a new typology of accidents whose effects can be spread, in
   space as well as in time, well beyond the borders of the installations
   where they occur, sometimes impacting the local population and the
   environment in a catastrophic fashion. This is the result of a number of
   factors that have changed the risk profile of modern industrial
   activities. For a number of reasons, the developing countries have
   proved to be more vulnerable to industrial disasters. Three of the most
   catastrophic industrial accidents-Bhopal, San Juan de Ixhuatepec, and
   Cubatao-occurred in developing countries, claiming thousands of lives.
   During the 1970s and 1980s the higher degree of public visibility of
   industrial hazards as a result of serious accidents, led to the
   creation, especially in the more industrialized countries, of
   regulations for greater control over industrial activities, either by
   means of new laws or by updating existing legislation. Some of these
   regulations were designed to improve the response to accidents with
   potential impacts outside the industrial sites. This article attempts to
   describe the current status and identify the shortcomings of off-site
   emergency planning for hazardous industrial areas in Brazil. The most
   important problems are the lack of specific legislation and the absence
   of awareness and active participation of public authorities. The
   experience of an off-site emergency planning process for a Brazilian
   industrial area is presented. This experience illustrates how difficult
   it is to prepare and implement emergency planning processes in an
   industrializing country.}},

Abstract = {{Clevidipine is a new lipophilic, ultra-short acting 1,4-dihydropyridine
   calcium channel antagonist for intraoperative use. Because sarcolemnal
   calcium currents are involved in the mechanism of action of anaesthetics
   we questioned whether clevidipine alters the potency of volatile
   anaesthetics. We studied the effects of clevidipine on minimal alveolar
   concentration and the time to awaken from isoflurane anaesthesia.
   Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetized with isoflurane, and were
   allocated to one of four treatments prior to minimal alveolar
   concentration determination: (a) saline control; (b) clevidipine 20 nmol
   kg(-1) min(-1); (c) clevidipine 40 nmol kg(-1) min(-1); (d) clonidine 1
   mu g kg(-1) - positive control. Ten mongrel dogs were anaesthetized with
   isoflurane and received a continuous infusion of clevidipine 6 nmol
   kg(-1) min(-1) or the solvent (Intralipid 20\% - control). After 2 h of
   steady-state anaesthesia, minimal alveolar concentration awake and the
   time to awakening were recorded. Clevidipine reduced minimal alveolar
   concentration to a small but statistically significant extent (from
   1.40+/-0.16 control to 1.23+/-0.13 vol\% with 20 nmol kg(-1) min(-1) and
   to 1.27+/-0.12 vol\% with 40 nmol kg(-1) min(-1;) mean+/-SD; P < 0.05)
   in rats. Clonidine reduced minimal alveolar concentration to 0.90+/-0.17
   vol\% (mean+/-SD; P < 0.05). Minimal alveolar concentration awake and
   the duration of sleep were not affected by clevidipine in dogs.
   Clevidipine mildly reduces miinimal alveolar concentration of isoflurane
   but does not prolong the duration of sleep and does not affect minimal
   alveolar concentration awake after a 2-h steady-state isoflurane
   anaesthesia.}},

Abstract = {{The densities of self-established non-indigenous prickly pears (Opuntia
   ficus-indica) in rangelands of the Karoo recorded on 3434 km of road
   transects, were on average 800 times greater below telegraph and
   transmission poles than away from poles, and 200 times greater next to
   wire fences along roads than in open rangelands. We suggest that this
   uneven establishment pattern is mainly due to the dispersal of Opuntia
   ficus-indica seeds by crows and other vertebrates (chiefly primates).
   Cape (Corvus capensis) and pied crows (C. albus) feed on fruits of
   Opuntia ficus-indica in the Karoo, and regurgitate pellets containing
   viable seeds of these plants below nest sites, roosts and occasional
   perch sites. Crows use man-made structures such as wire fences,
   telegraph and transmission poles and windmills for perching, roosting
   and nesting. Crow pellets, containing regurgitated bones and viable
   seeds of Opuntia spp., and other alien and indigenous plants, are most
   common around such perch sites. Crows are frequently associated with
   roads in the Karoo because they scavenge on road kills in the Karoo as
   well as feeding on fruits, insects and reptiles in road verges. We
   suggest that dispersal of seeds by crows is important for range
   extension and establishment of new Opuntia populations. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Objective, Oral alendronate is effective in increasing bone mineral
   density (BMD) and in reducing fracture incidence. However, a large
   proportion of patients under treatment do not show significant changes
   in BMD, or even bone loss. Incorrect administration, low intestinal
   absorption, and poor compliance are among factors that may account for
   this effect. In this subgroup of patients we evaluated whether
   intramuscular (im) clodronate increased the number of responders.
   Methods. Using an open case-control design we studied 60 postmenopausal
   osteoporotic women (mean age 58.9 years +/- 4.8 SD) after one year of
   therapy with oral alendronate who had an increase in BMD that was lower
   than the in vivo densitometry measurement error (2\%). Subjects were
   divided into 2 groups: the first continued aledronate treatment (AL
   group); the second began weekly im injections of clodronate 100 mg (CL
   group). BMD measurements were performed at the right Femoral neck by the
   same operator, using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry.
   Results. After 12 months of therapy the prevalence of responders
   (increase in BMD > 2\%) was 40\% in the AL group and 66\% in the CL
   group (prevalence rate ratio = 1.65; 95\% CI 1.25-2.04). The treatment
   group was the only variable that showed a significant correlation with
   being a responder (beta = 1.13; p = 0.03), as analyzed by multiple
   logistic regression to account for the effect of confounding factors. In
   the CL group the difference in the mean value of BMD between time TO and
   time T+12. was greater than in the AL group, bur did nor reach
   statistical significance. The mean percentage variation of BMD was
   significantly greater in the CL group (+3.21\%) compared to the AL group
   (+0.98\%) (p < 0.001, t test) (f value = 8.4: p < 0.01, by multiple
   linear regression analysis using the same covariates).
   Conclusion, Treatment with weekly intramuscular injection of clodronate
   in nonresponders to oral alendronate showed a higher number of subjects
   with a significant increase in BMD, compared to continuation of therapy
   with alendronate.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of secondary
   hypertension in a population of refractory hypertension without initial
   clinical or biological findings suggesting identifiable causes of
   hypertension.
   Methods: A survey included 200 consecutive hypertensive patients
   referred to hypertension specialists for refractory hypertension (BP>
   140/90 mmHg on at least two antihypertensive drugs). Prior inclusion,
   the permanent elevation of blood pressure was confirmed by ambulatory
   monitoring. In each subject an extensive workup was performed to detect
   a secondary cause for hypertension.
   Results: An essential hypertension was confirmed in 61\% of this cohort.
   A secondary hypertension was detected in 20\% of the patients; 8.5\%
   with a primary hyperaldosteronism, 8\% with a reno-vascular hypertension
   and 3\% with a nephropathy. Moreover, 18.5\% had a low renin
   hypertension. Thus, 27\% of these patients had an abnormality of the
   renin-aldosterone axis.
   Conclusion: Patients with refractory hypertension should be explored to
   detect secondary hypertension even without findings suggesting such
   causes. This additional diagnostic procedure must include at least
   renovascular investigations and plasma renin/aldosterone level
   determinations in appropriate conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Glycogen is present in skeletal muscle in smaller acid-insoluble
   proglycogen particles and larger acid-soluble macroglycogen particles.
   The present study was designed to investigate the relative contribution
   of pro- and macroglycogen to glycogenolysis during muscle contractions.
   Rats were subjected to a glycogen-depleting exercise bout and refed with
   either a carbohydrate-rich or fat-rich diet, resulting in widely
   different muscle glycogen contents. The following day, isolated
   hindlimbs were perfused and electrically stimulated to contract for 10
   min. Pre- and postcontraction muscle samples of soleus, white and red
   gastrocnemius were analysed for pro- and macroglycogen. Contractions
   caused significant reductions in both pro- and macroglycogen in all
   glycogen groups and muscle types. in glycogen-supercompensated
   gastrocnemius muscles, the relative utilization of macroglycogen was
   significantly higher than the relative utilization of proglycogen. In
   muscles with normal to low initial glycogen contents, proglycogen was
   much more abundant than macroglycogen and therefore contributed more to
   glycogenolysis in absolute numbers. In conclusion, both proglycogen and
   macroglycogen are suitable substrates during skeletal muscle
   contractions, although macroglycogen, when amply available, seems to be
   more easily broken down. This may provide an explanation for the
   dependence of the glycogenolytic rate on the total muscle glycogen
   content.}},

   between some of the Delta S = 0 and Delta S = -1 rate differences due to

Abstract = {{PROBLEM: Neonatal estradiol injections in mice lead to follicular cystic
   ovaries that are similar to ovaries in patients with polycystic ovarian
   syndrome (PCOS). The present study examined ovarian cytokine production
   following neonatal estradiol injection.
   METHOD OF STUDY: Female (C3H/HeJ x 129/HeJ)F(1) mice were injected daily
   with 20 mu g 17 beta-estradiol from 0-3 days postpartum. At intervals,
   animals were sacrificed to determine ovarian architecture, circulating
   levels of estradiol, ovarian and peritoneal machrophage cytokine
   production, and ovarian P450 aromatase enzyme mRNA levels.
   RESULTS: Similar to PCOS, our results show that neonatally
   estradiol-injected mice have lower levels of circulating estrogen that
   are correlated with decreased mRNA levels of P450 aromatase enzyme. Our
   data also show that follicular cystic ovaries have increased tumor
   necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 production. This
   increase in TNF-alpha and IL-6 production is also observed in peritoneal
   macrophages of estradiol-injected mice.
   CONCLUSION: The present study showed that neonatal estrogen injection in
   mice has an overall systemic effect on cytokine production. We speculate
   that increased cytokine production may alter certain important steps in
   follicular maturation, ultimately contributing to ovarian dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Morbidity due to motor vehicle accidents was analysed in a
   descriptive study based on reports of hospitals with the objective to
   characterize their victims, types of injuries, and the health care
   provided.
   Methods The study was carried out in two municipal hospitals of Rio de
   Janeiro, Brazil. Motor vehicle accidents were defined as a run over, a
   collision, and ``other traffic accidents{''}. Data was collected from
   cases seen in May (Hospital 1) and June (Hospital 2) of 1996 by 7 teams
   that alternated in shifts of 12 hours, covering the collection 24 hours
   per day. The events were classified according to the victim or, when it
   was impossible, to the person who helped them or accompanied them to the
   hospital.
   Results In the study period, 320 cases were seen in Hospital 1 and 290
   in Hospital 2. Most of the victims were men (69.3\%) in both of
   hospitals and the most affected group was young adults between 20 to 39
   years (60.5\% in Hospital 1 and 47.5\% in Hospital 2). Of all 610 cases,
   the main cause of injury was run overs (49.3\%), followed by collisions
   (35.6\%), and ``other traffic accidents{''} (15.1\%).
   Conclusions The analysis of the cases distributions and the type of care
   required corroborates with the need of a better organization of hospital
   care teams, more completeness of hospital reports and emphasis an some
   aspects in prevention campaigns.}},

Abstract = {{Mucins, the major component of mucus, contain tandemly repeated
   sequences that differ from one mucin to another. Considerable advances
   have been made in recent years in our knowledge of mucin genes. The
   availability of the complete genomic and cDNA sequences of MUC5B, one of
   the four human mucin genes clustered on chromosome 11, provides an
   exemplary model for studying the molecular evolution of large mucins.
   The emerging picture is one of expansion of mucin genes by gene
   duplications, followed by internal repeat expansion that strictly
   preserves frameshift. Computational and phylogenetic analyses have
   permitted the proposal of an evolutionary history of the four human
   mucin genes located on chromosome 11 from an ancestor gene common to the
   human von Willebrand factor gene and the suggestion of a model for the
   evolution of the repeat coding portion of the MUC5B gene from a
   hypothetical ancestral minigene. The characterization of MUC5B, a member
   of the large secreted gel-forming mucin family, offers a new model for
   the comparative study of the structure-function relationship within this
   important family.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen consumption (VO2), ventilation (V-E) and heart rate (HR) were
   studied in five recreational riders with a portable oxygen analyser (K2
   Cosmed, Rome) telemetric system, during two different experimental
   riding sessions. The first one was a dressage session in which the rider
   successively rode four different horses at a walk, trot and canter. The
   second one was a jumping training session. Each rider rode two horses,
   one known and one unknown. The physiological parameters were measured
   during warm up at a canter in suspension and when jumping an isolated
   obstacle at a trot and canter. This session was concluded by a jumping
   course with 12 obstacles. The data show a progressive increase in VO2
   during the dressage session from a mean value of 0.70 (0.18) l . min(-1)
   {[}mean (SD)] at a walk, to 1.47 (0.28) l . min(-1) at a trot, and 1.9
   (0.3) l . min(-1) at a canter. During the jumping session, rider VO2 was
   2 (0.33) l . min(-1) with a mean HR of 155 beats . min(-1) during canter
   in suspension, obstacle trot and obstacle canter. The jumping course
   significantly enhanced VO2 and HR up to mean values of 2.40 (0.35) l .
   min(-1) and 176 beats . min(-1), respectively. The comparison among
   horses and riders during the dressage session shows differences in
   energy expenditure according to the horse for the same rider and between
   riders. During the jumping session, there was no statistical difference
   between riders riding known and unknown horses. In conclusion these data
   confirm that riding induces a significant increase in energy
   expenditure. During jumping, a mean value of 75\% VO2max was reached.
   Therefore, a good aerobic capacity seems to be a factor determining
   riding performance in competitions. Regular riding practice and
   additional physical training are recommended to enhance the physical
   fitness of competitive riders.}},

Abstract = {{The paper analyses available information on various aspects of medicinal
   plants (MPs) of the Indian Himalaya region (IHR). Among the identified
   gaps in knowledge, lack of objective assessment of threats was
   considered a major impediment in setting conservation priorities. The
   paper addresses this issue keeping in view the needs of users (industry)
   and conservation concerns of academics (biologists). An approach for
   prioritisation of MPs for conservation was thus developed.
   Prioritisation based on three indices: (i) use value index (UVI)
   indicate threats imposed by users, (ii) sensitivity index (SI) reflect
   conservation concerns of biologists, and (iii) importance value index
   (IVI) is the cumulative value of (i) and (ii) to prevent biased
   approach. Dependence of pharmaceutical industry on only 10\% of the
   available stock and that too on non-native elements suggest that the
   potential of true Himalayan MPs has not been harnessed as yet. However,
   increased dependence on exclusive wild forms (64.6\%), dominance of
   destructive harvest trend (69\%) and restricted distribution range of
   most MPs used by the industry is a pointer to the intensity of threat.
   The paper identifies 20 top ranking MPs for conservation in each life
   form. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The quantum efficiency and the crosstalk of a photodiode in a long
   wavelength IR (LWIR) 2-D diode array are studied by numerically solving
   the 2-D diffusion equation of photocarriers in an array environment. The
   quantum efficiency depends strongly on both the diode size and the
   junction depth, and can be expressed, to good accuracy, as a quadratic
   function of the two variables. The results, corresponding to HgCdTe
   n(+)-on-p backside illuminated photovoltaic (PV) diodes, are compared
   with published Monte Carlo results and with analytical (1-D) special
   cases. For a given pitch, smaller diodes have lower crosstalk, but also
   lower quantum efficiency This implies an optimal diode size. The highest
   quantum efficiency is obtained for low junction depths (less than or
   equal to 1 mu m), and the optimum diode size, maximizing the quantum
   efficiency and minimizing the crosstalk, lies in the range of 15 to 30
   mu m for a pitch of 50 mu m over a wide range of diffusion lengths. The
   quantum efficiency depends weakly on the pitch, for a given ratio of
   diode size to the pitch. (C) 2000 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{Background: The goal was to examine tattooing in suicides, as tattoos
   have been associated with several risk factors for suicide. Method: A
   chart review of a three-year sample of 134 consecutive suicides in
   Mobile County, Alabama, was conducted. The prevalence of tattoos was
   compared between young ( < 30) white suicides and accidental deaths
   matched for age, gender and race, in a case-control study. Results:
   Tattoos were found in 21\% of suicides. Fifty-seven percent of young
   white suicides were tattooed compared to 29\% of matched accidental
   deaths. Limitations: Findings are preliminary due to the small sample
   size. The study methodology precluded obtaining information of
   psychiatric diagnoses prior to death. Conclusions: Tattoos may be
   possible markers for lethality from both suicide and accidental death in
   young people, presumably because of shared risk factors such as
   substance abuse and personality disorder. Affective disorders should
   receive further, more specific studies. The clinical value of inquiring
   about tattoos in young people at risk of suicide needs further study.

Title = {{Expression of the proteinase specialized in bone resorption, cathepsin
   K, in granulomatous inflammation}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{648-659}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: The cysteine proteinase cathepsin It has aroused intense
   interest as the main effector in the digestion of extracellular matrix
   during bone resorption by osteoclasts. The enzyme is not a housekeeping
   lysosomal hydrolase, but is instead expressed with striking specificity
   in osteoclasts. In this work, we present evidence for the association of
   cathepsin It with the granulomatous reaction. Granulomas are
   inflammatory tissue reactions against persistent pathogens or foreign
   bodies. We came across cathepsin It while working on Echinococcus
   granulosus, a persistent tissue-dwelling, cyst-forming parasite that
   elicits a granulomatous response.
   Materials and Methods: The walls of hydatid cysts from infected cattle
   were solubilized. Strong proteolytic activity was detected in the
   extracts. The proteinase responsible was purified by anion exchange and
   gel filtration. The purified protein was subjected to N-terminal
   sequencing, and its identity further confirmed by Western blotting, with
   a cathepsin It-specific antibody. The same antibody was used to localize
   the proteinase in paraffin-embedded sections of the parasite and the
   local host response.
   Results: A proteinase was purified to near homogeneity from hydatid cyst
   extracts. The enzyme was unequivocally identified as host cathepsin K.
   Both the proenzyme and the mature enzyme forms were found. Cathepsin K
   was then immunolocalized both to the parasite cyst wall and to the
   epithelioid and giant multinucleated cells of the host granulomatous
   response.
   Conclusions: In the granulomatous response to the hydatid cyst,
   cathepsin It is expressed by epithelioid and giant multinucleated cells.
   We propose that, by analogy with bone resorption, cathepsin It is
   secreted by the host in an attempt to digest the persistent foreign
   body. Both processes, bone resorption and granulomatous reactions,
   therefore tackle persistent extracellular material (the bone matrix or
   the foreign body), and utilize specialized cells of the monocytic
   lineage (osteoclasts or epithelioid/giant cells) secreting cathepsin It
   as an effector.}},

Abstract = {{Fifty years after Olaf Stapledon's landmark essay ``Interplanetary
   man?{''}, we propose the coming era of ``interstellar humanity{''}. Over
   the next 1000 years the domain of humanity will increasingly spread to
   the stars, a process that will alter our future in profound ways. At
   least three factors will drive this expansion: (1) increased
   understanding of cosmic evolution, changing our perception of ourselves
   and our place in the universe; (2) contact with extraterrestrial
   intelligence, bringing knowledge, wisdom, and problems of culture
   contact now unforeseen; and (3) interstellar travel, transporting
   humanity's emissaries to at least the nearest stars. The consequences of
   these events are not predictable in detail, but may be studied by
   examining the lessons of cosmic evolution; by using history to analyze
   the reception of new world views and intellectual culture contacts on
   Earth; and by anticipating the likelihood of success in interstellar
   travel and its effects. The prospect of interstellar humanity during the
   next millennium is likely to have an effect on all branches of
   terrestrial endeavor, whether religion, philosophy, science or the arts.

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine whether the socioeconomic and nutritional
   status of cured leprosy patients with residual deformity, and their
   household members, was lower than that of cured leprosy patients without
   deformity.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Subjects: One hundred and fifty-five index cases with deformity, 100
   without deformity. Also 616 household members comprising 48\% of the
   total members enumerated.
   Measurements: Nutritional status was evaluated using anthropometry.
   Disease characteristics, socio-economic parameters and household
   information were recorded using a questionnaire.
   Results: Index cases with deformity had lower community acceptance (P <
   0.001), and employment (P < 0.001) than those cases without deformity.
   Households of index cases with deformity had a lower income (P < 0.01)
   and a lower expenditure on food (P < 0.05). The presence of deformity
   (odds ratio (OR): 2.1-3.2, P < 0.01), unemployment (OR: 2.3-4.3, P <
   0.01) and female gender (OR: 2.4, P < 0.01) significantly increased the
   risk of index cases being undernourished, as judged by body mass index
   (BMI) alone, or BMI and mid-upper arm circumference. A low BMI ( <18.5)
   in the index case significantly increased the odds of other adults (OR
   2.2), adolescents (OR 2.9-3.8) and children (OR 2.2) in the household
   being undernourished.
   Conclusions: Cured leprosy index cases with physical deformity are more
   undernourished than index cases without deformity. This is associated
   with a reduced expenditure on food, possibly brought on by increased
   unemployment, and a loss of income. Undernutrition in the index case
   increases the risk of undernutrition in other members of the family.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHA2) is a rare autosomal dominant form
   of volume-dependent low-renin hypertension characterized by hyperkalemia
   and hyperchloremic acidosis but also by a normal glomerular filtration
   rate. These features, together with the correction of blood pressure and
   metabolic abnormalities by small doses of thiazide diuretics, suggest a
   primary renal tubular defect. Two loci have previously been mapped at
   low resolution to chromosome 1q31-42 (PHA2A) and 17p11-q21 (PHA2B). We
   have now analyzed a new large French pedigree, in which 12 affected
   members over three generations confirmed the autosomal dominant
   inheritance. Affected subjects had hypertension together with long-term
   hyperkalemia (range 5.2-6.2 mmol/liter), hyperchloremia (range: 100-109
   mmol/liter), normal plasma creatinine (range: 63-129 mmol/liter) and low
   renin levels. Genetic linkage was excluded for both PHA2A and PHA2B loci
   (all LOD scores Z < -3.2 at recombination fraction {[}theta] 0), as well
   as for the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter gene. A
   genome-wide scan using 383 microsatellite markers showed a strong
   linkage with the chromosome 12p13 region (maximum LOD score Z = 6.18,
   theta = 0, at D12S99). Haplotype analysis using 10 additional
   polymorphic markers led to a minimum 13-cM interval flanked by D12S1652
   and D12S336, thus defining a new PHA2C locus. Analysis of two obvious
   candidate genes (SCNN1A and GNb3) located within the interval showed no
   deleterious mutation. In conclusion, we hereby demonstrate further
   genetic heterogeneity of this Mendelian form of hypertension and
   identify a new PHA2C locus, the most compelling and precise linkage
   interval described to date.}},

Abstract = {{We have observed a total of five UVCS/S0H0 polar jets that correlate
   with the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) and Large Angle
   Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) jet events. We analyzed spectroscopic
   observations of these jets and found that they typically undergo two
   phases: at the first phase the O vr lines show a brief intensity
   enhancement (by a factor of 1.4) and narrowing (by a factor of 0.8),
   while the H I Ly alpha line is not enhanced, and the second phase, about
   25 minutes later, when the H I Ly alpha line shows an intensity
   enhancement (by a factor of 1.3) and narrowing (by a factor of 0.8),
   while the O VI line is relatively unchanged. We modeled the observable
   properties of the jets from 1997 August 5, detected at 1.71 R.. We
   interpret the first phase as the fast, dense centroid of the jet passing
   by the UVCS slit. The empirical jet model was able to reproduce the
   observed line properties with electron density enhancement by a factor
   of 3.2 (with a resulting density of 4.5 x 10(6) cm(-3)), an electron
   temperature decrease (change by a factor of 0.50 to 750,000 K), and the
   centroid outflow velocity larger than 280 km s(-1). During the second
   phase, the model required a further decrease in the electron temperature
   (change by a factor of 0.10, with a jet temperature of only 150,000 K),
   along with a weaker electron density (1.7 x 10(6) cm(-3)) and an outflow
   velocity of 205 km s(-1). Possible scenarios of the electron temperature
   variations needed to account for observed conditions on 1997 August 5
   indicate that some heating is required. We computed models of the
   temperature and nonequilibrium ionization state of an expanding plasma
   using various forms for the heating rates. We found that the jet had to
   leave the Sun at an electron temperature below 2.5 x 10(6) K and that a
   heating rate of the same order as the average coronal hole heating is
   required. Such low initial temperatures are consistent with the idea
   that the jets observed by LASCO, EIT, and UVCS are different than
   previously observed coronal X-ray jets.}},

Abstract = {{One way that an anthropic selection mechanism may be manifest in a
   physical theory involves multiple domains in the universe with different
   values of the physical parameters. If this mechanism is to be relevant
   for understanding the small observed value of the cosmological constant,
   it may involve a mechanism by which some contributions to the
   cosmological constant can be fixed at a continuous range of values in
   the different domains. I study the properties of four possible
   mechanisms, including the possibility of the Hubble damping of a scalar
   field with an extremely at potential. Another interesting possibility
   involves fixed random values of non-dynamical form fields, and a
   cosmological mechanism is suggested. This case raises the possibility of
   anthropic selection of other parameters in addition. Further
   requirements needed for a consistent cosmology are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Rate constants and branching ratios have been measured for the reactions
   of N-2(+) with CO2 and SO2 in a high-temperature flowing afterglow from
   300-1400 K. The rate constants have also been measured as a function of
   kinetic energy in a selected ion flow drift tube at 298 K for the
   reaction of N-2(+) with CO2. The rate constants for the reaction of
   N-2(+) with CO2 in the selected ion flow drift tube (SIFDT) and high
   temperature flowing afterglow (HTFA) both decrease monotonically with
   increasing energy. The rate constants at high temperatures have a large
   fraction of the available energy in internal energy (rotational and
   vibrational). Compared to the SIFDT rate constants with most of the
   energy in translation, internal energy hinders the reactivity more than
   translational energy. The rate constants for the reaction of N-2(+) with
   SO2 also decrease with increasing energy up to around 0.4 eV. The rate
   constants increase above 0.4 eV when an endothermic dissociative
   charge-transfer channel forming SO+ becomes important. Comparing the
   HTFA results with previous flow drift tube measurements shows that
   translational, rotational, and vibrational energy affect the reactivity
   identically at low energy where the SO2+ channel dominates. It appears
   that N-2(+) vibrational excitation is mainly responsible for the SO+
   channel, consistent with a previous study. The results for the N-2(+)
   reactions are compared to the energetically similar reactions of Ar+
   with CO2 and SO2. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{This paper presents extensions of stochastic gradient independent
   component analysis (ICA) methods to the blind deconvolution task. Of
   particular importance in these extensions are the constraints placed on
   the deconvolution system transfer function. While unit-norm constrained
   ICA approaches can be directly applied to the prewhitened blind
   deconvolution task, an allpass filter constraint within the optimization
   procedure is more appropriate. We show how such constraints can be
   approximately imposed within gradient adaptive finite-impulse-response
   (FIR) filter implementations by proper extensions of gradient techniques
   within the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal matrices. Both on-line
   time-domain and block-based frequency-domain algorithms are described.
   Simulations verify the superior performance behaviors provided by our
   allpass-constrained algorithms over standard unit-norm-constrained ICA
   algorithms in blind deconvolution tasks.}},

Abstract = {{The role of material development and selection as well as product safety
   and liability is explored in this paper. The paper presents a conceptual
   framework which facilitates an interface between material selection and
   product safety/liability at the three planning-horizon levels of
   strategic, intermediate, and tactical. The five specific areas of
   interface include: (1) strategic material development and usage, (2)
   product safety, (3) product liability, (4) materials selection and
   testing and (5) materials usage and processing. Then, five propositions
   pertaining to each area of interface at each level of planning are
   proposed and evaluated for a company as an example. The results indicate
   that the company performed well for two propositions (2) and (3); and
   performed very poorly for three propositions (1), (4) and (5). The
   company had to comply with stringent safety and regulatory requirements
   but was under no internal or external pressure to improve its material
   development, selection, and processing practices. Finally, the
   conclusions, assessment, and future research directions are presented.
   Additional recommendations, prerequisites, or guidelines for effective
   incorporation of the propositions for the company or other companies
   that might embark on similar programs are proposed. (C) 2000 Published

   and yew biozones, hornbeam dominated the forests in the alpine foreland,
   whilst fir/spruce forests formed the dominant vegetation at sites closer

Abstract = {{Optimal oxygenation of culture media is important for the successful use
   of liver slices as an in vitro tool for studying liver function.. For
   this reason the influence of 20, 40, 70 and 95\% O-2 concentration on
   the viability and metabolism of liver slices was investigated. The
   slices were incubated in the roller system at 37 degrees C under
   continuous gassing for 2, 24 and 48 hrs. Protein, DNA and potassium
   contents were maintained or even increased over time without influence
   by O-2, concentrations. The albumin secretion of slices incubated at
   40-95\% O-2 did not differ, but was much lower at 20\% O-2. A slight
   non-significant decrease in albumin secretion after 24 hrs of
   cultivation could be observed, whereas a much steeper decline was found
   in all groups after 48 hrs. Cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent
   7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation (ECOD) did not differ between the
   various O-2 concentrations, but declined from 2 to 48 hrs of incubation.
   It can be concluded that O-2 concentration of 20\% is not sufficient to
   maintain all cell functions of incubated rat liver slices, whereas 40,
   70 and 95\% are useful O-2 concentrations to retain all parameters
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{There have been five major mass extinctions among the marine biota
   during the similar to 0.6 b.y. history of metazoan life on Earth. These
   mass extinctions have been ranked from the largest to the smallest by
   the severity of taxonomic diversity lasses, but they have not been
   ranked by the severity of the ecologic changes that they produced, Here
   we utilize a system of paleoecological levels that allows for the
   ranking of ecological degradation or shifts associated with significant
   taxonomic events, along,vith an analysis of large-scale
   paleoenvironmental patterns of two of the great evolutionary faunas, to
   compare the relative ecologic degradation caused by two major mass
   extinctions. The Late Ordovician and Late Devonian mass extinctions
   produced similar taxonomic losses (marine families declined similar to
   22\% and 21\%, respectively). However, our analyses show that whereas
   the Late Ordovician extinction resulted in only minimal permanent
   ecological change, the Late Devonian extinction resulted in the complete
   restructuring of many components of the marine ecosystem, Thus, the
   large-scale taxonomic and ecological significance of these extinction
   events are decoupled, implying that some taxa are ecologically more
   critical than others.}},

Title = {{One model for an integrated math/physics course focusing on electricity

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, there has been an increasing, widespread
   pedagogical interest in developing various types of integrated curricula
   for science and engineering programs. Over the last three years, a
   year-long Integrated Math/Physics course has been developed at Union
   College. This paper will focus on a model for a one-quarter integrated
   course organized around a traditional set of electricity and magnetism
   (E\&M) physics topics, integrated with appropriate mathematical topics.
   Traditional, nonintegrated E\&M physics students often struggle with
   challenging vector calculus ideas which may have been forgotten, not yet
   encountered, or introduced with different notation in different
   contexts. Likewise, traditional vector calculus mathematics students are
   often unable to gain intuitive insight, or fail to grasp the physical
   significance of many of the vector calculus ideas they are learning.
   Many of these frustrations are due to the fact that at many schools, the
   physics and calculus teachers teaching separate courses probably have
   little or no idea what their fellow educators are actually doing in
   these courses. Substantial differences in context, notation, and
   philosophy can cause breakdowns in the transfer of knowledge between
   mathematics and physics courses. We will discuss the methods,
   philosophy, and implementation of our course, and then go on to present
   what we feel were the substantial strengths and insights gained from a
   thoughtful integration of the two subjects. In addition, some problem
   areas and recommendations for probable student difficulties will be
   addressed. (C) 2000 American? Association of Physics Teachers.}},

Title = {{Effects oil cholesterol balance and LDL cholesterol in the rat of a
   soft-ripened cheese containing vegetable oils}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine effects of a
   modified soft-ripened cheese containing vegetable oils on cholesterol
   status, using the rat as the experimental model and the traditional
   soft-ripened cheese as the control.
   Methods: Adult male Wistar rats (approximate to 370 g) were divided into
   two dietary groups (20 rats/group) and fed either the standard diet
   (STD, containing traditional cheeses made from whole milk) or the
   experimental diet (EXP, containing modified cheeses made from the
   combination of skim milk with the following fat mixture: mill: fat/oleic
   acid-enriched sunflower oil/soybean oil mixture). Lipids of the diets
   came solely from cheeses (14 g/100 g diet); the EXP diet contained
   (3-fold) less saturated fat, (2-fold) less cholesterol, and (15-fold)
   more phytosterols than the STD diet.
   Results: Although serum triglyceride and total cholesterol
   concentrations were not affected by the type of diet the EXP diet
   resulted in a significant reduction of LDL-cholesterol (31\%, p<0.001)
   and a significant increase of HDL-cholesterol (11\%, p<0.05), compared
   to the STD diet. Thus, a marked reduction (39\%) of serum LDL/HDL
   cholesterol ratio was observed in the EXP group (p<0.001). In addition,
   the two quantitative balances (excreted/ingested) of cholesterol and
   total neutral sterols (for which phytosterols were excluded) were
   significantly higher by 183\% and 174\%, respectively for the EXP group,
   compared to the STD group (p<0.05). On another hand, rats fed the EXP
   diet excreted more cholesterol than they ingested dietary cholesterol
   (cholesterol balance > 1), indicating that those animals eliminated some
   endogenous cholesterol in their feces, while the opposite was true for
   rats fed the STD diet (cholesterol balance < 1). Finally, fecal bile
   salt concentration was not significantly different between the two
   dietary groups.
   Conclusions: The partial substitution of milk fat by vegetable oils in
   soft-ripened cheese resulted in a decreased blood LDL/HDL cholesterol
   ratio and an increased fecal excretion of endogenous cholesterol and
   neutral sterols and, thus, markedly improved its nutritional qualities.
   Therefore, the consumption of the described modified cheese may meet the
   demand of subjects who wish to lower their risk for atherosclerosis and
   cardiovascular disease.}},

Abstract = {{We suggest Milankovitch climate oscillations as a common cause for
   geographical patterns in species diversity, species' range sizes,
   polyploidy, and the degree of specialization and dispersability of
   organisms. Periodical changes in the orbit of the Earth cause climatic
   changes termed Milankovitch oscillations, leading to large changes in
   the size and location of species' geographical distributions. We name
   these recurrent changes ``orbitally forced species' range dynamics{''}
   (ORD). The magnitude of ORD varies in space and time. ORD decreases
   gradual speciation (attained by gradual changes over many generations),
   increases range sizes and the proportions of species formed by
   polyploidy and other ``abrupt{''} mechanisms, selects against
   specialization, and favor dispersability. Large ORD produces species
   prone neither to extinction nor gradual speciation. ORD increases with
   latitude, This produces latitudinal patterns, among them the gradient in
   species diversity and species' range sizes (Rapoport's rule).
   Differential ORD and its evolutionary consequences call for new
   conservation strategies on the regional to global scale.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Purpose: Pectus carinatum (PC) traditionally has been managed
   with surgical reconstruction. Compressive orthosis also has resulted in
   subjective improvement in this defect. The goal of the authors was to
   develop an alternative brace and an objective radiographic marker to
   monitor the effects of chest wall compression on sternal protrusion.
   Methods: Baseline chest computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained for
   5 teenage boys with chondrogladiolar type of PC. The angle at the point
   of greatest sternal rotation was measured as the baseline deformity.
   Compressive orthosis was initiated using a custom-fitted brace.
   Follow-up chest CT scans were obtained to document change in sternal
   rotation.
   Results: One patient was lost to follow-up after 6 months with
   subjective improvement. Another opted for surgical correction after 3
   months, having shown a 16\% decrease in sternal rotation preoperatively.
   Two patients showed subjective improvement corroborated by 33\% and 44\%
   decreases in sternal rotation. The fifth patient, who discontinued
   bracing after 1 month, showed a 25\% increase 6 months later.
   Conclusions: Preliminary results indicate a potential role for
   compressive orthosis in the management of pectus carinatum, The
   objective radiographic marker described may be used to monitor the
   effects of growth or treatment with compressive orthosis.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous imaging of Tc-99m and I-123 would have a high clinical
   potential in the assessment of brain perfusion (Tc-99m) and
   neurotransmission (I-123) but is hindered by cross-talk between the two
   radionuclides. Monte Carlo simulations of 15 different dual-isotope
   studies were performed using a digital brain phantom. Several
   physiologic Tc-99m and I-123 uptake patterns were modeled in the brain
   structures. Two methods were considered to correct for cross-talk from
   both scattered and unscattered photons: constrained spectral factor
   analysis (SFA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The accuracy and
   precision of reconstructed pixel values within several brain structures
   were compared to those obtained with an energy windowing method (WSA).
   In I-123 images, mean bias was close to 10\% in all structures for SFA
   and ANN and between 14\% (in the caudate nucleus) and 25\% (in the
   cerebellum) for WSA. Tc-99m activity was overestimated by 35\% in the
   cortex and 53\% in the caudate nucleus with WSA, but by less than 9\% in
   all structures with SFA and ANN. SFA and ANN performed well even in the
   presence of high-energy I-123 photons. The accuracy was greatly improved
   by incorporating the contamination into the SFA model or in the learning
   phase for ANN. SFA and ANN are promising approaches to correct for
   cross-talk in simultaneous Tc-99m/I-123 SPECT.}},

   (P = 0.043). iNOS protein was detectable, but not measurable, at low
   levels in a subset of obese patients (3 of 10), iNOS protein levels
   could not be detected in nonobese individuals. Hormone-sensitive lipase
   (HSL), the key regulating enzyme in lipolysis, is reduced in obesity.
   The expression of HSL protein in subcutaneous adipose tissue was studied
   in the same subset of patients; in agreement with previous results, HSL
   levels were reduced in obese subjects: 4.64 +/- 1.10 and 1.27 +/- 0.35
   (P = 0.012) in nonobese and obese subjects, respectively.jlr. In
   conclusion, this study shows that eNOS and iNOS, but not nNOS, are
   present in human subcutaneous adipose tissue. Gene expression and
   protein levels of eNOS are increased, whereas HSL protein levels are
   decreased in obesity. It is speculated that increased NO production,
   preferably by eNOS, and decreased HSL levels may cause decreased
   subcutaneous adipose tissue lipolysis in obesity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the activities carried out at Trawsfynydd since the
   completion of defuelling in 1995. Special factors at Trawsfynydd led to
   a period of public consultation on how the site should be
   decommissioned. As a result, an early reduced height safestore strategy
   has been adopted for the site. This strategy is described in the paper.
   In addition to the site decommissioning strategy, consideration must be
   given to intermediate-level radioactive wastes that have been
   accumulated as the station was operated. The main waste streams at
   Trawsfynydd are described, together with the plans for dealing with
   them. Trawsfynydd's location within the Snowdonia National Park has
   resulted in a planning application being submitted for the long-term
   appearance and use of the site. The present status of the application is
   described, together with the implications of the recent Nuclear Reactors
   (Environmental Impact for Decommissioning) Regulations. Arrangements for
   the implementation of decommissioning and radwaste work at Trawsfynydd
   are described, with a summary of work that has been completed.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the type and patterning of morphogenic cell behaviors
   driving convergent extension of the Xenopus neural plate in the presence
   and absence of persistent vertical signals from the mesoderm by
   videorecording explants of deep neural tissue with involuted mesoderm
   attached and of deep neural tissue alone. In deep neural-over-mesoderm
   explants, neural plate cells express monopolar medially directed
   motility and notoplate cells express randomly oriented motility, two new
   morphogenic cell behaviors. In contrast, in deep neural explants
   (without notoplate), all cells express bipolar mediolateral cell
   motility. Deep neural-over-mesoderm and deep neural explants also differ
   in degree of neighbor exchange during mediolateral cell intercalation.
   In deep neural-over-mesoderm explants, cells intercalate conservatively,
   whereas in deep neural explants cells intercalate more promiscuously.
   Last, in both deep neural-over-mesoderm and deep neural explants,
   morphogenic cell behaviors differentiate in an anterior-to-posterior and
   lateral-to-medial progression. However, in deep neural-over-mesoderm
   explants, morphogenic behaviors first differentiate in intervals along
   the anteroposterior axis, whereas in deep neural explants, morphogenic
   behaviors differentiate continuously from the anterior end of the tissue
   posteriorly. These results describe new morphogenic cell behaviors
   driving neural convergent extension and also define roles for signals
   from the mesoderm, up to and beyond late gastrulation, in patterning
   these cell behaviors. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological data suggest that oestrogen contributes to the aetiology
   of colonic cancer. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that local
   hormone metabolism may play a key role in determining colonic
   responsiveness to oestrogen. To further clarify this mechanism we have
   characterized the expression and regulation of isozymes of 17
   beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 beta-HSD) in vitro and in situ.
   Immunohistochemistry was used to confirm expression of the type 2 and 4
   isozymes of 17 beta-HSD (17 beta-HSD2 and 4) in normal colonic
   epithelial cells. Parallel studies suggested that both isozymes were
   abnormally expressed in colonic tumours and this was confirmed by
   Western blot analyses. Abnormal expression of 17 beta-HSD2 and 4
   proteins was also observed in Caco-2, HT-29 and SW620 colonic cancer
   cell lines, although the overall pattern of oestrogen metabolism in
   these cells was similar to that seen in primary colonic mucosa, tissue.
   The predominant activity (conversion of oestradiol to oestrone) was
   highest in Caco-2>SW620>HT-29, which correlated inversely with the rate
   of proliferation of the cell lines. Regulatory studies using SW620 cells
   indicated that the most potent stimulator of oestradiol to oestrone
   inactivation was the antiproliferative agent 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3
   (1,25D(3)), whilst oestradiol itself inhibited 17 beta-HSD activity.
   Both oestradiol and 1,25D(3) decreased mRNA for 17 beta-HSD2 and 4. Data
   indicate that the high capacity for inactivation of oestrogens in the
   colon is associated with the presence of 17 beta-HSD2 and 4 in
   epithelial cells. Abnormal expression of both isozymes in colonic cancer
   cells and the stimulation of oestrogen inactivation by the
   antiproliferative agent 1,25D(3) highlights a possible role for 17
   beta-HSD isozymes as modulators of colonic cell proliferation. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{This study examined the efficacy of trazodone 200 mg/day in patients
   with erectile dysfunction (ED) without major organic findings.
   Patients and methods: Thirty-four patients with ED without major organic
   findings entered a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized
   two-centre trial comparing placebo and trazodone 200 mg/day. After a 2
   week treatment-free, baseline period eligible patients entered a 4 week
   treatment-phase. Nocturnal erectile activity was measured before and
   after treatment by Rigiscan Plus(R). Sexual desire, quality of partner
   relation and depressive symptomatology were assessed with the derogatis
   sexual functioning inventory (DSFI), the dyadic adjustment scale (DAS)
   and the Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS), respectively. Sexual
   function during the study period was assessed with patient diaries.
   Compliance was measured by trazodone serum concentrations.
   There were no significant differences between trazodone and placebo in
   total erection duration, change in sexual desire, report of morning
   erections or psychometric scales, except for the HDRS. Trazodone serum
   levels indicated that half of the patients were not compliant.
   In conclusion, Trazodone 200 mg/day has no effect on sexual function in
   men with ED without major organic findings and non-compliance was an
   important issue in the present study.}},

Abstract = {{A new s-parameter-based signal transient characterization method for
   very large scale integrated (VLSI) interconnects is presented. The
   technique can provide very accurate signal integrity verification of an
   integrated circuit (IC) interconnect line since its s-parameters is
   composed of all the frequency-variant transmission line characteristics
   over a broad frequency band. In order to demonstrate the technique, test
   patterns are designed and fabricated by using a 0.35 mu m complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process, The time-domain signal
   transient characteristics for the test patterns are then examined by
   using the s-parameters over a 50 MHz to 20 GHz frequency range. The
   signal delay and the waveform distortion presented in the interconnect
   lines based on the proposed method are compared with the existing
   interconnect models. Using the experimental characterizations of the
   test patterns, it is shown that the silicon substrate effect and
   frequency-variant transmission line characteristics of IC interconnects
   can be very crucial.}},

   Setting, University-affiliated teaching hospital.
   Patients. Forty-two consecutive patients (mean +/- SD age 45.6 +/- 6
   yrs) with uterine size greater than 12 weeks (cavity >72 cm).
   Intervention. Endometrial ablation; 26 (62\%) women were pretreated to

   successfully performed in all patients in a da) surgery setting.
   Multiple regression analysis examined the relationship of uterine size,
   pretreatment, procedure, and duration of surgery to amount of glycine
   absorbed. Glycine absorption was higher with resection than with
   coagulation (p = 0.04). Fluid absorption cor related with type of
   procedure (r = 0.32, p = 0.04) but not with duration of the procedure,
   uterine size, or pretreatment. One patient with uterine fibroids and one
   with endometrial adenocarcinoma had hysterectomy. With follow-up? of 39

Abstract = {{Composition changes and chemical structure alterations initiated by ion
   beams on metal oxide surfaces have been widely studied. Significant
   differences in the effect of low-keV inert (Ar+) and reactive (N-2(+))
   ion impact on a series of metal oxides have been published recently by
   the present authors. In this work the effect of 0.5-5 keV N-2(+)
   bombardment on single crystalline alpha-Al2O3 was studied by
   quantitative XPS. Clarifying the existing ambiguity, experimental
   evidence is presented that supports the preferential oxygen loss and
   build-up of nitrogen. The oxygen Loss increased with increasing N-2(+)
   ion energy until approaching an atomic ratio saturation value of O/Al
   similar to 1 on 3.5 keV bombardment with the concomitant build-up of N
   at N/Al similar to 0.5. In contrast to other oxides, for alpha-Al2O3 two
   major types of nitrogen were detected on N-2(+) impact; the two N 1s
   lines were separated by 7 eV, The one at 396.4 eV binding energy
   corresponds to a nitride-type N-Al environment, similar to that found in
   bulk AlN, Formation of the nitride is interpreted as the result of
   replacement of lattice oxygen around Al by implanted nitrogen in a
   two-stage process. The 403.4 eV component is assigned to nitrogen
   trapped in the cation-deficient lattice of alpha-Al2O3 in empty
   octahedral sites surrounded by oxygen atoms bonded to Al. Both of these
   chemical states of nitrogen were stable on heating up to 550-650 degrees

Abstract = {{Internodal growth of deepwater rice (Oryza sativa L.) can achieve rates

   cdc20s-3 are the regulatory and catalytic subunits, respectively, of
   cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) which are central to cell cycle
   regulation. Both genes are regulated by gibberellic acid in a coordinate
   manner with transcripts accumulating in the G2 phase prior to the
   B2-type mitotic cyclins described previously (M. Sauter et al. 1995,
   Plant J 7: 623-632), suggesting a distinct role in regulating G2;M phase
   progression. Since cdc20s-3 belongs to a group of CDKs that have no
   counterparts in animals, it may function in a plant-specific
   gibberellin-regulated cell division process.}},

Abstract = {{The inactivation kinetics of two strains of bacterial aerobic spores
   were investigated in a batch reactor for two pH levels (6.3 and 8.2) and
   various ozone dosages (0.5-2.5 mg/l). The kinetics of ozone
   decomposition was found to satisfactorily fit a first-order decay model.
   The CT (concentration x contact time) values were calculated using the
   modified Hom equation with exponential disinfectant decay. Lower pH
   resulted in lower CT values. The environmental spores tested were not as
   resistant to ozone as the reference strain of B. subtilis. Comparison of
   CT values for aerobic spores with published data suggests that bacterial
   spores could be a surrogate for evaluating the stone inactivation of G.
   lamblia cysts and C. parvum (oo)cysts during drinking water
   disinfection. However, more information on the resistance of naturally
   occurring populations of bacterial spores would be needed before they
   are used as an indicator of ozone disinfection efficiency. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The organic compounds of diesel exhaust particles (DEP-PAHs) have been
   shown to favor immunoglobulin production and bronchial
   hyperresponsiveness and to affect cytokine and chemokine productions. To
   evaluate if diesel exhaust could act in synergy with a house dust mite
   allergen (Der p 1), peripheral blood mononuclear cells from allergic
   patients were exposed to DEP-PAHs, with or without purified Der p 1.
   DEP-PAHs and Der p 1 separately induced an increase in interleukin
   (IL)-8, regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted
   (RANTES), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations. Interestingly,
   a synergy between the two stimuli was also observed. In the Ease of
   monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, DEP-PAHs reduced the release,
   whereas Der p 1 enhanced it. A simultaneous exposure led to reduced
   production as compared with allergen exposure alone, but still
   represented an increase as compared with the control exposure.
   Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase Erk1/2 antagonist mainly
   inhibited the release of MCP-1, whereas MAP kinase p38 antagonist mainly
   suppressed the release of IL-8 and RANTES. Messenger RNA expression
   correlated with protein measurements. Moreover, supernatants from cells
   exposed to both DEP-PAHs and Der p 1 had a significant chemotactic
   activity on neutrophils and eosinophils, These findings suggest that
   simultaneous exposure of allergic patients to DEPs and allergens could
   result in high local chemokine levels via MAP kinase pathways
   activation, increasing the likelihood of reaching a critical threshold
   leading to the initiation of respiratory allergic symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Nitrovasodilators have been proposed for the
   treatment of portal hypertension alone or in combination with
   beta-blockers. In addition to their vasodilatory properties, nitric
   oxide (NO) donors may exert direct antifibrogenic properties. We
   evaluated the effect of nitroglycerin (NTG) and S-nitroso-N-acetyl
   penicillamine (SNAP) on the mitogenic and chemotactic properties of
   platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)BB and the modulation of the
   relative intracellular signaling pathways in fully activated human
   hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a cell type that plays an active role in
   liver fibrogenesis and portal hypertension. Methods Br Results: Both NTG
   and SNAP induced a dose-dependent decrease in PDGF-induced DNA synthesis
   and cell migration, which was associated with a decrease in PDGF-induced
   intracellular Ca2+ increase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase
   (ERK) activity. These effects were not related to activation of the
   classic soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)/guanosine 3',5'-cyclic
   monophosphate pathway; accordingly, Western blot analysis of HSC lysates
   revealed the absence of the alpha(1)beta(1) ubiquitous subunits of sGC,
   whereas they were detectable in quiescent HSCs, freshly isolated from
   normal human liver. Conversely, both NTG and SNAP induced a more than
   10-20-fold increase in prostaglandin E-2 in cell supernatants within 1
   minute, associated with an increase in intracellular adenosine
   3',5'-cyclic monophosphate levels. Accordingly, the inhibitory effects
   of NO donors on PDGF action and signaling were eliminated after
   preincubation with ibuprofen, Conclusions: These results suggest that NO
   donors may exert a direct antifibrogenic action by inhibiting
   proliferation, motility, and contractility of HSCs in addition to a
   reduction of fibrillar extracellular matrix accumulation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Caesarean section among the Yoruba of western Nigerian is
   surrounded by a lot of fears, miseries, aversion, guilt and
   misconceptions for reasons varying from the desire by women to have a
   natural vaginal birth, fear of surgery, morbidity and deaths from the
   operation and prolonged hospital stay.
   Objective: To examine issues of reduced hospital stay following
   Caesarean section with a view of making the operation more acceptable
   and proffering solution to some of the problems faced by women when
   Caesarean section is indicated.
   Design: A prospective case control study.
   Setting: Wesley Guild Hospital, Ilesha, Nigeria from Ist July, 1997 to
   30th June, 1998,
   Subjects: One hundred consecutive patients who had uncomplicated
   Caesarean section, randomised into two groups of short (three days) and
   prolonged (seven to eight days) hospital stay respectively,
   Main outcome measures: Observations of patients in both groups were made
   by an independent observer on day seven post-operation and the main
   outcomes measured included: wound infection rates, ability to maintain
   erect posture, mood changes, neonatal sepsis rate, immunisation rate of
   the neonates and average hospital bills,
   Results: The findings revealed that wound infection rates of six per
   cent and ten per cent among the short and prolonged hospitalised
   patients respectively are not significantly different, Patients with
   short stay have better erect posture, lower incidence of depressive
   mood, lower neonatal sepsis rate, lower hospital bill and are more
   satisfied with early home discharge.
   Conclusion: Embracing the concept of early home discharge after
   Caesarean section in uncomplicated cases may remove some of the
   psychological upsets and economical impediments associated with the
   operation and make the operation more acceptable.}},

Abstract = {{Recent reports have postulated the existence of two different types of
   self-injurious behavior: impulsive and compulsive. The aim of the
   present study is to analyze the dimensionality of self-injurious
   behavior and to study the link between self-injurious behavior and
   clinical features in anorexia nervosa. The study involved 236
   consecutive patients with anorexia nervosa, diagnosed by DSM-IV
   criteria. Subjects were evaluated by means of a semistructured interview
   and self-reported questionnaires, such as the Eating Disorders Inventory
   and Hopkins Symptom Checklist. A principal component analysis was used
   to study the dimensionality of different types of self-injurious
   behavior, including purging. Our findings confirm the distinction
   between impulsive and compulsive self-injurious behavior. The dimensions
   appear to be represented as a continuum in both the anorexia nervosa
   diagnostic subgroups. A third distinct dimension emerged that; included
   self-induced vomiting and laxative/diuretics abuse. Childhood sexual
   abuse and anxiety significantly predict the presence of impulsive
   self-injury, whereas obsessionality and age predict compulsive
   self-injury. The coexistence of a positive score on both dimensions of
   self-injurious behavior was the strongest predictor of treatment
   dropout. The present study highlights the importance of self-injurious
   behavior; it should be given due consideration in future outcome studies
   on anorexia nervosa.}},

   Hematologically, the mother's peripheral neutrophil count is normal.
   However, the passive transfer of maternal immunoglobulin G

   neutrophils can result in severe neutropenia in the neonate. Generally,
   ANN is a self-limiting condition, but with severe bacterial infection,
   mortality can be high. We present the clinical features of monozygous
   twins delivered at 33 weeks' postconception with this condition. This
   case report is unique in that it occurred in twins born prematurely and
   was attributable to antibodies against 2 neutrophil-specific antigens,
   NA1 and NB1. A brief review of the diagnosis, management, and treatment

   proportion to leptin levels during the menstrual cycle in lean but not
   in obese women}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{143}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective: In recent studies serum leptin levels were significantly
   higher in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase, but the
   mechanism of changing leptin levels are unknown. Several research lines
   indicate a potential role for tumor necrosis Factor (TNF-alpha) in
   ovulation and reproductive events. As TNF-alpha appears to regulate
   leptin secretion, we speculated that TNF-alpha might be involved in
   leptin variations during the menstrual cycle.
   Design and methods: Nine healthy never obese and ten overweight normally
   cycling women were studied, TNF-alpha action - through the plasma levels
   of the soluble fraction of the tumor necrosis factor receptors 1 and 2
   (sTNFR1 and sTNFR2) - and leptin concentrations were measured in the
   follicular(F), peri-ovulatory (PO) and luteal phases (L) of :heir
   menstrual cycles.
   Results: Circulating leptin levels were significantly associated with
   the stage of the menstrual cycle (P<0.001), being higher in PO and L
   phases. However, only three of ten overweight subjects vs eight of nine
   lean women (Chi square P = 0.014 after Fisher's exact test) showed
   significantly higher leptin levels in the PO and L than in the F phase
   (95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) of the differences, 3.7 to 10.2
   ng/ml, paired t-test P= 0.001), In these women (group 1), the changes in
   leptin levels parallelled the variations observed in plasma sTNFR1 (2.53
   +/- 0.1 vs 2.11 +/- 0.05 ng/ml, P<0.0001, 95\% CI, 0.21 to 0.56) and
   sTNFR2 levels (5.19 +/- 0.28 vs 4.55 +/- 0.25 ng/ml, P< 0.0001, 95\% CI,
   0.47 to 0.81). In the remaining women (group 2), leptin (95\% CI, -1 to
   9.2 ng/ml, P = not significant (NS)), sTNFR1 (95\% CI, -0.3 to 0.14
   ng/ml, P=NS) and sTNFR2 levels (95\% CI, -0.95 to 0.39 ng/ml, P = NS)
   were essentially unaltered throughout the menstrual cycle. Group 2 women
   were similar in age (36.1 +/- 2.9 vs 37.3 +/- 1.4 years) and
   significantly overweight (body mass index 31 +/- 7.9 vs 23.9 +/-
   kg/m(2)) compared with group 1 women. A negative correlation was
   observed between leptin levels in the follicular phase and the change in
   plasma leptin from F to L phase in all subjects (r= - 0.67. P = 0.002).
   Conclusions: Circulating leptin and sTNFRs levels change significantly
   during the menstrual cycle of most lean women. In contrast, the levels
   of these molecules remain essentially unaltered during the F. PO and L
   phases in the majority of overweigh: women. Obesity might be associated
   not only with blunted diurnal excursions and dampened pulsatility but
   also with blunted excursions during the menstrual cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To report two cases of Hydroview(R) (Storz H60M) hydrogel
   intraocular lens (IOL) opacification necessitating explantation. To
   analyse the explanted lenses and compare them with a new lens in order
   to determine the cause of opacification.
   Methods: Two cases are presented. Both patients complained of subjective
   decreases in vision approximately 1 year following uneventful cataract
   extraction and implantation of hydrogel lenses by the same experienced
   surgeon in the same institution. The reduced contrast sensitivity was
   thought to be due to failure of the hydrogel lenses which appeared
   opacified at the slit-lamp. They were then exchanged for acrylic lenses.
   Pre- and postoperative contrast sensitivity testing was performed using
   the Vectorvision(R) CSV-1000E instrument. A detailed comparative
   analysis of the opacified explanted lenses and a new lens was
   undertaken. This included surface microscopy, infrared spectral
   analysis, X-ray elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and
   electron microscopy of lens slices.
   Results: Lens exchange resulted in an improvement in subjective visual
   acuity (VA) and in objective contrast sensitivity testing. Analysis
   revealed deposits of calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) on the explanted
   lens' surfaces.
   Conclusions: The surface of the Hydroview(R) H60M intraocular lens is
   subject to opacification as a result of calcium phosphate
   (hydroxyapatite) deposition, thereby limiting the patient's visual
   outcome, and in some cases necessitating explantation. The reason for
   surface calcification requires further study.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the assessment of silver European eel (Anguilla

   Downstream migration fluxes were monitored using eel traps and related
   to environmental factors. Intensive electrofishing and fyke-net fishing
   were conducted to assess eel biomass, densities, and population
   structure. A total of 564 eels, including 81 silver eels, were PIT
   tagged. In 1996, 616 eels were caught in the catchment including 68
   silver eels (11\%). During the following downstream migration period, 12
   of the PIT-tagged silver eels, among a total of 678, were recaptured in
   the downstream traps. Seven were recaptured in the catchment in 1997. It
   was shown that (i) only about 20\% of the silver eels present in the
   catchment emigrated during the following year, (ii) 12\% stayed in the
   catchment including two (3.4\%) that recovered yellow eel
   characteristics, and (iii) the other eels either died or settled in the
   catchment but were not recaptured. It was also estimated that 2\% (650
   eels) of the population (34 000 eels) among 3000 silver eels considered
   ``emigration candidates{''} emigrated each year.}},

   developed parallel to the existing Structured Interview for Anorexic and
   Bulimic Syndromes (SIAB-EX) a similarily designed questionnaire for
   symptoms of disordered eating and related areas (SIAB-S). Method: 377
   treated eating disordered patients were assessed within a two-week time
   period using both the SIAB-EX and SIAB-S. Results: Generally,
   self-ratings based on the SIAB-S were quite similar to expert ratings.
   Cohen's kappa showed good agreement between self- and expert ratings.
   Factor structure based on principal component analyses of expert ratings
   or self-ratings led to rather similar results confirming the robustness
   of the subscales in self- and expert ratings. Using expert rating as a
   criterion, the self-rating (SIAB-S)- which can more easily be used for
   screening purposes - had a sensitivity of 0.70, a specificity of 0.80
   and a PPV = 0.91 for the DSM-IV diagnoses of AN and/or BN (worst ever
   condition). Diagnostic sensitivity (79/73 \%) and specificity (66/63 \%)
   were in an acceptable range (past/current). If we focus on the
   differences between the two approaches the following was found:
   self-rating (compared to expert-rating) resulted in lower scores for
   items inquiring about binges and inappropriate compensatory behaviour,
   attitudes towards food and eating, and social interaction. On the other
   hand, self-rating (compared to expert-rating) led to higher scores for
   items measuring general psychopathology and atypical bingeing.
   Conclusion: Compared to the ``gold standard{''} of data obtained with
   investigator-based standardised or structured interviews, data based on
   self-rating with items formulated clearly and concisely can lead to
   reliable and valid results. While complex issues (what is a binge) are
   difficult to assess in self-ratings, some (very personal) questions may
   even be better asked in a self-report questionnaire.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To determine the reproducibility of parameters estimated by
   pulse wave analysis (PWA), mainly of central systolic blood pressure in
   the aorta (CSP), central systolic pressure-time index (CSPTI, area under
   the systolic part of the curve in the pressure-time graph per minute),
   and central augmentation index (CAI, pressure peak caused by wave
   reflection divided by pressure peak caused by ventricular ejection).
   Methods In 88 healthy subjects, aged 19-53 years, radial pulse wave was
   registered by two investigators on separate visits in a random sequence,
   twice during each visit.
   Results Variability within and among subjects was significantly
   different for peripheral systolic pressure (PSP) and for all the
   above-mentioned parameters (P < 0.0001 by ANOVA for all). Variability
   within and between observers was tested by Bland-Altman plots; they did
   not show any trend for the variability to be dependent on the underlying
   mean value. PSP, CSP and CSPTI decreased significantly during one visit
   (by 4.6, 4.7 and 4.2\%, respectively), PSP and CSP were higher at the
   first than at the second visit (by 2.2, 2.2\%, respectively, and not
   significant for CSPTI), and there were also significant interobserver
   differences in all the three parameters as one observer measured higher
   values (by 2.4, 3.2 and 6.0\%, respectively). CAI did not change within
   and between visits; the same applied to the difference between PSP and
   CSP since these pressures always changed in parallel.
   Conclusions PWA gives estimates of several parameters characterizing the
   pressure load of central circulation and the wave reflection. The
   reproducibility of CSP and CSPTI is similar to that of PSP, CAI and the
   difference between PSP and CSP is not influenced by order of
   measurement, of visit or by investigator. Therefore, CAI is a more
   stable parameter than PSP measured by an oscillometric device. Since
   these parameters may contribute to a better assessment of cardiovascular
   risk, PWA might be used in prospective studies. J Hypertens 2000,

Abstract = {{In this report we investigated the function of
   phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) in protein kinase B
   (PKB) activation and translocation to the cell surface. Wild-type and
   PDK1 mutants were transfected into HeLa cells, and their subcellular
   localization was analyzed. PDK1 was found to translocate to the plasma
   membrane in response to insulin, and this process did not require a
   functional catalytic activity, since a catalytically inactive kinase
   mutant (Kd) of PDK1 was capable of translocating. The PDK1 presence at
   the cell surface was shown to be linked to phospholipids and therefore
   to serum-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. Using
   confocal microscopy in HeLa cells we found that PDK1 colocalizes with
   PKB at the plasma membrane. Further, after cotransfection of PKB and a
   PDK1 mutant (Mut) unable to translocate to the plasma membrane, PKB was
   prevented from moving to the cell periphery after insulin stimulation.
   In response to insulin, a PKB mutant with its PH domain deleted (Delta
   PH-PKB) retained the ability to translocate to the plasma membrane when
   coexpressed with PDK1. Finally, we found that Delta PH-PKB was highly
   active independent of insulin stimulation when cotransfected with PDK1
   mutants defective in their PH domain. These findings suggest that PDK1
   brings PKB to the plasma membrane upon exposure of cells to insulin and
   that the PH domain of PDK1 acts as a negative regulator of its enzyme
   activity.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to NO and prostacyclin, endothelial cells release a factor
   that elicits vasodilatation by hyperpolarizing the underlying vascular
   smooth muscle cells. In some vascular beds, this so-called
   endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) displays the
   characteristics of a cytochrome P450 (CYP)-derived arachidonic acid
   metabolite, such as an epoxyeicosatrienoic acid. Native porcine and
   cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells were screened for CYP
   epoxygenases, and CYP2B, CYP2C, and CYP2J were detected with reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The CYP inducer
   beta-naphthoflavone and the Ca2+ antagonist nifedipine significantly
   increased CYP2C mRNA but did not change the expression of CYP2J or
   CYP2B. To determine the relationship between CYP2C expression and EDHF
   production in native endothelial cells, we incubated porcine coronary
   arteries with nifedipine. Nifedipine enhanced endothelial CYP2C protein
   expression, as well as the generation of 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid.
   In organ bath experiments, pretreatment with nifedipine enhanced
   bradykinin-induced, EDHF-mediated relaxations as well as the concomitant
   hyperpolarization of smooth muscle cells. The specific CYP2C9 inhibitor
   sulfaphenazole, on the other hand, significantly attenuated
   EDHF-mediated hyperpolarization and relaxation. These results
   demonstrate that in porcine coronary arteries, the elevated expression
   of a CYP epoxygenase, homologous to CYP2C8/9, is associated with
   enhanced EDHF-mediated hyperpolarization in response to bradykinin.
   Therefore, we propose that an isozyme of CYP2C is the most likely
   candidate for the CYP-dependent EDHF synthase in porcine coronary
   arteries.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Vasospasm and ischemic organ injury are important in the
   pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma). The present study
   was performed to determine whether SSc arterioles have an intrinsic
   disturbance in vasoconstrictor activity.
   Methods. Skin biopsy samples were obtained from the upper arm of 11
   patients with diffuse SSc (clinically uninvolved skin) and 8 age- and
   sex-matched control subjects. Dermal arterioles were dissected from the
   biopsy sample and mounted in a myograph for continuous monitoring of
   arteriolar diameter. The resting internal diameter of control and SSc
   arterioles was similar (mean +/- SEM 164 +/- 15 mu and 166 +/- 18 mu,
   respectively),
   Results. Dermal arterioles displayed no spontaneous constrictor activity
   in the absence of stimulation. Vasoconstriction in response to KCl, a
   receptor-independent activator of smooth muscle, or to phenylephrine, a
   selective alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(1)-AR) agonist, was
   similar in control and SSc arterioles. However, constrictor responses to
   UK 14,304, a selective alpha(2)-AR agonist, were increased in SSc
   compared with control arterioles (maximal constriction responses of 25
   +/- 5\% and 67 +/- 4\% {[}mean +/- SEM] in control and SSc arterioles,
   respectively; P = 0.000014). Mechanical denudation of the endothelium
   did not alter reactivity to alpha(2)-AR activation, indicating that the
   enhanced constriction in SSc was not mediated by changes in endothelial
   dilator activity, Indeed, in arterioles constricted with phenylephrine,
   the endothelial stimuli acetylcholine or bradykinin evoked
   endothelium-dependent relaxation that was similar in control and SSc
   arterioles.
   Conclusions. Vascular smooth muscle in SSc arterioles displayed a
   selective increase in alpha(2)-AR reactivity, The endothelial dilator
   function appeared normal. Altered activity of smooth muscle alpha(2)-ARs
   may contribute to the vasospastic activity that is a prominent feature
   of the SSc disease process.}},

   the nature of money supply. In this paper, I look at a business cycle
   model where the central bank sets money supply to minimize the
   volatility of inflation and output. I find that small changes in the
   central bank's preferences can generate large changes in the derived
   money supply rule and in correlations between real and nominal
   variables. Although wages are assumed to be sticky, changes in the money
   supply rule do not generate any major changes in the behavior of real

Abstract = {{This work studied the activation of hepatic macrophages during acute
   pancreatitis and the involvement of these cells in the lung inflammatory
   response. Pancreatitis was induced in Wistar rats by intraductal
   administration of 5\% sodium taurocholate. Three hours after
   pancreatitis induction, the degree of pulmonary inflammation, TNF-alpha
   levels, and P-selectin expression were evaluated. The generation of
   TNF-alpha by Kupffer cells was also measured. Pancreatitis increases the
   serum concentration of TNF-alpha, neutrophil infiltration, and
   P-selectin expression in pancreas and lung. In addition, Kupffer cells
   generate increased levels of TNF-alpha. When Kupffer cells were
   inhibited, the increase in serum TNF-alpha levels and the infiltration
   of neutrophils in the lung were prevented, but P-selectin expression
   remained unmodified. We conclude that pulmonary inflammation induced by
   acute pancreatitis is mediated by Kupffer cell activation and that

Abstract = {{Objective: This study was undertaken to determine' the incidence,
   hospital charges, and correlates associated with inpatient treatment of
   child maltreatment related injuries.
   Methods: The data were based on the 1995 Pennsylvania Hospital Discharge
   Data which included all Pennsylvania acute care hospitals that reported
   child maltreatment discharges. Per capita hospital discharge rates were
   computed for children discharged with child maltreatment related
   injuries according to selected variables. Odds ratios for child
   maltreatment related injury hospitalizations were also computed.
   Results: A total of 348 maltreated injured children ages 0-19 years were
   discharged from Pennsylvania hospitals in 1995, representing an
   incidence rate of 10.8 per 100,000 persons. The total hospital charges
   for child maltreatment related injury discharges amounted to over \$5.4
   million, of which Medicaid alone paid for 45\%. Compared to a random
   sample of non-maltreated injured children (n = 1052), maltreated injured
   children were found to be significantly younger, more likely to be
   females, and more likely to be Black. Child maltreatment related injury
   hospitalizations were more likely to be urgent and via physician
   referral or transfer from other health care facility. Maltreated injured
   children were three times as likely to die as other children.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that injury from child maltreatment
   is a major cause of hospitalization of young children 5 years and
   younger and represents a significant cost to publicly financed health
   care. While hospital discharge data can be used for population-based
   surveillance of child maltreatment related trauma, there is need for
   improvement in the surveillance of these injuries. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The dynamics of a recurrent inhibitory neural loop composed of a
   periodically spiking Aplysia motoneuron reciprocally connected to a
   computer are investigated as a function of the time delay, tau, for
   propagation around the loop. It is shown that for certain choices of
   tau, multiple qualitatively different neural spike trains co-exist. A
   mathematical model is constructed for the dynamics of this
   pulsed-coupled recurrent loop in which all parameters are readily
   measured experimentally: the phase resetting curve of the neuron for a
   given simulated postsynaptic current and tau. For choices of the
   parameters for which multiple spiking patterns co-exist in the
   experimental paradigm, the model exhibits multistability. Numerical
   simulations suggest that qualitatively similar results will occur if the
   motoneuron is replaced by several other types of neurons and that once
   tau becomes sufficiently long, multistability will be the dominant form
   of dynamical behavior. These observations suggest that great care must
   be taken in determining the etiology of qualitative changes in neural
   spiking patterns, particularly when propagation times around
   polysynaptic loops are long.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Warfarin use is complicated by an erratic dose response.
   Interpatient variability associated with warfarin therapy may be partly
   attributable to polymorphisms of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) complex. The
   purpose of this study was to ascertain the frequency and influence of
   CYP polymorphisms on warfarin dosing in our patient population.
   Methods. Patients receiving warfarin therapy were recruited from the
   inpatient divisions of our hospital. Genotyping fm known polymorphic
   alleles of the CYP subfamilies CYP2C9 (CYP2C9{*}1, CYP2C9{*}2, and
   CYD2C9{*}3) and CYP2A6 (CYP2A6{*}1, CYP2A6{*}2) with the use of standard
   methods of polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed. An
   unpaired t test was used to statistically compare genotypes.
   Results. Genotype frequency in 38 patients is as follows:
   CYP2C9{*}1/CYP2C9{*}1, 71\%; CYP2C9{*}1/CYP2C9{*}2, 21\%;
   CYP2C9{*}2/CYP2C9{*}2, 3\%; CYP2C9{*}1/CYP2C9{*}3, 5\%;
   CYP2A6{*}1/CYP2A6{*}1, 95\%; CYP2A6{*}1/CYP2A6{*}2, 5\%. Compared to a
   wild-type genotype, the presence of the CYP2C9{*}2, CYP2C9{*}3, or
   CYP2A6{*}2 allele was associated with a significant reduction in weekly
   warfarin dose (mean weekly warfarin dose {[}+/- SE] for wild-type
   genotype was 0.397 +/- 0.024 mg/kg/wk vs 0.307 +/- 0. 03 mg/kg/wk for
   carriers of CYP2C9{*}2, CYP2C9{*}3, or CYP2A6{*}2 polymorphism; P =
   .03).
   Conclusions. Polymorphisms that impair warfarin metabolism are common,
   occurring in 34\% of patients, and are associated with increased
   warfarin sensitivity. The use of genotypic information to prescribe more
   accurate doses of warfarin may increase the safety and efficacy of this
   medication.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Patients suffering from migraine and tension-type-headache
   are at risk of misusing analgesics and therefore developing chronic
   drug-induced headache. The present study compares migraine patients with
   and without abuse to identify psychological descriptors promoting drug
   abuse.
   Methods, We examined 21 in-patients with migraine and drug-abuse and 21
   out-patients with migraine and no drug-abuse who were comparable
   regarding age and diverse pain variables (intensity, frequency,
   duration, etc.). Psychometric questionnaires measured the constructs
   ``pain-disability{''}, ``depression{''}, ``self-efficacy{''} and
   ``pain-coping{''}. Using a standardized interview we investigated the
   external (environment) and internal (mental factors) conditions of all
   patients during medication intake.
   Results. Migraineurs who misused medications showed significantly
   greater disability, greater helplessness and anxiety due to pain and a
   tendency towards more marked general depression than non-abusers. The
   extent of the helpless and depressive coping with pain was best suited
   for distinguishing the patients with and without drug abuse,followed by
   the fact that those with abuse receive drugs from several doctors at the
   same time and demand that the drugs free them of all complaints.
   Conclusions. These findings suggest that migraine patients with drug
   abuse often take analgesics not according to their headache, but rather
   depending on certain other factors.}},

   containing only three angular variables can be directly constructed in a
   few minutes from the geometric invariants using Maple on a general
   personal compute,: These resulting equations have no extraneous roots
   and are algebraically independent. Because the basic closure equations
   are obtained from the geometric invariants, they have the most simple
   forms and provide a very good chance to solve the input-output equation
   for the inverse kinematics problem. As a result, we use the set of basic
   closure equations to derive the symbolic 16th degree input-output
   equation and compute the input-output equation for a special case with
   16 different real solutions. All position and orientation coordinates of
   the end-effector may be symbolic parameters. The definition of the
   geometric invariants is independent of joint types and can be applied to
   manipulators with any serial geometry.}},

Abstract = {{We recently developed a new method for simple determination of particle
   magnetic susceptibility using analytical magnetapheresis. This new
   method does not require laborious calibration plots and trial
   susceptibility values as do previous analytical magnetapheresis methods.
   The new method is based on balancing channel now rates and magnetically
   induced now rates for particle deposition in analytical magnetapheresis.
   The maximal now rate for complete particle deposition was determined
   experimentally and set to equal the magnetically induced now rate for
   determining particle magnetic susceptibility. This magnetic
   susceptibility determination generally takes less than 20 min. Several
   magnetically susceptible and ion-labeled particles were tested using
   this new method. The carrier magnetic susceptibilities were varied, and
   erbium ion-labeled particles were studied experimentally, resulting in
   successful susceptibility determinations of erbium ion-labeled particles
   and yeasts. The precision of each measurement was generally similar to
   10\%. Experimental determination of particle magnetic susceptibilities
   differed by less than 10\% from reference measurements taken using a
   superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. This method
   can determine minimal susceptibilities on the order of 10(-9) cgs. The
   minimum number of erbium labeling ions per particle required for
   complete deposition of silicas and yeasts was found to be 6.7 x 10(9).
   Analytical magnetapheresis shows good potential for use in simple
   determination of particle magnetic susceptibilities and should become a
   useful technique.}},

Abstract = {{Acetylcholine, released from cholinergic nerve terminals, innervated to
   adrenal chromaffin cells, evokes catecholamine release from the
   chromaffin cells. In the previous studies neostigmine, an
   acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, nicotine and oxotremorine, a muscarinic
   receptor agonist, hardly induce catecholamine release from adrenal
   medulla of 21-day-old rats. Not only adrenaline but also noradrenaline
   is released from the chromaffin cells by insulin-induced hypoglycemia in
   fasted 21-day-old rats, whereas preferential adrenaline release occurs
   in fasted 8-week-old rats. The purpose of the present study was to
   characterize the catecholamine output induced by hypoglycemia in
   21-day-old rats. Hexamethonium, a nicotinic receptor antagonist, blocked
   the adrenaline and noradrenaline release from the chromaffin cells
   almost completely as judged from measuring the catecholamine content and
   observing the morphological changes of the chromaffin cells. Nicotine or
   oxotremorine, injected into the fasted animals, induced catecholamine
   release. In the multiple steps of the chromaffin granule exocytotic
   pathway one or several steps are probably inactive in infant rat and
   these steps become to be fully active by starvation. The nicotinic
   receptors of the chromaffin cells in infant rats mainly contribute the
   secretion induced by hypoglycemia. It has been postulated that the
   nicotinic receptors are primarily concentrated in the synaptic zones of
   the chromaffin cell membrane and are involved in the physiological
   stimulation, whereas the extrasynaptic regions contain a mixture of the
   nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, these are activated by injected
   secretogogues.}},

Abstract = {{The transient critical heat fluxes, CHFs, on 1.2-mm horizontal cylinders
   with mirror finished surface (MS) and Emery-3 finished rough one (RS) in
   a pool of water due to exponentially increasing heat inputs,
   Q(0)e(t/tau), with the periods, tau, ranged from 20 s down to 2 ms at
   pressures ranging from atmospheric up to 2 MPa for the subcoolings
   ranging from 0 to 80 K were measured. A heat input with the period of 20
   s corresponds to quasi-steadily increasing one. The obtained data
   compared with the corresponding data for a cylinder with commercial
   surface (CS) which were already published in other papers. The trend of
   CHFs for the periods was generally as follows: the CHF first increases
   with a decrease in period up to a certain maximum CHF, then it decreases
   down to a minimum CHF and finally again increases with a decrease in
   period; namely the CHFs for the periods are separated into the first,
   second and third groups for longer, shorter and intermediate periods,
   respectively. The three groups of the CHFs for the periods tested were
   clearly observed for the cylinders with MS and RS, though the CHFs
   values for the shorter periods belonging to the second group were not
   observed for the cylinder with CS except those for the saturation
   condition at around atmospheric pressure, and those for high subcoolings
   at higher pressures. At the CHFs belonging to the second group the
   direct or semi-direct transition clearly occurs from transient
   conduction regime to film boiling without or with the vapor bubbles for
   a while with instantaneous increasing of heat flux for both cylinders of
   MS and RS. It was assumed that the transitions at the CHFs occur due to
   the explosive-like heterogeneous spontaneous nucleation (HSN) in
   originally flooded cavities similar to the assumption for the cylinder
   with CS previously published. It should be noted that as a typical
   example the minimum CHFs for the periods of 10 ms on the MS and RS
   cylinders at the pressure of I MPa for the subcooling of 40 K were
   approximate to 40\% of the corresponding steady-state CHF. It was
   observed that the trends of CHFs for the periods belonging to the second
   and third groups are significantly affected by the cylinder surface
   conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The objective of this study was to evaluate load transmission
   in the cancellous bone of the tibia under static and impact load.
   Background. Abnormal transmission of loads may result in osteoarthritis
   and fractures. However, the role of the cancellous bone in these
   processes is not well understood.
   Methods. The compressive stresses in the subchondral bone, epiphysis and
   diaphysis of the tibia of porcine knees were measured under static and
   impact load using mini-pressure transducers. The tests were performed
   using a drop-tower type testing machine in neutral, varus and valgus
   alignments. Tests were repeated after meniscectomy and again after
   removing the articular cartilage.
   Results. In the intact knee in all alignments, the highest stress on the
   medial side was found in the epiphysis, and in the subchondral bone on
   the lateral side. After meniscectomy, a significant increase was
   observed in the stress in the subchondral bone on both sides. After the
   articular cartilage was also removed, the stress in the subchondral bone
   increased again, but slightly.
   Conclusion. The importance of the meniscus in load transmission is
   supported by this study. The contribution of the articular cartilage to
   load transmission is less than that of the meniscus. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper proposes site selection diversity transmission power control
   (SSDT), an advanced form of transmission power control (TPC) for CDMA
   forward link. SSDT realizes site selection transmission diversity
   instead of full site transmission diversity used in conventional TPC
   during soft hand over (SHO) mode. The major intention of the site
   selection is to mitigate interference caused by multiple site
   transmission done at conventional TPC, Simulation results indicated that
   the higher the capacity gain of SSDT is in comparison to conventional
   TPC, the lower the mobile station (MS) speed is. Capacity gain of about
   55\% for a pedestrian MS is achieved by SSDT in case of MS reception
   diversity and 6 finger RAKE reception. This paper also presents the
   benefits of SSDT in terms of its high path capturing efficiency and the
   mitigation of power imbalance among active BS's due to TPC command

   wild-type recipients showed macrophage, recipient MHC class II, and B7

   cytometry revealed that CD11b(+) and MHC class II(+) graft infiltrating

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the history of assisted suicide/euthanasia and
   public attitudes in Canada; discusses depression in the terminally ill
   and the potential role of the psychologist in the assisted
   suicide/euthanasia process; and specifically addresses the importance of
   determining competence in terminally ill patients. One area in which the
   services of psychologists have not been used to their fullest potential
   is in the care of the terminally in, particularly in helping them make
   end-of-life decisions. It is very important that individuals making
   end-of-life decisions be assessed for mental disorders in order to
   ensure they are able to make competent decisions. If assisted suicide
   and euthanasia were to become legalized, psychologists should be
   involved in the assessment process in order to determine competency.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-scale network model based on the percolation theory and using a
   renormalization method was applied to describe the porous space of
   cement-based materials and to determine their gas transport properties.
   Gas permeability was measured on hardened cement pastes prepared with
   French OPC (CEM I) and BFS-PFA (CEM V) cements currently used in the
   nuclear waste industry. These experiments there carried out to study the
   influence of the degree of water saturation and of the microstructure on
   materials gas transport properties. Between 10 and 100\% relative
   humidity, the cement pastes' average gas permeability varies over five
   orders of magnitude (10(-16)-10(-21) m(2)). Results show that in the
   range of water saturation considered, there is no linear relationship
   between the gas permeability, and the degree of water saturation in
   percentage terms. Permeability change was well observed for cement
   pastes characterized by w/c ratios of 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50, in the low
   water saturation domain (<60\%). CEM V pastes are globally more
   permeable to gas than CEM I pastes in the range of one order of
   magnitude. For the modelling aspect, the application of the XDQ
   multi-scale model made it possible to model a porous network equivalent
   to the one obtained by the mercury intrusion porosimetry test. Each
   class of pores is associated with an elementary, cubic random network.
   The whole porous system is rebuilt by a recurrent process involving
   superposition and rescaling of all the elementary, networks. Then, an
   equivalent conductivity of the multiscale network is computed and
   extended to gas permeability. Modelling and experimental results are in
   agreement and show that mercury intrusion is a relevant method to
   characterize a porous space in order to estimate the gas permeability,
   of cement-based materials with a conceptual model.}},

Abstract = {{The objective was to investigate the relationship of disease severity,
   health beliefs and medication adherence among HIV/AIDS patients. A
   survey was administered to 72 patients in three different stages of
   HIV/AIDS (CDC clinical categories A, B, C). Multivariate analyses
   revealed that there were no significant differences in patients'
   perceptions of the severity of HIV/AIDS or perceptions of the benefits
   and barriers for the treatment across three disease stages. However, the
   most severely ill patients (tn stage C) perceived a higher risk of
   complications if they did not take their medicine as prescribed compared
   to asymptomatic patients (stage A) (p = 0.01). Also, patients in stages
   B and C were more adherent to their medications compared to patients in
   stage A (p = 0. 007). Finally, perceived susceptibility inaction was
   positively related to medication adherence (p = 0. 005) and difficulty
   in following doctors' instructions was negatively related to patients'
   medication adherence (p = 0. 009). In conclusion, patients' illness
   experiences are associated with their beliefs about the chances of
   developing complications if they do not adhere to their medications.
   Patients who have experienced more complications perceive a stronger
   relationship between medication non-adherence and AIDS-related
   complications, and are also more adherent to their medication regimen
   when compared to patients with no prior complications.}},

Abstract = {{Analysing a 2 X 2 table is one of the most frequent problems in applied
   research (particularly in epidemiology). When the table arises from a 2
   X 2 multinomial trial (or the case of double dichotomy), the appropriate
   test for independence is an unconditional one, like those of Barnard
   (1947), which, although they date from a long time ago, have not been
   developed (because of computational problems) until the last ten years.
   Among the different possible versions, the optimal (Martin Andres \&
   Tapia Garcia, 1999) is Barnard's original one, but the calculation time
   (even today) is excessive. This paper offers critical region tables for
   that version, which behave well compared to those of Shuster (1992). The
   tables are of particular use for researchers wishing to obtain
   significant results for very small sample sizes (N less than or equal to
   50).}},

Abstract = {{This evoked potential is novel because it arises in response to a
   stimulus that also evokes a muscle response, and so this potential could
   contain myogenic components. The present study was undertaken to define
   the relationship between the scalp response and other physiological
   responses that are evoked by airway occlusion. Evoked signals were
   recorded from the scalp, scalenus anterior, masseter, and
   electrooculogram. Responses to a 200-ms midinspiratory occlusion were
   recorded in 12 healthy volunteers. Evoked responses were reliably
   recorded at C-3-C-Z and C-4-C-Z and from the skin overlying the scalenus
   anterior in 11 of these subjects. The onset latencies were 15.7 +/- 3.1
   at C-3-C-Z, 15.9 +/- 2.1 at C-4-C-Z, and 17.6 +/- 5.5 ms at scalenus
   anterior. In nine subjects, the masseter response appeared to coincide
   with the mouth pressure trace, and this was interpreted as movement
   artifact. No consistent electrooculogram or frontal electroencephalogram
   response was recorded. Because of the similarity in onset latency at
   C-3-C-Z, C-4-C-Z, and scalenus anterior, it was concluded that the
   myogenic signal may contribute to the scalp response and should be
   viewed as a potential source of artifact in experiments of this nature.}},

   through a liquid phase (LPB) that forms at temperatures above a eutectic
   that releases a S-rich Liquid. Upon SSDB, there is no significant S
   excess at the interface, whereas LPB forms a thin interphase with a high
   local concentration of S. The SSDB materials have interfaces with such
   high toughness (above 300 J m(-2)) and fatigue resistance that mode I
   cracks divert into the Al2O3, rather than propagate at the interface.
   Conversely the LPB materials delaminate at the interface, solely as a
   result of the residual stresses from thermal expansion misfit, with an
   interface toughness in the range 2 to 7 J m(-2).}},

   single-stripe diode laser and a tapered amplifier. The pulses were
   generated by a mode-locked single-stripe laser in an external-resonator
   configuration. On amplification in a tapered amplifier, pulses exhibited
   both spectral broadening and distortion, depending on the tapered
   amplifier current and the injected optical pulse power. This behavior
   originates from the dynamic nonlinear carrier induced spatiospectral
   gain and index changes as well as gain saturation and leads to
   self-phase modulation. The origin of the observed behavior is revealed
   by a spatially resolved microscopic theory based on
   Maxwell-Bloch-Langevin equations that takes into account many-body
   interactions, energy transfer between carrier and phonon systems, and,
   in particular, the spatiotemporal interplay of stimulated and amplified
   spontaneous emission and noise. (C) 2000 Optical Society of America

Abstract = {{Fall chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) spawned predominantly in
   areas of the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River where hyporheic water
   discharged into the river channel. This upwelling water had a dissolved
   solids content (i.e., specific conductance) indicative of river water
   and was presumed to have entered highly permeable riverbed substrate at
   locations upstream of the spawning areas. Hyporheic discharge zones
   composed of undiluted ground water or areas with little or no upwelling
   were not used by spawning salmon. Rates of upwelling into spawning areas
   averaged 1200 L.m(-2).day(-1) (95\% CI = 784-1665 L.m(-2).day(-1)) as
   compared with approximately 500 L.m(-2).day(-1) (95\% CI = 303-1159
   L.m(-2).day(-1)) in nonspawning areas. Dissolved oxygen content of the
   hyporheic discharge near salmon spawning areas was about 9 mg.L-1 (+/-
   0.4 mg.L-1) whereas in nonspawning areas, dissolved oxygen values were 7
   mg.L-1 (+/- 0.9 mg.L-1) or lower. In both cases, dissolved oxygen of the
   river water was higher (11.3 +/- 0.3 mg.L-1). Physical and chemical
   gradients between the hyporheic zone and the river may provide cues for
   adult salmon to locate suitable spawning areas. This information will
   help fisheries managers to describe the suitability of salmon spawning
   habitat in large rivers.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: Criteria for determining the durability of the
   response to transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)
   ablation of prostate cancer have been established by calculating
   progression-free probability.
   Patients and Methods: A series of 82 patients (mean age 71 +/- 5.7
   years) with biopsy-proven localized (stage T-1-T-2) cancer who were not
   suitable candidates for radical surgery underwent transfectal HIFU
   ablation with the Ablatherm(TM) machine. The mean follow-up was 17.6
   months (range 3-68 months). The mean serum prostate specific antigen
   (PSA) value and mean prostate volume were 8.11 +/- 4.64 ng/mL and 34.9
   +/- 17.4 cm(3), respectively. Progression was rigidly defined as any
   positive biopsy result, regardless of PSA concentration, or three
   successive PSA increases for patients with a negative biopsy (PSA
   velocity greater than or equal to 0.75), Times to specific events
   (positive biopsy and PSA elevation) were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier
   survival method.
   Results: Overall, 62\% of the patients exhibited no evidence of disease
   progression 60 months after transrectal HIFU ablation, In particular,
   the disease-free rate was 68\% for the moderate-risk group of 50
   patients (PSA <15.0 ng/mL, Gleason sum <8, prostate volume <40 cm(3),
   and number of positive biopsies <5), For the low-risk group of 32
   patients (PSA <10 ng/mL and Gleason sum <7), the disease-free survival
   rate was 83\%,
   Conclusion: Transrectal HIFU prostate ablation is an effective
   therapeutic alternative for patients with localized prostatic
   adenocarcinoma.}},

Volume = {{71}},

Abstract = {{An adjustable resonance cavity was developed to measure the complex
   permittivity of dielectric materials. The cavity has an inner diameter
   of 16.400 cm and an inner height of 2.54 cm. The aluminum stationary
   wall holder was positioned about 10.8 cm above the top of the cavity. It
   was fixed into place by three 1.27-cm-diam linear shafts. By suspending
   from the wall holder, the movable wall moved vertically by sliding on
   1.27 cm bore-closed ball bushings. By turning a 1 in.-12 nut, the
   movable wall could be positioned so that the cavity height equaled the
   height of the sample. Therefore, this enables the measurement of the
   permittivity of samples with heights between 0.88 and 1.91 cm and radius
   between 1.27 and 3.18 cm. The complex permittivity of the sample was
   calculated based upon the sample dimensions, central frequency of TMono
   modes, and Q factor of the resonance curve using an exact solution. The
   complex permittivity was measured at the three lowest modes, where the
   frequency span is 1-4 GHz. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Muonium, like the hydrogen atom, is a hydrophobic solute in water under
   standard conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the
   free atom exists in a transient clathrate-like cage of hydrogen-bonded
   water molecules. The hyperfine constants of Mu and H are very close to
   their vacuum values, supporting the picture of an atom ``rattling{''}
   around in a hole in the liquid. Muonium has now been studied in water
   over a wide range of temperatures and pressures, from standard
   conditions to over 400 degrees C and 400 bar (the critical point is at
   374 degrees C, 221 bar). Drastic changes occur in the properties of
   water over this range of conditions, so large changes in the muonium
   hyperfine constant might well be expected. Surprisingly, the changes are
   small. The hyperfine coupling constant goes through a minimum in the
   subcritical region, and then increases toward the vacuum value under
   supercritical conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A study was made of the use of pulverized fuel ash (PFA) mixtures to

   PFA:cement and 2.5 times that of sand: cement for the same (PFA +
   sand):cement ratio. Frost resistance was generally good. The material
   showed no expansion when tested in accordance with the freeze-thaw test
   procedure given in BS 812: Part 124. The use of calcium chloride to
   improve early strength was more effective than the two commercially
   available accelerators investigated. More work is needed to improve the
   early strength in cold weather and reduce cement content of the mix. A
   field trial showed that cementitious materials were better than
   conventional Type 1 granular subbase, both in terms of having less

Abstract = {{To understand better the relative contributions of transcriptional and
   post-transcriptional processes towards the regulation of gene expression
   in plant mitochondria, we compared the steady state levels of RNAs with
   the respective transcriptional activities. All of the protein and rRNA
   coding genes of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial genome and several orfs
   were analyzed by run-on and northern experiments. rRNAs constitute the
   bulk of the steady state RNA in Arabidopsis mitochondria, but are
   (different from maize mitochondria) not equally prominent among the
   run-on transcripts. Their relatively low rate of active transcription is
   apparently compensated by their high stability. Run-on transcription
   values differ significantly between genes coding for different subunits
   of the same protein complex. The steady state RNA levels are
   considerably more homogeneous, indicating that high variations of
   transcription rates are counterbalanced by post-transcriptional
   processes. The relative amounts of the steady state transcripts for the
   different subunits in a given protein complex reflect the relative
   stoichiometries of the protein subunits much more closely than the
   respective transcriptional activities. Posttranscriptional RNA
   processing and stability thus contribute significantly to the regulation
   of gene expression in Arabidopsis mitochondria.}},

Abstract = {{The valid measurement of the concentration of serotonin (5-HT) in blood
   plasma is important when using the platelet as a model for the
   serotonergic neuron. The assay is hampered by the release of 5-HT by
   (residual) platelets during the preparation for assay. We developed an
   isopycnic method that separates cells gently and completely from plasma
   by centrifuging a diluted Percoll density-gradient to which whole blood
   was added. In this study this: method was compared with the usual
   differential centrifugation method. The isopycnic method on average
   resulted in nine times lon er levels of plasma 5-HT. This difference was
   linearly related to the number of residual platelets in plasma after
   differential centrifuging. The proportion of intra-individual variation
   decreased three-fold. Therefore, the use of a Percoll density-gradient
   may lead to a more precise and more accurate estimate of the level of
   plasma 5-HT. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The performance evaluation of many modern communication and
   manufacturing systems has been made possible by modeling them as
   queueing networks. Due to the limitations of exact algorithms to analyze
   general queueing networks, researchers have been focusing on developing
   approximations. Most of the approximations are lower order
   approximations in the sense that only a few parameters of the
   interarrival and service time distributions are used. This could lead to
   large errors in many conditions. In this paper, higher order
   approximations are developed for the single server queue with splitting,
   merging and feedback phenomena, which can then be integrated along with
   parametric decomposition to develop higher order approximations for
   queueing networks. Not only are the higher order approximations more
   accurate, but they can also be used to estimate the higher moments of
   the performance measures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Data on two co-existing Daphnia species, D.cucullata (G.O.Sars) and
   D.hyalina (Leydig), from three neighboring and interconnected lakes in
   northern Poland, revealed an extremely confined range of population
   density fluctuations throughout summer in each of the two species in
   each of the three lakes, with D.cucullata being an order of magnitude
   more abundant than D.hyalina (mean of 11.5 ind. l(-1) for D.cucullata
   and 1.1 ind. l(-1) for D.hyalina with 95\% confidence limits of +/-2.5
   and +/-0.5 ind. l(-1), respectively), in spite of markedly changing
   fecundity. There was no apparent phase of decline or increase that could
   br related to the distinct phases of low or high fecundity resulting
   from different food levels. Analysis of the gut contents of roach
   (Rutilus rutilus), the dominant planktivore in the three lakes, revealed
   identical selectivity for each of the two Daphnia species, suggesting
   that the lower density of the D.hyalina population was compensated for
   by the greater conspicuousness of individuals of this species. It is
   concluded that the population density of these Daphnia species remains
   far below the carrying capacity of the habitat and does not depend on
   food levels. Food availability merely sets the rate of population
   increase, while the actual population density in the lakes studied
   reflects the species' vulnerability to predation by planktivorous fish.}},

Abstract = {{The Mesozoic and Cenozoic positions of the continents that formed Pangea
   in the Triassic-Jurassic were derived from paleomagnetic and intraplate
   volcanic data, paleoclimatic observations, such as reef and fossil flora
   distribution, and geological observations. Major hot spots helped to
   determine the longitudinal position of Pangea and to construct a model
   of plate motion during the Pangean break-up. The position of the
   northern part of Pangea was constrained using Iceland and Jan Mayen hot
   spots. The Iceland hot spot was traced from its present day position to
   Greenland in the Paleocene, to Baffin Bay in the Late Cretaceous, to the
   Alpha Ridge in the Early Cretaceous, to the Chukchi Borderland in the
   Middle-Late Jurassic, to Franz Joseph Land in the Early Jurassic, the
   Yenisei-Khatanga Trough in the Middle Triassic, and finally to West
   Siberia in the Late Permian-Early Triassic. The hot spot activity is
   expressed by Eastern and Western Greenland volcanics, the Siberian trap
   basalts, and perhaps by Alpha Ridge and Chukchi Borderland volcanics.
   The Chukchi Borderland volcanics are related to the early stage of the
   opening of the Canadian Basin. The position of the southern part of
   Pangea was constrained using the Bouvet hot spot. This hot spot was
   tracked from its present day position to Western Antarctica in the Early
   Cretaceous-Late Jurassic and to South Africa in the Early Jurassic-Late
   Triassic. This hot spot activity produced the Ferrar and Karoo
   volcanics. The model of plate motion obtained agrees with other data on
   intraplate volcanics, which are also related to hot spots. At the time
   of the opening of the Central Atlantic, the Cape Verde and canary Island
   hot spots were located along the ocean's spreading axis. The long
   lasting location of hot spot and associated mantle upwelling plumes
   could help to explain forces driving the Tethys transit plates, opening
   of the Ligurian Ocean and Eastern Mediterranean. The European hot spots
   are related to the several Mesozoic phases of rifting. For example, the
   Rhine Graben hot spot may have been located at the rifting axis in the
   North Sea. Several authors have already discussed the contribution of
   hot spots to the opening of the South Atlantic and Indian oceans. Mantle
   plumes associated with hot spots play an active role in rifting and
   initial phases of spreading. The lithospheric displacement, caused by
   upwelling combined with sometimes remote collisional forces on the other
   side of continental plate, may result in compression and basin
   inversion. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed both the cytotoxicity and the type of cell death produced by
   the novel binuclear Pt(III) compound Pt-Spym
   ({[}Pt-2(2-mercaptopyrimidine)(4)Cl-2]) in kidney human fibroblasts and
   in human tumor cell lines (HeLa, CH1, CH1cisR and HL-60). The data
   showed that Pt-Spym displayed higher cytotoxicity against these tumor
   cells than cisplatin. In contrast, Pt-Spym had low toxicity against
   normal human fibroblasts. Interestingly, Pt-Spym circumvented cisplatin
   resistance in CH1cisR cells. We also observed that Pt-Spym induced the
   characteristic changes attributed to apoptosis in cells with normal
   levels of p53 protein (CH1 and CH1cisR) and with low levels of p53
   protein (HeLa), but not in cells lacking p53 (HL-60). Interestingly,
   Western blot data indicated that apoptosis induction by Pt-Spym in HeLa,
   CH1, and CH1cisR cells was not associated with drastic changes in p53
   levels. However, cis-DDP strongly decreased p53 levels in CH1 and
   CH1cisR cells and abolish p53 protein in HeLa cells. Altogether, these
   results suggest that induction of apoptosis by Pt-Spym requires the
   presence of p53 protein. BIOCHEM PHARMACOL 60;3:371-379, 2000. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{We study the linear conductance of single electron devices showing

   treated in terms of the Caldeira-Leggett model. We obtain the linear
   conductance from the Kubo formula leading to a formally exact expression
   which is evaluated in the semiclassical limit. Specifically me consider
   three models. First, the influence of an electromagnetic environment of
   arbitrary impedance on a single tunnel junction is studied focusing on
   the limits of large tunneling conductance and high to moderately low
   temperatures. The predictions are compared with recent experimental
   data. Second, the conductance of an array of N tunnel junctions is
   determined in dependence on the length N of the array and the
   environmental impedance. Finally, we consider a single electron
   transistor and compare our results for large tunneling conductance with
   experimental findings.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{106}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Transforming growth factor-betas (TGF-beta) have been demonstrated to be
   upregulated during osteoblast function in vitro and during cranial
   suture fusion in vivo. The authors hypothesized that spontaneous
   reossification of calvarial defects was also associated with
   upregulation of TGF-beta. The present study was designed to (1) evaluate
   the concept of a critical-size defect within the calvaria in an adult
   guinea pig model and (2) investigate the association between the
   reossification of calvarial defects and TGF-beta upregulation. Paired
   circular parietal defects with diameters of 3 and 5 mm and single
   parietal defects with diameters of 8 or 12 mm were made in 45
   six-month-old skeletally mature guinea pigs. Three animals per defect
   size were killed after survival periods of 3 days, 1 week, 4 weeks, 8
   weeks, or 12 weeks. New bone ingrowth was evaluated by assessing for
   linear closure by a traditional linear method and by a modified
   cross-sectional area method using an image analysis system in which the
   thickness of new bone was taken into account. Immunohistochemistry was
   performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies to localize TGF-beta 1,
   -beta 2. and -beta 3. All specimens were photographed, and the intensity
   of immunostaining was graded based on subjective photographic assessment
   by three independent reviewers. No defect demonstrated any measurable
   bone replacement after a survival period of 3 days. All 3- and 5-mm
   defects were completely reossified after 12 weeks based on the linear
   analysis of ne iv bone, indicating these defects to be less than
   critical size. However er, new bone formation in the 5-mm defects never
   exceeded a mean of 40 percent by cross-sectional area of new bone.
   Percent of new bone formation by cross-sectional area was significantly
   higher within 3-mm defects than in all larger defects 4 weeks after the
   craniotomy, reaching a mean of 89 percent new bone by 12 weeks.
   Persistent gaps were noted on linear analysis of the 8- and 12-mm wounds
   by 12 weeks. and mean percent new bone by cross-sectional area remained
   below 30 percent. Immunolocalization demonstrated osteogenic fronts at
   the advancing bone edge and the endocranial side, in which the
   osteoblasts stained strongly for ail isoforms of TGF-beta. The intensity
   of osteoblast expression waned considerably af-ter the majority of the
   defect had reossified. These data indicate that histometric analysis
   based on cross-sectional area more accurately reflects the osteogenic
   potential of a cranial defect than does linear inspection of defect
   closure. Although the interpretation of immunolocalization studies is
   highly subjective, independent assessment by three reviewers indicates
   that isoforms of TGF-beta were upregulated during a limited ``window{''}
   of time corresponding to the period of active calvarial reossification,
   and expression of TGF-beta corresponded to osteoblast activity within
   osteogenic fronts.}},

Title = {{Late diagnosis of Morquio Syndrome - Clinical and histopathological
   findings in a rare mucopolysacchardidosis}},
Journal = {{KLINISCHE MONATSBLATTER FUR AUGENHEILKUNDE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{217}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Morquio syndrome is a rare autosomal-recessive
   mucopolysaccharidosis. The Morquio syndrome is characterized by a
   reduced activity of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate-sulfatase (type A),
   or beta-galactosidase (type B). This deficiency leads to a lysosomal
   storage disease with accumulation of keratan sulfate und
   chondroitin-6-sulfate in connective tissue, skeletal system und teeth.
   Consequently, abnormalities of the skeletal system, aortic valvular
   disease and dental abnormalities occur. Ophthalmologically, diffuse
   corneal opacification and alterations of the trabecular meshwork -
   occasionally leading to glaucoma - can be found.
   Case Report: A 44-year-old woman asked for perforating corneal
   transplantation because of corneal clouding on both eyes. Besides, she
   suffered from dwarfism of unclear reason. The diffuse corneal clouding
   and the dwarfism suggested a systemic-metabolic disease. Thus, further
   radiologic and medical investigation was started.
   Results: Radiologically, a kyphoscoliosis, a pectus carinatum, a
   luxation of both hips, and a gonarthrosis were recognized. Fibroblast
   culture of a skin biopsy showed reduced activity of
   N-acetyl-galactosamine-6-sulfate-sulfatase. This was the proof of
   Morquio syndrome type A. The explanted corneal button showed granules of
   acid mucopolysaccharides. Those were in the epithelial and endothelial
   cells and in the corneal stroma.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, a Morquio syndrome has never been
   diagnosed with an adult and only after the ophthalmologist gave a hint.
   This can only be explained by the comparative mild expression of the
   disease in this patient. Diagnosis of Morquio syndrome is important
   because the frequent odontoid hypoplasia can lead to a deadly
   atlanto-axial instability, if not treated.}},

   fishes: New insights based on the morphology of Allothunnus fallai}},
Journal = {{ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{129}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Two significant functional differences-a more anterior and internally
   positioned red myotomal muscle mass and modification of the red-muscle
   vascular supply to form countercurrent heat exchangers-distinguish the
   tunas (tribe Thunnini) from other species in the teleost family
   Scombridae. Neither of these characteristics is found in the bonitos
   (tribe Sardini), the sister group to the Thunnini. The most recent
   scombrid classification places the slender tuna, Allothunnus fallai, in
   the tribe Sardini, but some earlier studies suggested that this species
   should be a member of the Thunnini. Allothunnus fallai does not possess
   the lateral subcutaneous arteries and veins or the lateral
   heat-exchanging retia typical of tunas. However, we have found that this
   species has a highly modified central circulation (dorsal aorta, post
   cardinal vein, and associated branch vessels) similar to the central
   heat-exchanging retia of certain tunas, an enlarged haemal arch to
   accommodate this structure, and the anterior, internal placement of red
   muscle characteristic of tunas. With these new characters, phylogenetic
   reconstructions based on parsimony place A. fallai as the sister taxon
   to the tunas, establish that it is the most basal tuna species, and
   support the hypothesis that the derivation of tunas from a bonito-like
   ancestor occurred through selection for an integrated set of
   characteristics affecting locomotion and endothermy. The major features
   of this hypothesis are as follows. (1) Selection for continuous, steady,
   and efficient swimming resulted in changes in body shape (the result of
   enlargement of the anterior myotomes, the anterior and internal shift of
   red muscle, and a narrowing of the caudal peduncle) which increased
   streamlining and led to the adoption of the thunniform swimming mode
   unique to the tunas. (2) Alterations in blood supply necessitated by the
   anterior shift in red muscle led to the interdigitation of numerous
   arterial and venous branches which set the stage for heat conservation.
   (3) The evolution of endothermy, together with thunniform swimming,
   contributed significantly to the ecological radiation and
   diversification of tunas during the Early Tertiary Period. Our studies
   of A. fallai thus suggest that the shift in red muscle position and
   changes in central circulation preceded the evolution of red-muscle
   endothermy. Co-evolutionary changes in red muscle quantity and
   distribution and in vascular specializations for heat conservation have
   led to different macroevolutionary trajectories among the now five
   genera and 14 tuna species of tunas and appear to reflect the influence
   of changing paleocological and paleoceanographic conditions, including
   cooling, that occurred in the Tertiary. (C) 2000 The Linnean Society of

Abstract = {{As the inner end-member of the planetary system, Mercury plays an
   important role in constraining and testing dynamical and compositional
   theories of planetary formation. With its companions Venus, Earth and
   Mars, it forms the family of terrestrial planets, a category of
   celestial object where each member holds information essential for
   retracing the history of the whole group. For example, knowledge about
   the origin and evolution of these planets is one of the keys to
   understanding how conditions to support life have been met in the Solar
   System and, possibly, elsewhere. This quest is all the more important as
   terrestrial-like objects orbiting other stars are not accessible; our
   own environment remains the only laboratory where we can test models
   that are also applicable to other planetary systems. The exploration of
   Mercury is therefore of fundamental importance for answering questions
   of astrophysical and philosophical significance, such as: `Are
   terrestrial bodies a common feature of most planetary systems in the
   Galaxy?'.}},

Abstract = {{Cine MRI of the heart using segmented ii-space pulse sequences permits
   multiphase images to be acquired in a single breath-hold. Whilst image
   quality is improved compared with conventional (non-segmented) cine
   imaging, subsequent analysis can be relatively time consuming. In this
   study, multiple slice breath-hold cine imaging of the heart was
   performed in 11 normal volunteers. Left and right ventricular stroke
   volume (SV) was estimated from the images by application of the
   Cavalieri method of modern design stereology in combination with point
   counting. The measured SVs were compared with those obtained by cine
   phase contrast velocity mapping in the ascending aorta and main
   pulmonary artery. Excellent agreement was found between the SVs
   determined by the two techniques, with mean differences (+/- one SD) of
   0.41 +/- 3.00 ml and 0.41 +/- 4.78 ml for left and right ventricles,
   respectively. Comparison of left and right ventricular SV using
   stereology yielded a mean difference of 0.84 +/- 5.70 ml. Breath-hold
   data acquisition together with stereological analysis is demonstrated to
   be an accurate and unbiased technique for the rapid assessment of
   cardiac function.}},

   onions were direct-seeded. Barley rows were planted either parallel with
   or perpendicular to the onion ro,vs. Barley was killed with fluazifop-P
   herbicide when approximate to 13, 18, 23, or 30 cm tall. Onion size and

Abstract = {{Using an in vivo model of tumor/self peptide presentation for induction
   of class I-restricted skin test reactivity, we have previously shown
   that a minority population of CD8(+) dendritic cells (DC) negatively
   regulates the induction of T cell reactivity by peptide-loaded CD8(-) DC
   in DBA/2 mice. However, the CD8(-) fraction can be primed by IL-12 to
   overcome inhibition by the CD8(+) subset when the two types of DC are
   cotransferred into recipient hosts. We report here that exposure of
   CD8(+) DC to IFN-gamma greatly enhances their inhibitory activity on Ag
   presentation by the other subset, blocking the ability of IL-12-treated
   CD8(-) DC to overcome suppression. In contrast, IFN-gamma has no direct
   effects on the APC function of the latter cells and does not interfere
   with IL-12 signaling. The negative regulatory effect triggered by
   IFN-gamma in CD8(+) DC appears to involve interference with tryptophan
   metabolism in vivo. Through tryptophan depletion affecting T cell
   responses, IFN-gamma acting on CD8(+) DC may thus contribute to
   regulation of immunity to tumor/self peptides presented by the CD8(-)
   subset.}},

Abstract = {{The synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) is crucially
   involved in exocytosis in neurons. The aim of this study was to
   investigate whether if is present in the ovary. We found SNAP-25 to be
   expressed in nonneuronal cells of the rat and human ovary, namely in all
   oocytes and in steroidogenic cells, including granulosa cells (GC) of
   large antral follicles and luteal cells. Both isoforms, SNAP-25a and b,
   were found in the ovary. Oocytes obtained by laser capture
   microdissection were shown to express SNAP-25b, whereas SNAP-25a was
   found in rat GC and human luteinized GC. Immunohistochemical
   observations of strong SNAP-25 staining in GC of large growing antral
   follicles compared with absent or weak staining in small follicles
   suggested a role in folliculogenesis. To study a presumed regulation of
   SNAP-25, we used a rat GC line (GFSHR-17), which expresses FSH
   receptors, and luteinizing human GC, which express LH receptors. FSH
   elevated SNAP-25 mRNA and protein levels about fivefold within 24 h in
   GFSHR-17 cells. The cAMP analogue dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP) mimicked this
   action of FSH. The effects of both db-cAMP and FSH were inhibited by the
   protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89. In contrast, SNAP-25 protein and
   mRNA-levels were not altered by LH/hCG in luteinized human GC. Our
   results for the first time identify SNAP-25b in oocytes and SNAP-25a in
   steroidogenic cells of the mammalian ovary. SNAP-25a and b may be
   involved in different exocytotic processes in these cell types.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the sharp resistance change near the metal-insulator transition
   (M-I) of the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) materials, we design and
   test a new type CMR bolometer. Lao(0.67)Ca(0.33)MnO(3) epitaxial thin
   films were used as the photosensitive element of the bolometer, and the
   optical response of this device to the He-Ne laser and the blackbody
   were measured. The measured signal and noise decrease with increasing
   modulation frequency; however, the signal-to-noise ratio shows no
   obvious change for the He-Ne laser. The temperature dependence of signal
   was measured in both ferromagnetic metallic and paramagnetic insulating
   states. wt shows that the strongest signal appears in the ferromagnetic
   state very close to the M-I point. The film's Curie temperature can span
   from 70 to 350 K, depending on the manufacture conditions. So, working
   near or at room temperature characterizes this CMR thin film bolometer.
   In this sense, it compensates the weakness of the high-temperature
   superconductor bolometer that can be used only around the liquid
   Nitrogen (LN) temperature.
   The measured detectivity is about 10(7) cmHz(1/2)/W and the thermal
   response constant is 20ms for this device. Compared with the
   high-temperature superconductor bolometer, the time constant of CMR
   bolometer is longer and the detectivity is lower. However, there is much
   room to improve yet.}},

   housing, with profound historical and economic changes. The effects of
   the earthquakes are influenced by population density, the verticalism of
   the buildings - from the thirteenth century - and the building
   techniques. The latter have always been highly diversified, not only in
   the various historical periods, but also within the same time-span, on
   the same territory, because of the strong geographic differences which
   characterise the Italian area (coasts, mountains, plains, etc.). This
   contribution provides a synthetic assessment of these variables in
   relation to the seismic effects described in the historical sources. The

   were tested with the same time courses. At pretreatment, plasma
   osteocalcin was significantly higher (p < 0.05) at 0100 than at 0900 and
   1700. At necropsy, measures for DEX groups were calculated as Z-scores
   using values from the placebo groups. The low evening DEX dose led to a
   significantly lower reduction in plasma osteocalcin compared with the
   tapered and constant dosing regimens (p < 0.05). The significant weight
   reduction in the DEX group occurred at d 3 in the low evening dose
   regimen but at d 7 in the constant dosing regimen, compared with the
   placebo group. Bone mineral content Z-score was reduced similarly in all
   DEX-treated groups across the three dosing regimens. We conclude that a
   plasma osteocalcin zenith at night exists in early life. A high DEX dose
   in the morning and low DEX dose in the evening may partially attenuate
   corticosteroid-induced suppression of bone formation and growth
   restriction.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge Management (KM) is an emerging methodology that harnesses an
   organization's largely untapped resource, knowledge, not only to sustain
   competitive advantage but also to become innovative. Since knowledge is
   a crucial resource, it should be managed judiciously. KM helps
   integrate, manage, store, retrieve, and disseminate an organizations
   information and intellectual assets to improve business performance. To
   be successful, KM requires a major shift in organizational culture and
   commitment. The primary focus of this research is to see how the
   grounded theory approach can be applied to studying the knowledge
   management practices in organizations. Our ultimate goal is to develop
   an empirically testable model that informs organizations on how to
   successfully implement KM by clearly outlining the current practice of
   KM and their relationship to organizational purposes, implementation,
   success factors and metrics, ``failure factors,{''} organizational
   impacts, and requisite organizational cultures and technology.}},

Title = {{Reduced dorsal and orbital prefrontal gray matter volumes in

Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{57}},

Abstract = {{Background: Converging neuroanatomic, neurophysiological, and
   neurobehavioral evidence implicate prefrontal subregions in
   schizophrenia. Neuroanatomic studies with magnetic resonance (MR)
   imaging enable regional volume parcellation. Inconsistent reports may
   relate to variable methods and small samples. We attempted to resolve
   volume differences within sectors of the prefrontal lobe in a large
   sample, relating volumes to clinical and neurocognitive features.
   Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 70 patients with
   schizophrenia (40 men and 30 women; 29 neuroleptic naive and 41
   previously treated) and 81 healthy controls (34 men and 47 women). Gray
   and white matter volumes of the dorsolateral, dorsomedial,
   orbitolateral, and orbitomedial prefrontal cortex were quantified.
   Symptoms, functioning, and neurocognition were assessed concurrently.
   Results: Reduced prefrontal gray matter volume was ob-served in
   patients. The reduction was evident for the dorsolateral al area in men
   (9\%) and women (11\%), for the dorsomedial area only in men (9\%), and
   for orbital regions only in women (23\% and 10\% for lateral and medial,
   respectively). The reduction of orbital volume in women was associated
   with poorer premorbid functioning, more severe negative symptoms, and
   depression. Volume of dorsal cortex was positively associated with
   better performance on abstraction and attention tasks across all groups.
   Conclusions: Schizophrenia is associated with reduced gray matter volume
   in prefrontal cortex, which affects men and women in the dorsolateral
   sector. The effects are moderated by sex for dorsomedial and orbital
   regions and are related to symptom severity and cognitive function. This
   is not a by-product of treatment, since the differences are evident in
   neuroleptic-naive patients.}},

Abstract = {{The critical role of the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) gene as a tumour
   suppressor has been clearly demonstrated for malignancies arising in NF1
   patients. However, little is known about the more common benign tumours,
   such as the pilocytic astrocytoma. Most NF1-associated astrocytomas are
   benign and clinically non-progressive, though aggressive tumours are
   occasionally encountered. In this study, eight pilocytic astrocytomas
   from six individuals affected with NF1 were analysed for NF1 expression.
   All eight tumours demonstrated loss of neurofibromin expression by
   immunohistochemistry, which was confirmed in one case using Western blot
   analysis. Microsatellite analysis showed loss of a single NF1 allele
   (LOH) in two of four NF1-associated tumours. These results demonstrate
   that, in contrast to sporadic astrocytomas, loss of NF1 expression is an
   important primary genetic event in the pathogenesis of NF1-associated
   pilocytic astrocytomas.}},

Abstract = {{We have shown previously that T cells, tagged with biotinylated anti-CD3
   antibody fragments, can exert avidin-dependent cytolytic activity on
   suitably biotinylated tumor cells in vitro. In this study, we
   demonstrate that avidin-driven CTL-tumor bridging in vivo leads to
   growth inhibition of murine tumors WEHI-164 fibrosarcoma and RMA
   Lymphoma. The biodistribution of biotin-tagged In-111-labeled T cells
   demonstrated a selective avidin-dependent and time-dependent
   accumulation of radioactivity at tumor sites, The specificity of
   lymphocyte tumor localization was demonstrated by the concurrent
   time-dependent decrease of radioactivity in the blood and in all other
   organs, Furthermore, we documented a therapeutic effect of the
   adoptively transferred T cells, i.e., a significant delay of tumor
   growth at early stages. All of the experiments included a control group
   of mice, which received all of the reagents, except avidin. These
   avidin-minus mice showed no specific localization and no delay in tumor
   growth, indicating that avidin bridging was essential for T-cell
   activity at tumor sites.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to determine whether there is an association
   between the removal of the corrugator supercilii muscle and the
   elimination or significant improvement of migraine headaches.
   Questionnaires were sent to 314 consecutive patients who had undergone
   corrugator supercilii muscle resection during endoscopic,
   transpalpebral, or open forehead rejuvenation procedures. The patients
   were queried as to whether they had a history of migraine headaches and,
   if so, whether the headaches significantly improved or disappeared after
   surgery. If the answer was affirmative, then the patients were further
   questioned about the duration of the improvement or cessation of the
   headaches and the relationship to the timing of the surgery. After an
   initial evaluation of the completed questionnaires, a telephone
   interview was conducted to confirm the initial answers and to obtain
   further information necessary to ensure that the patients had a proper
   diagnosis based on the International Headache Society criteria for
   migraine headaches. The charts of the patients who had migraine
   headaches were studied to ascertain and classify the type of surgery
   they had undergone. Patient demographics were reviewed, and the results
   were statistically analyzed.
   Of the 314 patients, 265 (84.4 pet-cent) either responded to the
   questionnaire, were interviewed, or both responded to the questionnaire
   and were interviewed. Of this group, 16 patients were excluded because
   of the provision of insufficient information to meet the International
   Headache Society criteria, the presence of organic problems, and other
   exclusions mandated by study design. Thirty-nine (15.7 percent) of the
   remaining 249 patients had migraine headaches that fulfilled the Society
   criteria. Thirty-one of the 39 (79.5 percent) with preoperative migraine
   noted elimination or improvement in migraine headaches immediately after
   surgery (p < 0.0001; McNemar), and the benefits lasted over a mean
   follow-up period of 47 months. When the respondents with a positive
   history of migraine headaches were further divided, 16 patients (p <
   0.0001; McNemar) noticed improvement over a mean follow-up period of 47
   months, and 15 (p < 0.0001; McNemar) experienced total elimination of
   their migraine headaches over a mean follow-up period of 46.5 months.
   When divided by migraine headache type, 29 patients (74 percent) had
   nonaura migraine headaches. Of these patients, the headaches disappeared
   in 11 patients, improved in 13 patients, and did not change in five
   patients (p < 0.0001). Ten patients experienced aura-type headaches,
   which disappeared or improved in seven of the patients and did not
   change in three of the patients (p < 0.0001). This study proves for the
   first time that there is indeed a strong correlation between the removal
   of the corrugator supercilii muscle and the elimination or significant
   improvement of migraine headaches.}},

   Borrelia burgdorferi was a protective immunogen in the murine model of
   Lyme borreliosis when mice were challenged (needle inoculated)

   study, DbpA-immunized C3H/HeJ mice were not protected from infection

   detect DbpA on B. burgdorferi in ticks, suggesting that DbpA is not
   available as a target for bactericidal antibodies in serum when B.
   burgdorferi-infected ticks take their blood meal from an immunized host.
   The failure of DbpA immunization to protect tick-challenged mice
   contradicts the results of earlier needle inoculation vaccination
   experiments and suggests that DbpA may not be suitable as a Lyme disease
   vaccine.}},

Abstract = {{Background Only limited information is available on students' concerns

   Sample and design A total of 16 concerns regarding communicating with
   patients were rated by 179 third-year medical students, before the
   students had any contact with patients and before communication skills
   teaching had begun. At the end of the term, the ratings were collected
   again from 139 of the students. The concerns were derived from the list
   by Cohen-Cole and from a previous pilot study.
   Results All concerns diminished significantly by the end of the term,
   but their order remained similar. At both time points, concerns about
   dealing with patients who are in pain or show strong negative emotions
   received the highest ratings.
   Conclusion Communication skills courses need to focus on helping
   students to cope with distressed patients.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to compare the allergy-preventive effect of a
   partially hydrolyzed formula with two extensively hydrolyzed formulas,
   in infants with a high risk for development of allergic disease.
   High-risk infants from four Danish centres were included in the period
   from June 1994 to July 1995. Five-hundred and ninety-five high-risk
   infants were identified. Nigh-risk infants were defined as having
   biparental atopy, or a single atopic first-degree relative combined with
   cord blood immunoglobulin E (IgE) greater than or equal to 0.3 kU/l, At
   birth all infants were randomized to one of three different blinded
   formulas. All mothers had unrestricted diets during pregnancy and
   lactation and were encouraged to breast-feed exclusively. If
   breastfeeding was insufficient, one of the three formulas, according to
   randomization, was given during the first 4 months. It was recommended
   not to introduce cow's milk, cow's milk products, and solid foods until
   the age of 4 months. After the age of 4 months a normal unrestricted
   diet and conventional cow's milk-based formula were given when needed.
   All infants were followed-up prospectively with interview and physical
   examination at the age of 6, 12, and 18 months, and if any possible
   atopic symptoms were reported. If food allergy was suspected, controlled
   elimination/challenge procedures were performed in a hospital setting.
   Of 550 infants included in the study, 514 were seen at all visits and 36
   were excluded owing to noncompliance. Of 478 infants who completed the
   study, 232 were exclusively breast-fed, 79 received an extensively
   hydrolyzed casein formula (Nutramigen), 82 an extensively hydrolyzed
   whey formula (Profylac), and 85 a partially hydrolyzed whey formula (Nan
   WA), during the first 4 months of life. These four groups were identical
   in regard to atopic predisposition, cord blood IgE, birthplace, and
   gender. Exclusively breastfed children were exposed less to tobacco
   smoke and pets at home and belonged to higher social classes, whereas
   the three formula groups were identical concerning environmental
   factors. The frequency of breast-feeding was high; only eight (2\%)
   children were not breast-fed at all. The three formula groups were
   identical in regard to duration of breast-feeding: and age at
   introduction of formula and solid foods. No significant differences were
   found in the three groups of infants receiving formula milk regarding
   the cumulative incidence of atopic dermatitis or respiratory symptoms.
   The cumulative incidence of parental-reported cow's milk allergy was
   significantly higher in children fed partially hydrolyzed formula (Nan
   HA) compared with extensively hydrolyzed formula (Nutramigen or
   Profylac) at 12 and 18 months (NanHA, 7.1\%; Nutramigen, 2.5\%;
   Profylac, 0\%; p = 0.033). The cumulative incidence of confirmed cow's
   milk allergy was 1.3\% (three of 232) in exclusively breast-fed infants,
   0.6\% tone of 161) in infants fed extensively hydrolyzed formula
   (Nutramigen or Profylac), and 4.7\% (four of 85) in infants fed
   partially hydrolyzed formula (Nan HA). Partially hydrolyzed formula was
   found to be less effective than extensively hydrolyzed formula in
   preventing cow's milk allergy, 0.6\% vs. 4.7\% (p = 0.05), but because
   of the small number of cases the results should be interpreted with
   caution. Compared with other similar studies the frequency of atopic
   symptoms was low, even though the dietetic intervention did not include
   either maternal diet during lactation or dietary restrictions to the
   children after the age of 3 months.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the mechanism of resistance to demethylation inhibitors
   (DMI) in Penicillium digitatum by isolating the CYP51 gene, which
   encodes the target enzyme (P450(14DM)) of DMI, from three DMI-resistant
   and three DMI-sensitive strains. The structural genes of all six strains
   were identical, but in the promoter region, a unique 126-bp sequence was
   tandemly repeated five times in the DMI-resistant strains and was
   present only once in the DMI-sensitive strains. Constitutive expression
   of CYP51 in the resistant strains was about 100-fold higher than that in
   the sensitive strains. We introduced CYP51, including the promoter
   region, from a DMI-resistant strain into a DMI-sensitive strain, which
   rendered the: transformants DMI resistant and increased CYP51
   expression. We also found that if the number of copies of the repeat was
   reduced to two, resistance and CYP51 expression also decreased, These
   results indicate that the 126-bp unit acts as a transcriptional enhancer
   and that a tandem repeat of the unit enhances CYP51 expression,
   resulting in DR;II resistance. This is a new fungicide resistance
   mechanism for filamentous fungi.}},

Abstract = {{Dairy cows are in Denmark either kept in tie-stalls or in loose housing

   important for dairy farmers who want to adopt a new housing system. The
   aim of the present investigation was to estimate the labour requirement
   for the various tasks involved in milk production in different housing
   systems. The estimation was done by use of models, which were based on
   detailed work studies carried out among 13 practical stockbreeders. The
   efficiency of the different housing systems depended on the size of
   herd. For herd sizes over 100 cows, the total labour requirement was
   between 27 and 31\% lower in loose housing systems than in tie-stall
   housing systems. However, when the herd sizes were reduced to fewer than
   70 dairy cows, the savings obtained on the tasks feeding and cleaning in
   loose housing systems were counterbalanced by a higher labour

   mark slope facies at the margins of structural uplifts. Two other
   genetic groups most likely originated from marine Middle-Upper
   Ordovician source rocks, but of distinct facies, with one an oxic
   shale-rich source west of the Bachu uplift and the other an anoxic shale
   source at Tazhong.
   Other genetic oil groups originated from various nonmarine source rocks.
   The largest of these groups consists of oils from the Luntai uplift,
   which best correlate with Jurassic lacustrine mudstones in the Kuqa
   depression, although Triassic lacustrine mudstones cannot be eliminated
   as a source for these oils. Two oils from southwest Tarim are highly
   mature. Despite uncertainty due to low biomarker concentrations, these
   oils probably originated from nonmarine shaly source rocks. The two
   remaining genetic groups consist of single oil samples: Yi603 (an oil
   likely derived from coal in the Kuqa depression) and Qu1 (derived from
   Carboniferous or Jurassic shaly source rock from the west flank of the
   Bachu uplift). Sample 63KLT (a seep sample from west of Kashi) has
   attributes of a lacustrine source rock and clusters with oils from
   Luntai. These results suggest that numerous source rocks occur in the
   basin, but they likely are areally restricted. Our results do not
   support previous published work that suggests that hypothesized euxinic
   source rocks might account for reserves of up to 350 billion bbl of oil.}},

Title = {{No diabetes-associated mutations in the coding region of the hepatocyte

Abstract = {{Aims/hypothesis. Mutations in the transcription factor hepatocyte
   nuclear factor (HNF)-4 alpha are the cause of one form of maturity-onset
   diabetes of the young, MODY1. The HNF-4 gamma is structurally related to
   HNF-4 alpha and is expressed together with HNF-4 alpha in pancreatic
   islets. We therefore tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in the
   HNF-4 gamma gene (HNF4G) is associated with MODY in Japanese subjects.
   Methods. We screened the protein coding region of HNF4G (exons 3-11) for
   mutations in 57 unrelated Japanese subjects with MODY by amplifying each
   exon and adjacent intron region using the polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) and specific primers and then directly sequencing the PCR
   products. The frequency of each variant was compared between patients
   with MODY and a group of non-diabetic subjects. Results. Wie found ten
   sequence variants, two of these were located in exons: exon 6, a silent
   substitution in codon 144, c.432A/G and exon 7, a G-to-A substitution in
   codon 190 (c.570G/A) resulting in a conservative Met-to-Ile substitution
   (M/I190) in the putative ligand-binding region of HNF-4 gamma protein.
   The remaining eight variants were located in introns. There was no
   significant difference in the frequency of these polymorphisms between
   subjects with MODY and non-diabetic control subjects.
   Conclusion/interpretation. Genetic variation in the coding region of
   HNF4G is unlikely to be a major cause of MODY in Japanese people.}},

Abstract = {{Soluble Fas (sFas) blocks apoptosis induced by Fas ligand in vitro. The
   serum concentration of sFas is elevated in lympho-proliferative
   diseases. We hypothesized that higher levels of sFas worsen the clinical
   symptoms and outcome of patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
   (NHL), We prospectively measured the serum concentrations of sFas in 67
   consecutive patients with aggressive NHL (59 with diffuse large cell
   lymphoma and 8 with diffuse small cleaved cell lymphoma). sFas was
   significantly elevated in patients with aggressive NHL compared to
   healthy controls (N = 36, P< 0.005), while sFas in patients with B
   symptoms (4.20 +/- 2.12 mu g/l) was significantly higher than in those
   without B symptoms (2.66 +/- 1.08 mu g/l, P < 0.005), No significant
   difference was observed between B-cell lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma or
   between patients with clinical stage I or II and those with clinical
   stage III or IV. Significant correlations were found between sFas
   concentration and both soluble interleukin-2 receptor (R = 0.400, P<
   0.001) and C-reactive protein (R = 0.340, P < 0.01) levels in patients
   with aggressive NHL. No correlation was observed between sFas and either
   white blood cell count or lactate dehydrogenase, Generalized Wilcoxon
   analysis revealed that NHL patients with sFas less than 4 mu g/l had
   better overall survival than those with sFas above 4 mu g/l (P < 0.001).
   The serum concentration of sFas might be associated with clinical
   symptoms and the prognosis of patients with aggressive NHL. Am. J.

Abstract = {{The demulsification of oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions under freezing
   conditions is connected to fat crystallization in the oil droplet.
   Therefore, demulsification can be prevented by the use of oil with a low
   melting point, and also by lowering the O/W ratio. However, an oil with
   a low melting point, such as sunflower, is rather expensive, and the O/W
   ratio has a significant effect on the texture of emulsions. We searched
   for an oil that is suitable for the production of a freeze-stable
   emulsion ansi found that soybean oil has unique characteristics.
   Normally, emulsions are more unstable at lower temperatures; soybean oil
   emulsion is unstable at -10 degrees C and stable at -20 degrees C. This
   unique characteristic results from the following two reasons. First, the
   solid fat content of soybean oil is almost the same at -10 and -20
   degrees C Second, small crystals form a larger network over a period of
   time, and the higher temperature promotes faster restructuring. This
   structure formation was microscopically observed with the use of a
   thermostated stage. Structure formation was suppressed with the addition
   of a crystal structure modifier, polyglycerol fatty acid full ester,
   which also suppressed coalescence.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of testosterone treatment and gonadectomy on myosin heavy
   chain (MHC) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression after 1 week's
   immobilization were studied in male rat gastrocnemius muscle. In the
   testosterone-treated group silastic testosterone capsules were implanted
   subcutaneously before immobilization. The gonadectomized animals were
   castrated at 5 weeks of age. One group of eugonadal animals served as
   the immobilized control group, and another as the sedentary control
   group. Immobilization was performed at 9 weeks of age by bilateral
   hindlimb casting. The body and muscle masses, and the amount of type tla
   MHC mRNA decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in the immobilized animals
   by similar to 30, 40 and 50\%, respectively, regardless of the serum
   testosterone levels which ranged from 1.1 +/- 0.4 to 59 +/- 14 nmol L-1.
   In the immobilized testosterone-treated group the proportion of type IIx
   MHC mRNA increased to 14\% of the total MHC mRNA (P= 0.02, compared with
   control). The MHC protein distribution did not change significantly.
   There were no significant differences in any parameters between the
   three immobilized groups. In conclusion, neither the lack nor excess of
   testosterone significantly altered the changes caused by immobilization.
   Therefore, it seems that lack of mechanical loading is a far more
   important determinant of MHC expression than the male sex hormone
   status.}},

Abstract = {{The small, exclusively Australasian, anomalodesmatan family Myochamidae
   comprises only two genera; the shallow-burrowing Myadora and the
   cementing Myochama. This paper describes the anatomy and cementing
   behaviour of Myochama anomioides and draws comparisons with Myadora.
   The anatomy of Myochama anomioides is little different from that
   previously described for Myadora, except that they are mirror images.
   Valve inequality is not reflected in the organs of the mantle cavity in
   either taxon. Such differences which are present, for example the
   reduction of the foot in Myochama, mostly relate to the adoption of a
   sessile habit. There are few differences in mantle folds of the
   cementing and non-cementing genus, except that in,M. anomioides the
   right mantle fold, which secretes the cemented valve, is thicker and
   less well-developed than the left. During the cementation process, the
   periostracum secreted by the right fold is thinner and has a quilted
   appearance.
   Individuals of Myochama anomioides cement by their right valve once they
   have reached a size of 1.2-3.9 mm. They appear to have a preference for
   attaching to the posterior portions of a diversity of living, shallow
   infaunal bivalves. The pronounced stereotypic orientation they adopt
   suggests that these hosts are most often alive at the time of
   colonization and that the myochamids benefit from the relationship. The
   relationship, however, is not obligate. They are capable of attaching to
   other shelly or rock debris, but do so at a larger size, presumably when
   the pre ferred substrata are not available. The thin layer of
   extra-periostracal cement lacks the calcareous crystalline nature of
   oyster cement, instead being largely composed of organic material. This
   cement is presumably secreted by glands within the mantle, but these
   have not been identified. Indeed, the mantle lacks arenophilic glands
   which might have been thought a suitable candidate for supplying cement.}},

Abstract = {{Background: While aging clearly has protean biological effects on every
   organ system, the differential effects of aging in women and men in the
   retrobulbar vasculature, to our knowledge, have never been investigated.
   Because glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration are closely linked
   to advanced age, we performed a cross-sectional study using color
   Doppler imaging of 4 retrobulbar vessels in both healthy women and men.
   Objective: To define the influence of aging per se on ocular
   hemodynamics.
   Methods: Women (n=73) and men (n=55), aged from 20 to 90 years, free of
   ocular and systemic disease, and with normal intraocular pressure, were
   recruited for this study. Postmenopausal women who were not receiving
   estrogen replacement therapy were also recruited. Studies involved color
   Doppler imaging analysis of the ophthalmic, central retinal, and nasal
   and temporal posterior ciliary arteries. Ophthalmic arterial peak
   systolic and end-diastolic velocities and a Pourcelot resistance index
   were determined for each vessel.
   Results: In both sexes, ophthalmic arterial end-diastolic velocity
   decreased and the Pourcelot resistance index rose with advancing age
   teach P<.001); peak systolic velocity in the ophthalmic vessel was
   age-independent. In contrast, central retinal arterial Row velocities
   were unaffected by age in both sexes. In the posterior ciliary arteries,
   in men, flow velocities and the Pourcelot resistance index were
   independent of age. However, in women, end-diastolic velocity decreased
   with age in both the nasal and temporal posterior ciliary vessel teach
   P<.05); peak systolic velocity was constant; the Pourcelot resistance
   index in each ciliary artery rose with advancing age teach P<.05).
   Conclusions In healthy women and men, aging-induced changes in
   retrobulbar hemodynamics are comparable to alterations seen in patients
   with glaucoma or age-related macular degeneration, suggesting that
   vascular changes with senescence may contribute to increased risk for
   these diseases in older age.}},

Abstract = {{The idea that a sparse representation is the computational principle of
   visual systems has been supported by Olshausen and Field {[}Nature
   (1996) 381:607-609] and many other studies. On the other hand neurons in
   the inferotemporal cortex respond to moderately complex features called
   icon alphabets, and such neurons respond invariantly to the stimulus
   position. To incorporate this property into sparse representation, an
   algorithm is proposed that trains basis functions using sparse
   representations with shift invariance. Shift invariance means that basis
   functions are allowed to move on image data and that coefficients are
   equipped with shift invariance. The algorithm is applied to natural
   images. It is ascertained that moderately complex graphical features
   emerge that are not as simple as Gabor filters and not as complex as
   real objects. Shift invariance and moderately complex features
   correspond to the property of icon alphabets. The results show that
   there is another connection between visual information processing and
   sparse representations.}},

Abstract = {{In order to characterize the contributions of respiratory and
   photosynthetic actions to energy conversions, the mixotrophic cells of
   Marchantia polymorpha were cultivated in the medium containing 10
   kg/m(3) glucose as an organic carbon source. The cultures were conducted
   with the supply of ordinary air (0.03\% CO2) at constant incident light
   intensities of 50 and 180 W/m(2). From the results of metabolic
   analysis, it was found that the cell yield based on ATP synthesis was
   estimated to be 6.3 x 10(-3) kg-dry cells/mol-ATP in these cultures.
   Under the examined conditions, energy conversion efficiency through
   respiration was larger than that through photosynthesis, and efficiency
   of overall energy conversion to ATP was maximized when the sum of
   energies from glucose and light captured by the cells was approximate to
   7.2 x 10(5) J/(h kg-dry cells). Taking into account the efficiency of
   overall energy conversion, a batch culture of M. polymorpha in a
   bioreactor was carried out by regulating incident light intensity
   ranging from 9 to 58 W/m(2). In the culture with light regulation, the
   cell yield of 6.2 x 10(-9) kg-dry cells/J was achieved on the basis of
   energy provided to the system throughout the culture, and this value was
   2.3 and 9.3 times as large as those obtained in the cultures under
   constant incident light intensities of 50 and 180 W/m(2), respectively.

Abstract = {{Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and Fas ligand (FasL) have been implicated
   in the pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Several recent
   studies have shown that some metalloproteinase mediates TNF-alpha and
   Fast processing. We examined the ameliorating effect of a hydroxamic
   acid-based metalloproteinase inhibitor (KB-R7785) that inhibits
   TNF-alpha and Fast release in a lethal acuteGVHD model in mice. The
   ameliorating effect of KB-R7785 was superior to that of anti-TNF-alpha
   antibody. We also examined the effect of KB-R7785, which we previously
   demonstrated a potent ameliorating effect on acute GVHD, on
   graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect of allogeneic bone marrow
   transplantation (BMT), Administration of KB-R7785 without bone marrow
   cells and spleen cells (BMS). significantly prolonged the survival of
   IgE-producing B53 hybridoma cell-inoculated (C57BL/6 x BALB/c) F1 (CBF1)
   mice by inhibiting the infiltration of B53 cells into the liver and
   spleen. Transplantation of B6 BMS without KB-R7785 resulted in the death
   of most recipients due to acute GVHD while efficiently eliminating B53
   cells. Administration of KB-R7785 along with B6 EMS resulted ill 50\%
   survival of B53-inoculated CBF1 mice over 50 days without histological
   manifestations of acute GVHD or residual B53 cells. These results:
   suggest that KB-R7785 could be a potent therapeutic agent for GVHD, and
   indicate the beneficial effects of KB-R7785 that inhibit tumor
   infiltration and prevent acute GVHD while preserving the GVL effect of
   allogeneic BMT.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To reveal anatomic factors that determine the visibility of
   respiratory jugular venodilation, a landmark for right internal jugular
   vein puncture, in ventilated patients.
   Design: Prospective observational study.
   Setting: Single community hospital.
   Participants: Adult patients undergoing general endotracheal anesthesia.
   Interventions: Anatomy of the right neck, including the carotid artery
   and internal jugular vein, was evaluated in a blind manner using 7.5-MHz
   ultrasonography in patients simulating the position for internal jugular
   vein puncture. Anatomic variables correlated with the visibility of
   respiratory jugular venodilation were analyzed.
   Measurements and Main Results: Of 124 patients, respiratory jugular
   venodilation was observed in 94 patients (75,8\%). Satisfactory quality
   of ultrasound image was obtained for all patients. The visibility of
   venodilation correlated with the extent of change of the vein size
   during a respiratory cycle but not with the end-expiratory or
   endinspiratory vein diameter. These results indicated that there was no
   correlation between the vessel size and the visibility of venodilation,
   suggesting that it is rational to attribute the increased success rate
   of the respiratory jugular venodilation-guided puncture to accurate vein
   localization rather than to a larger target size. Among the demographic
   variables examined, body weight and obesity correlated with the
   visibility of venodilation, but age, gender, and height did not
   correlate. In obese patients, the respiratory change of the vein
   diameter was smaller, and the vein was deeper.
   Conclusions: The visibility of respiratory jugular venodilation does not
   correlate with the vein size but with the extent of its dynamic change
   during a respiratory cycle. Copyright (C) 2000 by W.B. Saunders Company.}},

Abstract = {{(1R,2R)-1-(5'-Methylfur-3'-yl)propane-1,2,3-triol (MFPT), a stable
   anhydro derivative of sphydrofuran, was obtained from the culture broth
   of Streptomyces sp. strain FV60 as an inhibitor of herpes simplex virus
   type 1 (HSV-1). The compound showed antiherpetic activity with a 50\%
   Inhibitory concentration of 1.2 mu M in an in vitro assay system.
   Although the binding of virus to host cells was not Inhibited, the
   penetration of virus into cells was moderately blocked by MFPT. Some of
   the viruses, once they had penetrated cells, failed to form plaques in
   the presence of MFPT. When added to the late stages of HSV-1
   replication, MFPT also inhibited virus production. Sodium dodecyl
   sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of isotope-labelled
   HSV-specific proteins revealed that a protein or proteins with reduced
   molecular weight (about 120 kDa) was clearly detected in cells treated
   with MFPT. Western blot analysis with antibodies against three
   HSV-specific glycoproteins (gB, gC and gD) showed a significant
   difference in gC synthesis between untreated and MFPT-treated cells.
   Release of progeny viruses was suppressed by MFPT. Syncytium formation
   by HSV-1 strain HF was inhibited and small plaques with rounded cells
   were formed in MFPT-treated cell cultures. When wild-type HSV-1 was
   serially propagated under the selective pressure of MFPT, resistant
   virus emerged. MFPT-resistant progeny were accompanied by the formation
   of plaques with rounded cells. These results, taken together, suggest
   that MFPT might act by limiting the maturation of HSV-specific
   glycoproteins, particularly of HSV-1 gC.}},

   long-term retention test. In the absence of a reminder treatment,
   infants exhibited complete forgetting during the long-term test. Infants
   exposed to one reminder exhibited retention when tested 24 h after their

   customers are served on an LCFS basis. The focus is on the stationary

   individual types of customers. A computational approach is developed for
   computing the stationary distribution of queue strings, the mean of busy
   period, and the means and variances of waiting times. The relationship
   between these performance measures and the threshold number N is

Abstract = {{The long-time behavior of the consumer population in a Gallopin's
   system, located in a polluted environment, was studied. Firstly, a
   mathematical model, i.e., a nonlinear ordinary differential system, was
   made by faking a constant catch rate into account in model of MA Zhi-en.
   Secondly, using the extension theorem and the comparison theorem, the
   bound of the system was estimated. Then, the effect of the pollution on
   the consumer population was discussed by the use of calculus and
   qualitative theory of differential equation. Finally, some conditions
   for weak persistence in the mean and extinction are found out. The
   threshold between persistence and extinction can be established in some
   cases.}},

Abstract = {{This article will describe the development of Section XI from a
   pamphlet-sized document to the lengthy and complex set of requirements,
   interpretations, and Code Cases that it has become by the year 2000.
   Section XI began as a set of rules for inservice inspection of the
   primary pressure boundary system of nuclear power plants. It has evolved
   to include other aspects of maintaining the structural integrity of
   safety class pressure boundaries. These include procedures for component
   repair/replacement activities, analysis of revised and new plant
   operating conditions, and specialized provisions for nondestructive
   examination of components and piping. It has also increased in scope to
   cover other Section III construction: Class 2, Class 3 and containment
   structures. First, to provide a context for the discussions to follow,
   the differences in administration and enforcement between Section XI and
   the other Code Sections will be explained, including its dependence on
   the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The importance of interpretations
   and Code Cases then will be discussed. The development of general
   requirements and requirements for each class of structure will be
   traced. The movement of Section XI toward a new philosophy,
   risk-informed inspection, will also be discussed. Finally, an annotated
   bibliography of papers describing the philosophy and technical basis
   behind Section XI will be provided. {[}S0094-9930(00)01703-0].}},

Abstract = {{Purpose and Methods: Nine elite canoeists were investigated concerning
   changes in performance, heart rate variability (HRV), and blood-chemical
   parameters over a 6-d training camp. The training regimen consisted of
   cross-country skiing and strength training, in total 13.0 +/- 1.6 h,
   corresponding to a 50\% increase in training lend. Results: Time to
   exhaustion (RunT) decreased from 19.1 +/- 1.0 to 18.0 +/- 1.2 min (P <
   0.05). (V) over dot (2max) and max lactate (L-max) both decreased
   significantly (P < 0.05) over the training period (4.99 +/- 0.97 to 4.74
   +/- 0.98 L.min(-1) and from 10.08 +/- 1.25 to 8.98 +/- 1.03 mmol.L-1
   respectively). Heart rates (HR) decreased significantly st all
   workloads. Plasma volume increased by 7 +/- 7\% (P < 0.05). Resting
   cortisol, decreased from 677 +/- 244 to 492 +/- 222 nmol.L-1 (P < 0.05),
   whereas resting levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline remained
   unchanged. The change brtween tests in RunT correlated significantly
   with the change in HRmax (r = 0.79. P = 0.01). There were no group
   changes in high or low frequency HRV, neither at rest nor following a
   tilt. Conclusions: The reduced maximal performance indicates a state of
   fatigue/overreaching and peripheral factors are suggested to limit
   performance even though HRmax and La-max both were reduced. The reduced
   submaximal heart rates are probably a result of increased plasma volume.
   HRV in this group didn't seem to be affected by short-term overtraining.}},

   reservoirs. We propose a device combining the exchange field and

Abstract = {{Local and non-local relaxation processes were distinguished by

   discharge current (TSDC) line-shape in the case of three epoxy networks

   differences in crosslink density. As far as local motions are concerned,
   the TSDC evolution measured at low temperature can be accounted for by
   using a model based on a distribution of activation energies. On the
   other hand, the higher temperature part of the spectrum of the densely
   crosslinked network, which mainly results from cooperative motions,

Abstract = {{Organic pollution is still the most important anthropogenic stress
   factor influencing the usability of ground and surface water as drinking
   water for cattle. Organic pollution is decomposed in several distinct
   heterotrophic processes that cause oxygen deficit, and finally end in
   the production of ammonia, hydrogen sulphide or methane. Even after the
   oxygen balance being restored higher nutrient concentrations
   (eutrophication) will remain. Eutrophication itself often leads to
   secondary pollution processes that adversely affect oxygen availability.
   Toxins may be generated by certain bluegreen bacteria growing under
   highly eutrophic conditions. Due to the concentrations of organic
   substances bacterial growth is forced, sometimes including faecal
   indicators and pathogenic species originating from the effluents of most
   of the communal sewage treatment works. Another kind of man made
   pollution concerns certain toxic substances. Disregarding the effects of
   accidental spills, the industrial production and use of pesticides in
   agriculture as well as other industrial chemicals or heavy metals may
   cause concentrations beyond acceptable limits. The use of surface water
   for cattle may become a problem for this reason. Accidental spills must
   be reckoned with as well, so the technical equipment for providing
   alternative sources of drinking water in emergencies must be available.
   Whereas the use of groundwater is normally not affected by toxic
   substance or pathogenic bacteria, high concentrations of iron, humic
   acids or salination may affect the suitability of water for cattle.}},

Abstract = {{The notion of specification frameworks transposes the framework approach
   from software development to the level of formal modeling and analysis.
   A specification framework is devoted to a special application domain. It
   supplies reusable specification modules and guides the construction of
   specifications. Moreover, it provides theorems to be used as building
   blocks of verifications. By means of a suitable framework, specification
   and verification tasks can be reduced to the selection, parametrization
   and combination of framework elements resulting in a substantial support
   which opens formal analysis even for real-sized problems. The transfer
   protocol framework addressed here is devoted to the design of data
   transfer protocols. Specifications of used and provided communication
   services as well as protocol specifications can be composed from its
   specification modules. The theorems correspond to the relations between
   protocol mechanism combinations and those properties of the provided
   service which are implemented by them. This article centers on the
   application of this framework which is discussed with the help of the
   specification of a sliding window protocol. Moreover the structure of
   its verification is described. The specification and verification
   technique applied is based on L. Lamport's temporal logic of actions
   (TLA). We use the: variant cTLA which particularly supports the modeling
   of process systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{2-{[}Fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) uptake within the
   primary lesion correlates with survival on positron emission tomography
   (PET) studies of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The more
   metabolically active the tumour, the worse the outcome. The aim of this
   study was to determine whether a correlation exists between
   aggressiveness as determined by pathology and the findings of FDG PET in
   pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Thirty-five patients with 38 adenocarcinomas
   of the lung were studied. All patients underwent thoracotomy within 4
   weeks of the FDG PET study. For semiquantitative analysis, standardized
   uptake values (SUVs) were calculated. Patients were classified into high
   SUV (greater than or equal to 4.0) and low SUV (<4.0) groups. The degree
   of FDG uptake (SUVs) in primary lung lesions was correlated with the
   histopathological features of aggressiveness (pleural involvement,
   vascular invasion or lymphatic permeation). The mean SW of aggressive
   adenocarcinomas (4.36+/-1.94,n =22) was higher than that of
   non-aggressive ones (1.53 +/- 0.88, n = 16) (P <0.0001). Tumours with a
   high FDG uptake have a significantly higher likelihood of aggressiveness
   than those with a low FDG uptake (P = 0.0004). Analysis by the
   Kaplan-Meier methods revealed that the groups had different prognoses
   (log-rank test, P = 0.0099). The high SUV group had a significantly
   worse prognosis. In conclusion, a correlation was seen between
   aggressiveness as determined by pathology and glucose metabolism as
   measured by FDG PET in adenocarcinoma of the lung. FDG PET may be used
   as a non-invasive diagnostic technique in measuring aggressiveness and
   prognosis in patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. ((C) 2000

Abstract = {{Between 28 September and 7 October 1995, we conducted an airborne laser
   altimetry experiment over the Long Valley caldera, California, in which
   each of two scanning laser altimeters (dubbed SLICER and RASCAL) were ?
   own in a NASA T-39 jet aircraft. Operating concurrently were a Global
   Positioning System( GPS) guidance system and dual frequency receivers
   for precise navigation and post-flight calculation of the airplane
   trajectory relative to a ground station, and an inertial navigation
   system (INS) for attitude determination. Reduction of raw laser ranges
   requires merging the differential kinematic GPS aircraft trajectory and
   the INS data with the laser data, and determination of the atmospheric
   delay. Data geolocation consists of obtaining the centre location and
   the mean elevation within each footprint in a geodetic coordinate
   system. The elevation of Crowley Lake is recovered to an accuracy of
   similar to 3 cm or better from 3 km above ground level and crossover
   analysis indicates that the elevation estimates are consistent from pass
   to pass. We test our geolocation procedures by comparing laser-derived
   elevations with those determined in situ for recognizable ground
   features. A comparison of laser and GPS-derived positions shows that the
   horizontal accuracy is better than the diameter of the footprint and
   vertical accuracy is within the error inherent in the range measurement.
   A comparison of SLICER elevation data with digital elevation models
   (DEMs) of the region shows that the DEM data provides surface topography
   to within stated accuracy limits. Although research continues to utilize
   the full potential of laser altimetry data, our results constitute a
   successful demonstration that the technique may be used to perform
   geodetic monitoring of surface topographic changes.}},

   period of 3 years (1996-1999). The mean age of the patients was 41.7
   years (range 19-80 Y, SD 10.0 Y). As a measure of the progression rate
   (PR) the lost registered Expended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score
   was divided by the time span (years) from disease onset until the latest
   assessment The APOE genotype was determined from saliva and/or blood
   samples using PCR-techniques. The prevalence of different APOE genotypes
   was compared with the allele-distribution in a population of 361 persons
   from a Danish cross-sectional population study. The frequency of
   APOE-epsilon 4/epsilon 4 homozygotes was significantly higher in the
   MS-group as compared to controls (P<0.05, odds ratio: 2.3), whereas the
   frequency distribution of other genotypes did not differ significantly.
   The rate of progression was significantly foster in the APOE-epsilon
   4/epsilon 4 homozygotes compared to other genotypes in the MS group
   (P<0.05). This study suggests that the APOE-epsilon 4/epsilon 4

Abstract = {{1. Intra-sarcomeric gradients of {[}Ca2+] during activation of action
   potential stimulated frog single fibres were investigated with the Ca2+
   indicator fluo-3 and confocal and two-photon microscopy. The object of
   those experiments tvas to look for evidence of extra-junctional Ca2+
   release and examine the microscopic diffusion of Ca2+ within the
   sarcomere.
   2. By exploiting the spatial periodicity of sarcomeres within the fibre,
   we could achieve a high effective line-scanning rate (similar to 8000
   lines s(-1)), although the laser scanning microscope was limited to <
   1000 lines s(-1) At this high time resolution, the time course of
   fluorescence changes was very different at the z- and m-lines, with a
   significant delay (similar to 1 ms; 22 degrees C) between the rise of
   fluorescence at the z-line and the m-line.
   3. To calculate the expected fluorescence changes, we used a
   multi-compartment model of Ca2+ movements in the half-sarcomere in which
   Ca2+ release was restricted to triadic junctions (located at z-lines).
   Optical blurring by the microscope was simulated to generate
   fluorescence signals which could be compared directly to experimental
   data. The model which reproduced our experimental findings most
   accurately included Ca2+ binding by ATP, as well as indicator binding to
   immobile sarcomeric proteins. After taking sarcomeric misregistration
   within the fibre into account, there was very good agreement between the
   model and experimental results.
   4. We conclude that there is no experimental evidence fur Ca2+ release
   at locations other than at z-lines. In addition, our calculations
   support the conclusion that rapidly diffusing Ca2+ buffers (such as ATP)

   intracellular indicator binding need to be considered to explain
   correctly the time course of fluorescence change in the fibre.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Trofosfamide is a commercially available oxazaphosphorine
   prodrug that requires metabolic activation at the mixed-function oxidase
   system of the liver. Metabolic products of trofosfamide include
   ifosfamide (the major metabolite) and cyclophosphamide. In pilot studies
   with trofosfamide at a dose of 150 mg per day given continuously,
   significant activity against refractory small-cell lung cancer and mild
   toxicity in elderly, pretreated patients was observed. The prognosis of
   pretreated elderly patients with metastatic lung cancer is extremely
   poor. Patients and Methods:Thus, the aim of this trial was to test the
   activity of a monotherapy with trofosfamide given orally and
   continuously (3x50 mg daily) in elderly and/or heavily pretreated
   patients with small-cell or non-small-cell lung cancer. 51 adult
   patients (median age 65 years, range 38-77 years) with pretreated
   (surgery 1, radiation 11, chemotherapy 33) metastatic (liver 23, lymph
   nodes 25, bone 7 adrenal gland 4, other sites 17) small-cell lung cancer
   (n=24) or non-small-cell lung cancer (n=27) received 3x50 mg
   trofosfamide continuously until proven tumor progression. Results: All
   patients survived the therapy. Major responses have been seen in
   patients with small-cell lung cancer (CR 5, PR 4, SD 8, PD 7). The
   median duration of response was 5 months. In patients with metastatic
   nonsmall cell lung cancer no major response was observed (SD 18, PD 9).
   However, in patients with stable disease under trofosfamide therapy
   normal activity of the patients for averagely 1 year was
   seen,Trofosfamide was well tolerated without significant
   gastrointestinal or renal toxicity, peripheral neurotoxicity or
   alopecia. Bone marrow toxicity was the leading toxicity (WHO grade II
   leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia). Conclusion:Trofosfamide seems to be
   an active agent in the treatment of elderly and/or pretreated patients
   with metastatic lung cancer, especially small-cell lung cancer.}},

Abstract = {{We used a single administration of clomiphene citrate (CC), a synthetic

   CC in combination with these hormones affected both expression of
   oligosaccharides on the uterine surface and membrane architecture
   further elucidating CC's agonistic/antagonistic properties.
   Ovariectomized sexually mature rats were given combinations of E-2 and
   CC (E-2 + CC) or P-4 and CC (P-4 + CC) or P-4 and E-2 (P-4 + E-2) and
   were killed 24 h later, Uterine tissue was labelled with the lectin
   Phytolacca americana conjugated with avidin and subsequently labelled
   with biotinylated ferritin and prepared for transmission electron
   microscopy. Results of the administration of these hormone combinations
   indicate that CC, when administered in conjunction with E-2, had the
   ability to downregulate expression of oligosaccharides on the membrane
   surface caused by E-2. When administered with P-4, CC had the ability to
   upregulate the effects of P-4. Thus, when combined with E-2, CC has an
   antagonistic effect but when combined with P-4, CC has an agonistic
   effect.}},

Abstract = {{The frequency domain model has been extended for the regional
   instability evaluation while retaining its practicality and improving
   the reliability of major influential numerical models. The unified
   friction and local pressure loss model of the original LAPUR was
   modified considering the different dynamic characteristic of two
   pressure loss mechanisms. The detailed ex-core recirculation loop model
   was implemented and the neutron point kinetics model was also modified
   to reflect the inter-mode void reactivity interaction. The neutron flux
   modal analysis code, ACCORD-N, was developed based on the nonlinear
   iterative nodal method. Efficient schemes were proposed to give the
   higher mode initial flux guess. The modified code system was verified
   based on the Ringhals unit I stability test data. Extensive studies were
   performed to identify influential factors in the regional instability. A
   dependence of the decay ratio was investigated with regard to the
   sub-criticality of the first azimuthal mode, Nyquist plots and several
   power shape indices. It seemed reasonable to conclude that the regional
   instability was strongly influenced by the thermal hydraulic mechanism.
   Including the simulation results of other reactors, the distance
   weighted axial power momentum, named the AS-value, gave a good account
   of both core-wide and regional instability modes. (C) 2000 Elsevier

   oceanica, and the entrails of fish discarded by local fishermen. Whilst
   foraging, the turtles generally rested on the seabed and employed their
   forelimbs to clear away detritus from their selected prey. Foraging
   dives were of short duration (mean +/- SE = 2.3 +/- 0.43 min, N=96)
   compared to deeper dives reported in the literature presumably because
   of the small lung volumes required to attain neutral buoyancy at such

Abstract = {{The terms routinely used to describe states of reduced glomerular

   defined. With increasing interest in the epidemiology of chronic renal
   insufficiency and the timing of initiation of dialysis, terms such as

   without clear definition. Unambiguous terminology should be adopted. The
   authors favor using the term chronic renal insufficiency to describe
   states of reduced GFR not severe enough to require dialysis or
   transplantation. The authors propose classifying patients with GFR of 60
   to 41 mL/min, 40 to 21 mL/min, and 20 mL/min or below as having mild,
   moderate, and advanced degrees of chronic renal insufficiency,
   respectively. The use of this terminology will facilitate communication

   comparison of populations across cohort studies and clinical trials. (C)

Abstract = {{Abnormal accumulation of the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein has
   recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's and
   Parkinson's diseases. Because neurodegeneration in these conditions
   might be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress,
   the effects of alpha-synuclein were investigated in a hypothalamic
   neuronal cell. line (GT1-7). alpha-Synuclein overexpression in these
   cells resulted in formation of alpha-synuclein-immunopositive
   inclusion-like structures and mitochondrial alterations accompanied by
   increased levels of free radicals and decreased secretion of
   gonadotropin-releasing hormone. These alterations were ameliorated by
   pretreatment with anti-oxidants such as vitamin E. Taken together these
   results suggest that abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein could lead
   to mitochondrial alterations that may result In oxidative stress and,
   eventually, cell death.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of coupled gap solitons in diatomic lattices with cubic and
   quartic nonlinearities is considered analytically based on an extended
   quasidiscreteness approach. For various mass differences (and thus
   different gap widths of the phonon spectrum), the coupled gap solitons
   are shown to display very rich dynamical behavior and their properties
   are strongly dependent on the force-constant ratio K-3(2)/(K2K4), where
   K-j (j=1,2,3) are the force constants for the quadratic, cubic, and
   quartic parts of the intersite interaction potential, respectively.
   Several previous theoretical approaches for studying gap soliton
   dynamics in diatomic lattices are recovered in our scheme, and the
   relations between these methods are elucidated in a systematic way.}},

   dispersed in a nearly pure tin matrix with a small amount of eta-Cu6Sn5
   phase in the bulk of solder. During thermal shock and aging
   microstructural evolution occurred with Cu-Sn intermetallic compound
   (IMC) layer growth at interface, bismuth phase coarsening and Ag3Sn
   phase coarsening. The microstructure of the solder appeared to be stable
   at high temperature. The shear strength of the present solder joint is
   higher than that of Sn-37Pb and Sn-3.5Ag solders. Shear failure occurred

Abstract = {{Objective: Abdominal pain is a common problem in childhood and accounts
   for a significant workload in general practice. The aim of this study
   was assess the nature of abdominal pain in a sample of Australian
   children attending a Western Australian general practice for any reason,
   and to determine factors associated with the reporting of such pain.
   Methodology: A prospective study of children and their families
   attending a rural general practice was undertaken using a parental
   survey to assess the frequency and nature of abdominal pain, demographic
   features, physical and behavioural characteristics.
   Results: Abdominal pain was common in this population; 44\% (70 of 164)
   of parents reported that the index child had experienced abdominal pain
   in the past 12 months. The average age of children who experienced
   recent abdominal pain was 9 years and 9 months. Multivariate analysis
   suggested that children experiencing abdominal pain in the preceding 12
   months were more likely to be anxious (odds ratio (OR) = 3.74, P =
   0.01), to have a family history of similar problems in siblings (OR =
   4.26, P = 0.01) and to experience sleep disturbance (OR = 3.90, P =
   0.02) than children without abdominal pain. Consumption of three or more
   serves of wholemeal bread or cereals per day had a significant
   protective effect an reported abdominal pain in children (OR = 0.12, P =
   0.03). The majority of families (66\%) dealt with the pain without
   resorting to medical care.
   Conclusions: Abdominal pain remains a common problem of children
   attending an Australian general practice, and was associated with
   features suggesting that it is related to anxiety and coping ability.
   Abdominal pain is not usually associated with disease; most families
   recognize this and cope with abdominal pain without medical
   consultation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents some chemical and metallographic studies of the
   Statue of Neptune, which is a famous historical object in the City of
   Gdansk. In 1998, due to the conservation work to be carried out on the
   Statue, a decision had to be taken about the repair methods to be
   applied to the right hand of the Statue which was badly damaged.
   Examinations have revealed that this XVII-century art-casting was made
   of brass, containing also some other alloying elements such as lead,
   tin, and antimony. Due to the presence of lead, it was necessary to
   abandon an earlier decision to join two parts of the arm near the wrist
   using flame plating. It has been found that an internal hollow made of a
   copper alloy ensures strength that is appropriate to the arm structure.
   The fissure in the wrist was thoroughly cleaned and filled up with epoxy
   resin mixed with some brass dust additives and colouring substances to
   integrate the colours with the original. Other damage was also repaired
   using epoxy resin. In order to protect the sculpture against the
   destructive effect of the environment, its surface was covered with a
   film of a substance obtained by mixing two solutions consisting of
   bees-wax in toluene and Paraloid/Acryloid B-72 in toluene.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of bus
   suspension systems on building vibrations and dynamic pavement loads.
   Building vibrations and pavement loads induced by two instrumented buses
   having different characteristics were measured simultaneously under
   controlled field conditions. Field tests were performed at several
   vehicle speeds, normal and reduced tire pressures, and with roads having
   good surface condition as well as abrupt surface irregularities. Tests
   were carried out at two vibration complaint sites in Montreal. The level
   and frequency content of vibrations and loads induced by the two buses
   were evaluated and compared. The results show that the dynamic component
   of pavement loads induced by the two buses were significantly different
   but the difference in building vibration levels was not as significant.

Abstract = {{Background: The major objective of the present study was to examine the
   cardioprotective effect of resveratrol, an antioxidant presents in red
   wines, in the rat after ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion (I-R).
   Methods: The left main coronary artery was occluded for 30 or 5 min
   followed by a 30-min reperfusion in anesthetized rats. Animals were
   preinfused with and without resveratrol before occlusion and the
   severity of ischemia- and I-R-induced arrhythmias and mortality were
   compared. Results: Resveratrol pretreatment had no effect on
   ischemia-induced arrhythmias nor on mortality. In contrast, a dramatic
   protective effects were observed against I-R-induced arrhythmias and
   mortality. Resveratrol pretreatment both reduced the incidence and
   duration of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation
   (VF). During the same period, resveratrol pretreatment also increased
   nitric oxide (NO) and decreased lactate dehydrogenase levels in the
   carotid blood. Conclusions: Resveratrol is a potent antiarrhythmic agent
   with cardioprotective properties in I-R rats. The cardioprotective
   effects of resveratrol in the I-R rats may be correlated with its
   antioxidant activity and upregulation of NO production. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{A full-scale fishing experiment on north-east Arctic cod (Gadus morhua)
   and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), involving a trawler, a longliner
   and a gillnetter was conducted in order to determine how the length
   distributions and life history parameters of the catches were affected
   by gear type. Relative selectivity was analysed for catches taken when
   the boats fished simultaneously in the same area, and when the skippers
   were allowed to fish under conditions as close as possible to commercial
   operation. Trawl and longline-caught cod had similar length
   distributions, but cod caught by trawl were on average 2.3 cm smaller
   than longline-caught cod. Cod caught by longline had a lower condition
   factor and length at age. The longliner caught smaller haddock than the
   trawler when the boats fished in the same area. When the skippers were
   allowed to change fishing ground, the mean length of cod increased in
   the trawl catches and became larger than the mean length in the longline
   catches. The mean length of haddock in the longline catches increased by
   2.8 cm and became larger than that of the trawl catches. Gillnet catches
   consisted almost solely of large cod. Mean length of gillnet caught fish
   in 186 mm nets decreased from 86.2 cm to 82.3 cm even if the boat did
   not change area. Separate selectivity experiments for trawl and gillnet
   were conducted, and the parameters for the mesh selection are presented.
   To find the functional form of the longline selectivity we used relative
   catch proportion in each 5 cm length-group for longline compared to
   trawl and gillnet, whose selectivities were assumed to be known. When
   compared to that of the gillnet, the plots indicate that the longline
   selectivity curve takes the form of a unimodal distribution. When
   longline catches was compared to trawl catches none of the suggested
   models seemed to fit, and to conclude anything about the form of the
   longline selection curve is not possible. (C) 2000 International Council

Abstract = {{Background: Crohn's disease is often poorly responsive to conventional
   therapy with corticosteroids and immunomodulators. A novel chimeric
   antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha, infliximab, has shown utility
   in the treatment of refractory refractory Crohn's disease in adults.
   Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of open-label administration of
   infliximab in children and adolescents with active intestinal Crohn's
   disease.
   Methods: Chart review of the experience with 19 subjects (mean age 14.4
   years, range 9 to 19 years) receiving 1 to 3 infusions of infliximab (5
   mg/kg/dose) over a 12-week period for corticosteroid-resistant disease
   (n = 7) or corticosteroid dependence (n = 12). Disease activity was
   monitored by physician global assessment and the Pediatric Crohn's
   Disease Activity Index.
   Results: Significant initial improvement (first 4 weeks after infusion)
   was noted in all subjects, with Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index
   values decreasing significantly (mean +/- SD, 42.1 +/- 13.7 to 10.0 +/-
   5.6, P < .0001). Over the subsequent 8-week period, 8 of 19 treated
   subjects had worsening of symptoms, although none deteriorated to severe
   activity. The mean Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index at 12 weeks
   was 26.8 +/- 16.4. The mean daily prednisone dosages at baseline, 4
   weeks, and 12 weeks were 28 +/- 14 mg, 20 +/- 12 mg, and 8 +/- 12 mg,
   respectively (P < .01). Adverse effects were noted in 3 patients during
   infusion (dyspnea, rash) and were self-limited.
   Conclusions: Infliximab is associated with short-term clinical
   improvement in children and adolescents with severe Crohn's disease. The
   rapid return of disease activity in some patients suggests that
   additional dosing strategies may be required. Long-term safety
   necessitates close monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the ways in which the bodies and social roles of New
   Zealand women were constructed in the popular media prior to, during and

   analysis of the New Zealand Woman's Weekly, shows the ways in which
   women were encouraged to appropriately manage and survey their bodies
   and behaviours to maintain an unproblematic gender order. During the
   war, women were primarily constructed in terms of their usefulness to
   the war effort. After the war, women were encouraged to regard their
   bodies and their social selves as the social currency by which they
   could attract and hold the scarce resource which men represented. They
   were also encouraged to construct their bodies as primarily suited to
   motherhood in the family-centred postwar social environment. This
   mothering role also extended to the postwar rehabilitation of men, This
   study draws on the work of Foucault to discuss the operation of power on
   women's bodies and their subjectivities during this historical period.}},

Abstract = {{1 The role of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in the modulation of
   acetylcholine release was studied using field stimulated mouse cortex
   slices incubated with {[}H-3]-choline.
   2 Both acetylcholine (100 mu M) and the cholinesterase inhibitor
   neostigmine (100 mu M) inhibited the stimulation-induced (S-I) outflow
   of radioactivity but in the presence of atropine (0.3 mu M) an
   enhancement was seen, which may be indicative of facilitatory nicotinic
   receptors.
   3 Mecamylamine (100 mu M) was unable to antagonize the enhancement seen
   in the presence of acetylcholine and atropine. The nicotinic agonist
   dimethylphenylpiperazinium (30 mu M) did not facilitate S-I outflow of
   radioactivity.
   4 A range of nicotinic blockers had no effect on the enhancement seen in
   the presence of neostigmine and atropine, nor did indomethacin, the
   5HT(3) antagonist MDL 7222 nor the NMDA antagonist MK-801.
   5 The inability to block this effect suggests that nicotinic receptors
   are not involved. We postulate, at least for neostigmine, that the
   facilitation is an artefact because of the use of {[}H-3]-choline as a
   radiotracer whereby the efflux of radioactivity is enhanced because the
   radiolabelled acetylcholine is not metabolized to choline and therefore
   flows out of the tissue more readily.}},

   The amount of quantum yield of fluorescence decreases with the increase

   heavy-atom effect studies that the decrease of biscyanines fluorescence
   ability is connected with the enhancement of singlet-triplet intersystem
   crossing (S-1 --> T-2). It has been established that the probability of
   the triplet states population in biscyanines with chromophores in

Abstract = {{Background and aims-One form of epithelial cell injury in inflamed
   colonic mucosa in ulcerative colitis (UC) is reported to involve
   apoptosis of these cells. Bcl-2 family proteins Bax and Bcl-2 are the
   major regulators of apoptosis. The aim of this study was to elucidate
   the involvement of the Bax/Bcl-2 system in induction of apoptosis of the
   inflamed colonic epithelium in UC.
   Methods-Colonic epithelium was isolated from colonic biopsy specimens.
   Expression of CD95, Pax, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2 proteins was determined by
   western blotting. Bax gene expression was assessed by both reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by Southern
   hybridisation and a real time PCR assay.
   Results-Equal levels of expression of CD95, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2 proteins
   were noted in normal and UC colonic epithelia. Equal levels of
   expression of Pax protein and mRNA were noted in epithelia of normal
   colon and inactive UC. Levels of expression of Bax protein and mRNA were
   markedly reduced in inflamed UC colonic epithelium.
   Conclusions-Our study showed for the first time downregulation of Bax in
   inflamed colonic epithelium of UC. The Bax/Bcl-2 system did not seem to
   be involved in induction of apoptosis of epithelial cells in the
   inflamed colonic mucosa of UC.}},

Abstract = {{The crystallization kinetics of the Fe53.5Ni20Cu1Nb3Si13.5B9 glassy
   ribbon was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. The phase
   identification in the linearly heated samples was performed by X-ray
   diffraction. The linear heating thermograms indicate an anomalous
   heating rate dependence. It was found that both kinetics and mechanisms
   of glass crystallization suddenly change when the heating rate falls
   below its critical value, omega = 20 K min(-1) The crystallization
   proceeds as a two step (R1 and R2) transformation using small heating
   rates omega < 20 K min(-1). The activation energies E-1{*} = 302 kJ
   mol(-1) and E-2{*} = 345 kJ mol(-1) indicate atomic transport
   mechanisms. The ordered Fe3Si and Fe3NiSi1.5 nanocrystalline phases
   crystallize separately in the R1 and R2 steps. In the same material both
   phases crystallize simultaneously in one crystallization step (R3) by
   the viscous how mechanism (E-3{*} = 718 kJ mol(-1)) at higher heating
   rates, omega greater than or equal to 20 K min(-1). The DSC experiments
   gave evidence of the diffusion of nickel, which starts before the

Abstract = {{Transplantation of Schwann cells (SCs) induced remyelination of
   demyelinated rat dorsal column (DC) axons and improved conduction. To
   investigate the difference between oligodendrocyte (OL) and SC
   myelination in conductive functions of axons, we compared normal DCs,
   demyelinated DCs, demyelinated DCs remyelinated by SC transplantation,
   and normal dorsal roots. All of the axons was originated from dorsal
   root ganglion neurons.
   Dorsal roots of adult rats were demyelinated at T11 by X-ray irradiation
   and ethidium bromide, and transplanted with SCs (3 X 10(4)) of adult
   rats. Three weeks later, the spinal cord was removed and pinned in a
   recording chamber and compound action potentials (CAPs) were recorded,
   to investigate conduction properties (conduction velocity and response
   after high frequency stimulation). Normal DCs or dorsal roots were
   recorded in same manner.
   Following transplantation of SCs, histological examination revealed
   SC-like patterns of remyelination in demyelinated DCs. SC
   transplantation improved significantly conduction properties compared to
   demyelinated axons, but less than normal DC. Moreover, remyelinated
   axons by SC transplantation showed as low amplitude of CAP as dorsal
   roots, but lower conduction velocity than dorsal roots. Though
   anatomical difference and/or time after transplantation influenced the
   conduction, these result suggested that SC myelination resulted in lower
   amplitude of CAP than OL, and SC remyelination might be insufficient for
   conduction velocity.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical behavior of the lung and chest wall has not been
   determined in preschool children. We therefore obtained static
   expiratory pressure-volume (P-V) curves of the respiratory system,
   partitioned into lung and chest wall components using esophageal (Pes)
   and airway pressure (Paw) registration in 17 anesthetized children (0.2
   to 15.5 yr in the supine and lateral position. From the P-V curves the
   inspiratory capacity (IC), the chest wall elastance (Ecw), and the
   maximal compliance of the respiratory system (Crs and lungs (C-lung)
   were calculated and related to growth. At IC (Paw = 30 cm H2O), Pes was
   the same in the two po sitions: 11 +/- 3 cm H2O). In contrast, at
   end-expiration (Paw = 0), Pes was close to zero in the lateral position,
   but markedly positive in the supine position (7 +/- 2 cm H2O). C-lung
   was similar in both positions and increased with growth. Thus, C-lung in
   the lateral position (ml/cm H2O) = 0.0017 x length(2.26) (cm), r(2) =
   0.90. Crs and IC were approximately 20\% greater (p less than or equal
   to 0.001) in the supine position than in the lateral, and correlated
   strongly (r(2) greater than or equal to 0.93) with power functions of
   length in both positions. Ecw expressed as a fraction of total
   respiratory system elastance (Ecw/Ers) was 33 +/- 12\% in the lateral
   position and 12 +/- 16\% supine (p < 0.001). We conclude that the
   respiratory mechanics in children correlated closely with body size and
   showed important differences between the supine and lateral positions.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, we showed that 5 cases of hypersensitivity to mosquito bites
   (HMB) concealed the clonal lymphoproliferation of Epstein-Barr viral
   (EBV) DNA-positive natural killer (NK) cells. Although the symptoms of
   HMB have been supposed to derive from Arthus phenomenon, it has become
   apparent that this unique disorder has the potential to develop into
   so-called malignant histiocytosis (MH) or related disorders.
   Accordingly, the criteria for MH have been changed, and a newer
   diagnostic name, hemophagocytic syndrome, has been described as being
   associated with viral infection or leukemia/lymphoma. We previously
   reported that biopsy specimens taken from skin lesions demonstrated
   infiltration of lymphocytes bearing the phenotype of NK cells. In this
   study, we found that skin lesions exhibited infiltration of atypical
   lymphocytes around the small vessels, resembling angiocentric lymphoma,
   and that these infiltrating cells were positive for EBER-1 by in situ
   hybridization. These findings support the concept that HMB is the most
   important manifestation of a certain type of lymphoproliferative disease
   that presents with an intense local skin reaction and high fever
   following mosquito bites, and whose essence is the lymphoproliferation
   of EBV DNA-positive NK cells. Int J Hematol. 2000;72:223-228. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Objectives: To make a cost minimisation analysis of incisional hernia
   repair at a county hospital and extrapolate the results nationally.
   Setting. County hospital, Sweden.
   Subjects: 861 patients who underwent midline laparotomy between August
   1989 and November 1992.
   Interventions: In April 1991 surgeons were urged to change their suture
   technique towards wound closure with a suture length: wound length ratio
   of at least 4.
   Main outcome measures: Rate of incisional hernia at 12 months and the
   number of hernia repairs required with associated costs.
   Results: The average cost of one hernia repair was SEK 42 643. After the
   intervention the risk of requiring a hernia repair was reduced by 0.016
   for each patient operated on through a midline incision. The cost was
   reduced by SEK 686 and the cost of an operation 5 minutes longer was SEK
   570, so the intervention generated savings of SEK 116 for each patient
   operated on. A similar reduction on a national level would yield annual
   savings of SEK 2 107 140, which may be regarded as the annual
   opportunity cost of an inadequate surgical technique in Sweden.
   Conclusions: An alteration to the suture technique that reduces the rate
   of incisional hernia and the number of hernia repairs required is cost

Abstract = {{A porous TiO2 film possessing both meso-sized (2-50 nm) pores and
   macro-sized (100-300 nm) pores has been fabricated for the first time by
   coating an SnO2 substrate with a paste consisting of secondary TiO2
   submicroparticles, poylethylene glycol, hydroxypropyl cellulose and
   water, followed by calcination. The macropores are formed most probably
   by phase separation between the TiO2 particles and the polymers in the
   course of drying of the coated paste. The meso-macroporous TiO2 film
   thus prepared has a thickness of ca. 10 mu m by four-fold coating, and
   is characterized by a large surface area arising from the mesopores in
   the secondary TiO2 particles, and by the presence of wide channels
   within the film. The film fabricated by calcination at 550 degrees C for
   30 min was composed of pure anatase with high crystallinity. These
   features are favorable to construct an electrode for dye-sensitized
   photoelectrochemical cells.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a probabilistic syntactic approach to the detection
   and recognition of temporally extended activities and interactions
   between multiple agents. The fundamental idea is to divide the
   recognition problem into two levels. The lower level detections are
   performed using standard independent probabilistic event detectors to
   propose candidate detections of low-level features. The outputs of these
   detectors provide the input stream for a stochastic context-free grammar
   parsing mechanism. The grammar and parser provide longer range temporal
   constraints, disambiguate uncertain low-fever detections, and allow the
   inclusion of a priori knowledge about the structure of temporal events
   in a given domain. To achieve such a system we: 1) provide techniques
   for generating a discrete symbol stream from continuous low-level
   detectors; 2) extend stochastic context-free parsing to handle
   uncertainty in the input symbol stream; 3) augment a run-time parsing
   algorithm to enforce intersymbol constraints such as requiring temporal
   consistency between primitives; and 4) extend the consistency filtering
   to maintain consistent multiobject interactions. We develop a real-time
   system and demonstrate the approach in several experiments on gesture
   recognition and in video surveillance. In the surveillance application,
   we show how the system correctly interprets activities of multiple,
   interacting objects.}},

   type 2 (HIV-2), and HIV-1 infection of host peripheral blood mononuclear
   cells (PBMCs) is CD I dependent. In some cases, X4 HIV-1 chemotaxis is
   CD4 independent, and cross-species transmission might be facilitated by
   CD4 independent entry, which has been demonstrated for some SIV strains
   in CD4(-) non-T cells. As expected for CCR5-dependent virus, SIV
   required CD4 on rhesus and pigtail macaque PBMCs for infection and
   chemotaxis, However, SIV induced the chemotaxis of human PBMCs in a
   CD4-independent manner. Furthermore, in contrast to the results of
   studies using transfected human cell lines, SIV did not require CD4
   binding to productively infect primary human PBMCs. CD4-independent

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that beta-adrenoceptor (P-AR) agonists have
   potent anti-inflammatory capabilities, e.g. represented by suppression
   of release of the proinflammatory cytokines.
   Aim of this research was to determine whether the effects of
   beta-agonists on LPS-induced TNF alpha and IL-10 release are influenced
   by their different stereochemistry. In addition, the role of the beta-AR
   subtypes was studied. The effect of two stereoisomers of the selective
   beta(2)-AR agonist TA2005 {[}(R,R)- and (S,S)-] on the LPS-induced TNFa
   and IL-IO release by U937 macrophages was compared. The
   (R,R)-stereoisomer was 277 times more potent in inhibiting the TNFa
   release than the (S,S)-form. The (R,R)stereoisomer also appeared to be
   more potent in increasing the IL-IO release. In radioligand binding
   studies the affinity of (R,R)-TA2005 for the beta-adrenoceptor was 755
   times higher than the (S,S)-TA2DOS stereoisomer. In addition, the
   elevation of intracellular cAMP in U937 cells appeared to be
   stereoselective: (R,R)-TA2005 was more potent in elevating intracellular
   cAMP. The effect of both stereoisomers on the LPS-induced TNFa release
   could almost completely be antagonized by preincubation with the
   selective beta(2)-AR-antagonist ICI-118551. Further evidence that the
   effect of the P-agonists is mediated via the beta(2)-adrenoceptor
   subtype exclusively was acquired by incubation of U937 cells with
   selective beta(1)- and beta(3)-agonists. None of these receptor subtype
   agonists showed significant suppressive effect on TNFa release. This
   study provides additional proof that the anti-inflammatory effects of
   beta(2)-agonists are mediated via the beta(2)-adrenoceptor and indicates
   that these effects are highly dependent on the stereoselectivity of the
   ligand.}},

Abstract = {{Naftidrofuryl (Praxilene; NAF) significantly improves claudication
   distance in patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD).
   Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a powerful endogenous vasoconstrictor and the
   circulating levels of ET-1 are elevated in patients with vascular
   disease. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) was prepared from healthy
   volunteers. NAF at concentrations similar to therapeutic levels (3.5-14
   mu mol/l), inhibited (P < 0.02) platelet activation (as indicated by a
   fall in median platelet volume, MPV) induced by ET-1 (0.4 mmol/l) alone.
   NAF also inhibited (P <0.0001) shape change (PSC; an early phase of
   platelet activation, characterised by an increase in MPV) induced by
   ET-1 (0.4 mu mol/l) in combination with ADP (0.05-0.15 mu mol/l) or
   serotonin (0.03-0.13 mu mol/ l). We assessed the effect of ETA (BQ123,
   50 nmol/ l) or ETB (BQ788, 50 nmol/l) receptor antagonists on PSC
   induced by ET-1 alone. Both antagonists significantly inhibited PSC. We
   conclude that ET-1 activates human platelets. Both ETA and ETB receptors
   probably contribute to this response by a complex mechanism that
   requires further elucidation. NAF antagonises the action of ET-1 on
   human platelets. These actions may contribute to the beneficial effects
   of NAF in PVD.}},

Abstract = {{The large-scale ozone distribution over the northern hemisphere
   undergoes strong fluctuations each winter on timescales of up to a few
   weeks. This is closely linked to changes in the stratospheric polar
   vortex, whose shape, intensity and location vary with time. Elliptical
   diagnostic parameters provide an empirical description of the daily
   character of the polar vortex. These parameters are used as an objective
   measure to define two characteristic wintertime vortex displacements,
   towards northern Europe and Canada, respectively. The large-scale
   structures in bath the stratosphere and troposphere and the 3D ozone
   structures are determined for both vortex displacement scenarios. A
   linear ozone transport model shows that the contribution of horizontal
   ozone advection dominates locally in the middle stratosphere.
   Nevertheless, the largest contribution is due to vertical advection
   around the ozone layer maximum. The findings are in agreement with an
   EOF analysis which reveals significant general modes of ozone
   variability linked to polar vortex displacement and to phase-shifted
   large-scale tropospheric waves. When baroclinic waves travel through the
   regions of vortex-related ozone reduction, the combined effect is to
   produce transient synoptic-scale areas of exceptionally low ozone;
   namely dynamically induced strong ozone mini-holes.}},

   using a monolithic 50 x 4.6 mm i.d. poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene)
   column have been carried out. The separation process involves
   precipitation of the macromolecules on the macroporous monolithic column
   followed by progressive elution utilizing a gradient of the mobile
   phase. Depending on the character of the separated polymer, solvent
   gradients were composed of a poor solvent such as water, methanol, or
   hexane and increasing amounts of a good solvent such as THF or
   dichloromethane. Monolithic columns are ideally suited for this
   technique because convection through the large pores of the monolith
   enhances the mass transport of large polymer molecules and accelerates
   the separation process. Separation conditions including the selection of
   a specific pair of solvent and precipitant, flow rate, and gradient
   steepness were optimized for the rapid HPLC separations of various
   polymers that differed broadly in their molecular weights. Excellent
   separations were obtained demonstrating that the
   precipitation-redissolution technique is a suitable alternative to
   size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). The molecular weight parameters
   calculated from the HPLC data match well those obtained by SEC. However,
   compared to SEC, the determination of molecular parameters using
   gradient elution could be achieved at comparable flow rates in a much
   shorter period of time, typically in about 1 min. (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Objectives: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is likely to become one of the
   most important indications for laparoscopic surgery. We herein report
   our experience.
   Methods: From April 1994 until April 1999, 98 patients presenting with
   RCC were treated laparoscopically by either radical nephrectomy (RN; n =
   73) or wedge resection (WR; n = 25). The mean age was 62.3 years. The
   mean tumour diameters were 3.8 cm (RN) and 1.9 cm (WR). All tumours were
   clinical stage T1 lesions. The transperitoneal approach was used for RN
   in all patients. For WR either the transperitoneal or the
   retroperitoneal approach was used. In 15 patients, the adrenal gland was
   removed simultaneously. The specimen was entrapped in an organ bag and
   removed intact through a small muscle-splitting incision in the lower
   abdominal wall.
   Results: RN: The mean operating time was 142 (range 86-230) min, the
   mean blood loss was 170 (range 0-1,500) mi, and the mean postoperative
   hospital stay was 7.4 (range 3-32) days. Minor complications occurred in
   4.0\% of the patients, while major complications were seen in 8.0\% of
   them. WR: The mean operating time was 163.5 (range 90-300) min, the mean
   blood loss was 287 (range 20-800) mi, and the postoperative hospital
   stay was 8.0 (range 3-8) days. Minor complications: 4\%, major
   complications: 8\%. Histology revealed RCC stage T1 in 77 patients,
   stage T3a in 7, and stage T3b in 3 patients, oncocytoma in 2 patients,
   angiomyolipoma in 2, renal adenoma in 1, renal metastasis in 1,
   multilocular cysts in 4, and renal abscess in 1 patient. Over mean
   follow-up periods of 13.3 and 22.2 months for RN and WR, respectively,
   neither local recurrences nor metastases have been observed among
   patients with histologically confirmed RCC.
   Conclusions: Laparoscopic surgery for clinical stage T1 RCC is safe and
   efficient. Excellent tumour control can be achieved. However, longer
   follow-up periods will be necessary to confirm these results. Copyright

Journal = {{CHEST}},

Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{348-352}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Context: Measurement of pulsus paradoxus (PP) is one of several measures
   previously advocated in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
   asthma management guidelines: a pulsus of > 12 mm Hg warranted hospital
   admission. It is one of only a few measures that is not effort dependent
   and therefore important in the evaluation of patients with asthma.
   Objective: Determination of physician accuracy in measuring PP.
   Design: A model of induced PP in a trained healthy subject without
   respiratory disease was constructed with a fixed inspiratory resistance
   with measurement of inspiratory air pressure and beat-to-beat BP
   noninvasively,
   Setting: Laboratory.
   Participants: Attending physicians from emergency medicine and critical
   care disciplines who served as consecutive examiners of the trained
   reference subject generating known PP.
   Interventions: A total of 19 attending physicians were assessed for
   ability in measuring PP by sphygmomanometry and by palpation. The
   reference subject generated 4 degrees of PP sequentially, with each
   examiner blinded to the value of negative inspiratory pressure and PP,
   Examiners first assessed PP qualitatively by palpation, followed by its
   measurement within 2 min.
   Main outcome measure: Proximity of physician-measured PP (PPm) to true
   PP (PPt). Results: At inspiratory pressures of -10, -15, -20, and -25 mm
   Hg, PPt was 13.7, 16.2, 19.1, and 20.7 mm Hg, respectively (F = 14.8, p
   < 0.0001; analysis of variance {[}ANOVA]). At the same pressures, PPm
   was 13.1, 17.5, 17.7, and 18.0 mm Hg (p > 0.10; ANOVA). Linear
   regression of PPm against PPt for each examiner revealed a slope (SE) of
   0.53 (0.23), and not a 1:1 relationship.
   Conclusions: Past and present guidelines do not account for the
   challenges in measuring PP, especially in tachypneic patients.
   Sphygmomanometric determination of PP should be augmented by new aids
   developed through technological innovation.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{36}},

Pages = {{195-200}},

Abstract = {{There is evidence that telomeres, the ends of chromosomes, serve as
   clocks that pace cellular aging in vitro and in vivo. In industrialized
   nations, pulse pressure rises with age, and it might serve as a
   phenotype of biological aging of the vasculature. We therefore conducted
   a twin study to investigate the relation between telomere length in
   white blood cells and pulse pressure while simultaneously assessing the
   role of genetic factors in determining telomere length. We measured by
   Southern blot analysis the mean length of the terminal restriction
   fragments (TRF) in white blood cells of 49 twin pairs from the Danish
   Twin Register and assessed the relations of blood pressure parameters
   with TRF. TRF length showed an inverse relation with pulse pressure.
   Both TRF length and pulse pressure were highly familial. We conclude
   that telomere length, which is under genetic control, might play a role
   in mechanisms that regulate pulse pressure, including vascular aging.}},

Abstract = {{In an attempt to characterise the clinical features, incidence and
   outcome of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) we report our experience in a
   large unselected series of patients from a well defined region. All new
   cases of ET in the County of Copenhagen were registered during the
   period 1977-98. We identified 96 cases of ET, yielding an age- and
   sex-adjusted annual incidence rate of 0.59/100.000 and a
   point-prevalence at last follow up of 11/100.000. The overall incidence
   rate was 0.31 and 1.00 per 100.000 population during the consecutive
   periods 1977-89 and 1990-98, respectively, corresponding to a 3.2-fold
   increase. Median age at diagnosis was 67 yr (females 68 yr, males 66 yr,
   range 18-87 yr), and the female to male (F/M) ratio was 2.6:1. At
   diagnosis, 52\% of the patients displayed no ET-related symptoms and
   were discovered fortuitously by a routine platelet count. Forty-eight
   percent presented with thrombohaemorrhagic phenomena, of which
   microvascular disturbances of the central nervous system (CNS),
   extremities and skin were most frequently observed (23\%). Compared to
   patients diagnosed after 1989, patients diagnosed before 1990 had a
   significantly higher mean platelet count, white blood cell (WBC) count,
   lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value and alkaline phosphatase value. With a
   median follow up of 70 months, 5-yr survival was 76\%, significantly
   lower than the expected survival of an age- and sex-matched control
   group (p = 0.0052). Thirty-seven patients experienced a total of 55
   thrombohaemorrhagic events during follow-up, corresponding to an
   incidence of thrombosis and microvascular disturbances or haemorrhage of
   8.1\% per pt-yr and 2.5\% per pt-yr, respectively. The number of
   patients experiencing thrombosis or microvascular disturbances was
   significantly higher among the 29 patients who never received
   acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) compared to the 67 patients who received ASA
   during follow up (45\% vs. 21\%; p = 0.017). This study provides
   population-based data suggesting the benefit of treatment with low-dose
   ASA in a non-selected population of patients with ET.}},

   average, interactions without conflicts outnumbered conflicts 2 to I;

Abstract = {{The catalytic polymerization of a series of 1,6-heptadiynes (1-4) by

   poly(1,6-heptadiyne)s with highly conjugated polyenes. The

   110,000. The structures of the polymers depend on the types of monomers
   employed. Namely, diethyl dipropargylmalonate (DEDPM) and 1 result in a
   polyene backbone consisting of only five-membered rings, whereas the
   remaining monomers (2-4) result in a mixture of both five-membered and
   six-membered ring structures. The copolymerization of DEDPM and

Title = {{Deficiencies of essential fatty acids, vitamin A and E and changes in
   plasma lipoproteins in patients with reduced fat absorption or
   intestinal failure}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{632-642}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Deficiencies of essential fatty acids (EFA), Vitamin A
   (retinol) and vitamin E (alpha- and gamma-tocopherol) were studied in
   non-HPN patients with different degrees of fat malabsorption (managing
   without home parenteral nutrition (HPN), and in HPN-patients receiving
   HPN with and without parenteral lipids.
   Design and subjects: Phospholipid fatty acids (including EFA),
   cholesterol, retinol. alpha- and gamma-tocopherol in plasma and the
   intestinal absorption of fatty acids and energy (balance-studies) were
   measured in 40 non-HPN patients. 44 HPN patients and 35 controls.
   Subgroups were non-HPN patients with fat:total energy absorption ratios
   >25\% (A), between 15 and 25\% (B), and <15\% (C), and HPN patients
   receiving (D) and not receiving parenteral lipids (E).
   Results: Intestinal absorption of the EFA linoleic acid was 8.2, 4.3,
   3.8, 0.5 and 0.5 g/day and corresponding plasma concentrations were
   17.3\%, 15.5\%, 13.1\%, 12.1\% and 8.9\% in groups A-E, respectively (P
   < 0.001). Deficiencies in EFA, defined as a Holman index >0.2
   (20:3n-9/20:4n-6 ratio), were confined to 42\% of the patients in group
   E. Plasma cholesterol was decreased in groups B-E. Plasma retinol was
   reduced (below the lower 2.5\% confidence interval of controls) in 7\%
   of non-HPN patients and in 20\% of HPN patients. Plasma alpha-tocopherol
   was reduced in 64\% of patients from groups B-E. Plasma gamma-tocopherol
   was decreased in 33\% of the patients, except in HPN-patients receiving
   parenteral lipids.
   Conclusions: Plasma linoleic acid may decrease considerably (from 26\%
   to 8-10\%)as fat absorption decreases before secondary signs of
   essential fatty acid deficiencies occur tan increase in 20:3n-9 and the
   Holman index). In this study this was confined to patients on lipid-free
   HPN. Vitamin A deficiencies were mainly seen in HPN patients. Vitamin E
   deficiencies were common in both HPN and non-HPN patients, but
   administration of parenteral lipids normalized plasma gamma-tocopherol.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a technique for using broadband seismograms recorded from
   earthquakes at local and regional distances to refine basin structure,
   For the region outside the basin, we assume a one-dimensional (ID)
   crustal model and analytical techniques (GRT) to propagate the energy
   from sources to the basin edge where the motions are then interfaced
   with a (2D) finite-difference algorithm (Wen and Helmberger, 1996). We
   parameterize the basin section by isovelocity layers with linear dipping
   segments between control points. The control point depths are allowed to
   vary to improve the modeling of waveform data of stations inside the
   basin. The comparison between data and synthetics is qualified by a
   fitness function defined by two factors: the timing shift required for
   best alignment and the correlation coefficient. The procedure was
   applied to a strong-motion waveform profile across the extended Los
   Angeles Basin produced by the 1992 Landers, California earthquake to
   refine the velocity structure using sensitivity testing and forward
   modeling. Only the correlation coefficient and amplitude were used
   because absolute timing was unknown. The procedure was extended to a
   direct waveform inversion by employing a conjugate gradient approach,
   which uses numerical derivatives. Numerical tests using the new
   inversion process with synthetic data demonstrate that it is possible to
   recover a detailed basin structure, if a sufficient amount of
   high-quality data exists.}},

Abstract = {{Parasitoids of dried-fruit insects were surveyed at a culled fig
   warehouse in Fresno, CA. Three parasitoids of pyralid larvae were found:
   Habrobracon hebetor (Say), Venturia canescens (Gravenhorst), and at
   least one species in the genus Goniozus Forster. Two parasitoids of
   pyralid pupae also were noted: Mesostenus gracilis (Cresson) and a new
   species of Psilochalcis Keifer. The latter is a new host association.
   Several beetle parasitoids were present, including Anisopteromalus
   calandrae (Howard), three species of Cephalonomia Westwood, Laelius
   centratus (Say), and Cerchysiella utilis Noyes. C. utilis, a parasitoid
   of driedfruit beetle, Carpophilus hemipterus (L.), is a new record for
   California. Most activity by parasitoids (detected by yellow night
   traps) occurred directly above the fig mass. Pyralid parasitoids
   exhibited two peaks of seasonal activity one in late summer through
   early fall, shortly after new figs were brought into the warehouse, and
   one in the spring. II hebetor generally attacked older host larvae,
   whereas V. canescens equally attacked older and younger larvae,
   indicating that these two parasitoids may coexist Ly exploiting
   different portions of the host population. H. hebetor was active
   throughout the winter, suggesting that winter release of H. hebetor
   could be used to control diapausing pyralid populations in dried fruit
   and nut storage areas.}},

   antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial pathogens (from
   bloodstream, inpatient and outpatient lower respiratory tract, urinary
   tract, and skin and soft-tissue infections) were included in an
   extensive database used to define antimicrobial resistance patterns
   throughout the world. On the basis of 1997-1999 test results from the
   Americas, fluoroquinolones continue to demonstrate potent in vitro
   activity against Enterobacteriaceae and important pathogens (Haemophilus
   influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis. Streptococcus pneumoniae, and
   atypicals) that cause community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
   At published breakpoint concentrations, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin,
   sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin, and ciprofloxacin inhibited
   similar to 100\% of H. influenzae isolates, including those that
   demonstrated resistance to beta-lactams and macrolides. Fluoroquinolones
   were also active against numerous other gram-negative bacilli and
   demonstrated high activity against S. pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic or
   viridans group streptococci. New fluoroquinolones maintain activity
   against penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, with a low
   overall resistance in this species, even among the most recent (1999)
   clinical isolates. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program will
   continue to monitor the antibacterial activity of these newer agents
   throughout the world, to identify emerging resistant strains and to
   facilitate possible intervention strategies as these newer compounds are
   used in the clinic setting.}},

Abstract = {{Studied of the molecular and biochemical basis of self-incompatibility
   (SI) in Papaver rhoeas have revealed much about the signalling pathways
   triggered in pollen early in this response. The aim of the current
   investigation was to begin to study downstream events in order to
   elucidate some of the later cellular responses involved in the SI
   response and identification of the mechanisms controlling the
   irreversible inhibition of pollen tube growth. We have used the FragEL
   assay to investigate if there is any evidence for DNA fragmentation
   stimulated in pollen of P, rhoeas in an S-specific manner. Our data
   clearly demonstrate that S proteins are responsible for triggering this,
   specifically in incompatible, and not compatible, pollen. DNA
   fragmentation was first detected in incompatible pollen tubes 4 h after
   challenge with S proteins, and continued to increase for a further 10 h.
   This provides the first evidence, to our knowledge, that this phenomenon
   is associated with the SI response. We also demonstrate that mastoparan,
   which increases {[}Ca2+](i), also triggers DNA fragmentation in these
   pollen tubes, thereby implicating an involvement of Ca2+ signalling in
   this process, Together, our data represent a significant breakthrough in
   understanding of the SI response in Papaver pollen.}},

   daily for 4 d) to specifically knock-down the cloned KOR. Efficacy of
   the KOR antisense ODN treatment was behaviorally evaluated by assessing
   the antinociceptive effects of peripherally administered kappa- (EMD
   61,753 and U 69,593), mu- (DAMGO) and delta- (deltorphin) ORAs in the
   formalin test. Intrathecal antisense, but not mismatch ODN blocked the
   actions of EMD 61,753 and U 69,593 without affecting the actions of
   DAMGO or deltorphin; a complete recovery of antinociceptive actions of
   the kappa-ORA EMD 61,753 was observed 10 d after the termination of
   antisense ODN treatment. In contrast, the ability of EMD 61,753 to
   dose-dependently attenuate responses of pelvic nerve afferent fibers to
   noxious colonic distension was unaffected in the same rats in which the
   antisense ODN effectively knocked-down the KOR as assessed in the
   formalin test. Additionally, Western blot analysis demonstrated a
   significant downregulation of KOR protein in the L4-S1 dorsal root
   ganglia of antisense, but not mismatch ODN-treated rats. The present
   results support the existence of a non-kappa-opioid receptor site of
   action localized in the colon.}},

Abstract = {{Transgenic poplars (Populus tremula X Populus alba) were obtained by
   introduction of a sense homologous transgene encoding caffeic acid
   O-methyltransferase (COMT) under the control either of the cauliflower
   mosaic virus double 355 promoter or of the eucalyptus cinnamyl alcohol
   dehydrogenase promoter. Although these constructs conferred a moderate
   overexpression of COMT in some lines, a transgenic line with the double
   355 promoter was found where COMT activity in woody tissues was close to
   zero due to a gene-silencing phenomenon. For the first time in COMT
   down-regulated trees, this alteration substantially reduced lignin level
   in 6-month-old trees (17\% decrease). Lignin structure was found to be
   strongly altered, with a two times higher content in condensed bonds, an
   almost complete lack of syringyl units, and the incorporation of
   5-hydroxyguaiacyl units to the most remarkable Extent reported so far.
   Consistent with the higher cellulose content and with the higher
   condensation degree of the lignin, the impact of the transformation on
   the kraft-pulping performances of the poplar trees positively affected
   the pulp yield (10\% relative increase), but made lignins less amenable
   to industrial degradations.}},

Abstract = {{The zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization behavior of two ferromagnetic
   oxides, SrRuO3 and La2/3Ca1/3MnO3, and two ferrimagnetic oxides, MnCo2O4
   and NiFe2O4, has been compared. It has been observed that a peak or
   maximum in M-ZFC(T) is obtained (at T-p less than or equal to T-c) in a
   given temperature range only when measured with magnetic fields less
   than a critical value, H-cr, which is temperature dependent. H-cr
   corresponds to the field below which the contribution to initial
   magnetization is mainly from domain wall displacements. M-ZFC increases
   with increasing temperature as long as H-cr is greater than the applied
   field and the applied magnetic field overcomes this critical field above
   T-p. The results indicate that there is a direct correlation between the
   shapes of M-ZFC(T) curves and the domain structure of a material. A
   drastic decrease of M-ZFC below T-p is observed for high coercivity
   (hard) materials when measured with small DC magnetic fields, compared
   to a broad maximum obtained for the soft materials, because of domain
   wall pinning effects. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   During annealing at ca. 500 degrees C, significant diffusion of elements
   occurred which had a dramatic effect on the film characteristics;
   interdiffusion of Pb and Si were clearly evident and the diffusion and
   reaction of Pb with the Pt electrode resulted in the formation of a
   distinct PbPtx phase (x = 3-4) at the film/Pt interface. Drastic
   interdiffusion of all elements except Zr was detected at higher

Abstract = {{Nicotinic agonists elicit the release of dopamine from striatal
   synaptosomes by acting on presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
   (nAChRs) on dopamine nerve terminals. Both alpha 3 beta 2{*} and alpha 4
   beta 2 nAChR subtypes (but not alpha 7{*} nAChRs) have been implicated.
   Here, we compared nAChR-evoked {[}H-3]dopamine release from rat striatal
   synaptosome and slice preparations by using the nicotinic agonist
   anatoxin-a. In the more integral slice preparation, the
   concentration-response curve for anatoxin-a-evoked {[}H-3]dopamine
   release was best fitted to a two-site model, giving EC50 values of 241
   nM and 5.1 mu M, whereas only the higher-affinity component was observed
   in synaptosome preparations (EC50 = 134 nM). Responses to a high
   concentration of anatoxin-a (25 mu M) in slices (but not in
   synaptosomes) were partially blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor
   antagonists (kynurenic acid, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) and by
   alpha 7{*}-selective nAChR antagonists (alpha-bungarotoxin,
   alpha-conotoxin-ImI, methyllycaconitine) in a nonadditive manner. In
   contrast, the alpha 3 beta 2-selective nAChR antagonist
   alpha-conotoxin-MII partially inhibited {[}H-3]dopamine release from
   both slice and synaptosome preparations, stimulated with both low (1 mu
   M) and high (25 mu M) concentrations of anatoxin-a. Antagonism by
   alpha-conotoxin-MII was additive with that of alpha 7{*}-selective
   antagonists. These data support a model in which alpha 7{*} nAChRs on
   striatal glutamate terminals elicit glutamate release, which in turn
   acts at ionotropic glutamate receptors on dopamine terminals to
   stimulate dopamine release. In addition, non-alpha 7{*} nAChRs on
   dopamine terminals also stimulate dopamine release. These observations
   have implications for the complex cholinergic modulation of inputs onto
   the major efferent neurons of the striatum.}},

Abstract = {{The existing data envelopment analysis (DEA) models for measuring the
   relative efficiencies of a set of decision making units (DMUs) using
   various inputs to produce various outputs are limited to crisp data. To
   deal with imprecise data, the notion of fuzziness has been introduced.
   This paper develops a procedure to measure the efficiencies of DMUs with
   fuzzy observations. The basic idea is to transform a fuzzy DEA model to
   a family of conventional crisp DEA models by applying the a-cut
   approach. A pair of parametric programs is formulated to describe that
   family of crisp DEA models, via which the membership functions of the
   efficiency measures are derived. Since the efficiency measures are
   expressed by membership functions rather than by crisp values, more
   information is provided for management. By extending to fuzzy
   environment, the DEA approach is made more powerful for applications.

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the efficacy of intratympanic gentamicin
   instillation as treatment of incapacitating unilateral Meniere's
   disease, using a predetermined regimen with a fixed dose. Study Design:
   A prospective study hom a single institution between 1988 and 1998.
   Methods: One hundred fourteen patients were enrolled in this study.
   Gentamicin (26.7 mg/mL) was administered three times daily for 4
   consecutive days. The Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium Guidelines
   for Reporting Treatment Results in Meniere's Disease of the American
   Academy of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery (1985) were used.
   Results: Comprehensive data were available for 90 individuals. Complete
   control of vertigo was achieved in 76 (84.4\%), substantial control in 8
   (9.0\%), limited control in 2 (2.2\%), and insignificant control in 4
   (4.4\%) patients. Disability scores at the end of 2 years were as
   follows: 76 patients (8.4\%) had no disability, 5 (5.6\%) had mild
   disability, 2 (2.2\%) had moderate disability, and 7(7.8\%) had severe
   disability. Caloric testing responses, as determined using
   electronystagmography, were as follows: 71\% of the patients had an
   absent ice-water response, 16\% had a positive ice-water response, and
   in 13\% there continued to be present a bithermal response. Hearing was
   worse in 22 patients (25.6\%), unchanged in 41 (48.2\%), and improved in
   22 (25.6\%). Conclusions: Intratympanic gentamicin administration using
   this particular protocol is an effective treatment option for patients
   with disabling unilateral Meniere's disease. Hearing loss is a distinct
   possibility, and patients should be advised accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{How do partners in long-term relationships construct memories of the

   answers to this question. Findings indicate that wives invoke different
   theories of the past at different stages of life. At 10 years into the
   study, wives' memories of the past were negatively biased, such that
   present ratings seemed a significant improvement. At 20 years into the
   study, wives' memories of the past continued to be negatively biased;
   however at this stage, recollections of the past resembled current
   perceptions. Across both intervals, concurrent ratings in fact declined
   significantly. Longitudinal analyses revealed that the degree of bias in
   wives' memories at Time 2 predicted the course of their marital
   satisfaction over the subsequent 10 years. These results support the
   view that memory bias may be a mechanism of maintaining satisfaction in

Abstract = {{Serial subtraction by seven (Serial Seven Test, SST) is frequently used

   the SST. The participants were 80 consecutive outpatient referrals to
   the neuropsychology consultation service of two large general medical
   hospitals. All subjects were administered a comprehensive
   neuropsychological assessment battery, including the Mini Mental State
   Examination version of the SST. Multiple regression analysis indicated
   that calculation skill is at least as important as concentration, in
   predicting SST performance. Measures of overall level of cognitive
   dysfunction, education, and psychopathology were unrelated to SST
   performance. The results suggest that SST performance is heavily
   influenced by basic arithmetic skill and that the procedure should be
   used with caution as a measure of concentration or other nonacademic

Abstract = {{We analyzed the phylogenetic relationship between the species of
   Lordiphosa and other Drosophilidae using alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh)
   gene sequences. The phylogenetic trees consistently show that the four
   species Drosophila kurokawai, D. collinella, D. stackelbergi, and D.
   clarofinis, which include three species groups of Lordiphosa, form a
   monophyletic clade. This clade is placed as a sister group to the
   willistoni and saltans groups of Sophophora. On the other hand, three
   species of Lordiphosa, D. tenuicauda, D. pseudotenuicauda, and D.
   acutissima, all of which belong to the tenuicauda group, are not shown
   to be related to the major Lordiphosa lineage. In the phylogenetic toes,
   these species are included into the clade comprised of Drosophila and
   Hirtodrosophila, although it remains uncertain whether the tenuicauda
   group is a monophyletic group or not. These results indicate that
   Lordiphosa is polyphyletic and that most of the members of the subgenus
   have a close relationship to the neotropical groups of Sophophora. The
   above conclusion is compatible with the hypothesis of Okada (Mushi
   {[}1963] 37:79-100) and Lastovka and Maca (Acta Ent Bohemoslov {[}1978]
   75:404-420) that Lordiphosa is most closely related to Sophophora; in
   contrast, our results contradict the hypothesis of Grimaldi (Bull Am Mus

Journal = {{CURRENT THERAPEUTIC RESEARCH-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{507-522}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This paper reviews the pharmacological properties of the
   proton pump inhibitor (PPI) pantoprazole, with a focus on the
   relationship between pantoprazole dosage and acid suppression in
   patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),
   Background: Pantoprazole is a new PPI available in both oral and
   intravenous (IV) formulations. Like other PPIs, pantoprazole is
   efficacious in the treatment of GERD and other acid-related diseases. It
   has high specificity for the relevant binding sites on activated proton
   pumps, and its profile of pH activation suggests that its activated
   cationic sulfenamide derivative should reach much higher concentrations
   at the site of acid production on the parietal cell than elsewhere in
   the body. These features suggest that pantoprazole will act specifically
   on parietal cells, with little propensity to cause unwanted systemic
   effects. Pantoprazole has minimal interaction with the cytochrome P-450
   enzymes and no known drug interactions, suggesting that no dosage
   adjustment will be needed when it is taken concurrently with other
   medications that are metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 system. Its
   bioavailability is unaffected by food intake. Pantoprazole follows
   linear pharmacokinetics; studies indicate a linear dose response
   increasing up to 40 mg once daily, with some additional benefit at
   higher dosages for patients with chronic hypersecretory conditions. The
   recommended dosage of pantoprazole in GERD is 40 mg once daily, This
   dosage suppresses intragastric pH throughout the day and some of the
   night, providing relief of nighttime gastroesophageal reflux, Both the
   oral and IV formulations of pantoprazole can be dosed at 40 mg once
   daily for patients with GERD, and apparent dose equivalence makes it
   possible to switch a patient from IV to oral pantoprazole without a
   change in dosage or loss of efficacy in either acid suppression or
   disease healing. Dosage adjustments are rarely needed for special
   situations such as severe ulcer disease. No dosage adjustment is
   necessary in elderly patients or in those with renal impairment or mild
   to moderate hepatic impairment.
   Conclusion: The pharmacological characteristics of pantoprazole-its
   ability to relieve GERD symptoms, long duration of action, equivalence
   of oral and TV formulations, and low potential for adverse drug
   interactions-make it a valuable option for the treatment of acid-related
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the relationships between resting metabolic

   Design: Prospective longitudinal observational study.
   Participants: A sample of 147 participants (76 males, 71 females) 18-68
   y of age were followed for approximately 51/2 y.
   Measures: At baseline, post-absorptive RMR and RER were determined by
   indirect calorimetry and adjusted for the effects of age, body mass and
   subcutaneous fatness using regression procedures. Indicators of body
   size and fatness included body mass, waist circumference, and the sum of
   six skinfolds. Changes in these indicators (delta scores) were adjusted
   for age and length of the follow-up period using regression.
   Results: Correlations between baseline RMR, RER and subsequent changes
   in the indicators of body fatness were uniformly low and not significant
   (range -0.05-0.16). Further, Cox proportional hazards regression
   analyses indicated that neither RMR nor RER were significant predictors

Abstract = {{In this study, the morphology of polyurea hard domains in flexible
   polyurethane molded foams was investigated to evaluate the influence of
   diethanol amine (DEOA), a commercially utilized cross-linking agent.
   Tapping Mode AFM was utilized to reveal that DEOA dramatically alters
   the morphology of the solid state. Without DEOA, the solid state phase
   separation leads to the formation of lamellae-like polyurea domains ca.
   50-100 nm long by 5 nm wide, and these lamellae frequently aggregate to
   form larger precipitates ca. 30-50 nm in diameter. These larger
   aggregations appear to be evenly distributed in the material. However,
   when DEOA is added to the formulation, the hard domains become smaller
   and more geometrically isotropic, ca. 5 nm in diameter. Furthermore, in
   the DEOA containing material, the hard domains do not appear to form the
   larger 50 nm aggregates but instead remain distributed at ca. 10 nm
   apart. The addition of DEOA thus reduced the observed level of hard
   domain interconnectivity, an effect which is suggested to explain in
   part the corresponding reduction in modulus (i.e. stiffness) that is
   commonly observed when DEOA is added to such foam formulations. The
   morphological alterations observed using AFM were also found to
   correlate well with the DEOA induced changes in the small angle X-ray
   scattering profiles of these samples. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Fas molecule, also designated APO-1/CD95. belongs to the tumor
   necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family. It is a widely expressed
   membrane-anchored protein that induces apoptosis by Fas/Fas ligand
   (Fas-L) mediation. It was reported that Fas-mediated apoptosis plays an
   important role in regulation of the immune system, systemic inflammatory
   response, and ischemia/reperfusion injury. A soluble form of Fas (sFas)
   is produced either through the proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound
   receptors or by alternative splicing, and sFas is thought to be
   implicated in apoptosis. In addition, sFas released damaged cells, and
   elevated serum levels of sFas reflect systemic tissue damage. To examine
   the specificity of sFas production during cardiac surgery with
   cardiopulmonary bypass, we serially measured the serum sFas levels in 13
   patients during and after surgery. Blood samples were obtained before
   surgery, at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, at the end of surgery,
   and at 12 h after surgery. Levels of serum sFas were determined by
   sandwich ELISA. Seven patients undergoing other types of surgeries
   served as controls. Although increased sFas was not observed in the
   control group, a significantly higher sFas level was detected in cardiac
   surgical patients at the end of surgery than before surgery (p = 0.028),
   and the level decreased at 12 h after surgery. A significant correlation
   was observed between the maximum sFas values and the length of surgery
   (r = 0.659, p = 0.012) and cardioplegic arrest (r = 0.559, p = 0.036).
   Elevated serum sFas levels were observed in patients undergoing cardiac
   surgery, and these serum sFas levels reflect the severity of a surgery.
   sFas may play an important role in the pathophysiology of surgical
   damage caused by cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the means, both physical and numerical, for speeding up
   particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of RF discharges. These include
   implicit movers, longer ion timesteps, lighter-mass ions, different:
   weights for electrons and ions, and improved initial density profiles.
   By using these methods (singly or together) on Ar and O-2 RF discharges
   we were able to achieve speedups of six to 30 times with
   single-processor machines. In electrostatic 1d3v PIG simulations of RF
   discharges, the field solve is typically less than 1\% of the work load.
   Even for 2d3v PIC simulations, the field solve can be a small percentage
   of the work load, especially when fast Fourier transform methods are
   used to solve the field. Thus, we can obtain significant gains by just
   paralleling particle processing (e.g., pushing/accumulating) without
   paralleling the field solve. We applied this simple scheme to conduct
   1d3v and 2d3v PIG simulations of Ar RF discharges on two- and four-CPU
   symmetric multiprocessor machines and on a distributed network of
   workstations. For a fixed number of grid points, the speedup for this
   parallel particle processing became more linear with increasing number
   of particles. The combination of single-processor methods and
   paralleling makes run times for PIC codes more competitive with other
   types of codes.}},

Abstract = {{Although a number of studies reported the association of HLA-DRB1 and
   Crohn's disease (CD), the actual alleles associated with CD are
   considerably variable among populations. On the other hand, the
   relevance of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) in the pathogenesis
   of CD is established through experimental as well as clinical studies,
   raising the possibility that TNFA polymorphism is primarily or
   independently contribute to the association of HLA region genes with CD.
   New polymorphisms which may affect the transcriptional activity were
   recently reported within the upstream promoter region of TNFA gene. In
   the present study, we compared HLA-DRB1, TNFA promoter and TNF receptor
   2 (TNFR2) genotypes in 154 Japanese patients with CD and 265 unrelated
   healthy controls to evaluate the individual contribution of these genes
   to the genetic predisposition to CD. Significant positive association
   was observed in HLA-DRB1{*}0405 (P = 0.001, odds ratio (OR) = 2.02) and
   0410 (P = 0.002, OR = 4.79). Among the TNFA promoter haplotypes,
   TNFA-U03 (-1031C, -863A, -857C) was significantly increased (P = 0.008,
   OR = 1.64), while TNFA-U04 (-1031C, -863C, -857C) was significantly
   decreased (P = 0.014, OR = 0.12), in CD. The association with TNFA-U03
   was independent of that with DRB1{*}0405 and 0410, and apparent additive
   or multiplicative effect was not observed between these susceptibility
   alleles. No association was observed between TNFR2-196M/R polymorphism
   and CD. These results indicated that both of HLA-DRB1 and TNFA promoter
   polymorphisms contribute to the susceptibility to CD in an independent

Title = {{Space-time description of photon emission from an atom}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Starting from the postulate that the electromagnetic field appearing in
   the transverse set of microscopic Maxwell-Lorentz equations governing
   field-matter interactions, properly normalized, can be looked upon as
   describing one-photon-emission and -absorption processes in space and
   time, a first-quantized initiation of photon emission by a single atom
   is presented. The wave function for the emerging photon is introduced as
   a six-vector object constructed from the complex analytical signals of
   the Riemann-Silberstein vectors belonging to opposite photon helicities.
   When the atom is no longer electrodynamically active, the emitted photon
   is described in first quantization by the so-called energy wave function
   well known for photons in free space. From the momentum representation
   of the emerging photon wave function a condition on the analytical part
   of the transverse atomic current density is established which ensures
   that precisely one photon is emitted. A propagator description of the
   emerged photon dynamics in the coordinate representation is established.
   The photon propagator is introduced as a two-component spinor, where
   upper and lower tensor components are constructed, respectively, from
   positive and negative helicity combinations of the propagators
   describing the time-space evolution of the transverse electric and
   magnetic fields. It is shown that the emission region for the photon
   coincides with the region in space where the transverse atomic current
   density is nonvanishing. For a photon emitted in an electric dipole
   transition the emission region essentially is the near-field zone of the
   atom, and this zone therefore determines the initial (and best) spatial
   confinement of the photon. The photon emerging from an atom active for a
   finite time necessarily is of the polychromatic sort and the associated
   wave packet essentially is confined between spherical shells moving
   outwards with the vacuum speed of light. To illustrate the main
   principles of the fundamental theory in a heuristic fashion we apply it
   to a study of the emission of a one-photon sinusoidal wavetrain from a
   pointlike atom. It is found that the atomic current density needed to
   create just one photon is independent of the oscillation period in the
   train and thus depends only on the number of periods in the wave train.
   An explicit expression for the one-photon energy is derived, and it is
   shown that only for extremely short pulse trains pronounced deviations
   from the textbook result, E=(h) over bar omega(0), occur. The radial
   energy flow in the coupled atom-photon system in the near-field zone of
   the atom is investigated, and the cycle-averaged outwards energy
   transport carried by the emerging photon in a given distance from the
   atom is determined.}},

Abstract = {{TSC-22 is a highly conserved member of a novel family of transcription
   factors, that is a direct target of transforming growth factor-beta
   (TGF-beta) in osteoblastic cells. We have investigated the expression of
   TSC-22 in detail during mouse development using in situ hybridization,
   We detected strong expression of TSC-22 in the embryo proper first at
   embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5), in the primitive heart, intermediate mesoderm
   and the neural tube. The dynamics of the TSC-22 distribution in the
   neural tube was particularly striking, with ubiquitous expression
   rostrally and restriction to neural tissue nearer the floor plate more
   caudally; between E8.5 and E9.5 the zone of restricted expression
   extended rostrally, At later stages of development, TSC-22 was detected
   in the mesenchymal compartment of many tissues and organs, including the
   lung, trachea, kidney, stomach, intestine, tooth buds, and in
   precartilage condensations. Furthermore, TSC-22 was highly expressed in
   the floor plate itself and notochord, and the endothelium lining the
   blood vessels, in particular the major arteries. Many of these sites
   have been proposed previously as possible TGF-beta target tissues; the
   results imply that TSC-22 may also be a direct TGF-beta target gene
   during mouse embryogenesis. Experiments on TSC-22 expression in embryoid
   bodies of embryonic stem (ES) cells expressing dominant negative
   TGF-beta binding receptors initially supported this hypothesis. However,
   examination of somatic chimeras derived from these same mutant ES cells
   at nominal E9.5 showed that TSC-22 expression in the heart and neural
   tube was still detectable despite obvious phenotypic abnormalities. We
   therefore propose that although TSC-22 may be a direct target of
   TGF-beta in late development, other factors are likely to be major
   regulators of expression at earlier stages. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The question of whether respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) originates
   mainly from a central coupling between respiration and heart rate, or
   from baroreflex mechanisms, is a subject of controversy. If there is a
   major contribution of baroreflexes to RSA, cardiocirculatory coupling
   during breathing and during cyclic baroreflex stimulation should show
   similarities. We applied a sinusoidal stimulus to the carotid
   baroreceptors and generated heart rate fluctuations of the same
   magnitude as RSA with a frequency similar to, but different from, the
   breathing frequency (0.2 Hz, compared with 0.25 Hz), and at 0.1 Hz, in
   17 supine healthy subjects (age 28-39 years). The data were analysed
   using discrete Fourier-transform and transfer function analysis.
   Respiratory fluctuations in systolic blood pressure preceded RSA with a
   time lag equal to that between baroreceptor stimulation and oscillations
   in RR interval (0.62+/-0.18 s compared with 0.57+/-0.28 s at 0.2 Hz neck
   suction). The response of systolic blood pressure to neck suction at 0.2
   Hz was 5 times less than the respiratory blood pressure fluctuations.
   Neck suction at 0.1 Hz largely increased fluctuations in blood pressure
   and RR interval, whereas the spontaneous phase relationship between
   blood pressure and RR interval remained unchanged. Our results are not
   consistent with the hypothesis that the origin of RSA is predominantly a
   central phenomenon which secondarily generates fluctuations in blood
   pressure, but suggest that, under the condition of fixed-frequency
   breathing at 0.25 Hz, baroreflex mechanisms contribute to respiratory
   fluctuations in RR interval.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the hypothesis that epidermal growth factor
   (EGF) signaling in luteinized granulosa cells works through Raf-1 and
   mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and that depletion of Raf-1 by
   geldanamycin will inhibit the signaling pathway and cause apoptosis.
   Design: Laboratory study. Setting: University of Minnesota.
   Patient(s): Human luteinized granulosa cells from IVF patients.
   Intervention(s): The cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO), 0.5 mu M of
   geldanamycin, 10 ng/mL of EGF, and geldanamycin + EGF.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Radiochemical MAP kinase assay, Western
   blotting, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry.
   Result(s): Geldanamycin treatment depleted Raf-1 and lowered MAP kinase
   activity in luteinized granulosa cells. EGF treatment increased MAP
   kinase phosphorylation and translocation of the phosphorylated MAP
   kinase to the nucleus. Geldanamycin blocked this effect. Cleavage of
   caspase-3, the executioner protein in apoptosis, into an active 17 kD
   fragment was observed by Western blotting in geldanamycin-treated cells.
   Finally, by flow cytometry we observed significantly increased
   percentages of subdiploid apoptotic nuclei in geldanamycin-treated
   cells.
   Conclusion(s): In human luteinized granulosa cells, EGF works through
   Raf-1, and MAP kinase and depletion of Raf-1 by geldanamycin resulted in
   decreased MAP kinase activity, increased activated caspase-3, and,
   ultimately, apoptosis. (C)2000 by American Society for Reproductive

   the size of inclusions and the precipitation ratio of the MnS phase in
   the oxides decreased. More than 90\% of MnO-SiO2 oxides contain MnS
   phases and MnS precipitation is accompanied by an Mn-depleted zone
   around the oxides. This zone was created not just around the MnS, but
   around the whole oxide inclusion. One can tentatively conclude that the
   majority of the MnS islands after isothermal holding are formed by the
   diffusion of Mn and S from the matrix into the inclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The management of orbital floor fractures continues to be
   debated. Bioactive glasses and glass-ceramics are in the new group of
   materials developed for the repair of bone defects which are beyond any
   innate healing capacity due to their size, Objective: We compared the
   use of alloplastic implants (bioactive glass) with conventional
   autogenous grafts (cartilage - plus or minus lyophilized dura) for the
   repair of orbital floor defects after trauma. Material and Methods:
   Twenty-eight patients having orbital floor fractures with persistent
   diplopia, enophthalmos, and/or infraorbital nerve paraesthesia were
   operated on from 1991 to 1995 at Turku University Central Hospital.
   Reconstruction was either with bioactive glass (S93P4) or autogenous
   cartilage implants. Results: Postoperative tomograms in the 28 patients
   showed adequate maintenance of orbital and maxillary sinus volume
   without any evidence of resorption in either group. None of 14 patients
   in the study group had any evidence of dystopia or complications
   relating to implants follow-up. One had infraorbital nerve paraesthesia
   and another had entropion postoperatively. Among the 14 control subjects
   there were three cases of persistent diplopia, two of infraorbital nerve
   paraesthesia and one of enophthalmos. Conclusion: Bioactive glass
   implants are well-tolerated and seem to be a promising repair material
   for orbital floor fractures. Their use leads to less morbidity as no
   donor site operation is needed. Also it provides favourable healing as
   it is bioactive, biocompatible and causes new bone formation. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{CD147 is a broadly expressed plasma membrane glycoprotein containing two
   immunoglobulin-like domains and a single charge-containing transmembrane
   domain. Here we use co-immunoprecipitation and chemical cross-linking to
   demonstrate that CD147 specifically interacts with MCT1 and MCT4, two
   members of the proton-linked monocarboxylate (lactate) transporter
   family that play a fundamental role in metabolism, but not with MCT2,
   Studies with a CD2-CD147 chimera implicate the transmembrane and
   cytoplasmic domains of CD147 in this interaction. In heart cells, CD147
   and MCT1 co-localize, concentrating at the t-tubular and intercalated
   disk regions. In mammalian cell lines, expression is uniform but
   cross-linking with anti-CD147 antibodies caused MCT1, MCT4 and CD147,
   but not GLUT1 or MCT2, to redistribute together into `caps', In
   MCT-transfected cells, expressed protein accumulated in a perinuclear
   compartment, whereas co-transfection with CD147 enabled expression of
   active MCT1 or MCT4, but not MCT2, in the plasma membrane. We conclude
   that CD147 facilitates proper expression of MCT1 and MCT4 at the cell
   surface, where they remain tightly bound to each other. This association
   may also be important in determining their activity and location.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of acoustic and radio waves called PASS (Radio Acoustic
   Sounding System) allows ground based measurements of the vertical
   profiles for temperature, wind and turbulent parameters. The technique
   uses the scattering of the radio waves at the density fluctuations
   caused by the acoustic wave field Compared to SODAR or RADAR techniques
   which have proven their reliable routine operation in various
   applications RASS shows no sensitivity to fixed echo, to environmental
   noise or to precipitation. The height range of the RASS sounding is
   limited only by the atmospheric absorption of the sound waves and the
   shift of he acoustic wave with the mean field Depending on the specific
   choice of acoustic and radio operation frequencies and the geometric
   configuration of the antennas RASS can be optimized for profiling in
   height ranges of some hundreds meter to some kilometer. In view of
   on-line environmental monitoring at industrial sires PASS allows direct
   measurements of the profiles of the meteorological parameters for
   transport and dispersion, atmospheric stability and the formation and

Abstract = {{The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint (LIFE) reduction in hypertension
   study is a double-blind, prospective, parallel-group study comparing the
   effects of losartan with those of atenolol on the reduction of
   cardiovascular complications in patients (n = 9,194) with essential
   hypertension and with electrocardiographically (ECG) documented left
   ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Baseline blood pressure was 174.4/97.8 mm
   Hg (mean), age 66.9 years, body mass index 28.0 kg/m(2): 54.1\% were
   women and 12.5\% had diabetes mellitus. This population will be treated
   until at least 1040 have a primary endpoint. After five scheduled visits
   and 12 months of follow-up, blood pressure decreased by 23.9/12.8 mm Hg
   to 150.5/85.1 mm Hg (target < 140/90 mm Hg). The mandatory titration
   level of less than or equal to 160/95 mm Hg was reached by 72.1\% of the
   patients. At the 12-month visit, 22.7\% of all patients were taking
   blinded study drug alone, 44.3\% were taking blinded drug plus
   hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and 17.7\% were taking blinded drugs plus
   HCTZ and additional drugs. Controlling for all other variables, patients
   in the US received more medication and had 2.4 times the odds of
   achieving blood pressure control than patients in the rest of the study
   (P < .001). Previously untreated patients (n = 2530) had a larger
   initial decrease in blood pressure compared with those previously
   treated. Diabetics (n = 1148) needed more medication than nondiabetics
   to gain blood pressure control. Only 13.9\% of the patients had
   discontinued blinded study drug and 1.4\% missed the revisit at 12
   months.
   These data demonstrate both the successful lowering of blood pressure
   during 12 months of follow-up in a large cohort of patients with
   hypertension and LVH on ECG, but also emphasize the need for two or more
   drugs to control high blood pressure in most of these patients. Being
   previously treated and having diabetes were associated with less blood
   pressure response, whereas living in the US indicated better blood
   pressure control. It has been possible to keep most of these patients
   with complicated hypertension taking blinded study drug for 12 months.

Abstract = {{Background: A low dose solution of adrenaline 2 mu g . ml(-1), fentanyl
   2 mu g . ml(-1) and bupivacaine 1 mg . ml(-1) has been reported to give
   superior pain control when used for epidural analgesia after major
   surgery. The present paper describes the compounding and chemical
   stability of this triple-component solution during storage and use.
   Methods: Sterile triple-component concentrates (11X) were diluted by the
   use of gas isolator technology to give ready-to-use infusion solutions.
   Eight solutions were analysed by reverse phase high-performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) methods, and assays were performed on 1, 45, 90
   and 180 days after storage at 2-8 degrees C. After 180 days the
   solutions were subsequently stored at 22C for four days before they were
   reanalysed. HPLC quantification of adrenaline was also performed on
   samples from solutions given to 28 different patients.
   Results: The concentration of adrenaline and fentanyl decreased
   approximately 3.5\% from 1 to 180 days at 4 degrees C and four days at
   22 degrees C. The corresponding figure for bupivacaine was an apparent
   increase by 2.4\% in concentration. No absorption to the polypropylene
   plastic bags of fentanyl and bupivacaine was detected. None of the 28
   samples derived from used infusion bags contained less than 95\% of the
   declared content of adrenaline.
   Conclusions: The triple-component epidural analgesic solution remained
   stable during six months of cold storage, followed by four days of
   storage at room temperature. No significant degradation of adrenaline
   tvas observed in infusion solutions returned from the wards.}},

Abstract = {{Organophosphate and carbamate ester insecticides, main causes of
   pesticide poisoning, inhibit cholinesterase (ChE) enzymes The aim of
   this study was to measure and compare baseline values for
   pseudocholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme activities
   of different blood fractions in the dog to aid in diagnosis of
   anticholinesterase poisoning. After collecting blood samples from 23
   6-24-mo-old male beagle dogs, Ellman's colorimetric assay was run on
   plasma, red blood cells (RBC), and whole blood fractions prepared in
   triplicate. The procedure described in a commercially available kit was
   applied to plasma and RBC. Hemolyzed whole blood fractions (final
   dilution 1:8) avoided the time-consuming and laborious separation of
   plasma and RBC. In addition to the kit substrate acetylthiocholine
   (ASCh), we used butyrylthiocholine (BSCh) as substrate. Whatever the
   substrate, ChE: activity was lower in RBC than in other blood
   preparations. It was higher when using ASCh rather than BSCh as
   substrate (mean IU/L+/-SD): 563 +/- 144 and 303 +/- 45 respectively, in
   contrast to plasma (1640 +/- 310 and 2510 +/- 450). Whole blood enzyme
   activity did not differ significantly according to substrate: ASCh, 1590
   +/- 190 : BSCh, 1620 +/- 250) with a 2 to 3\% within-day coefficient of
   variation. Enzyme activity was significantly lower in dogs <1-y old.
   This study confirms the low ChE activity in dog RBC compared to other
   species and other blood fractions. It shows that using whole blood
   instead of separating RBC from plasma minimizes the variability of ChE
   activity in the hemoglobin-rich fraction.}},

Abstract = {{The therapeutic spectrum of nemonapride, a new substituted benzamide,
   and its relationship with plasma concentrations of the drug and
   prolactin were investigated by a fixed-dose study (18 mg/day for 3
   weeks) in 31 patients with acutely exacerbated schizophrenia. Of 31
   patients, 25 (80.6\%) were responders who showed a reduction in symptoms
   (percentage of improvement) of 50\% or more after 3 weeks. The mean
   values of percentage of improvement in scores on the total Brief
   Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the five subscale symptoms were
   71.5\% for total, 73.2\% for Positive, 86.0\% for Excitement, 53.9\% for
   Negative, 84.2\% for Cognitive, and 67.5\% for Anxiety-Depression.
   Responders had higher percentage of improvement in positive (84.6 +/-
   17.0(dagger) 9/0 vs. 25.9 +/- 15.7\%; p < 0.001) and anxiety-depression
   (76.9 +/- 18.8\% vs. 28.5 +/- 39.9\%; p < 0.005) symptoms than did
   nonresponders after 3 weeks. The percentage of improvement in total BPRS
   after 2 weeks was well correlated with that after 3 weeks (Spearman rank
   correlation coefficient: r(s) = 0.711; p < 0.01). There was an inverted
   U-shaped relationship between plasma drug concentrations (nemonapride
   plus desmethylnemonapride) and percentage of improvement in total BPRS
   symptoms after a 3-week treatment (y = 46.9 + 73.9x - 44.2x(2); p <
   0.001). These findings suggest that nemonapride has a broad therapeutic
   spectrum in the treatment of acute schizophrenia. The improvements in
   scores for the Positive and Anxiety-Depression subscale symptoms are
   regarded as determinant factors for total response to nemonapride. An
   assessment of clinical status after 2 weeks and plasma drug monitoring
   may be useful for the prediction of the final outcome for patients.}},

Abstract = {{We attempted to induce MUC1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) by
   mixed-lymphocyte tumor cell culture (MLTC) using two allogeneic
   MUC1-positive cancer cell lines, T-47D and MCF7. The induced CTLs
   exhibited MUC1-specific cytotoxicity 16 days after the initial
   stimulation. However, these CTLs underwent apoptotic death within 16
   days. To examine whether the B7-1 molecule is required for the expansion
   of the responder cells, a B7-1(+)/MUC1(-) cell line was transfected with
   MUC1 cDNA, and the resulting transfectant was employed as a stimulator
   in an autologous MLTC. The CTLs exhibited MUC1 specificity but also
   continued to propagate. In parallel, autologous dendritic cells (DCs)
   were added to all MLTC containing peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs)
   and the allogeneic MUC1-positive stimulators. The CTLs demonstrated MUC1
   specificity and their number increased. This suggests that the B7-1
   molecule is required for rescuing CTLs front MUC1-mediated apoptotic
   death, but not for the induction of MUC1-specific responsiveness. This
   strategy to obtain the CTLs efficiently may be useful for adoptive
   immunotherapy against cancer.}},

Abstract = {{The recorded exceedances of the 24-hr PM10 National Ambient Air Quality
   Standard (NAAQS) in Treasure Valley, Idaho, have been associated with
   prolonged stagnation periods during the winter. A comprehensive modeling
   study of PM10 impact in Treasure Valley was performed to support the
   State Implementation Plan (SIP). The study included base-year and
   short-term episodic conditions. The ISCST3 (Industrial Source Complex
   Short Term 3) model, using the base-year meteorology and gridded
   emissions of mobile sources, point sources, and wood burning as input,
   generally agreed well with measurements in both temporal patterns and
   annual averages. The WYNDvalley model was evaluated using monitoring
   data and was used to simulate the PM10 impact for episodic exceedances
   during stagnant winter conditions. An emission inventory was prepared
   for a base year (1995) and then extrapolated to the years 2000, 2005,
   2010, and 2015 in order to determine air quality planning requirements.
   According to the simulations using base-year emissions and meteorology,
   exceedances are not expected. However, exceedances at some stations
   could be expected using projected emissions and episodic meteorology.
   Results from emission control strategies we developed indicate that
   mobile-source emissions have the most significant impact; reduction of
   25\% would be needed to eliminate the simulated exceedances in all
   projected years.}},

   with or without subsequent radiation therapy for breast cancer. As an
   objective assessment of the extent of edema, the circumferences of the
   affected and opposite normal forearms were measured at 10 cm below the
   olecranon of the arm. Twelve of these patients received continual
   bandaging. In these patients, the average excess circumference of the
   affected arm was 6.4 cm over that of the normal forearm; the average
   duration of edema before treatment was 3.5 years; the average period for
   conservative treatment was 10.6 months; and the average decrease in
   circumference was 0.8 cm (11.7 percent of the preoperative excess).
   Twelve patients underwent surgery and postoperative continual bandaging.
   In these patients, the average excess circumference was 8.9 cm; the
   average duration of edema before surgery was 8.2 years; the average
   follow-up after surgery was 2.2 years; and the average decrease in

Abstract = {{This paper discusses a fundamental problem in natural language
   generation: how to organize the content of a text in a coherent and
   natural way. In this research, we set out to determine the semantic
   content and the rhetorical structure of texts and to develop heuristics
   to perform this process automatically within a text generation
   framework. The study was performed on a specific language and textual
   genre: French instructional texts. From a corpus analysis of these
   texts, we determined nine senses typically communicated in instructional
   texts and seven rhetorical relations used to present these senses. From
   this analysis, we then developed a set of presentation heuristics that
   determine how the senses to be communicated should be organized
   rhetorically in order to create a coherent and natural text. The
   heuristics are based on five types of constraints: conceptual, semantic,
   rhetorical, pragmatic, and intentional constraints. To verify the
   heuristics, we developed the SPIN natural language generation system,
   which performs all steps of text generation but focuses on the
   determination of the content and the rhetorical structure of the text.}},

   crabs are transferred from high to low salinity, but does not change in
   C, maenas, a more modest osmoregulator. Amplification and sequencing of
   arginine kinase cDNA from both species, accomplished by reverse
   transcription of gill mRNA and the polymerase chain reaction, revealed
   an open reading frame coding for a 357-amino-acid protein. The predicted
   amino acid sequences showed a minimum of 75\% identity with arginine
   kinase sequences of other arthropods. Ten of the 11 amino acid residues
   believed to participate in arginine binding are completely conserved
   among the arthropod sequences analyzed. An estimation of arginine kinase
   mRNA abundance indicated that acclimation salinity has no effect on
   arginine kinase gene transcription, Thus, the observed enhancement of
   enzyme activity in C, sapidus probably results from altered translation
   rates or direct activation of pre-existing enzyme protein.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new file organization for the storage and manipulation of
   spatial (or multidimensional) data that is able to execute spatial join
   operations with great efficiency. The Filter Tree access method is a
   hierarchical organization that tends to separate spatial entities by
   size. We provide algorithms for constructing Filter Trees, for
   performing range queries on a Filter Tree, and for performing spatial
   joins between a pair of Filter Trees. In full spatial joins, a minimum
   number of index block accesses are needed using Filter Trees, as each
   leaf block is read at most once. We derive some basic properties of
   Filter Trees, and analyze the performance of the algorithms. Finally, we
   include results from experiments using a prototype implementation of
   Filter Trees to treat both synthetic and real sets of spatial entities.
   Our experimental results show that full spatial joins call always be
   done more efficiently with Filter Trees than with current competitive
   methods, with large performance improvements. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A firm faces many problems that are inherently cross-functional. To
   solve them successfully requires the coordinated actions of many
   functional representatives acting in a decentralized setting. Functional
   managers, however, respond to their own individual incentives and may
   consequently fail to maximize the overall profits of the firm. We
   examine this issue in a setting in which the output of early actions
   limits the range of later actions, and we propose an incentive scheme
   that allows the system to be successfully decentralized. Our mechanism
   is based on linear transfer prices for the intermediate output that are
   implemented through an internal market; a market maker buys the output
   from one function and sells it to another. She is not obliged to sell at
   the same price at which she bought and may set prices solely to provide
   incentives. We illustrate the flexibility of the scheme by applying it
   to several models in the operations management literature.}},

Abstract = {{Matured females of two Lake Baikal endemic fish species, Comephorus
   baicalensis and Comephorus dybowski, have been investigated for lipid of
   the whole body and specific tissues (liver, muscles, ovaries),
   phospholipid classes and fatty acids of neutral and polar lipids. Total
   lipid in the body (38.9\% fresh weight), liver (23.5\%) and muscles
   (14.5\%) of C. baicalensis were greater than those of C. dybowski (4.7,
   8.7 and 2.6\%, respectively); only their ovaries were similar (5.3 and
   5.6\% lipid, respectively). In both species, phosphatidylcholine and
   phosphatidylethanolamine were the major phospholipids, ranging from 60.7
   to 75.1\% of total phospholipid and 14.5-25.7\%, respectively. In most
   cases, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were the major fatty acid
   group in C. baicalensis, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were
   the major group in C. dybowski. The MUFA 18:1(n-9) prevailed over other
   fatty acids in C. baicalensis and varied from 19\% in polar lipids of
   muscles to 56.1\% in neutral lipids of muscles. In polar lipid of C.
   dybowski, the PUFA 22:6(n-3) prevailed over other fatty acids in muscles
   and ovaries, while 16:0 dominated polar liver lipids and neutral lipids
   of all tissues. Other major fatty acids included 16:1(n-7), 18:1(n-7),
   and 20:5(n-3). Values of the (n-3)/(n-6) fatty acid ratio for neutral
   lipids of C. baicalensis (0.5-0.9) are well below the range of values
   characteristic either for marine or Freshwater fish, while these values
   for polar lipids (1.6-1.8) are in the range typical of freshwater fish.
   Neutral lipid fatty acid ratios in C. dybowski (2.5-3.1) allow it to be
   assigned to freshwater fish, but polar lipids (2.8-3.7) leave it
   intermediary between freshwater and marine fish. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Journal = {{HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To assess the effects of payment methods on the costs of care
   in medical group practices. Data Sources. Eighty-six clinics providing
   services for a Blue Cross managed care program during 1995. The clinics
   were analyzed to determine the relationship between payment methods and
   cost of care. Cost and patient data were obtained from Blue Cross
   records, and medical group practice clinic data were obtained by a
   survey of those organizations.
   Study Design. The effects of clinic and physician payment methods on per
   member per year (PMPY) adjusted patient costs are evaluated using a
   two-stage regression model. Patient costs are adjusted for differences
   in payment schedules; patient age, gender, and ACG; clinic
   organizational variables are included as explanatory variables.
   Data Collection. Patient cost data were extracted from Blue Cross claims
   files, and patient and physician data from their enrollee and provider
   data banks. Medical group practice data were obtained by a mailed survey
   with telephone follow-up.
   Principal Findings. Capitation payment is correlated with lower patient
   care costs. When combined with fee-for-service with withhold provisions,
   this effect is smaller indicating that these two clinic payment methods
   are not interchangeable. Clinics with more physician compensation based
   on measures of resource use or based on some share of the net revenue of
   the clinic have lower patient care costs than those with more
   compensation related to productivity or based on salary. Salary
   compensation is strongly associated with higher costs. The use of
   physician profiles and clinical guidelines is associated with lower
   costs, but referral management systems have no such effect. The lower
   cost clinics are the smaller, multispecialty clinics.
   Conclusions. This study indicates that payment methods at both the
   medical group practice and physician levels influence the cost of care.
   However, the methods by which that influence is manifest is not dear.
   Although the organizational structure of clinics and their use of
   managed care programs appear to play a role, this influence is less than
   expected.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the effectiveness of free beta-hCG,
   pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, and nuchal translucency in a
   prospective first-trimester prenatal screening study for Down syndrome
   and trisomy 18.
   Methods: Risks were calculated for Down syndrome and trisomy 18 based on
   maternal age and biochemistry only (n = 10,251), nuchal translucency
   only (n = 5809), and the combination of nuchal translucency and
   biochemistry (n = 5809).
   Results: The study population included 50 Down syndrome and 20 trisomy
   18 cases. Nuchal translucency measurement was done on 33 Down syndrome
   and 13 trisomy 18 cases. Down syndrome screening using combined
   biochemistry and ultrasound resulted in a false-positive rate of 4.5\%
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 3.9\%, 5.2\%) and detection rate of
   87.5\% (95\% CI 47\%, 100\%) in patients under age 35 years. In older
   patients, the false-positive rate was 14.3\% (95\% CI 12.7\%, 15.8\%)
   and detection rate was 92\% (95\% CI 74\%, 99\%). For trisomy 18
   screening, the false-positive rate was 0.4\% (95\% CI 0.24\%, 0.69\%)
   and detection rate was 100\% (95\% CI 40\%, 100\%) in younger patients,
   whereas in older patients the false-positive rate was 1.4\% (95\% CI
   0.9\%, 2.0\%) and detection rate was 100\% (95\% CI 66\%, 100\%). Using
   modeling, at a fixed 5\% false-positive rate, the Down syndrome
   detection rate was 91\%. Conversely, at a fixed 70\% Down syndrome
   detection rate, the false-positive rate was 1.4\%.
   Conclusion: First-trimester screening for Down syndrome and trisomy 18
   is effective and offers substantial benefits to clinicians and patients.

Abstract = {{We have cloned cDNA sequences of both rat and mouse slow troponin T
   gene. These sequences share a high level of homology with each other and
   with the human slow troponin T gene although we were unable to detect an
   alternatively spliced exon present at 3' end of human slow troponin T
   cDNA in either mouse or rat cDNAs. Northern blot analysis detected a
   high level expression of slow troponin T in adult mouse Soleus with a
   lower level expression in mixed postnatal skeletal muscles. Unlike late
   fetal and postnatal skeletal muscles in which slow troponin T expression
   is restricted to slow muscle fibre rich regions only, in situ
   hybridisation analysis detected this isoform to be highly expressed in
   somitic myotome and all muscle masses at 10-14 days of gestation after
   which its expression was rapidly downregulated. The unexpected
   expression of slow troponin T mRNA in fetal heart was apparent by both
   northern blotting and in situ hybridisation analyses. Slow troponin T
   mRNA in fetal heart was first detected at 10 day in utero reaching
   maximum levels of expression at 12-15 days gestation. The slow troponin
   T in the heart was mainly expressed in the ventral ventricles until day
   15 after which low level expression was also observed in both atria.
   Slow troponin T mRNA in both atrium and ventricle was mainly expressed
   in outer wall of the myocardium although it was also expressed in
   interventricular septum. This study therefore shows that in addition to
   being a cell type specific marker during later fetal and postnatal
   skeletal muscle development, slow troponin T represented one of the
   major developmental isoforms expressed in embryonic and fetal skeletal
   muscle as well as in the cardiac muscle.}},

Abstract = {{Coronary heart disease mortality is four times higher in Lithuanian
   compared to Swedish middle-aged men. Using the same equipment (Acuson
   XP10 with 5 MHz linear transducer) and staff we compared the amount of
   atherosclerosis in carotid and femoral arteries in 100 randomly sampled
   50-year-old men in each of the cities Vilnius, Lithuania and Linkoping,
   Sweden. Atherosclerotic plaques were more abundant in Vilnius men
   compared to Linkoping men (53 versus 28\% in the common carotid artery,
   73 versus 37\% in the common femoral artery, P < 0.001 for both).
   Plaques were thicker and more extended in arteries of Vilnius men, and
   an ultrasound atherosclerosis score was higher in both carotid and
   femoral arteries (P < 0.001 for all). More Vilnius men had a maximal
   intima-media thickness of the common femoral artery above 1 mm (P <
   0.005). Stiffness in the common carotid artery was higher in Vilnius men
   (P < 0.001). In a linear regression model of the pooled material, after
   adjustment for city was made, smoking, systolic blood pressure, low
   density lipoprotein cholesterol and beta-carotene (inversely)
   significantly contributed to a high total ultrasound score (r(2) =
   0.32). These findings show that the higher coronary mortality noted in
   Lithuanian men goes together with a higher prevalence of early
   peripheral atherosclerosis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Two lichens and 12 green plants growing at a former arsenic roasting

   the tetramethylarsonium cation and four arsenoriboses) by HPLC-ICP-MS.
   Total arsenic concentrations were in the range of 0.27 mg As (kg dry
   mass)(-1) (Vaccinium vitis idaea) to 8.45 mg As (kg dry mass)(-1)
   (Equisetum pratense). Arsenic compounds were extracted with two
   different extractants {[}water or methanol/water (9:1)]. Extraction
   yields achieved with water {[}7\% (Alectoria ochroleuca) to 71\%
   (Equisetum pratense)] were higher than those with methanol/water (9:1)
   {[}4\% (Alectoria ochroleuca) to 22\% (Deschampsia cespitosa)]. The
   differences were caused mainly by better extraction of inorganic arsenic
   (green plants) and an arsenoribose (lichens) by water. Inorganic arsenic
   was detected in all extracts. Dimethylarsinic acid was identified in
   nine green plants. One of the lichens (Alectoria ochroleuca) contained
   traces of methylarsonic acid, and this compound was also detected in
   nine of the green plants. Arsenobetaine was a major arsenic compound in
   extracts of the lichens, but except for traces in the grass Deschampsia
   cespitosa, it was not detected in the green plants. In contrast to
   arsenobetaine, trimethylarsine oxide was found in all samples. The
   tetramethylarsonium cation was identified in the lichen Alectoria
   ochroleuca and in four green plants. With the exception of the needles
   of the tree Larix decidua the arsenoribose
   (2'R)-dimethyl{[}1-O-(2',3'-dihydroxypropyl)-5-deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranos-
   5-yl]- arsine oxide was identified at the low mu g kg(-1) level or as a
   trace in all plants investigated. In the lichens an unknown arsenic
   compound, which did not match any of the standard compounds available,
   was also detected. Arsenocholine and three of the arsenoriboses were not
   detected in the samples. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to the primary cell surface receptor CD4, CCR5 or another
   coreceptor is necessary for infections by human immunodeficiency virus
   type 1 (HIV-1), yet the mechanisms of coreceptor function and their
   stoichiometries in the infection pathway remain substantially unknown.
   To address these issues, we studied the effects of CCR5 concentrations
   on HIV-1 infections using wild-type CCRS and two attenuated mutant
   CCR5s, one with the mutation Y14N at a critical tyrosine sulfation site
   in the amino terminus and one with the mutation G163R in extracellular
   loop 2. The Y14N mutation converted a YYT sequence at positions 14 to 16
   to an NYT consensus site for N-linked glycosylation, and the mutant
   protein was shown to be glycosylated at that position. The relationships
   between HIV-1 infectivity values and CCRS concentrations took the form
   of sigmoidal (S-shaped) curves, which were dramatically altered in
   different ways by these mutations. Both mutations shifted the curves by
   factors of approximately 30- to 150-fold along the CCRS concentration
   axis, consistent with evidence that they reduce affinities of virus For
   the coreceptor. In addition, the Y14N mutation specifically reduced the
   maximum efficiencies of infection that could be obtained at saturating
   CCR5 concentrations, The sigmoidal curves For all R5 HIV-1 isolates were
   quantitatively consistent with a simple mathematical model, implying
   that CCR5s reversibly associate with cell surface HIV-1 in a
   concentration-dependent manner, that approximately four to six CCR5s
   assemble around the virus to form a complex needed for infection, and
   that both mutations inhibit assembly of this complex but only the Y14N
   mutation also significantly reduces its ability to successfully mediate
   HIV-1 infections. Although several alternative models would be
   compatible with our data, a common feature of these alternatives is the
   cooperation of multiple CCR5s in the HIV-1 infection pathway. This
   cooperativity will need to be considered in future studies to address in
   detail the mechanism of CCR5-mediated HIV-1 membrane fusion.}},

Abstract = {{The CYP17 gene encodes an enzyme involved in several critical steps of
   steroidogenesis. The promoter region of the CYP17 displays a
   single-nucleotide polymorphism, which is suspected to modulate the
   expression of the gene and thus may contribute in the interindividual
   variations of hormonal background. In agreement with this functional
   hypothesis, the MspA1+ allele (designated as A2) of the CYP17 was shown
   to render an increased risk of breast cancer (BC). However, the latter
   observation was disputed by a series of negative reports. Here, we
   re-evaluated the role of CYP17 MspA1 polymorphism in the BC
   susceptibility, using a non-traditional design of a case-control study.
   In addition to randomly selected 183 BC patients and 107 female
   middle-aged donors, we examined the groups with apparently extreme
   characteristics of either BC risk or BC resistance, namely the 57
   bilateral breast cancer (biBC) patients and 75 elderly (greater than or
   equal to 75 years old) tumor-free women. Neither BC nor biBC patients
   showed increased prevalence of `unfavorable' A2 allele as compared with
   the non-affected cohorts. Moreover, the A2 variant was not significantly
   associated with the tumor size, nodal involvement and menopausal status
   in the patients either with the monolateral or bilateral disease. Thus,
   our data argue against the earlier reported role of the CYP17 in BC
   predisposition and progression. In addition, usual distribution of the
   CYP17 alleles in the elderly group indicates a neutral effect of this
   polymorphism on the longevity in females. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Title = {{Optimal L(1)-L(2) primary tone level separation remains independent of
   test frequency in humans}},

Year = {{2000}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies described a systematic asymmetry of the level of the
   2f(1)-f(2) distortion product otoacoustic emission (DP) in the space of
   the primary tones levels L(1) and L(2) in normal-hearing humans. Optimal
   primary tone level separations L(1)-L(2), which result in maximum DP
   levels, were close to L(1) = L(2) at high levels, but continuously
   increased with decreasing stimulus level towards L(1) > L(2) (Gaskill
   and Brown, 1990, J. Acoust. Sec. Am. 88, 821-839). At these optimal
   L(1)-L(2), however, not only DP levels in normal hearing were maximal,
   but also trauma-induced DP reductions. A linear equation that
   approximates optimal L(1)-L(2) level separations thus was suggested to
   be optimum for use in clinical applications (Whitehead et al., 1995, J.
   Acoust. Sec. Am. 97, 2359-2377). It was the aim of this study to extend
   the generality of optimal L(1)-L(2) separations to the typical human
   test frequency range for f(2) frequencies between 1 and 8 kHz. DPs were
   measured in 22 normal-hearing human ears at 61 primary tone level
   combinations, with L(2) between 5 and 65 dB SPL and L(1) between 30 and
   70 dB SPL (f(2)/f(1) = 1.2). It was found that the systematic dependence
   of the maximum DP level on the L(1)-L(2) separation is independent on
   frequency. Optimal L(1)-L(2) level separations may well be approximated
   by a linear equation L(1) = a L(2)+(1-a) b (after Whitehead et al.,
   1995) with parameters a = 0.4 and b = 70 dB SPL at f(2) frequencies
   between 1 and 8 kHz and L(2) levels between 20 and 65 dB SPL. Below L(2)
   = 20 dB SPL, the optimal L(1) was found to be almost constant. Following
   previous notions (Gaskill and Brown, 1990), an analysis of basilar
   membrane response data in experimental animals (after Ruggero and Rich,
   1991, Hear. Res. 51, 215-230) is further presented that relates optimal
   L(1)-L(2) separations to frequency-selective compression of the basilar
   membrane. Based on the assumption that optimal conditions for the DP
   generation are equal primary tone responses at the f(2) place, a linear
   increase of the optimal L(1)-L(2) level separation is graphically
   demonstrated, similar to our results in human ears. (C) 2000 Published

Abstract = {{The main goal of this paper is to find a way to minimize the number of
   steps in the topology optimization procedure. The material description
   of the topology optimization is employed. The technique presented is
   effective for the 0/1 mass distribution in the entire structure.
   According to the proposed procedure, a systematic adjustment at every
   optimization step is made whereby the optimum topology can be obtained
   in very few steps. The procedure involving the above adjustment cuts off
   the material property values that are below a certain fixed threshold
   value. The material property to which this procedure applies is the
   density of the material. Ultimately, in the n-th optimization step only
   a few design points have the material property in the interval between
   zero and one. These material property values are very close to 1. In the
   next (n + 1) step only the 0/1 distribution is performed, but the total
   mass is usually a little less than the one assumed initially. The
   optimum topology of the structure is between the above two steps. The
   numerical implementation of the problem is presented using FEM for 2D
   examples, where the considered continuum domain and the FE mesh for this
   domain are fixed during the optimization, which means that the same
   algorithm and the same mesh are valid from the beginning to the end.}},

Abstract = {{Boron delta layers in silicon, grown by molecular beam epitaxy and
   characterized by the secondary ion mass spectrometry, have been employed
   to investigate the migration of silicon self-interstitials during
   irradiation with MeV protons in the 500-850 degreesC temperature range.
   After growth, the samples were thinned from the backside to a thickness
   that made them transparent for the proton energies used. As a result,
   the generation rate of point defects can be considered as essentially
   uniform throughout the samples. However: the evolution of the boron
   profiles is almost identical to that observed after injection of
   self-interstitials caused by thermal oxidation of the samples at
   elevated temperature. This strongly indicates that the surface acts as a
   reflective boundary for the migrating self-interstitials or/ and an
   efficient sink for mobile vacancies. Furthermore, higher value of
   interstitial supersaturation in the near-surface region in
   proton-irradiated samples is consistent with experimentally detected
   depth dependence for immobile fraction in boron clusters. Then,
   activation energy of boron mobilization, (0.9 +/- 0.4) eV, was
   attributed to the dissociation of boron clusters. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Journal = {{PROTEIN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{The biotin holoenzyme synthetases (BHS) are essential enzymes in all
   organisms that catalyze post-translational linkage of biotin to
   biotin-dependent carboxylases. The primary sequences of a large number
   of these enzymes are now available and homologies are found among all.
   The glycine-rich sequence, GRGRXG, constitutes one of the homologous
   regions in these enzymes and, based on its similarity to sequences found
   in a number of mononucleotide binding enzymes, has been proposed to
   function in ATP binding in the BHSs. In the Escherichia coli enzyme, the
   only member of the family for which a three-dimensional structure has
   been determined, the conserved sequence is found in a partially
   disordered surface loop. Mutations in the sequence have previously been
   isolated and characterized in vivo. In this work these single-site
   mutants, G115S, R118G, and R119W, of the E. coli BHS have been purified
   and biochemically characterized with respect to binding of small
   molecule substrates and the intermediate in the biotinylation reaction.
   Results of this characterization indicate that, rather than functioning
   in ATP binding, this glycine-rich sequence is required for binding the
   substrate biotin and the intermediate in the biotinylation reaction,
   biotinyl-5'-AMP. These results are of general significance for
   understanding structure-function relationships in biotin holoenzyme
   synthetases.}},

   cleavage and the rate of the reaction is not dependent on concentration

   presumed to be A(AL)1. In second step, intramolecular acylation of the

Abstract = {{Background: We have previously shown increased expression of the CD4(+)
   cell chemoattractant IL-16 in bronchial mucosa of patients with asthma,
   We investigated the effects of allergen challenge on airway IL-16
   expression,
   Methods: We investigated the expression of IL-16 immunoreactivity in
   bronchial biopsy samples obtained from atopic asthmatic subjects (n =
   19) and normal subjects (n = 6) 24 hours after segmental allergen
   challenge. Control biopsy samples were obtained either at baseline or
   after diluent challenge. IL-16 expression was correlated to numbers of
   CD4(+) cells, CD25(+) cells, and activated eosinophils. IL-16
   bioactivity was assessed in bronchoalveolar fluid obtained from patients
   with asthma.
   Results: IL-16 expression was higher in control biopsy specimens
   obtained from subjects with asthma compared with normal subjects (P <
   .05). In patients with asthma, numbers of IL-16 immunoreactive cells
   were significantly higher in biopsy specimens obtained after allergen
   challenge compared with control biopsy specimens (P < .001). Allergen
   provocation was associated with release of IL-16 in bronchoalveolar
   fluid in patients with asthma, In normal subjects, there was no
   difference in the number of IL-16-immunoreactive cells in biopsy
   specimens obtained after allergen challenge compared with biopsy
   specimens obtained after diluent challenge. Allergen challenge was
   associated with an increase in the numbers of EG2(+) eosinophils in
   patients with asthma but not in normal subjects. IL-16 expression
   correlated with the numbers of CD4+ cells and CD25+ cells after allergen
   challenge in asthmatic subjects with a provocative concentration
   required to decrease the FEV1 by 20\% of its baseline value (PC20FEV1) <
   4 mg/mL. IL-16-immunoreactive tells were identified mainly as T cells
   and eosinophils in asthmatic subjects after allergen challenge.
   Conclusion: Endobronchial allergen provocation in atopic asthmatic
   patients resulted in increased airway expression of IL-16 and release of
   bioactive IL-16 in airways. IL-16 may contribute to the immunoregulation
   of the inflammatory infiltrate in the airways in response to antigen.}},

Abstract = {{The KE family is a large three-generation pedigree in which half the
   members are affected with a severe speech and language disorder that is
   transmitted as an autosomal dominant monogenic trait. In previously
   published work, we localized the gene responsible (SPCH1) to a 5.6-cM
   region of 7q31 between D7S2459 and D7S643. In the present study, we have
   employed bioinformatic analyses to assemble a derailed BAC-/PAC-based
   sequence map of this interval, containing 152 sequence tagged sites
   (STSs), 20 known genes, and >7.75 Mb of completed genomic sequence. We
   screened the affected chromosome 7 from the KE family with 120 of these
   STSs (average spacing <100 kb), but we did not detect any evidence of a
   microdeletion. Novel polymorphic markers were generated from the
   sequence and were used to further localize critical recombination
   breakpoints in the KE family. This allowed refinement of the SPCH1
   interval to a region between new markers 013A and 330B, containing
   similar to 6.1 Mb of completed sequence. In addition, we have studied
   two unrelated patients with a similar speech and language disorder, who
   have de novo translocations involving 7q31. Fluorescence in situ
   hybridization analyses with BACs/PACs from the sequence map localized
   the t(5;7)(q22;q31.2) breakpoint in the first patient (CS) to a single
   clone within the newly refined SPCH1 interval. This clone contains the
   CAGH44 gene, which encodes a brain-expressed protein containing a large
   polyglutamine stretch. However, we found that the t(2;7)(p23;q31.3)
   breakpoint in the second patient (BRD) resides within a BAC clone
   mapping >3.7 Mb distal to this, outside the current SPCH1 critical
   interval. Finally, we investigated the CAGH44 gene in affected
   individuals of the KE family, but we found no mutations in the currently
   known coding sequence. These studies represent further steps toward the
   isolation of the first gene to be implicated in the development of
   speech and language.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims: Significant changes in hepatic haemodynamics occur
   after major hepatectomy, but the pathogenesis of this phenomenon is
   unclear. This study investigates the serum profile of prostaglandin and
   nitric oxide in the hepatic and systemic circulation before and after
   hepatectomy and the temporal relationship of these to changes in the
   hepatic blood flow.
   Methods: Blood samples were collected from the internal jugular, portal
   and hepatic veins of six Yorkshire pigs (17-25 kg) before, immediately
   after and 48 h after partial hepatectomy.
   Results: Serum levels of prostacyclin I-2 (PGI(2)) and prostaglandin E-2
   (PGE(2)) from the systemic circulation, the portal circulation and from
   the hepatic veins were found to differ considerably even before
   hepatectomy. After the hepatectomy was performed, there was a
   significant rise in PGI(2) levels in the systemic circulation (P =
   0.027). Hepatic blood flow and cardiac output were measured before
   hepatectomy, 24 and 48h after hepatectomy in another six pigs. A
   significant increase in hepatic blood flow (P = 0.029) occurred after
   the hepatectomy and this was accompanied by a concomitant increase in
   the cardiac output (P = 0.042). The increase in PGI(2) concentration in
   the systemic circulation after hepatectomy appears to accompany the
   development of hyperdynamic hepatic and systemic circulations. No
   significant change was found in circulating PGE(2) levels in the
   systemic, portal and hepatic veins at the three collection intervals
   (i.e. pre, post and 48 h after hepatectomy). The PGE(2) levels in the
   hepatic vein, however, were significantly higher from than in the portal
   vein (P = 0.028). No significant changes were observed in the level of
   nitric oxide.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates an increase in the total hepatic
   blood flow after hepatectomy together with a threefold increase in
   prostacyclin in the systemic circulation. The liver was identified as
   the main source of circulatory prostaglandin. (C) 2000 Blackwell Science

Abstract = {{It has been postulated that Langerhans cells (LC) provide tolerogenic
   signals in the local impairment of cutaneous immune functions and
   antigen-specific tolerance induced by UV radiation. Studies in vitro and
   ex vivo have indicated that UV radiation may down-regulate the
   expression of costimulatory molecules on LC, leading to reduced
   antigen-presenting function. In contrast, we recently observed an
   up-regulatory stage in the number of human epidermal LC with induced
   expression of B7 costimulatory molecules 12-24 h after solar-simulating
   UV radiation (SSR) in vivo. To examine the apparent discrepancy between
   the observed human LC responses in vitro, ex vivo and in vitro, we
   compared the three protocols in a parallel fashion. The intact skin as
   well as skin explants and epidermal cell suspensions from the same
   individuals were irradiated with a single erythematogenic dose of SSR.
   The expression of cell surface markers in the epidermal cells was
   analysed with flow cytometry 24 h later. The number of CD1a(+)/HLA-DR+
   LC increased post-SSR in vitro by a factor of 2.8+/-0.4, whereas in
   irradiated skin explants es vivo or in cell suspensions in vitro,
   reduced numbers were seen. HLA-DR expression intensities were found to
   have increased on DR+ and CD1a(+)/DR+ cells in vivo. Similarly, SSR
   induced B7-2 (CD86) expression in CD1a(+) cells significantly in vivo
   (P=0.031) but reduced the expression Ex vivo or in vitro. We conclude
   that the early up-regulatory stage of human LC number and membrane
   markers, recorded at 24 h after a single exposure to SSR, is exclusively
   an in vivo phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Porfiromycin (PM), a bioreductive alkylating agent, is currently under
   development for the treatment of head and neck cancers as an adjunct to
   radiation therapy in phase III clinical trials. After i.v.
   administration of a single dose of PM to patients at 40 mg/m(2), urinary
   metabolites were isolated by HPLC and identified by atmospheric pressure
   chemical ionization mass spectrometry. In dogs, {[}methyl-H-3]PM was
   administered i.v. to three Beagle dogs at a single dose of 2 mg/kg.
   Urinary excretion of radioactivity and PM at different times was
   determined by liquid scintillation counting and by HPLC, respectively.
   An average of 48.0\% of total radioactivity given to the dogs was
   cumulatively excreted in urine over a period of 7 days. Unchanged parent
   drug excreted in urine accounted for 10.8\% of the administered dose
   over the same period of time. The results indicated that the majority of
   excreted dose in dog urine was in the form of metabolites. Three phase I
   and four phase II metabolites of PM were identified in human and dog
   urine. The phase I metabolites are 2-methylamino-7-aminomitosene,
   1,2-cis and 1,2-trans-1-hydroxy-2-methylamino-7-aminomitosenes. The
   phase II metabolites are a pair of isomeric N-acetylcysteine
   S-conjugates and a pair of isomeric cysteine S-conjugates of mitosenes
   at the C-1 and C-10 positions. Most of the identified metabolites were
   confirmed by comparison with synthetic reference standards using HPLC
   and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The identification
   of mercapturic acids and cysteine S-conjugates in urine indicates that
   the metabolism of PM may be through GSH conjugation.}},

Abstract = {{Increased mobilization of As under anaerobic conditions is of great
   concern in As contaminated soils and sediments. The identification of
   important release mechanisms may assist in designing safe and effective
   remediation strategies, In this study we investigated the effect of
   microbial reduction of aqueous arsenate (As(V)) on the solubilization of
   As(V) sorbed to ferrihydrite, in the absence of reductive dissolution of
   the Fe(III)-oxide solid phase. The addition of 0.1, 1.0, and 5.0 mM
   As(V) to serum bottles containing 10 mmol L-1 Fe(III) as ferrihydrite
   resulted in the sorption of 98, 75, and 20\% of the applied As(V),
   respectively. inoculation with an As(V) reducing, glucose fermenting
   microorganism (CN8) was followed by complete reduction of aqueous As(V)
   to As(III) at nontoxic As concentrations (up to 1.0 mM), but no
   reduction or dissolution of the Fe(III) solid phase was observed,
   Despite rapid reduction of aqueous As(V) to As(III), sorbed phase As
   remained primarily as As(V), and desorption of As(V) was too slow to
   cause a significant increase in aqueous As concentration over the 24-day
   experiment, Our study suggests that the reduction of aqueous As(V) may
   play a relatively minor role in the solubilization of As(V) sorbed to Fe
   (hydr)oxide. Arsenic release from contaminated soils and sediments may
   proceed considerably faster under conditions favoring dissimilatory
   Fe(III) reduction leading to the dissolution of sorbing phases.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that large amounts of leukocytes colonize the uterus, and
   that these leukocytes can produce considerable quantities of hydrogen
   peroxide (H2O2) and other reactive oxygen species that are toxic to
   sperm. It has been shown recently that oviductal fluid has a catalase
   that helps to maintain sperm motility, Therefore, the current experiment
   was performed to determine if a similar mechanism of protection exists
   against peroxides within uterine cells. Sperm motility and velocity were
   recorded after a 6h incubation in 1) conditioned media in the presence
   of endometrial cells, 2) conditioned media without endometrial cells, 3)
   control media (48h without cells) over endometrial cells, or 4) control
   media alone. All these treatments were performed in the presence or
   absence of added catalase. Conditioned media, endometrial cells and
   catalase had a significant positive effect on the maintenance of sperm
   motility and velocity. Addition of anticatalase antibodies did not
   neutralize the beneficial effect of the conditioned media. However, the
   concentrations of aromatic amino acids, known substrates for sperm amino
   acid oxidase, were significantly lower in uterine conditioned media as
   compared to control medium. This reduction of aromatic amino acids was
   in correlation with reduced H2O2 production by sperm as estimated by
   chemiluminescence. These results suggest that epithelial and stromal
   uterine cells do not maintain sperm motility by secreting catalase in
   the conditioned media, but rather by reducing the levels of aromatic
   amino acids and thus of peroxides generated in the presence of
   spermatozoa. (C) 2000 by Elsevier Science Inc.}},

   not supremacy more accurately associated with the structures of
   relations that set the terms for - or are constitutive of - a domain of
   social existence (bodies of law or webs of codes)? This social
   sovereignty offers us a way to understand not only how both state and
   nonstate actors can together he central to the governance of social
   domains, but also how communities can fashion sovereign `societies' as
   opposed to states. The case of globalized financial markets is explored
   as a pointed example of a transboundary form of social sovereignty.}},

Abstract = {{The liver is an essential organ that produces several serum proteins,
   stores vital nutrients, and detoxifies many carcinogenic and xenobiotic
   compounds. Various growth factors positively regulate liver growth, but
   only a few negative regulators are known. Among the latter are the
   transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) super-family members TGF-beta
   1 and activin A. To study the function of novel activin family members,
   we have cloned and generated mice deficient in the activin beta C and
   beta E genes. Expression analyses demonstrated that these novel genes
   are liver specific in adult mice. Here, we show by RNase protection that
   activin beta C transcripts are present in the liver beginning at
   embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) whereas activin beta E expression is detected
   starting from E17.5. Gene targeting in embryonic stem cells was used to
   generate mice with null mutations in either the individual activin beta
   C and beta E genes or both genes, In contrast to the structurally
   related activin beta A and beta B subunits, which are necessary for
   embryonic development and pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone
   homeostasis, mice deficient in activin beta C and beta F were viable,
   survived to adulthood, and demonstrated no reproductive abnormalities.
   Although activin beta C and beta E mRNAs are abundantly expressed in the
   liver of wild-type mice, the single and double mutants did not show any
   defects in liver development and function. Furthermore, in the
   homozygous mutant mice, liver regeneration after >70\% partial
   hepatectomy was comparable to that in wild-type mice. Our results
   suggest that activin beta C and beta E are not essential for either
   embryonic development or liver function.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental cheeses inoculated with Debaryomyces hansenii and
   Brevibacterium linens were ripened for 76 d under aseptic conditions.
   Triplicate cheese-making trials were similar as a result of efficient
   control of the atmosphere. In all trials, D. hansenii grew rapidly
   during the first 2 d and then slowed, but growth remained exponential
   until d 10 (generation time around 70 h). Total cell counts were higher
   than the number of viable cells, and after 10 d they remained around 3 x
   10(9) yeast/g of DM. This difference resulted from the nonviability of a
   fraction of D. hansenii. After d 15, the pH of the rind was close to 7,
   and B. linens grew exponentially until d 25 (generation time around 70
   h). The growth rate subsequently decreased but remained exponential
   (generation time around 21 d). Cell counts of D. hansenii and B. linens
   were correlated with the environmental technical conditions. Total D.
   hansenii counts were also correlated with total B. linens counts. Viable
   B. linens counts were related to rind lactate, and total counts depended
   on rind pH, internal lactate, and D. hansenii viable counts. The
   internal pH of the cheese depended on lactate concentrations, whereas
   surface pH was related to internal lactose, temperature, and relative
   humidity. These results suggest a determining role of the diffusion of
   the carbon sources in the ripening of smear soft cheese.}},

Abstract = {{Primary carbonates in peridotite xenoliths from the East African Rift in
   northeastern Tanzania occur as intergranular patches with accessory
   minerals (olivine and spinel), as patches with accessory magmatic
   minerals (nepheline), and as round monomineralic inclusions in primary
   olivine grains. All are characterized by calcitic compositions (Ca/Ca +
   Mg + Fe from 0.83 to 0.99), extremely low SiO2 + Al2O3 + Na2O + K2O, low
   trace element abundance {[}total rare-earth element (REE) abundance <25
   ppm], uniform extinction, and lack of reaction textures with the host
   xenolith. Calculated Fe-Mg exchange coefficients between carbonate and
   primary olivine indicate disequilibrium in most samples. Combined with
   the lack of significant reaction textures, this suggests that the
   carbonates were introduced shortly before or during eruption of the host
   magma. A global compilation of electron microprobe analyses of
   mantle-derived carbonates (in xenoliths, xenocrysts, and megacrysts)
   reveals compositional clusters near end member calcite, end member
   magnesite, and stoichiometric dolomite. Eutectic liquid compositions an
   less common, suggesting that many carbonate inclusions reported
   worldwide may be crystalline precipitates. Likewise, the calcites in
   this study are not interpreted to represent quenched carbonatitic melts,
   but are interpreted instead to be crystalline cumulates from such melts.
   These inferences art: consistent with recent experiments, which show
   that carbonatitic melts cannot become more calcitic than CaCO(3)similar
   to 80 wt\%. Low trace element abundance may be a diagnostic feature of
   cumulate carbonate, and in combination with petrography and major
   element composition, serve to distinguish it from quenched carbonated
   liquid.}},

Abstract = {{Using linear combinations of vectors in composition space, we formulate
   a lever rule for reactive distillation columns. This lever rule
   facilitates the proposal of alternative sequences of reactive
   distillation systems by allowing us to visualize how material balance
   constraints move as a Function of reaction ``turnover{''}. our approach
   uses the concept of a pseudo-feed, which is the composition that results
   from mixing column distillate and bottom products. Our lever rule for
   reactive distillation columns uses linear combinations of so-called
   reaction difference points, stoichiometric coefficient vectors of
   reactants and products, and composition vectors. When a reaction causes
   no change in the total number of moles, the reaction difference point
   moves to infinity (Hauan, Omtveit \& Lien (1996). Paper 5f, A.I.Ch.E.

   Engineering Science, 55(6), 1053-1075, Hauan, Ciric, Westerberg \& Lien

   out all geometric constructions entirely within a finite composition
   domain by decomposing the total stoichiometric coefficient vector into
   product and reactant stoichiometric coefficient vectors. In this case
   the lever rule compares distances along two parallel vectors. For an
   infinite extractive difference point (Westerberg \& Wahnschafft (1996).
   Advances in Chemical Engineering, 23, 63-170) we can confine all
   geometric manipulations when proposing alternative reactive distillation
   processes to a finite composition domain by combining the vectors in a
   different order. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, various surface cleaning techniques for the removal of

   electron spectroscopy (AES) and secondary mass ion spectroscopy were
   used to monitor the presence of surface C and O, and atomic force
   microscopy was used to monitor surface roughness. AES analysis showed
   that ex situ ultraviolet/ozone (UV/O-3) and wet chemical treatments
   based on HF and HCl were very effective in removing surface C and
   reducing the native oxide on both AIN and GaN, After H-2 and N-2 plasma
   treatments in ultrahigh vacuum at temperatures of 750 and 900 degrees C,
   clean GaN surfaces could br achieved with in the detection limits of
   AES. An oxygen-free AW surface could not be obtained within the
   detection limits of AES. SIMS analysis showed that concentrations of
   surface C and O up to 3 x 10(20) and 2 x 10(22) cm(-3), respectively,
   still exists on plasma-treated GaN. The results of this study indicate
   that ex situ UV/O-3 followed by H-2/N-2 plasma treatment is highly
   effective in reducing the C and O contamination at the GaN surface, bur
   that further in situ methods are needed to obtain clean GaN and AlN

   and 30 parts per thousand (hypertonic), for 2 weeks. The density of MR
   cells, protein content, activity, and localization of the sodium pump
   were examined. There was no significant difference in serum osmolarity

   amounts of protein and activity of Na,K-ATPase were elevated in fish
   from SW with the highest salinity. MR cells observed by scanning

   these deep-hole MR cells increased significantly in fish adapted to
   hypertonic SW. Larger and more numerous deep-hole MR cells of euryhaline

Abstract = {{Asynchronous distributed decision-making (ADDM) systems constitute a
   special class of distributed problems and are characterized as large,
   complex systems wherein the principal elements are the geographically
   dispersed entities that communicate among themselves, asynchronously,
   through message passing and are permitted autonomy in local decision
   making. Such systems generally offer significant advantages over the
   traditional, centralized algorithms in the form of concurrency,
   scalability, high throughput, efficiency, low vulnerability to
   catastrophic failures, and robustness. A fundamental property of ADDM
   systems is stability that refers to their behavior under representative
   perturbations to their operating environments, given that such systems
   are intended to be real, complex, and to some extent, mission-critical,
   and are subject to unexpected changes in their operating conditions.
   This paper introduces the concept of stability in ADDM systems and
   proposes an intuitive yet practical and usable definition that is
   inspired by those used in control systems and physics. An ADDM system is
   defined as a stable system if it returns to a steady state in finite
   time, following perturbation, provided that it is initiated in a steady
   state. Equilibrium or steady state is defined through placing bounds on
   the measured error in the system. Where the final steady state is
   equivalent to the initial one, a system is referred to as strongly
   stable, If the final steady state is potentially worse then the initial
   one, a system is deemed marginally stable. When a system fails to return
   to steady state following the perturbation, it is unstable. The
   perturbations are classified as either changes in the input pattern or
   changes in one or more environmental characteristics of the system, such
   as hardware failures. For a given ADDM system, the definitions are based
   on the performance indices that must be judiciously identified by the
   system architect and are likely to be unique. To facilitate the
   understanding of stability in representative real-world systems, this
   paper reports the analysis of two basic manifestations of ADDM systems
   that have been reported in the literature: 1) a decentralized military
   command and control problem, MEAD and 2) a novel distributed algorithm
   with soft reservation for efficient scheduling and congestion mitigation
   in railway networks, RYNSORD, Stability analysis of MFAD and RYNSORD
   yields key stable and unstable conditions. A system determined to be
   stable provides the reassurance that the system will perform well under
   adverse conditions. In contrast, a system deemed unstable reflects the
   need to address key weaknesses in the system design. Thus, stability
   analysis is a necessary and critical step in the development of any ADDM
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Low-level replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in cultured
   lymphoblastoid cells inoculated with H77 serum inoculum led to the
   appearance of new virus variants containing identical substitutions at
   three sites within the viral 5' nontranslated RNA (5'NTR): G(107)-->A,
   C-204-->A, and G(243)-->A (N, Nakajima, hi. Hijikata, II, Yoshikura, and
   Y, K, Shimizu, J, Virol, 70:3325-3329, 1996), These results suggest that
   virus with this 5'NTR sequence may have a greater capacity for
   replication in such cells, possibly due to more efficient capindependent
   translation, since these nucleotide substitutions reside within the
   viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES), To test this hypothesis, we
   examined the translation of dicistronic RNAs containing upstream and
   downstream reporter sequences (Renilla and firefly luciferases,
   respectively) separated by IRES sequences containing different
   combinations of these substitutions, The activity of the IRES was
   assessed by determining the relative firefly and Renilla luciferase
   activities expressed in transfected cells. Compared with the IRES
   present in the dominant H77 quasispecies, an IRES containing all three
   nucleotide substitutions had significantly greater translational
   activity in three of five human lymphoblastoid cell lines (Raji, Bjab,
   and Molt4 but not Jurkat or HPBMa10-2 cells). In contrast, these
   substitutions did not enhance IRES activity in cell lines derived from
   monocytes or granulocytes (HL-60, KG-1, or THP-1) or hepatocytes (Huh-7)
   or in cell-free translation assays carried out with rabbit reticulocyte
   lysates, Each of the three substitutions was required for maximally
   increased translational activity in the lymphoblastoid cells. The 2- to
   2.5-fold increase in translation observed with the modified IRES
   sequence may facilitate the replication of HCV: possibly accounting for
   differences in quasispecies variants recovered from liver tissue and
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the same patient.}},

Abstract = {{With the aim of exploring relationships between the chemical structure
   and the physico-chemical properties of amphiphilic beta-cyclodextrin, a
   reappraisal of the obtaining of pure heptakis
   (2,3-di-O-hexanoyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CDC6) was undertaken. In
   this paper the chemical characterization of the newly synthesized
   beta-CDC6 and its ability to form mixed structures with
   dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) are reported. Miscibility of the
   two amphiphiles is examined: (i) in monolayers formed at the air-water
   interface by analyzing the surface pressure-area isotherms; and (ii) in
   fully hydrated mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and
   X-ray diffraction at small and wide angles. Results demonstrate that the
   beta-cyclodextrin derivative is partially miscible to the phospholipid:
   intimate mixing occurs at beta-CDC6 molar ratios smaller than 7-15
   mol\%, depending on the dimensional scale considered, while beyond these
   compositions phase separation is observed. At the air-water interface,
   the miscibility region of the two compounds shows non-ideal behavior
   characterized by the non-additivity of the molecular areas in the mixed
   monolayers. At the three-dimension level, the formation of a
   beta-CDC6/DMPC mixed lamellar phase occurs except at beta-CDC6 molar
   ratios close to 5 mol\% at which a highly ordered structure is depicted
   below the solid-to-liquid state transition of the DMPC hydrocarbon
   chains. At beta-CDC6 contents higher than 7 mol\%, the mixed assemblies
   coexist with excess amphiphilic cyclodextrin which then forms a
   separated hexagonal structure. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {{Multipoint videoconference service allows multiple and far-away
   conferees to conduct a meeting without leaving their offices.
   Variable-bit-rate video compression is attractive for
   video-conferencing, because it can provide a constant image quality and
   it can effectively utilize the communication bandwidth via statistical
   multiplexing. When some conferences temporarily generate heavy traffic
   to a link, congestion occurs and some video packets have to be
   discarded. Since the packets of different conferences are multicast to
   different number of conferees, the loss of different packet will affect
   different number of people. If we discard the packets sent to the
   smallest number of conferees, we can minimize the number of affected
   conferees to give the best mean quality of service, but the conference
   having a smaller number of conferees will suffer from a poorer quality
   of service. Therefore, we must consider both the mean quality of service
   and fairness in congestion control. In this paper, we propose a
   congestion-control strategy for multipoint videoconferencing. This
   strategy has a control parameter which we can tune to make a tradeoff
   between the mean quality of service and fairness. In addition, the
   strategy only involves some simple arithmetic and logic operations, and
   hence, it can be executed quickly for real-time congestion control.}},

Abstract = {{Shifting slash-and-burn agriculture is likely one of the main causes of
   forest degradation in southern Belize. Although many development
   projects have attempted to reduce the impacts of agriculture on the
   tropical rainforest, the situation is still a cause for concern. A study
   of the farming system of the San Jose Maya community was therefore
   carried out to examine agricultural production in its social, cultural,
   economic, and political context. Results demonstrate that agricultural
   production contributes to forest degradation because of the limited
   availability of agricultural land, the low level of investment in
   agricultural production, the land tenure system, limited marketing
   opportunities, and the exclusion of Mayas from the country's political
   and economic domains. Agroforestry could, however, offer a partial
   solution to the problem of forest degradation. Three types of
   traditional agroforestry systems are practised in San Jose: the milpa (a
   slash-and-burn agriculture system), cacao (Theobroma cacao) cultivation
   under shade trees, and the homegarden. These traditional agroforestry
   systems almost entirely meet a family's needs for food and wood, and
   generate at least 62\% of family income. Improving the productivity of
   these systems could help to reduce pressure on the forest in southern
   Belize.}},

Abstract = {{Systematic K-Ar Dating has been yielded for Pliocene-Recent volcanic
   eruptions in the Tengchong volcano area, mainly for latest eruptions of
   Heikongshan, Dayingshan and Maanshan craters. After distignishing
   plagioclase-phenocryst and olivine-phenocryst with excess argon from
   samples, a series age of the matrix of volcanic rocks has been obtained.
   From time-space exchanges and distribution, the activities of the
   Tengchong volcano could be divided into three stages. The first stage
   developed in the late Pliocene, when the volcanic eruptions occurred in
   southeastern and northwestern ends of the Tengchong volcano area. The
   second stage experienced in the early Pleistocene suggests that the
   volcanic activities were migrated and transferred to central areas of
   the basin. At this stage, volcanic scale and distribution were largest
   compared with that in other stages. The third stage occurred during the
   early Pleistocene-Holocene. During the late of Early Pleistocene-Middle
   Pleistocene, volcanic scales were decreased, and mainly distributed on a
   NS-trending belt in the center of the Tengchong basin. Since late
   Pleistocene, the volcanic activities have been focused on Heikongshan,
   Dayingshan, and Maanshan areas. There was volcanic activity in Maanshan
   area in the Holocene. The third volcanic stage is characterized as from
   central-northern to southern parts, it gets younger and younger. This
   means that the volcanic activities are transferred from north to south.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To assess the difference in costs of home-based versus
   clinic-based physiotherapy (PT) for patients with rheumatoid arthritis
   (RA) from a societal perspective.
   Methods. A cost analysis was performed using statistical and financial
   information provided by The Arthritis Society, Ontario Division, from
   April 1, 1997 to March 30, 1998. Cost estimates included treatment costs
   and costs borne by patients. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to
   examine the effect of altering the valuation of treatment time and
   patient employment status.
   Results. Total costs per case were \$210.87 for the home setting, and
   \$183.87 for the clinic setting when patients were employed. Sensitivity
   analysis did not change the trend of the results. The estimated start-up
   costs for an arthritis clinic were between \$302.90 and \$652.40. From
   the perspective of the health care system, these costs would be
   recovered after serving 4 to 8 RA patients at a clinic.
   Conclusion. The findings suggest that ambulatory PT care is less costly
   than home-based services for people with RA based on The Arthritis
   Society model. Further studies should be conducted to examine the
   effectiveness and the possible adverse consequences of alternative
   settings for service delivery.}},

   eggs did not form chromosomes like the female pronucleus, but became a
   dense chromatin body, which did not participate in karyokinesis. At
   completion of cytokinesis of the first cleavage, the UV-irradiated sperm

Abstract = {{The wall-bounded sheer flow and the plane Poiseuille channel flow of
   monodisperse suspensions of liquid drops are considered by theory and
   numerical simulation. First, the motion of an individual drop in
   infinite or semi-infinite shear flow is discussed in the limit of small
   volume fractions. An expression for the flux of the drops normal to the
   streamlines of the unperturbed flow is derived in terms of (a) the
   migration velocity of the drop away from the wall, and (b) the net
   displacement of a drop's center after interception with another drop. In
   the case of two-dimensional infinite shear flow, in the limit of
   infinite dilution, and in the context of Stokes flow, the self- and
   gradient-diffusivity are found to diverge, and this underlines the
   importance of fluid inertia and the necessity to perform renormalization
   by requiring global constraints, Numerical simulations of pairwise drop
   interceptions in semi-infinite shear flow above a plane wall reveal that
   the capillary number, expressing the drop deformability, and the
   distance of the drop pair from the wall, play an important role in
   determining not only the magnitude, but also the direction of the net
   displacement of the drop center after recession. Dynamic simulations of
   the expansion of a periodic bed of drops distributed randomly within a
   layer next to a wall illustrate explicitly the formation of a
   particle-free zone near the wall and the thickening of the bed due to
   hydrodynamic interceptions at a rate that is a strong function of the
   capillary number. Results of dynamic simulations of the pressure-driven
   flow of a two-dimensional suspension in a channel confined between two
   parallel walls are presented illustrating the effect of the capillary
   number and of the ratio of the viscosity of the drop and suspending
   fluid on (a) the time required for the suspension to reach statistical
   equilibrium, (b) the distribution of the drop number density across the
   channel width, (c) the mean velocity profile, and (d) the effective
   viscosity of the suspension. The general features of the flow are found
   to be in good agreement with published laboratory observations. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{In the case of degenerate four-wave mixing in a cerium-doped potassium
   sodium strontium barium niobate (Ce:KNSBN) crystal, it is found that the
   transmission grating is dominant when the incident beams are
   extraordinarily polarized, the crystal response is more rapid, and the
   conjugate beam is more intense. Furthermore, the variation of the
   conjugate beam intensity forms a loop as the fringe modulation of the

   implemented edge enhancement of an image and edge-enhanced optical

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present semi-analytical solutions for two-dimensional
   equations governing transport of Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (LNAPL)
   in unconfined aquifers. The proposed model is based on sharp interface
   displacement and steady groundwater flow assumptions, where both the
   water-LNAPL interface and the LNAPL-air interface are represented as
   sharp interfaces. In the case of steady groundwater flow, these
   equations can be reduced to a two-dimensional nonlinear solute transport
   equation, with the LNAPL thickness in the free product lens being the
   primary unknown variable. The linearized form of this solute transport
   equation falls into the category of two-dimensional transport equation
   with time-dependent dispersion coefficients. This equation can be solved
   analytically for an infinite domain region. In this paper, the general
   form of the analytical solution for the transport equation, as well as
   the solutions for some specific cases are presented. To demonstrate the
   utility of the proposed solution, numerical results obtained for two
   example problems are discussed and presented comparatively with a
   finite-element solution and other more restrictive solutions available
   in the literature. Although the solutions discussed in this paper have
   some simplifying assumptions, such as sharp-interfaces between fluid
   phases, steady groundwater flow and homogeneous aquifer properties; the
   semi-analytical solutions presented in this study may be used
   effectively as bench mark solutions in evaluating LNAPL migration in the
   subsurface. These solutions are simple and cost effective to implement
   and may be used in the calibration of other more complex numerical
   solutions that can be found in the literature. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The incidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), an infectious
   disease, sharply increases among the elderly and the main risk factor
   for CAP in this age group is chronic comorbidity. The use of the term
   CAP in the elderly population should be reserved for pneumonia acquired
   outside of the nursing home setting, since nursing home-acquired
   pneumonia differs from CAP in terms of its aetiology and clinical
   manifestations.
   The main aetiology for CAP is Streptococcus pneumoniae, but atypical
   pathogens also play an important role as causative agents. The clinical
   presentations of CAP in the elderly can be different from those in
   younger patients, and therefore it is important to be aware of and
   familiar with these differences to avoid unnecessary delays in reaching
   the correct diagnosis. Imaging is essential to diagnose CAP and to
   assess its severity. Clinical and laboratory indices can be used to
   identify elderly patients with CAP who are at low risk for mortality and
   who can be treated as outpatients. The decision not to hospitalise
   elderly patients with CAP is contingent on a good clinical condition and
   the existence of home support systems. The aetiology of CAP cannot be
   determined on the basis of clinical manifestations, imaging or routine
   laboratory test results, and the initial antibiotic therapy for elderly
   patients with CAP should be empirical, based on accepted guidelines.
   In the light of developments in recent years, elderly patients with CAP,
   except those who are severely ill, can be treated empirically with
   once-daily antibiotic monotherapy in the initial phase, using a
   third-generation fluoroquinolone preparation, such as sparfloxacin,
   levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, or a new macrolide such as clarithromycin,
   azithromycin or dirithromycin. In addition to antibiotic therapy, it is
   critically important to identify and treat the physiological
   disturbances that accompany CAP as well as decompensation of chronic
   comorbid conditions. As soon as the patient's condition permits, oral
   antibiotic therapy should replace intravenous therapy and early
   discharge from the hospital should be considered. Since influenza and
   pneumococcus immunisation can reduce morbidity and mortality from CAP,
   it is important to implement regular immunisation programmes in the
   primary care setting.}},

Abstract = {{It is now well established that some bacteria and fungi are aggressive
   colonizers of soil and the roots of plants, and are able to protect
   plants from infection by soil-borne fungal pathogens. In most cases that
   have been well studied, the biological mechanisms underlying this
   phenomenon, known as biocontrol, include the production of antifungal
   compounds, involving both metabolites and enzymes. Bacteria of the genus
   Pseudomonas comprise a large group of the active biocontrol strains as a
   result of their general ability to produce a diverse array of potent
   antifungal metabolites. These include simple metabolites such as
   2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid and pyrrolnitrin
   {[}3-chloro-4-(2'-nitro-3'-chlorophenyl)-pyrrole], as well as the
   complex macrocyclic lactone, 2,3-de-epoxy-2,3-didehydra-rhizoxin. Study
   of the biochemistry and mechanism of formation of these metabolites has
   proved useful in several ways. Pyrrolnitrin is active against
   Rhizoctonia spp, Fusarium spp, and other plant pathogenic fungi, and it
   has been used as a lead structure in the development of a new
   phenylpyrrole agricultural fungicide. In addition, pyrrolnitrin has been
   used for years as a model for the study of the mechanisms involved in
   the chlorination of organic molecules. We have cloned a four-gene
   cluster from a P fluorescens biocontrol strain that encodes the enzymes
   required for the production of pyrrolnitrin. Using these genes and
   strains mutated in the individual genes, we have elucidated the
   biochemical pathway by which pyrrolnitrin is synthesized. Studies of the
   genes involved in pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis have demonstrated that a new
   class of halogenase enzyme is involved in the chlorination reactions in
   pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis. The P fluorescens mutants that do not produce
   pyrrolnitrin have been used to demonstrate clearly the important role of
   pyrrolnitrin in the overall biocontrol activity shown by the strain. In
   addition, we have modified the pyrrolnitrin genes within the P
   fluorescens strain, which has resulted in significant increases in the
   production of this metabolite. The strains which overproduce
   pyrrolnitrin are also significantly more active than the wild-type
   strain in biocontrol. These studies suggest that the biocontrol activity
   of bacteria can be dramatically increased to rival the activity of
   commercial chemical fungicides through directed genetic modification.
   Bacteria remain important sources of natural products with diverse
   activities. In order to capture the full potential of these compounds,
   it will be necessary in the future to take a multidisciplinary approach
   to their study and development. (C) 2000 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Because blood loss attributable to laboratory testing is the
   primary cause of anemia among preterm infants during the first weeks of
   life, we quantified blood lost attributable to phlebotomy overdraw, ie,
   excess that might be avoided. We hypothesized that phlebotomy overdraw
   in excess of that requested by the hospital laboratory was a common
   occurrence, that clinical factors associated with excessive phlebotomy
   loss would be identified, and that some of these factors are potentially
   correctable.
   Design. Outcome Measures, and Analysis. Blood samples drawn for clinical
   purposes from neonates cared for in our 2 neonatal special care units
   were weighed, and selected clinical data were recorded. The latter
   included the test performed; the blood collection container used; the
   infant's location (ie, neonatal intensive care unit {[}NICU] and
   intermediate intensive care unit); the infant's weight at sampling; and
   the phlebotomist's level of experience, work shift, and clinical role.
   Data were analyzed by univariate and multivariate procedures.
   Phlebotomists included laboratory technicians stationed in the neonatal
   satellite laboratory, phlebotomists assigned to the hospital's central
   laboratory, and neonatal staff nurses. Phlebotomists were considered
   experienced if they had worked in the nursery setting for >1 year. Blood
   was sampled from a venous or arterial catheter or by capillary stick
   from a finger or heel. Blood collection containers were classified as
   tubes with marked fill-lines imprinted on the outside wall, tubes
   without fill-lines, and syringes. Infants were classified by weight into
   3 groups: <1 kg, 1 to 2 kg, and >2 kg. The volume of blood removed was
   calculated by subtracting the weight of the empty collection container
   from that of the container filled with blood and dividing by the
   specific gravity of blood, ie, 1.050 g/mL. The volume of blood withdrawn
   for individual laboratory tests was expressed as a percentage of the
   volume requested by the hospital laboratory.
   Results. The mean (+/- standard error of the mean) volume of blood drawn
   for the 578 tests drawn exceeded that requested by the hospital
   laboratory by 19.0\% +/- 1.8\% per test. The clinical factors identified
   as being significantly associated with greater phlebotomy overdraw in
   the multiple regression model included: 1) collection in blood
   containers without fill-lines; 2) lighter weight infants; and 3)
   critically ill infants being cared for in the NICU. Because the overall
   R-2 of the multiple regression for these 3 clinical factors was only
   .24, the random factor of individual phlebotomist was added to the
   model. This model showed that there was a significant variation in blood
   overdraw among individual phlebotomists, and as a result, the overall
   R-2 increased to .52. An additional subset analysis involving 2 of the 3
   groups of blood drawers (ie, hospital and neonatal laboratory
   phlebotomists) examining the effect of work shift, demonstrated that
   there was significantly greater overdraw for blood samples obtained
   during the evening shift, compared with the day shift when drawn using
   unmarked tubes for the group of heavier infants cared for in the NICU.
   Conclusion. Significant volumes of blood loss are attributable to
   overdraw for laboratory testing. This occurrence likely exacerbates the
   anemia of prematurity and may increase the need for transfusions in some
   infants. Attempts should be made to correct the factors involved. Common
   sense suggests that blood samples drawn in tubes with fill-lines marked
   on the outside would more closely approximate the volumes requested than
   those without. Conversely, the use of unmarked tubes could lead to
   phlebotomy overdraw because phlebotomists may overcompensate to avoid
   having to redraw the sample because of an insufficient volume for
   analysis. We were surprised to observe that the lightest and most
   critically ill infants experienced the greatest blood overdraw. Because
   the volume indicators on the outside of syringe barrels are seemingly
   analogous to the blood collection tubes with fill-lines, it was also
   unexpected to observe that blood overdraw was greater with syringes than
   with either marked or unmarked tubes. It is likely that this is
   attributable in part to the unavoidable presence of the air bubble
   inevitably originating in the syringe tip. Educating individual
   phlebotomists, nurses, and other members of the care team on reducing
   unnecessary blood loss, eg, ordering only essential blood tests,
   exercising the greatest care in the smallest infants, practice in
   drawing blood samples into syringes, etc, may also help. Other promising
   means for reducing laboratory blood loss include technologic
   improvements to further reduce laboratory sample volume required, more
   reproducible and better capillary blood sampling containers, and use of
   point-of-care laboratory testing in which little to no blood loss
   results.}},

Abstract = {{The N-input multiplexers based on CMOS switches are conventionally
   designed with the binary tree structure to simplify the address decoder
   and obtain a reasonable delay, which estimates the propagation time from
   data input end to the output end of the multiplexers. However, this
   design strategy in general takes too much hardware and incurs too much
   delay. To reduce both delay and cost, some structures other than the
   binary-tree structure have to be used. Therefore, in this paper we
   propose a general procedure based on the heterogeneous-tree structure
   for designing fast large fan-in CMOS multiplexers. The results show that
   not only can the speed be increased but the cost can also be reduced
   considerably for the proposed circuits with various input sizes. In
   addition, we show that both the binary-tree structure and the uniform
   structure are special cases of the proposed approach.}},

Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{Mousepox was identified in a single mouse-holding room in early 1999
   after a group of 20 CAF1/Hsd mice were inoculated SC with a killed
   murine spindle cell tumor line, S1509A. The cell line had been used
   without complications multiple times and was determined to be free of
   viral contamination on the basis of results of mouse antibody production
   testing. Of the 20 mice inoculated, 12 mice died by postinoculation day
   8. Severe lymphoid and hepatic necrosis was observed in select mice
   subjected to histologic examination. Ballooning degeneration of
   epithelial cells with intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies was
   observed in the skin overlying the inoculation site of the single mouse
   from which this tissue site was evaluated. Presence of ectromelia virus
   was confirmed by use of immunohistochemical and polymerase chain
   reaction analyses, and the virus was isolated after serum, pooled from 5
   of the index cases, was inoculated into an immune-naive mouse.
   Investigation into the source of virus contamination included
   inoculating mice with aliquots of various S1509A freeze dates;
   chemically defined media and supplements, including fetal bovine serum;
   and two lots of pooled commercial mouse sera, after heat inactivation at
   56 degrees C for 30 minutes used as a medium supplement. One lot of
   pooled commercial mouse serum was identified as the source of ectromelia
   virus. This lot of serum was inadvertently used to feed S1509A cells
   that were subsequently inoculated into mice. We determined that the
   contaminated serum, which was purchased in late 1998, originated from
   China. The serum was imported into the United States as a batch of 43 L
   in early 1995. The serum was blended into a single lot and filtered (0.2
   mu m) before distribution to major suppliers throughout the country. The
   serum was sold or further processed to obtain a variety of serum-derived
   products. Because murine serum is generally sold in small aliquots (10
   to 50 ml), we speculate that several thousand aliquots may have been
   derived from this batch of serum and, if inoculated into mice, would
   likely result in additional mousepox outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{Forty-three stool samples from 27 human immunodeficiency virus

   children, collected during a 15-month period, were examined for enteric
   viruses. Diagnostic assays included enzyme immunoassays for rotavirus,
   adenovirus, and Norwalk virus; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for
   picobirnavirus and atypical rotavirus; and PCR for astrovirus and
   enterovirus. Specimens from HIV-positive children were more likely than
   those of HIV-negative children to have enterovirus (56 versus 21\%; P <
   0.0002) and astrovirus (12 versus 0\%; P < 0.02), but not rotavirus (5
   versus 8\%; P > 0.5). No adenoviruses, picobirnaviruses, or Norwalk
   viruses were found. The rates of virus-associated diarrhea were similar
   among HIV-positive and HIV-negative children. Enteroviruses were
   excreted for up to 6 months in HIV-positive children; however, no
   evidence for prolonged excretion of poliovirus vaccine was observed.
   These results suggest that although infection with enterovirus and
   astrovirus may be frequent in HIV-infected children, enteric viruses are
   not associated with the diarrhea frequently suffered by these children.}},

   provide passive damping. A finite-element model based on a hybrid
   displacement theory is used to accurately capture the transverse shear
   effects in the composite primary structure and the viscoelastic and the
   piezoelectric layers within the SCL. Detailed numerical studies are
   presented to assess the influence of the number of actuators and their

   resonance analysis models are implemented in the rotor blade built
   around the composite box beam with segmented SCLs. A classic ground
   resonance model and an air resonance model are used in the rotor-body

   have a large effect on the enantioselectivity but the separation was
   dramatically influenced by the kind of alcohol in the mobile phase. The
   effect of temperature on the chiral separation is also discussed. Most

Abstract = {{Technical analysis, also known as ``charting,{''} has been a part of
   financial practice for many decades, but this discipline has not
   received the same level of academic scrutiny and acceptance as more
   traditional approaches such as fundamental analysis. One of the main
   obstacles is the highly subjective nature of technical analysis-the
   presence of geometric shapes in historical price charts is often in the
   eyes of the: beholder. In this paper, we propose a systematic and
   automatic approach to technical pattern recognition using nonparametric
   kernel regression, and we apply this method to a large number of U.S.
   stocks from 1962 to 1996 to evaluate the effectiveness of technical
   analysis. By comparing the unconditional empirical distribution of daily
   stock returns to the conditional distribution-conditioned on specific
   technical indicators such as head-and-shoulders or double-bottoms-we
   find that over the 31-year sample period, several technical indicators
   do provide incremental information and may have some practical value.}},

Abstract = {{Study Objective. To evaluate the role of outpatient diagnostic
   hysteroscopy.
   Design. Retrospective review (Canadian Task Force classification IL-2).
   Setting. University, teaching hospital-based outpatient clinic.
   Patients. One thousand six hundred women, 67.3\% premenopausal and
   32.7\% postmenopausal.
   Intervention. Diagnostic hysteroscopy without premedication or
   anesthesia; endometrial sampling or hysteroscopy-guided biopsy was
   performed when appropriate.
   Measurements and Main Results, Outpatient hysteroscopy was successfully
   performed in 1468 women (91.8\%). Eleven women (0.7\%) developed
   vasovagal response during the procedure, 18 required hospital admission
   because of pain or hemorrhage, and 2 were suspected of having uterine
   perforation. A II recovered spontaneously without intervention,
   Intrauterine anatomic pathology was diagnosed in 17.0\%; the overall
   Frequency of myomas and endometrial polyps was 12.3\% and 7.1\%,
   respectively. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of
   hysteroscopy without biopsy in diagnosing endometrial carcinoma were
   only 58.8\% and 20.8\%, respectively OF 1112 women with hysteroscopic
   impression of normal or atrophic endometrium, 10 (0.9\%) had endometrial
   hyperplasia on biopsy
   Conclusion. Hysteroscopy without biopsy carries low sensitivity and
   positive predictive value in the diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma and
   hyperplasia. In our opinion the predictive value of a negative
   hysteroscopy is inadequate, and endometrial biopsy should be performed
   during hysteroscopy for accurate diagnosis of endometrial
   histopathology.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of population bottlenecks on the mean and the additive
   variance generated by two neutral independent epistatic loci has been
   studied theoretically. Six epistatic models, used in the analysis of
   binary disease traits, were considered. Ancestral values in an
   infinitely large panmictic population were compared with their
   expectations at equilibrium, after t consecutive bottlenecks of equal
   size N (derived values). An increase in the additive variance after
   bottlenecks (inversely related to N and t) will occur only if the
   frequencies of the negative allele at each locus are: (1) low,
   invariably associated to strong inbreeding depression; (2) high, always
   accompanied by an enhancement of the mean with inbreeding. The latter is
   an undesirable property, making the pertinent models unsuitable for the
   genetic analysis of disease. For the epistatic models considered, it is
   unlikely that the rate of evolution may be accelerated after population
   bottlenecks, in spite of occasional increments of the derived additive

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{678-684}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims Lipid response to dietary fat and cholesterol is, to
   a large extent, genetically controlled. Apolipoprotein B (apo B) plays a
   dominant role in cholesterol homeostasis. Several polymorphic sites
   within or adjacent to the gene locus for apo B have been detected. The
   X+ allele of the XbaI restriction fragment polymorphism of the apo B
   gene has been found to be associated with higher serum cholesterol
   and/or triglyceride levels. In order to study the influence of this
   mutation on the plasma lipid response in diets of varying fat content,
   72 healthy male subjects were studied, 21 X- X- (X-) and 51 X+ (X+ X- or
   X+ X+).
   Methods and results These subjects followed three consecutive 28-day
   diet periods: one rich in saturated fats (SAT diet; 38\% fat, 20\%
   saturated); a National Cholesterol Education Program type I diet (NCEP-I
   diet) (28\% fats, <10\% saturated); and a third monounsaturated (MUFA
   diet)(38\% fats, 22\% monounsaturated). The different genotypes can be
   observed to have significant effects on total and LDL cholesterol
   concentrations (P < 0.017). X+ individuals had higher levels of total
   and LDL cholesterol after the consumption of a SAT diet (P < 0.012; P <
   0.006, respectively), NCEP diet (P < 0.060; P < 0.054, respectively) and
   MUFA. diet (P < 0.022; P < 0.042, respectively) in comparison with X-
   individuals. A significant interaction between genotypes and dietary
   effects was observed for diet-induced changes in plasma triglycerides (P
   < 0.032). Significant decreases in the absolute values of triglyceride
   concentrations (-0.18 mmol L-1, P < 0.024) were noted in the X- subjects
   after the high intake of a MUFA diet, while no significant differences
   were observed in the X+ individuals (0.006 mmol L-1, P < 0.858).
   Conclusions Our results suggest that the total triglyceride response to
   diet is influenced by the apo B XbaI polymorphism.}},

Abstract = {{Context. The debate on the respective roles of medical specialists and
   generalists has tended to portray them as alternatives, rather than
   seeking ways to build on the complementary skills of these professional
   groups.
   Objective. We wished to evaluate the impact of a selective admitting
   policy that attempts to exploit the complementary strengths of
   specialists and generalists.
   Design. Prospective cohort study of patients admitted to hospital with
   congestive heart failure.
   Setting. Public hospital in New South Wales, Australia.
   Patients. Subjects aged 60 years or more with congestive heart failure
   defined by the Framingham criteria (see Appendix).
   Intervention. A selective admission policy which referred patients with
   identifiable single system disorders to the relevant subspecialist,
   while patients with multiple medical problems were admitted under a
   general physician.
   Main outcome measures. Length of hospital stay, survival, quality of
   life and satisfaction with care.
   Results. Two-hundred and seventy-five patients with congestive heart
   failure were followed up from admission to 1 year after discharge from
   hospital. Of these, 102 were cared for by cardiologists and 154 by
   generalists. The patients under the generalists were older, had greater
   co-morbidity, but appeared to have less severe cardiac disease than
   those cared for by cardiologists. The use of cardiac drugs and
   investigations was similar in the two groups. The generalists' patients
   had a longer length of hospital stay, but the cardiologists' patients
   had a higher mortality during the early follow-up period. There were no
   differences in let els of satisfaction with care on. in health-related
   quality of life between the two groups of patients. Multivariate
   analysis suggested that any differences in outcomes between the two
   groups of patients were due to the severity of underlying disease, and
   co-morbidity, rather than the quality of care that was provided by the
   physicians.
   Conclusions. It is possible to implement a hospital admission policy
   that selectively refers patients with congestive heart failure to
   specialists or generalists, according to the presence of co-morbid
   conditions, without adversely affecting the outcomes of care. Such a
   policy should represent optimum use of the complementary skills of these
   professional groups.}},

Abstract = {{4 - Substituted - 2,6 - dimethyl - 3,5 - bis(alkoxycarbonyl) - 1,4 -
   dihydropyridines are important calcium channel blockers. A practical and
   general procedure for the Hantzsch cyclocondensation reaction using
   ammonium bicarbonate in stead of ammonia is described. This is a novel,
   one - pot operationthat not only preserves the simplicity of Hantzsch
   synthesis but also gives high yields (70\% similar to 86\%) of the 1,4 -
   dihydropyridines. Thus a solution of ethyl acetoacetate, formalin,
   ammonium bicarbonate (mol ratio: 2.5:1:1.25) and MeOH was warmed at 50
   similar to 60 degrees C until all the NH4HCO3 was decomposed. After
   refluxing for 0.5 h, the solution was cooled and the resulting
   suspension was filtered, washed with methanol and dried. The product was
   obtained as yellow crystals was products. Iron(III) chloride hexahydrate
   is an effective oxidation agent for 1,4 - dihydropyridines in acetic
   acid medium. However, oxidation of 4 - isopropyl - 1,4 - DHP (7) with
   FeCl3. 6H(2)O afforded the dealkylated pyridine (10). Presumably, a
   single electron transfer occurred. In comparison with HNO3, CrO3, MnO2
   et al., Iron(III) chloride hexahydrate is an effective oxidation agent
   in the aromatization of 1,4 - dihydropyridines. Moreover, excellent
   yields with environment friendly nature of Fe3+ oxidation make this an
   important means for the aromatization of 1,4 - DHP. After 1,4 - DHP (1)
   was dissolved in acetic acid, FeC3. 6H(2)O (mol ratio: 1:2) was added.
   The mixture was refluxed for 1 h, before being neutralized with aq.
   Na2CO3. Then the mixture was extracted with CHCl3. The collected
   chloroform solution was dried (anhyd. Na2SO4) and solvent was removed.
   The residue was recrystallised from aq ethanol, yielding pale yellow
   crystals (60\% similar to 72\%).}},

Abstract = {{Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus is a chronic dermatosis of unknown
   etiology and pathogenesis. Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus associated
   skin lesions show T cell enriched infiltrates, sometimes resembling the
   histologic picture of early mycosis fungoides. It is supposed that the
   infiltrating T cells participate in the pathogenesis of atrophy and
   sclerosis. We investigated skin biopsies from 39 lichen sclerosus et
   atrophicus patients by histology, immunohistochemistry and, in order to
   establish the status of T cell clonality, by polymerase chain reaction
   amplifying the T cell receptor-gamma rearrangements. A stage-dependent
   shift of the CD3-positive T cells was observed from a predominantly
   CD4-positive to a predominantly CD8-positive phenotype. The increase of
   CD8-positive cells was associated with more pronounced epidermotropism
   and basal degeneration. Nearly all CD8-positive cells expressed
   cytotoxic granules (TIA1), possibly causing the basal destruction. In
   the late fibrotic stage of the disease, only a weak or no infiltrate was
   found. Regarding the T cell receptor-gamma polymerase chain reaction,
   the presence of clonally expanded T cells was demonstrated in 19 of 39
   patients (49\%) by at least one of two different high resolution
   electrophoresis techniques applied to separate the amplification
   products. Thus, for the first time clonally expanded infiltrating T
   cells were detected in lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. Furthermore, this
   is one of the first reports on the detection of clonally expanded
   infiltrating T cells in an inflammatory skin disease. The clonal T cells
   could not be assigned to the CD4 or CD8 subtype. Most likely, their
   presence is not the result of a malignant transformation but a response
   to an as yet unknown lichen sclerosus et atrophicus associated antigen.}},

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{We analyze in detail a specific 5-dimensional realization of a
   ``brane-universe{''} scenario where the visible and hidden sectors are
   localized on spatially separated 3-branes coupled only by supergravity,
   with supersymmetry breaking originating in the hidden sector. Although
   general power counting allows order 1/M-Planck(2) contact terms between
   the two sectors in the 4-dimensional theory from exchange of
   supergravity Kaluza-Klein modes, we show that they are not present by
   carefully matching to the 5-dimensional theory. We also find that the
   radius modulus corresponding to the size of the compactified dimension
   must be stabilized by additional dynamics in order to avoid runaway
   behavior after supersymmetry breaking and to understand the
   communication of supersymmetry breaking. We stabilize the radius by
   adding two pure Yang-Mills sectors, one in the bulk and the other
   localized on a brane. Gaugino condensation in the 5-dimensional
   effective theory generates a superpotential that can naturally fix the
   radius at a sufficiently large value that supersymmetry breaking is
   communicated dominantly by the recently discovered mechanism of anomaly
   mediation. The mass of the radius modulus is large compared to m(3/2)
   The stabilization mechanism requires only parameters of order one at the
   fundamental scale, with no fine-tuning except for the cosmological
   constant.}},

Pages = {{722-729}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The association between cancer and thromboembolic disease has
   been known for over a century. Increased tissue factor expression by
   endothelial cells, monocytes or macrophages is implicated. Thus,
   monocyte tissue factor measurements may reflect disease presence or
   progression.
   Methods: Using a 2 stage kinetic chromogenic assay, monocyte tissue
   factor levels were assessed in normal controls (n=60), patient controls
   (hernia or cholecystectomy, n=60) and in patients with benign and
   malignant disease of the bladder (n=73), prostate (n=81), breast (n=83)
   and colorectum (n=62). This was performed as baseline (resting cells)
   and after 6 hours incubation with (stimulated) and without
   (unstimulated) lipopolysaccharide. Each benign disease group was
   subdivided into inflammatory and non-inflammatory categories.
   Results: The relative operating characteristic curve for the
   lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocyte tissue factor assay showed
   sensitivity and specificity for cancer, the area under the curve being
   0.71. The control groups and the benign non-inflammatory groups gave
   similar results and were pooled for further analysis. Each malignant
   group showed higher monocyte tissue factor levels than the control
   groups for baseline (P<0.05) and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells
   (P<0.05). All benign inflammatory groups apart from breast, showed
   increased monocyte tissue factor levels over controls for baseline
   (P<0.05) and ligopolysaccharide-stimutated cells (P<0.05). In all cases
   there was no significant difference between the malignant and the benign
   inflammatory groups. Monocyte tissue factor levels were related to tumor
   grade or stage, patients' survival time, serum prostate specific antigen
   and static bone scan images. Levels were also higher in patients with
   bladder cancer recurrence and in those who subsequently died.
   Conclusion: Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocyte tissue factor assay
   showed sensitivity and specificity for cancer compared to controls.
   Monocyte tissue factor levels are raised in malignant groups compared to
   controls and non-inflammatory diseases but not when compared with
   inflammatory conditions. Stimulated cells give better discrimination
   between the groups and may be useful in identifying high risk
   individuals. Monocyte tissue factor levels were related to tumor
   progression.}},

Abstract = {{This tutorial emphasis disturbances in auroral emissions and ionospheric
   currents and their relation to interplanetary conditions and the overall
   level of geomagnetic activity. Auroral zone disturbances are divided
   into three fundamentally different types: poleward boundary
   intensifications (PBIs), substorms, and effects of solar wind dynamic
   pressure enhancements. The most common type of auroral-zone disturbance
   is the PBI, which occurs during all levels of geomagnetic activity. PBIs
   have an auroral signature that often can be seen to move equatorward
   from the magnetic separatrix. They are typically associated with ground
   magnetic perturbations of few tens of nT, but perturbations can be as
   high as similar to 500 nT. Individual PBIs are longitudinally localized,
   associated with the longitudinally localized flow bursts in the tail
   plasma sheet, and occasionally traverse essentially the entire
   latitudinal extent of the plasma sheet. PBIs appear to generally be the
   dominant type of auroral-zone disturbance during periods of enhanced
   magnetospheric convection, including the growth phase of substorms,
   convection bays, and the main phase of magnetic storms. Substorms are a
   far more dramatic and large scale, but far less common, disturbance than
   PBIs. They occur after a greater than or similar to 30 min growth-phase
   period of enhanced convection. It is now known that at least similar to
   50\% of substorms are associated with IMF changes that lead to a
   reduction in the strength of convection. However, it has not yet been
   shown whether or not all are most substorm onsets are caused by these
   types of IMF changes. Auroral activity during substorms typically
   initiates within a similar to 1-2 h MLT sector near the equatorward
   boundary of the auroral oval and then expands both poleward and
   azimuthally. Substorms are associated with ground magnetic disturbances
   that range from similar to 50 to similar to 2000 nT, a reduction in
   strength of the cross-tail current, a poleward displacement of the inner
   edge of the plasma sheet, and a large release of plasma and magnetic
   field energy from the region earthward of the new inner edge of the
   plasma sheet. The reduction of cross-tail current is also believed to
   often be associated with a severance, and loss from the magnetotail, of
   the outer portion of the plasma sheet (r greater than or similar to
   25R(E)). Recent studies have shown that solar wind dynamic pressure
   increases caused large auroral-zone disturbances during a stormtime
   period of strongly enhanced convection, affecting the poleward boundary,
   latitudinal width, and intensity of the auroral oval. Dynamic pressure
   increases also appear to also enhance the entire magnetospheric current
   system, including the magnetopause, cross-tail, region 1 field-aligned,
   and global ionospheric currents. Thus, in addition to PBIs, significant
   variations in solar wind dynamic pressure should be considered as a
   possibly important source of geomagnetic disturbances during periods of
   enhanced magnetospheric convection. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The major goal of this paper is to approach and solve a spectrum of

   survivability, damage adaptation and recovery, this paper reports a new,
   completely automated realtime motion control conceptual framework with

   Innovative highly efficient identification and design methods are
   applied and verified. To attain the desired aircraft performance and
   expand the operational flight envelope at high-angle-of-attack regimes,

Abstract = {{Experimental data show that biological synapses behave quite differently
   from the symbolic synapses in all common artificial neural network
   models. Biological synapses are dynamic; their ``weight{''} changes on a
   short timescale by several hundred percent in dependence of the past
   input to the synapse. In this article we address the question how this
   inherent synaptic dynamics (which should not be confused with long term
   learning) affects the computational power of a neural network. In
   particular, we analyze computations on temporal and spatiotemporal
   patterns, and we give a complete mathematical characterization of all
   filters that can be approximated by feedforward neural networks with
   dynamic synapses. It turns out that even with just a single hidden
   layer, such networks can approximate a very rich class of nonlinear
   filters: all filters that can be characterized by Volterra series. This
   result is robust with regard to various changes in the model for
   synaptic dynamics. Our characterization result provides for all
   nonlinear filters that are approximable by Volterra series a new
   complexity hierarchy related to the cost of implementing such filters in
   neural systems.}},

Abstract = {{A 72-year-old man with exertional angina had a strongly positive
   exercise electrocardiogram (EECG) with a negative thallium-201
   myocardial perfusion scintigram (Tl). Arteriography revealed
   triple-vessel coronary artery disease, for which he underwent
   aortocoronary bypass grafting. Repeat EECG was negative, and it was
   again associated with a negative Tl. The false-negative Tl on the first
   test was felt to be due to a rare phenomenon of homogeneously
   distributed reversible exercise-induced myocardial ischemia, leading to
   a uniform radiotracer count density. The even distribution of ischemia
   would also be expected to render a false-negative EECG, due to
   electrocardiographic cancellation, and this is frequently the case.
   However in the patient presented herein, we propose that the ischemic
   cardiac apex rendered the EECG strongly positive because its position
   was not opposed by an ischemic muscular region, and thus an uncancelled
   ischemic ST-segment vector was generated. This hypothesis is supported
   by our recent work showing the unique role of the ischemic apex (among
   all the ether myocardial territories) in rendering the EECG positive.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the secretion of the plasma levels of atrial natriuretic
   peptide (ANP) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we
   evaluated the relationship between plasma levels of ANP and pulmonary
   capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) in 45 consecutive patients during the
   acute phase of AMI (similar to 12 h after the attack) (group 1) and
   compared data with those obtained after 1 mo (group 2). In both groups 1
   and 2, plasma ANP levels significantly correlated with PCWP. The slope
   of the linear regression line between the PCWP and ANP in group 1 was
   significantly lower, by about one-third, than that in group 2. In
   addition, we examined changes in ANP levels and left ventricular
   end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) over 180 min after AMI induced by
   injection of microspheres into the left coronary arteries of three dogs.
   The LVEDP and ANP levels 30 min after AMI were significantly higher than
   those before; however, despite the persistent high LVEDP during the 180
   min after AMI, ANP levels decreased gradually and significantly to 63\%
   of the peak level at 150 min. These findings suggest that the secretion
   of ANP during the acute phase of myocardial infarction may be
   insufficient relative to the chronic phase.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic response image plane nonuniformity and stochastic noise are
   properties that greatly influence the outcome of quantitative magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations such as gel dosimetry measurements
   using MRT. To study these properties, robust and accurate image analysis
   methods are required. New nonuniformity level assessment methods were
   designed, since previous methods were found to be insufficiently robust
   and accurate. The new and previously reported nonuniformity level
   assessment methods were analyzed with respect to, for example,
   insensitivity to stochastic noise; and previously reported stochastic
   noise level assessment methods with respect to insensitivity to
   nonuniformity. Using the same image data, different methods were found
   to assess significantly different levels of nonuniformity. Nonuniformity
   levels obtained using methods that count pixels in an intensity
   interval, and obtained using methods that use only intensity values,
   were found not to be comparable. The latter were found preferable, since
   they assess the quantity intrinsically sought. A new method which
   calculates a deviation image, with every pixel representing the
   deviation from a reference intensity, was least sensitive to stochastic
   noise. Furthermore, unlike any other analyzed method, it includes all
   intensity variations across the phantom area and allows for studies of
   nonuniformity shapes. This new method was designed for accurate studies
   of nonuniformities in gel dosimetry measurements, but could also be used
   with benefit in quality assurance and acceptance testing of MRI,
   scintillation camera, and computer tomography systems. The stochastic
   noise level was found to be greatly method dependent. Two methods were:
   found to be insensitive to nonuniformity and also simple to use in
   practice. One method assesses the stochastic noise level as the average
   of the levers at five different positions within the phantom area, and
   the other assesses the stochastic noise in a region outside the phantom
   area. (C) 2000 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Abstract = {{The blood group antigens H, A, B, and Le(b) are oncofetal antigens of
   the human distal colon. Although these antigens are present in the
   digestive mucosa of the rat, little is known about their ontogenic
   expression in the developing rat colon. The present study was undertaken
   to assess age-dependent and region-related changes of blood group
   antigens during colonic development and maturation with the aim of
   determining their fetal phenotype. Antigen expression was assessed by
   immunohistochemistry using H-, A-, B-, Le(a)-, and Le(b)-specific
   monoclonal antibodies and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded colon
   sections from fetal, suckling, weanling, and adult rats. Staining of
   antigen was analyzed with respect to its locations in colonic goblet
   cells, brush borders, and columnar cells. H, B, and Le(b) antigens were
   expressed by goblet cells of the distal colon, beginning at 20 days of
   gestation, but expression was lost from the colon during the first
   postnatal week, thus exhibiting a fetal phenotype. H and Le(b), but not
   B, were also expressed by goblet cells of the fetal proximal colon;
   however, unlike that of the distal colon, their expression increased
   progressively during postnatal development until adulthood. Fetal
   phenotypic expression was observed in the brush border of the proximal
   and distal colon for H antigen, whereas it was observed in that of the
   distal colon for B antigen. No fetal phenotypic expression of H, B, and
   Le(b) by columnar cells of the colon was observed. Antigen A was
   expressed by goblet cells, brush border, and columnar cells of the
   entire colon at all ages, in concert with the development and maturation
   of the colon. Therefore, its expression in the rat colon was not fetal
   in nature. Le(a) was not detected in the colon at any age, except for
   some sporadic staining in the Golgi zone of columnar cells of the
   postnatal proximal colon. In conclusion, these data indicate significant
   age- and region-related changes of blood group antigen expression in the
   rat colon. Because the fetal phenotypic expression of H, B, and Le(b) by
   goblet cells of the distal colon mimics that in the human distal colon,
   the adult rat colon is a potentially useful model for assessing the
   effects of cocarcinogenic dietary factors, including ethanol, that may
   induce reexpression of these so-called oncofetal tumor-associated
   antigens of the colon. Anat Rec 259:395-404, 2000. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains isolated
   from a seagull in Japan were examined. A total of 50 faecal samples was
   collected on a harbour bank in Hokkaido, Japan, in July 1998. Two
   different STEC strains, whose serotypes were O136:H16 and 0153:H-, were
   isolated from the same individual by PCR screening; both of them were
   confirmed by ELISA and Vero cell cytotoxicity assay to be producing;
   active Stx2 and Stx1, respectively. They harboured large plasmids, but
   did not carry the haemolysin or eaeA genes of STEC O157:H7. Based on
   their plasmid profiles, antibiotic resistance patterns, pulsed-field gel
   electrophoresis analysis (PFGE), and the stx genes sequences, the
   isolates were different. Phylogenic analysis of the deduced Stx amino
   acid sequences demonstrated that the Stx toxins of seagull-origin STEC
   were closely associated with those of the human-origin, but not those of
   other animal-origin STEC. In addition, Stx2 Phi -K7 phage purified from
   O136 STEC resembled Stx2 Phi -II from human-origin O157.H7, and was able
   to convert non-toxigenic E. coli to STEC. These results suggest that
   birds may be one of the important carriers in terms of the distribution
   of STEC.}},

Abstract = {{We use observations from the Ulysses electron spectrometer to examine
   global trends of the electron suprathermal population and to study, for
   the fi rst time, the electron core, halo, and total temperature
   gradients in the fast solar wind over the poles. We use a data set
   covering the period from the beginning of the mission ( 1990, day of
   year 322) to approximately the first completion of Ulysses out
   of-ecliptic orbit around the Sun (1998, day 32). This allows us to
   characterize very welll the two states of the solar wind: the high-speed
   wind, emanating from polar coronal holes , and the low-speed streams,
   emanating from equatorial regions. From a classical bi-Maxwellian (core
   and halo) model of electron velocity distribution functions, we define
   the electron suprathermal strength S as the ratio of the halo to core
   kinetic pressures: S = n(h)T(h)/n(c)T(c). The fast wind has larger
   average values of S than the slow wind. This global correlation between
   S and the solar wind hulk speed is also observed on a smaller scale in
   the polar regions. We find that the small-scale variations of the solar
   wind bulk speed in the polar regions, typically +/-50 kin/s around an
   average value, of 750 km/s, are correlated with small-scale variations
   of S. We present also the first observations of the electron core, halo,
   and total temperature gradients in time-stationary fast solar wind
   periods over the poles, We examine all the previous observations in the
   context of simple solar wind exospheric models. We find, for instance,
   that the total electron temperature can be well fitted by a law of the
   form T-c = T-0 + T-1 r(-4/3), as predicted by the exospheric
   approximation.}},

Abstract = {{Within the field of multimedia there are few methods, criteria or
   standards for evaluating the experiential impact of a design. This paper
   offers six propositions for structure, causality, visibility and
   interaction, which appear to produce cognitive, emotive and sensory
   engagement in users' reactions to a narrative multimedia design. The
   developmental approach was phenomenological. The propositions derive
   from a focus group study in which 12 users played with four commercial
   computer games, then we (and they) analysed their reactions. Two
   observations from the study inform the morphology of narrative. Firstly,
   there is a fundamental conflict between narrative in its traditional
   form and interactivity, and secondly, the primal features of
   narrative-causality temporality and linearity-are disrupted within a
   hyper structure. The first set of propositions suggests solutions for
   such conflicts. These are spatial containment, causality, and demands on
   user's skills. Further propositions for engaging interaction are
   causality of dialogue, apparent intelligence of the program and hiding
   the delivery medium. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Xylanases form enzymes of considerable interest to a variety of
   biotechnological industries. Their industrial usage is especially
   attractive since they can replace some of the environmental pollutants,
   and are economically viable. Those with higher thermostability and
   optimal activity at alkaline pH are of particular importance to the
   paper and pulp industry due to the demands of conditions under which the
   enzymatic reactions are carried out. We have earlier isolated a xylanase
   from Bacillus sp. NG-27, which is active both at high temperature as
   well as at alkaline pH. In order to find out factors responsible for the
   adaptation of this enzyme to the extreme conditions, three dimensional
   structure of NG-27 xylanase has now been obtained by homology,
   modelling. The tertiary structure shows TIM barrel fold consisting of 8
   parallel beta-strands surrounded by alpha-helices. The active site is
   located at the carboxy terminal end of the TIM barrel. Factors which
   contribute to the thermostability of the enzyme are increased number of
   salt bridges. The salt bridges occur remarkably on one face of
   alpha-helices, with oppositely charged residues occupying i, i+4, i+7
   positions. A solvent shielded salt bridge interaction is also observed,
   which is absent in the mesophilic homologous xylanases. Solvent
   shielding may enhance electrostatic interaction through lowering of the
   dielectric, and contribute to increased stability of the enzyme.}},

Journal = {{BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{685-698}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Motivation: A protocol is described to attach expression patterns to
   genes represented in a collection of hybridization array experiments.
   Discrete values are used to provide an easily interpretable description
   of differential expression. Binning cutoffs for each sample type are
   chosen automatically depending on the desired false-positive rate for
   the predictions of differential expression. Confidence levels are
   derived for the statement that changes in observed levels represent true
   changes in expression. We have a novel method for calculating this
   confidence which gives better results than the standard methods. Our
   method reflects the broader change of focus in the field from studying a
   few genes with many replicates to studying many (possibly thousands) of
   genes simultaneously, but with relatively few replicates. Our approach
   differs from standard methods in that it exploits the fact that there
   are many genes on the arrays. These are used to estimate for each sample
   type an appropriate distribution that is employed to control the
   false-positive rate of the predictions made. Satisfactory results can be
   obtained using this method with as few as two replicates.
   Results: The method is illustrated through applications to macroarray
   and microarray datasets. The first is an erythroid development dataset
   that we have generated using nylon filter arrays. Clones for genes whose
   expression is known in these cells were assigned expression patterns
   which are in accordance with what was expected and which are not picked
   up by the standards methods. Moreover genes differentially expressed
   between normal and leukemic cells were identified These included genes
   whose expression was altered upon induction of the leukemic cells to
   differentiate. The second application is to the microarray data by
   Alizadeh et al. (2000). Our results are in accordance with their major
   findings and offer confidence measures for the predictions made. They
   also provide new insights for further analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most frequent primary tumor
   of the liver. It is associated to chronic liver diseases and has a high
   prevalence in some regions of Africa and Asia. Aim: To describe the
   clinical characteristics of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,
   admitted to two hospitals of the IX region of southern Chile. Material
   and methods: Prospective study of 29 consecutive patients admitted to
   two hospitals in Temuco, Chile. Clinical features, laboratory values and
   viral markers were analyzed. Results: Eighteen patients were male and
   ages ranged from 29 to 75 years old. The most frequent presenting
   symptom was abdominal pain in 21 patients. Seven subjects had a history
   of alcoholism. Serum bilirubin values ranged from 0.1 to 15.8 mg/dl,
   alkaline phosphatases ranged from 171 to 3476 U/l, ASAT from 24 to 5400
   U/l and alpha feto protein from 1.4 to 350 ng/ml. Two patients had a
   positive hepatitis B surface antigen and all had negative hepatitis C
   virus antibodies. Mean tumoral diameter was 9.6 cm and the most common
   presentation was nodular. Mean survival after be diagnosis was 6.3
   months. Conclusions: These patients with hepatocellular carcinoma have a
   low frequency of positive viral markers and tumors of large sizes on
   presentation.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory, histopathological, pharmacological and clinical evidence
   support the notion that a systemic activation of blood coagulation is
   often present in cancer patients. On the other hand, epidemiological
   studies provide evidence of an increased risk of cancer diagnosis
   following primary thromboembolism. Moreover, the metastatic ability of
   human breast cancer cells is correlated with the number of thrombin
   receptors of these cells, and thrombin treatment of B16 melanoma cells
   dramatically increases the number of lung metastases in rats. We have
   proposed that these tumour-promoting effects of thrombin can be
   explained by the ability of thrombin to activate angiogenesis, an
   essential requirement for tumour progression. Many of the cellular
   events involved in the angiogenic cascade can be activated by thrombin.
   At the molecular level, brief exposure of endothelial cells to thrombin
   causes an upregulation of the receptors (KDR and Flt-1) of VEGF, the key
   angiogenic mediator. This results in a synergistic effect of thrombin
   and VEGF in the activation of angiogenesis. In addition, thrombin
   activates cancer cells to secrete VEGF, thus causing a mutual
   stimulation between EC and CA cells. Cancer cells exposed to thrombin
   secrete metalloproteinase 92 KD and overexpress the integrin a(v)b(3),
   all of which are involved in tumour metastasis. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Bizarre stimuli usually facilitate recall compared to common stimuli.
   This investigation explored the so-called bizarreness effect in free
   recall by using 80 simple line drawings of common objects (common vs
   bizarre). 64 subjects participated with 16 subjects in each group. Half
   of the subjects received learning instructions and the other half rated
   the bizarreness of each drawing. Moreover, drawings were presented
   either alone or with che name of the object under mixed-list encoding
   conditions. After the free recall task, subjects had to make metamemory
   judgments about how many items of each format they had seen and
   recalled. The key result was that a superiority of bizarre pictures over
   common ones was found in all conditions although performance was better
   when the pictures were presented alone than with their corresponding
   label. Subsequent metamemory judgments, however, showed that subjects
   underestimated the number of bizarre items actually recalled.}},

   Pythium ultimuun Trow. All proved effective in inhibiting the growth of
   the phytopathogens at all of the test concentrations (10, 20, 50, 100 mu

   1-(3)nitrophenyl-6-trifluoromethylpyrazolo{[}3,4-d]pyrimidine-4(5H)-thio
   ne (CF(3)3). Ultrastructural studies on P. ultimum treated with CF(3)3
   revealed alterations in the normal hyphal shape and, at high
   concentration, plasmolysis and damage to the wall texture was observed.
   At 20 mu g/ml different vesicles were seen in the cytoplasm: some
   appeared quite dense, and specific cytochemical reactions indicated that
   they were most likely peroxysomes; other vesicles seem to be vacuoles of
   varying content. In some cases there was disintegration of the nuclear

Abstract = {{Two texturally and mineralogically distinct types of Mississippi
   Valley-type mineralization are hosted by the upper Cambrian Metaline
   Formation in northeastern Washington. Josephine-type mineralization is
   iron poor and coarse grained, whereas Yellowhead-type mineralization is
   iron rich, fine grained, and commonly botryoidal. Josephine
   mineralization is found largely in the Josephine lithofacies, a
   fragmental unit near the contact between dolomites of the Metaline
   Formation and shales of the overlying Ledbetter Formation. Yellowhead
   mineralization forms several planar zones several hundred meters below,
   largely in the light-gray bedded dolo-stone lithofacies of the Metaline
   Formation. About 12.7 million tonnes (Mt) of Josephine-type ore (1.3\%
   Pb, 3.0\% Zn) and 730,000 t of Yellowhead-type ore (4.5\% Zn, 0.5\% Ph)
   were produced from the district before 1997, and about 5.5 Mt of ore
   (7.2\% Zn, 1.3\% Pb) remain, largely in the Yellowhead zone.
   Ore textures in both types of mineralization indicate a complete lack of
   equilibrium among adjacent miner als, and this is confirmed by
   geochemical measurements. Although fluid inclusion homogenization and
   freezing temperatures are similar for both types of ore, fluid inclusion
   leachate and gas analyses differ for each mineral. Compositions for
   Josephine minerals appear to form a cluster that differs from
   compositions for Yellowhead minerals, suggesting that ore minerals were
   deposited from two parent brines that changed composition slightly to
   deposit each mineral. Isotopic analyses indicate that sulfur in both
   types of mineralization was probably derived from the same source
   whereas lead definitely came from two distinct sources. These
   observations indicate that ore formed when two parent metal-rich brines
   mixed with the same source of sulfur. Abundant pyrite that retains the
   form of marcasite suggests that the original brine in at least the
   Yellowhead ores was moderately acid. Geochemical speciation calculations
   indicate that relatively high temperatures are needed to dissolve enough
   iron to make iron-rich Mississippi Valley-type deposits. Furthermore,
   moderately acid brines with relatively low sulfur contents are enriched
   in iron whereas those with high sulfur contents lack iron, suggesting
   that the variations in iron content of these deposits reflect variations
   in the dissolved sulfur content of the parent brines.}},

Abstract = {{The perception that mercury in dental amalgam is toxic to the human
   organism has prompted worldwide efforts by the scientific community to
   develop alternative amalgam-like materials that utilize little or no
   mercury. In this investigation, an attempt is made to develop a new
   dental alloy system by adding liquid mercury to silver-coated Ag4Sn
   intermetallic particles in lesser amounts than are used in conventional
   amalgam alloys. An effort to precipitate the important eta-prime
   (Cu6Sn5) phase was made by adding pure Cu and Sn powders to the alloy
   formulation during trituration. Tytin(R) a popular Ag-Sn-Cu
   single-composition, spray-atomized conventional dental alloy was used as
   the control to obtain baseline data for com parisons of microstructures
   and mechanical properties. Amalgamation of the coated particles with
   mercury, with or without the addition of Cu and Sn powders, mostly
   produced specimens with chemically non-coherent microstructures that
   were relatively weak in compression. These results were due, in part, to
   mercury's inability to chemically wet the Ag-coated particles and Cu and
   Sn powders because of naturally occurring surface oxide films. The
   strongest specimens tested had silver dendritic coatings, resulting in
   compression strength values up to 40\% of the control's. Their higher
   strength is attributed to mechanical interlocking at the particle/matrix
   interfaces. (C) 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.}},

Abstract = {{As of this writing, there exists a large variety of recently developed
   pattern classification methods coming from the domain of machine
   learning and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we study the
   performance of a recently developed and improved classifier that
   integrates fuzzy set theory in a neural network (NEFCLASS). The
   performance of NEFCLASS is compared to a well-known classification
   technique from machine learning (C4.5). Both C4.5 and NEFCLASS will be
   evaluated on a collection of benchmarking data sets. Further, to boost
   performance of NEFCLASS, we investigate the advantage of preprocessing
   the algorithm by means of an exploratory factor analysis. We compare the
   algorithms before and after applying an exploratory factor analysis on
   leading performance indicators, as there are the accuracy of the created
   classifier and the magnitude of the associated rule base. (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{Axolotls are an important model system for studying heart development.
   Patterning of the semitic mesoderm occurs in axolotls in a manner that
   is much more similar to the pattern observed in higher vertebrates than
   in Xenopus, For these reasons we cloned the axolotl cardiac actin gene,
   since this gene is expressed during the development of both semitic and
   cardiac muscle in other vertebrates. In this paper we characterize its
   expression. Expression of cardiac actin RNA is switched on during
   gastrula stages and appears in the semitic mesoderm when it is formed;
   expression is later activated in the embryonic heart. In adults the gene
   is expressed only in the heart. The results demonstrate that the clone
   encoding cardiac actin provides a useful marker for studying development
   of both skeletal and cardiac muscle development in axolotls.}},

Abstract = {{To date, more than a dozen studies have investigated the role of HLA
   genes in determining clinical course and disease severity in multiple
   sclerosis (MS); in each of these studies, however, patient sample size
   has been small, and no consistent pattern has emerged from the results.
   For the present study, we determined HLA class II genotypes and
   catalogued clinical and demographic data for a total of 948 patients,
   making our data set the largest ever used to investigate HLA genes in
   MS. Our goals were both to investigate the impact of HLA-DRB1 alleles on
   clinical course and disease severity in MS and to compare the
   frequencies of the established susceptibility allele DR15 in various
   clinicodemographic subgroups of MS patients. We found that, in addition
   to DR15, DR17 is positively associated with susceptibility to MS; that
   none of the HLA-DRB1 alleles influences course or outcome in MS; that
   carriers of DR15 are prone to MS development at an earlier age than
   noncarriers; and that differences in DR15 positivity rates, after
   stratification for diagnostic category and examination results, seem to
   reflect a gradient of phenocopy contamination, with rates increasing in
   proportion to the degree of clinical or paraclinical verification of the
   MS diagnosis.}},

   of the solvent are the major factors of the K-t-variations as a result
   of preferential solvation of the ketonic tautomer. The equilibrium
   constants for p-substituted benzoylacetates were evaluated in chloroform

Abstract = {{The hypotheses that fish survival probabilities may be lower (1) at less

   and (3) with the deployment of extended-length intake guidance screens,
   are not supported by results on yearling chinook salmon smolts
   (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) at Lower Granite Dam, Snake River,
   Washington. Estimated 96 h survival probabilities for the six test
   conditions ranged from 0.937 to 0.972, with the highest survival at
   turbine operating towards the lower end of its efficiency. A blanket
   recommendation to operate all Kaplan type turbines within +/- 1 percent
   of their peak. efficiency appears too restrictive. Cavitation mode
   survival (0.946) was comparable to that at peak operating efficiency
   mode (0.937), as was the survival between upper (0.947) and mid depths
   (0.937). Survival differed only slightly among three turbine intake bays
   at the same depth (0.937 to 0.954), most likely due to differential flow
   distribution. Extended-length intake fish guidance screens did not
   reduce survival. However, the sources of injury somewhat differed with
   depth; probable pressure and shear-related injuries were common on fish
   entrained at mid-depth, and mechanically-induced injuries were common at
   upper depth. Operating conditions that reduce turbulence within the
   turbine environment may enhance fish survival; however, controlled
   experiments that integrate turbine flow physics and geometry and the
   path entrained fish traverse are needed to develop specific guidance to
   further enhance fish passage survival.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium nitride (TiN) is a biocompatible material and has very low
   electrical resistance. Electrochemical control of pathogenic microbes
   derived from a drinking water distribution system was investigated using
   a TiN electrode. When a potential of 1.2 V vs saturated calomel
   electrode (SCE) was applied, the survival ratio of microorganisms
   decreased to below 40\%. Changes in pH were not observed at 1.2 V vs
   SCE. Also, by applying -0.6 V vs SCE for 30 min, 69\% of cells on the
   electrode surface were detached by the electrostatic repulsion.
   Therefore, an electrochemical disinfection reactor using a TiN mesh as
   the working electrode and the counter electrode was constructed. The
   drinking water containing mean viable cell concentration of 73 cells/ml
   was continuously passed through the reactor at a flow rate of 15 ml/min.
   The viable cell concentration in treated water decreased to below 5
   cells/ml. When no potential was applied, cell concentration in treated
   water gradually increased after 200 h of reactor operation. In contrast,
   when alternating potentials of 1.2 and -0.6 V vs silver/silver chloride
   (Ag/AgCl) were applied to the TiN mesh working electrode, the viable
   cell concentration remained below 100 cells/ml during a 440 h operation.
   The reactor for drinking water disinfection incorporated with the TiN
   mesh electrode worked effectively by applying alternating potentials of
   1.2 and -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Relapses are common in children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, and
   this prospective study looks into the possibility of decreasing the

   includes 36 children with a steroid-dependent, relapsing nephrotic
   syndrome on a maintenance prednisone therapy of about 0.5 mg/kg every
   other day, They were prospectively divided into two groups with
   comparable age and sex distribution and the number of those who had
   previously received cyclophosphamide therapy. Group 1 patients were
   advised to take daily prednisone for 5 days, starting at the time of the
   onset of an upper respiratory tract infection (URI), No such advice was
   given to those in group 2, and they remained on alternate-day prednisone
   during URI. At the end of a 2-year follow-up period, the total number of

Abstract = {{A few widely used primary incident wave models for pyramidal horn
   antenna analysis are compared on the basis of gain calculations. The
   analysis is based on edge-wave diffraction theory, as presented in a
   recent publication, with some modifications made to the underlying
   theory, It is shown that these models agree well for high-gain horns
   with small flare angles, but that the differences are more profound for
   lower gain horns, where the flare angles are larger. The accuracy of the
   various models are studied by comparing the results to actual
   measurements. The respective effects of amplitude and phase variation in
   the primary incident wave are also illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{Background Deaths caused by substance abuse, circulatory disorders, and
   external causes such as suicide, homicide, and accidents are more likely
   to occur during the first week of the month than the last week of the
   preceding month. The purpose of this report is to determine if death
   caused by acute myocardial infarction occurs more often in the first 7
   days of the month than in the last 7 days of the preceding month.
   Methods and Results This study used computerized death records for
   Washington state from 1988 to 1997. There were 401,314 deaths, of which
   33,436 (8.3\%) had an underlying cause of acute myocardial infarction.
   The week of the month during which death occurred was defined as
   occurring during the first 7 days of the month or the last 7 days of the
   preceding month. R, the ratio of the number of deaths during the first 7
   days of the month to the number of deaths in the last 7 days of the
   preceding month multiplied by 100, was calculated, as were 95\%
   confidence intervals. R values For other cardiac causes and substance
   abuse-related causes were also calculated. Deaths caused by acute
   myocardial infarction occurred more often in the first week of the month
   than in the lost week of the previous month (R = 104.4, 95\% confidence
   interval 101.7-107.8). This pattern of death was most apparent for
   individuals greater than or equal to 75 years of age (R = 107.3, 95\%
   confidence interval 102.1-111.1) and was not evident for other cardiac
   causes, including congestive heart failure or myocardial ischemia. By
   comparison, substance abuse-related deaths occurred much more frequently
   during the first week of the month (R = 117.6, 95\% confidence interval
   110.0-125.8).
   Conclusions This pattern of death for acute myocardial infarction may be
   in part caused by stressful events associated with the first week of the
   month.}},

Abstract = {{1 Stable clones of HEK293 cells expressing either FLAG(TM)
   epitope-tagged, wild type human beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors or
   C-terminally green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged forms of these
   receptors were established.
   2 The binding affinity of {[}H-3]-dihydroalprenolol and other Ligands
   was little affected by addition of GFP to the C-terminal of either
   receptor.
   3 Isoprenaline induced the internalisation of both
   beta(1)-adrenoceptor-GFP and beta(2)-adrenoceptor-GFP and following
   removal of the agonist both constructs were able to recycle to the cell
   surface.
   4 The extent of internalisation of beta(2)-adrenoceptor-GFP produced by
   isoprenaline was substantially greater than for
   beta(1)-adrenoceptor-GFP,
   5 C-terminal addition of GFP slowed markedly the rate of internalization
   of both the beta(1)-adrenoceptor and the beta(2)-adrenoceptor in
   response to isoprenaline.
   6 Sustained exposure to isoprenaline (24 h) produced substantially
   greater levels of downregulation of native beta(2)-adrenoceptor compared
   to beta(2)-adrenoceptor-GFP although both were equally effectively
   removed from the plasma membrane.
   7 Sustained exposure to isoprenaline resulted in a large fraction of
   beta(2)-adrenoceptor-GFP becoming trapped in internal vesicles/lysosomes
   but not degraded.
   8 Even after sustained exposure to isoprenaline a significant fraction
   of beta(1)-adrenoceptor-GFP remained at the cell surface.
   9 These results indicate that although GFP tagging of beta-adrenoceptors
   can provide qualitative visual patterns of agonist-induced receptor
   trafficking and regulation in HEK293 cells the quantitative details vary
   markedly from those obtained with the unmodified receptors.}},

Abstract = {{There is not a strong research basis for current views of the importance

   This study compared 1 day versus 3 days of resistance training per week
   in recreational weight trainers with the training volume held constant
   between the treatments. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2
   groups: 1 day per week of 3 sets to failure (1DAY) or 3 days per week of
   1 set to failure (3DAY). Relative intensity (percent of initial 1
   repetition maximum {[}1RM]) was varied throughout the study in both
   groups by using a periodized repetition range of 3-10. Volume
   (repetitions x mass) did not differ (p less than or equal to 0.05)
   between the groups over the 12 weeks. The 1RMs of various upper- and
   lower-body exercises were assessed at baseline and at weeks 6 and 12.
   The 1RMs increased (p less than or equal to 0.05) significantly for the
   combined groups over time. The 1DAY group achieved similar to 62\% of
   the 1RM increases observed in the 3DAY group in both upper-body and
   lower-body lifts. Larger increases in lean body mass were apparent in
   the 3DAY group. The findings suggest that a higher frequency of
   resistance training, even when volume is held constant, produces
   superior gains in 1RM. However, training only 1 day per week was an
   effective means of increasing strength, even in experienced recreational
   weight trainers. From a dose-response perspective, with the total volume
   of exercise held constant, spreading the training frequency to 3 doses
   per week produced superior results.}},

Abstract = {{The low-humidity IB crystal form of aspartame
   (L-alpha-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester) is prepared via
   humidityinduced transition from the highly hydrated IA crystal form and
   is used widely as a sweetener. The crystal structure of the low-humidity
   IB form is determined at 1.05 Angstrom resolution (0.476 Angstrom(-1) in
   maximum sin theta/lambda) from an extremely fine fibrous crystal using
   synchrotron radiation. There are three aspartame molecules and two water
   molecules in the asymmetric unit of the monoclinic space group P2(1).
   Each aspartame molecule adopts an almost identical extended conformation
   which is commonly observed in other crystal forms of aspartame. Three
   aspartame molecules are assembled into a triangular trimer, and trimer
   units are stacked along the b-axis via hydrogen-bonding and
   electrostatic interactions in the main chains and also via hydrophobic
   contacts in the phenyl side-chains. Six trimer units are related by
   pseudo 6(1)-screw axis symmetry and form a hydrophilic channel at their
   center. The hydrophilic channel in the is form contains only four water
   molecules in the unit cell, compared with 16 in the IA form. Although
   the IB form exhibits a trimer structure similar to that of the IA form,
   one aspartame molecule is rotated by approximate to 20 degrees from the
   orientation in the IA form. This arrangement of the molecule implies
   that the humidity-induced transition is accompanied by a flapping motion
   of its methyl ester group. These structural differences may imply the
   stepwise transition from the IA to the IB forms.}},

Abstract = {{Objective--To determine the relationship between plasma beta-endorphin
   (EN) concentrations and exercise intensity and duration in horses.
   Animals--8 mares with a mean age of 6 years (range, 3 to 13 years) and
   mean body weight of 450 kg,
   Procedure--Horses were exercised for 20 minutes at 60\% of maximal
   oxygen consumption ((V) over dot O(2)max) and to fatigue at 95\% (V)
   over dot O-2 max. Plasma EN concentrations were determined before
   exercise, after a 10-minute warmup period, after 5, 10, 15, and 20
   minutes at 60\% (V)over dot O-2 max or at the point of fatigue (95\% (V)
   over dot O-2 max), and at regular intervals after exercise. Glucose
   concentrations were determined at the same times EN concentrations were
   measured. Plasma lactate concentration was measured 5 minutes after
   exercise.
   Results--Maximum EN values were recorded 0 to 45 minutes after horses
   completed each test. Significant time and intensity effects on EN
   concentrations were detected. Concentrations were significantly higher
   following exercise at 95\% (V) over dot O-2,max, compared with those
   after 20 minutes of exercise at 60\% (V) over dot O(2)max (605.2 +/-
   140.6 vs 312.3 +/- 53.1 pg/ml). Plasma EN concentration was not related
   to lactate concentration and was significantly but weakly correlated
   with glucose concentration for exercise at both intensities (r = 0.21
   and 0.30 for 60 and 95\% (V) over dot O(2)max, respectively).
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance--A critical exercise threshold exists
   for EN concentration in horses, which is 60\% (V) over dot O(2)max or
   less and is related to exercise intensity and duration. Even under
   conditions of controlled exercise there may be considerable differences
   in EN concentrations between horses. This makes the value of comparing
   horses on the basis of their EN concentration questionable.}},

Abstract = {{Shells belonging to the bivalve genus Corbicula occur commonly in
   Pleistocene interglacial deposits in NW Europe. These have usually been
   identified as C. fluminalis, a modern species described from the
   Euphrates river, although thr veracity of this specific attribution
   remains equivocal. Corbicula has nowadays a southern distribution, and
   laboratory studies indicate that it is thermophilous. It is also
   tolerant of brackish water, one of several attributes that make this an
   effective colonizer.
   In NW Europe, Corbicula is known from the Lower Pleistocene but is
   absent from the Cromerian Complex, occuring again in the three
   interglacials following the Anglian/Elsterian. It appears to be unknown
   from the last interglacial, except as derived fossils.}},

Abstract = {{Several techniques have been developed to diagnose Helicobacter pylori
   infection and two noninvasive methods are available: carbon 13-urea
   breath test (UBT) and serology. Measurement of IgG serum antibodies by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a reliable and inexpensive
   method for detection of infection. The aim of this study was to assess
   the seroconversion by different techniques after five to eight years. In
   1990, 588 of 1010 asymptomatic donors were found to be seronegative by
   ELISA, based on an N. pylori whole-cell suspension lysate (sensitivity
   and specificity: 92\% and 97\%). In 1995 serum samples from 418 of 588
   seronegative donors were collected and retested using the same antigen.
   411 of 418 samples were frankly negative, and 7 donors were found to be
   seroconverted. This group of seven sera represents the object of the
   study. They were retested by ELISA and western blotting using a
   different antigen (NCTC). To standardize our techniques, sera from 43 H.
   pylori positive and 47 H. pylori negative patients according to culture,
   histology, urease test, and UBT were used. The cutoff for ELISA-NCTC was
   0.53 AI (absorbance index) (mean value + 2 SD), and for western blotting
   was negativity for CagA or <10 bands (sensitivity and specificity: 95\%
   and 96\%; 98\% and 81\% for ELISA and western blotting respectively).
   According to the results obtained in 1990 and 1995, seven donors were
   found to be seroconverted by ELISA using sonicated antigen; in five the
   seroconversion was confirmed by ELISA using NCTC antigen and in two
   there was concordance with WB. Four of the seven donors were contacted
   and asked to undergo UBT and a further serum sample was drawn to be
   reassessed in 1998. A seroconversion was found in all four donors by
   ELISA while WB and UBT confirmed the seroconversion in only three of
   four donors. In conclusion the in-house ELISA used performed well
   compared to other theoretically better serologic assays and confirmed
   the low seroconversion rate for N. pylori infection in adult populations
   living in developed countries.}},

Abstract = {{The shape memory properties have been studied in a Ti36Ni49Hf15 high

   TiNiHf alloy is deformed at the room temperature. The shape recovery
   ratio is constant at 92\% when the deformation temperature is below 457
   K, then rapidly decreases to zero above 590 K for the specimen deformed
   to 4.5\%. Obvious two-way shape memory effect (TWSME) is obtained in the
   Ti36Ni49Hf15 alloy aged at 973 K for various hours. As the aging time
   further increases, the TWSME decreases. Moreover, TWSME in the aged
   Ti36Ni49Hf15 alloy is unstable and decreases rapidly after several

Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1188-1195}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background, A 1988 study indicated that older adults made up a
   substantial portion of regular patients seen in private dental
   practices. A follow-up study was conducted in 1998 to track changes over
   the decade in the participating practices.
   Methods, The authors collected data from respondents to the 1988 survey
   again in 1998. The authors received complete data from 41.7 percent of
   the original respondents who still were practicing at their 1988
   addresses. Dentists kept a log of all procedures provided in their
   practices in one day. The authors attributed values of services in both
   years, using a 1997 national estimate of fees.
   Results, The authors found that the percentage of office visits,
   services provided and patient expenditures attributed to patients 65
   years of age or older exceeded the percentage of the population in that
   age group. In four of the five age groups in which patients had the
   highest mean expenditures, patients were 60 years of age or older.
   Patients 60 years of age or older accounted for 28.8 percent of all
   patient expenditures, a 12.1 percent increase from 1988. Longitudinal
   analyses indicated that between 1988 and 1998, dentists 40 years of age
   or older experienced increases of 30.3 to 64.3 percent in the proportion
   of visits, services and expenditures by patients 65 years of age or
   older.
   Conclusions, The results of this investigation illustrate the importance
   of older adults to dental practices. Data from the practices of dentists
   who participated in both surveys show increases in the percentage of
   total dental visits, total eel-vices provided and total patient
   expenditures attributed to older adults.
   Clinical Implications, Older adults continue to have a disproportionate
   and positive impact on the surveyed dental practices and their financial
   well-being. Dentists should reevaluate the accessibility of their
   practices to this population. Rather than waiting for the practice to
   ``age,{''} dentists may want to structure their practices in ways that
   appeal directly to older adults and work to even better understand the
   needs and preferences of older patients already in their practices.}},

Title = {{Involvement of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 in the regulation of the
   UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A7 (UGT1A7) gene in rat hepatocytes}},

Abstract = {{UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A7 (UGT1A7) is a major UGT contributing to
   the glucuronidation of xenobiotic phenols in rats. Its expression in rat
   liver is tightly regulated, with low constitutive and high inducible
   expression in response to aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands and
   oltipraz. Previously, we reported the absence of 3-methylcholanthrene-
   or oltipraz-responsive elements in the 1.6-kbp region flanking the
   UGT1A7 promoter. However, potential binding sites were noted for several
   liver-enriched transcription factors. Here we show that deletion of the
   hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)3, HNF4, and CCAAT-enhancer binding
   protein-like binding sites had no effect on the expression of a UGT1A7
   reporter plasmid, p(-965/+56)1A7-Luc, in primary rat hepatocytes. The
   full activity of the promoter was contained in the region between bases
   -157 and +76. Two sites of binding by rat liver nuclear proteins were
   detected in this region by DNase footprinting. PR-1 corresponded to the
   HNF1-like binding site between bases -52 and -38, whereas PR-2 was
   located between -30 to -6. Gel retardation studies supported the
   presence of HNF1 alpha in the PR-1 DNA-liver nuclear protein complex.
   Mutation of PR-1 inhibited binding in the gel shift assay, prevented
   activation by overexpressed HNF1 in human embryonic kidney cells, and
   reduced by >80\% the maximal luciferase activities expressed from basal
   and 3-methylcholanthrene-responsive UGT1A7 gene reporter constructs in
   primary rat hepatocytes. These data provide evidence for an important
   stimulatory role of HNF1 in promoting UGT1A7 gene expression in rat
   liver.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulation of grain drying in a vertical cylindrical bed has

   model (Local Temperature Equilibrium Model: LTEModel). The air-grain
   mass transfer is expressed with a drying rate equation outcome from
   experiments. The resolution of the equations set is carried out, using a
   finite volume method. Different effects, such as the effect of the
   porosity variation on energy and mass transport, are discussed.
   Sensitivity to external conditions is determined. Finally, validity of
   local thermal assumption is examined. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Decisions by patients upon when to use health care services are a major
   influence on the consumption of health care resources. Patient education
   - often based upon written information on how to identify symptoms of
   common illnesses, when to seek help and how to self-treat - is an
   increasingly popular strategy to rationalise demand. A large body of
   literature, in evaluating the impact of such written information, has
   though overlooked the possession or acquisition of comparable
   publications by respondents in the course of the studies.. This study
   attempted to overcome this limitation in considering the impact of a
   prominent patient education booklet that makes reference to over 40
   common ailments. Questionnaire data from a cohort sample of residents (n
   = 495) in an area within which the booklet was circulated and that from
   a comparison area (n = 509) suggests that such literature exerts a
   modest influence in orienting patients towards `` appropriate{''}
   self-referral and self-care behaviour. Reasons for this limited impact
   emerged however in semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample of
   respondents (n = 85). These data show that understanding of the way in
   which written advice for patients is perceived has to focus upon the
   ways in which diverse sub-populations process and attribute meaning to
   `` official{''} and ``unofficial{''} sources of advice. More
   fundamentally, the increasingly sophisticated and specialised nature of
   medical and scientific knowledge may be distancing expert knowledge from
   individuals and society such that ``lay{''} responses to ``expert{''}
   advice now reflect a continuing process of risk assessment, trust or the
   withholding of trust. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Two closely linked genes, un-24 and het-6, associated with the het-6
   heterokaryon incompatibility functional haplotype were examined in 40
   Neurospora crassa strains from a Louisiana sugarcane field. Partial
   diploid analyses were used to determine that half of the strains were
   functionally Oak Ridge (OR) and half were non-OR and indistinguishable
   from the standard Panama (PA) form. PCR-based markers were developed to
   identify polymorphisms within both un-24 and het-6, Two common forms of
   each gene occur based on these molecular markers. Rare forms of both
   un-24 and het-6 were identified as variants of the non-OR form by a DNA
   transformation assay. The heterokaryon incompatibility function of
   haplotypes, based on partial diploid analyses, was perfectly correlated
   with the PCR-based markers at both loci. This correlation indicates that
   the two loci are in severe linkage disequilibrium in this population
   sample and may act as an incompatibility gene complex. Southern
   hybridizations using OR- and PA-derived cloned probes from the region
   that spans un-24 and het-6 showed that the apparent absence of
   recombination in this similar to 25-kbp region is associated with low
   levels of overall sequence identity between the PA and OR forms. (C)

Abstract = {{The present study aimed to investigate the validity of bioelectrical

   of the upper arm. Bioelectrical impedance of the right upper arm and the
   thickness of elbow flexor and extensor muscles were measured from 26
   healthy young adult men using a specially designed bioelectrical
   impedance data acquisition system and brightness-mode ultrasound
   apparatus, respectively. As reference data, the muscle volume (MVMRI) of
   the right upper arm was determined using a magnetic resonance imaging
   method. The impedance index was calculated as L-2/Z, where L is the
   upper arm length and Z is the impedance of the shoulder to the elbow.
   The muscle volume (MVULT) was calculated as pi . (d/2)(2) . L, where d
   is muscle thickness. L-2/Z and MVULT were significantly correlated with
   MVMRI with correlation coefficients of 0.971 and 0.962, respectively. In
   these relationships, the standard errors of estimation were 44.2 cm(3)
   (6.3\%) for L-2/Z and 50.7 cm(3) (7.2\%) for MVULT. There was no
   significant difference between the absolute errors of muscle volumes
   estimated by L-2/Z and MVULT: 36.2 (4.8, SEM) cm(3) for L-2/Z versus
   40.3 (5.8) cm for MVULT. The present results suggest that both

Abstract = {{A fieldworthy system was developed to quantify the eyelid movements in
   clinical sites. The system consists of a home-use charge-coupled device
   video camera, a processing unit, and a personal computer. A white marker
   of 4-mm diameter and 30-mg weight is attached to the lower margin of the
   upper eyelid. The processing unit automatically detects the vertical
   displacement of the upper edge of the marker: One marker is attached to
   each eye so that the movements of the both eyelids are measured with one
   camera simultaneously. The measurement error of the system was evaluated
   in experiments on eight healthy subjects and eight patients with eyelid
   paralysis. The mean of the absolute error of peak amplitudes occurring
   in 2 min was 0.81 mm, with the worst error being +1.7 mm, The
   reproducibility of the mean peak amplitude measured on five consecutive
   days was within 1 mm. The mean peak amplitudes of both eyes were
   measured preoperatively and postoperatively for approximately three
   months for three patients who mere operated on to remove vestibular
   schwannoma, The results demonstrated basic clinical utility of the

Abstract = {{Ultrastructural changes in gill chloride cells during smoltification
   were examined in wild and hatchery-reared masu salmon. On the filament,
   two types of chloride cells (alpha and beta) and accessory cells were
   observed in wild fish from January (parr) to May (full-smolt), while
   only alpha and accessory cells (alpha-a cells) were observed in
   hatchery-reared fish from March (pre-smolt) to May (full-smolt). Among
   alpha-a cells of both types of fish, development of rough endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus was detected in pre-smelt before
   full-smelt. However, ultrastructural changes were not revealed in beta
   cells of wild fish during smoltification. During smoltification, the
   alpha-a cell number increased and beta cell number decreased. On the
   lamella, only one type of chloride cell was observed in both wild and
   hatchery-reared fish during smoltification. Their ultrastructural
   changes were almost the same as those in filament alpha-a cells, and
   their number declined during smoltification. Although there was almost
   no difference between changes in ultrastructure or in the number of
   chloride cells in both wild and hatchery-reared fish during
   smoltification, the chloride cell number of hatchery-reared fish varied
   widely in comparison to that in wild fish. The present study is the

   reversal potential close to +30 mV, which gave a P-Na/P-k = 3.47. The
   inward and outward components of the current nearly disappeared when

Abstract = {{Objectives. To estimate the health effects of postmenopausal hormone
   therapy used for 10 or 20 years in a population of intermediate
   cardiovascular risk.
   Design. Using existing estimates of the effect of hormone therapy on
   rates of myocardial infarction, hip fracture and breast cancer, a
   proportional multistage life table was generated to calculate the
   effects of use for 10 and 20 years in a synthetic cohort of Dutch women
   aged 55 with an average and a high-risk profile for cardiovascular
   disease.
   Results. A woman of the general population who starts hormone therapy at
   age 55 for 10 years can prolong her life by 1 month and may postpone the
   occurrence of first incidence of one of the diseases under consideration
   by 2.4 months. One excess breast cancer case is likely to occur per 5-6
   averted cases of first myocardial infarction or hip fracture. If she
   prolongs her use to 20 years, the gain of life expectancy and
   disease-free life expectancy is doubled. The risk-benefit ratio worsens
   to one extra breast cancer per 3-4 averted cases of the preventable
   diseases. For a woman with a high-risk profile, the gains in health are
   about twice as high as for her counterpart in the general population,
   and her risk-benefit ratio is also more favourable. Yet, the
   risk-benefit ratio still worsens for 20 as compared with 10 years of
   use.
   Conclusions. Women from the general population in the Netherlands and
   similar populations can achieve only a modest gain in life expectancy by
   using hormones during 10 or 20 years following menopause. This is a
   consequence of the low incidence of myocardial infarction and hip
   fracture and the relatively high incidence of breast cancer before the
   age of 75. Women at increased cardiovascular risk can benefit more from
   hormone therapy. But even amongst these women, the risk of breast cancer
   incurred with long-term use offsets much of the benefit that could
   accrue from changing the risk of heart disease and hip fracture.}},

Abstract = {{The role of the different cytoskeletal structures like microfilaments
   (MF), microtubuli (MT), and intermediate filaments (IF) in phagosome
   motion is unclear. These cytoskeletal units play an important role in

   investigated ferromagnetic phagosome motions by cell magnetometry.
   J774A.1 macrophages were incubated with 1.3-mu m spherical magnetite
   particles for 24 h, after which more than 90\% of the particles had been
   phagocytized. Phagosome motions can be caused either by the cell itself
   (relaxation) or by applying magnetic twisting forces, yielding cell
   stiffness and viscoelastic properties of the cytoskeleton, Apparent
   viscosity of the cytoplasm was non-Newtonian and showed a
   shear-rate-dependent power law behavior. Elastically stored energy does
   not force the magnetic phagosomes back to their initial orientation:
   57\% of the twisting shear was not recoverable. Cytoskeletal drugs, like
   Cytochalasin D (CyD, 2 - 4 mu M), Colchicine (CoL, 10 mu M), or
   Acrylamide (AcL, 40 mM) were added in order to disturb the different

   +/- 0.01 after 5 min versus 0.34 +/- 0.01 in control), whereas phagosome
   twisting shows only a small response with a 9\% increase of stiffness
   and a small reduction of recoverable strain. Col depolymerizes the MT,
   inducing a moderately accelerated relaxation (relative decay 0.28 +/-
   0.01 after 5 min) and a 10\% increase of cell stiffness, where the pure
   viscous shear is increased and the viscoelastic recoil is inhibited by
   40\%. Combining the two drugs conserves both effects. After
   disintegrating either MF or MT, phagosome motion and cytoskeletal
   stiffness reflect the behavior of either MT or MF, respectively. The
   results verify that the dominant phagosome transport mechanism is
   MF-associated. MT depolymerization by Col induces an activation of the
   F-actin synthesis, which may induce an accelerated relaxation and an
   increase of stiffness. Cell mechanical properties are not modulated by
   MF depolymerization, whereas MT depolymerization causes a loss of
   viscous resistance and a loss of cell elasticity. The mean energy for
   stochastic phagosome transport is 5{*}10(-18) Joules and corresponds to
   a force of 7 pN on a single 1.3-mu m phagosome.}},

   Samples analysed have been obtained from fruits of different trees (one
   for each of the varieties: `Moro','Tarocco', `Sanguinello' and
   `Sanguinello nocellare') harvested about every 15 days during the 1998
   productive season. Seasonal variation has been also evaluated. HPLC
   results were compared with spectrophotometric measurements, using a
   calibration curve obtained for cyanidin-3-glucoside solutions. The two

   polypeptide associated with GLRaV-1 using a Tricine sodium dodecyl
   sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system. Concentrated p37
   preparations were used to immunize mice for the production of monoclonal
   antibodies (MAb). Serum collected from the immunized mice showed
   reactivity with the 37-kDa polypeptide but no reactivity with the 38-kDa
   polypeptide associated with GLRaV-1 using the Western blot assay. The
   polyclonal antiserum reacted to both native and heat-denatured virus
   preparations. Two sets of anti-p37 MAbs were developed. One set binds
   p37 and also cross reacts with other GLRaV proteins, such as p36 of
   GLRaV-4 and -5, while the second set recognizes p37 specifically We
   obtained the partial nucleotide sequence of the putative p37 viral

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the usefulness of percent free serum
   prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a predictor of the pathological
   features of prostate cancer.
   Materials and Methods: Total and free serum PSA were measured
   preoperatively in 220 consecutive patients with clinically localized
   prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy, Organ-confined
   disease and favorable pathology were considered as the outcomes for this
   study.
   Results: Percent free serum PSA was not able to predict these outcomes
   in the overall population. However, it could significantly predict
   favorable pathology in a subset of patients in whom digital rectal
   examination (DRE) was normal and total PSA ranged from 4.1 to 10 ng/ml,
   A 11\% cutoff provided a significant distribution with an odds ratio of
   2.8 (95\% confidence interval 1.1-7.0), a positive predictive value of
   63.3\% and a negative predictive value of 46.3\%,
   Conclusions: According to these results, we suggest that percent free
   PSA may provide additional information for the staging of clinically
   localized prostate cancer. However, the reference population for its
   usefulness would be those patients with normal DRE and total PSA between
   4.1 and 10 ng/ml. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG. Basel.}},

Abstract = {{Short-period, three-component recordings from peaceful nuclear
   explosions (PNE) of the profile QUARTZ,located in Russia, are used to
   constrain the nature of the coda of PNE arrivals. In particular, we
   examine the unusually strong and extensive coda of the long-range
   P(n)(interpreted as a whispering-gallery, WG) phase propagating to
   beyond 3000 km. Energy-balance considerations in three dimensions show
   that such an extensive coda is inherent not only to WG but to all other
   P-wave phases and can be explained by crustal scattering. The long coda
   is a result of excitation of short-period scattered waves (Pg, Sg, Lg,
   Rg) within the crust by the waves incident from the mantle, or,
   conversely, by generation of mantle phases from crustal guided waves
   within the source region. The resulting estimates of coda Q range
   between Q = 380 near 2 Hz and Q = 430 near 5 Hz and can be associated
   with crustal attenuation including the sediments. Our coda model also
   explains quantitatively the observed build-up of the arrival amplitude
   with time and the apparent lack of a pronounced coda of the body-wave
   arrivals from the mantle transition zone. These effects result from
   adding up the energy of the later arrivals arriving during the codas of
   earlier arrivals. We ``deconvolve{''} the overlapping coda patterns and
   show that the true relative energies of the arrivals are significantly
   lower than the apparent energies measured from the raw records. A
   whispering-gallery interpretation of the long-range P(n) and crustal
   scattering accounts for the entire range of observations of kinematic,
   spectral, and amplitude pattern of the PNE wavefield and allows the
   derivation of constraints on attenuation.}},

Abstract = {{Are maternal cohabitation and remarriage equivalent routes to the
   economic recovery of children and their mothers following parental
   divorce and separation? Unlike previous studies that have been primarily
   cross-sectional in design, this study uses panel data from the National
   Longitudinal Survey of Youth-Child Supplement to make both absolute and
   relative comparisons of potential economic returns. Also investigated is
   how income from spouses and partners is combined with income from other
   sources to support children, and the extent to which economic hardship
   over time relates to mothers' union experiences. Findings show that
   while in absolute terms, remarriage is economically more advantageous
   than cohabitation, cohabitation and remarriage are equivalent in their
   ability to restore family income to prior levels. Cohabiting mothers
   start off in a weaker economic position prior to divorce, however and
   continue to rely on income from employment and AFDC to a greater extent
   than do remarried mothers. Over time, cohabitation, even when it results
   in a stable union, is a comparatively poor mechanism for maintaining
   economic recovery for the children of divorce. The extent of economic
   difficulties experienced by children whose mothers ``unstably{''}

Abstract = {{In many, but not all societies, dark skin color is associated with high
   blood pressure. Whether the association between skin color and blood
   pressure is independent of known determinants of blood pressure remains
   controversial. We examined the association between skin color and blood
   pressure in 835 Egyptian adults (370 men and 465 women) participating in
   the National Hypertension Project, a national survey of hypertension
   prevalence and blood pressure-related complications conducted in Egypt
   during 1991-1993. Skin color was assessed by measuring the concentration
   of cutaneous melanin in an unexposed area with the use of reflectance
   spectrophotometry. Higher concentrations of melanin were associated with
   lower body mass index, less education, manual labor (among men), and a
   lower urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio (among women). In multivariate
   regression analyses adjusted for age, body mass index, and education,
   there was a significant nonlinear association between blood pressure and
   skin color among women; in the lower to intermediate range of skin
   pigmentation, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were higher in
   women with greater concentrations of cutaneous melanin. In men, blood
   pressure was not associated with skin color. When we used a subjective
   assessment of skin color, there was no significant difference in blood
   pressure between black-skinned Egyptians (predominantly of Nubian
   descent) and fair-skinned Egyptians for either gender. While the
   significant relationship in women appeared to be independent of known
   risk factors for hypertension, residual confounding may explain the
   association.}},

Abstract = {{Jury awards are often criticized as being arbitrary and excessive. This
   paper speaks to that controversy reporting data from interviews with
   civil jurors' accounts of the strategies that juries use anti the
   factors that they consider in arriving at a collective award. Jurors
   reported difficulty in deciding on awards, describing it as ``the
   hardest part{''} of jury service and were surprised the court did not
   provide more guidance to them. Relatively few jurors entered the jury
   deliberation room with a specific award figure in mind. Once in the
   deliberation room, however they reported discussing a variety of
   relevant factors such as the seriousness of the injury, the plaintiff's
   age, and occasionally even more esoteric items such as the impact of
   inflation. Two frequent topics of discussion, attorneys' fees and
   insurance, suggest that jurors attempt to estimate the actual impact of
   an award on both defendant and plaintiff This descriptive account may
   help to inform the debate about whether jurors require additional
   guidance or information in the award process.}},

Journal = {{NURSE EDUCATION TODAY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{435-442}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Although research based practice is being increasingly extolled by both
   the government and the profession, no clear educational strategy exists
   as to how practitioners should be supported in achieving this goal.
   Furthermore, the effectiveness of educational interventions in fostering
   a positive attitude to research, or a change towards a greater
   prevalence of research based practice, remains unknown. However,
   research has indicated that practitioners are dissatisfied with their
   research skills and the opportunities to enhance them.
   This paper describes a series of nine workshops on research utilization
   which were undertaken in a range of Trusts throughout England. The
   primary purpose of the workshops was to help nurses, health visitors and
   midwives to:
   Critically appraise research
   Implement research in their place of work.
   The workshops were evaluated by two methods - a written semi-structured
   questionnaire and a qualitative study focused on three sites which used
   pre-workshop telephone interviews and post-workshop focus groups.
   Overall the workshops were effective in reducing fear and lack of
   understanding of research, alleviating the problem of jargon, and
   increasing the skills of critical appraisal. Although the participants'
   attitude to research was not changed by attending the workshops - it was
   positive before the workshop and remained so-several personal and
   professional benefits were accrued. The implications of this evaluation
   for practice, education, and research are discussed. (C) 2000 Harcourt

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES We sought to determine the effects of oral L-arginine and the
   hexamethyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor atorvastatin on
   endothelial function in young patients with type I diabetes mellitus
   (DM).
   BACKGROUND Endothelial dysfunction, a key early event in
   atherosclerosis, occurs in young patients with type I DM, and its
   reversal may benefit the progression of vascular disease. Cholesterol
   reduction in L-arginine improve endothelial function in nondiabetic
   subjects, but their effect in patients with type I DM is unknown.
   METHODS In a double-blind, 2 X 2 factorial study, we investigated the
   effect of L-arginine (7 g twice daily) and atorvastatin (40 mg/day) on
   conduit artery vascular function in 84 normocholesterolemic young adults
   (mean +/- SD: age 34 rears {[}range 18 to 46], low density lipoprotein
   {[}LDL] cholesterol 2.96 +/- 0.89 mmol/liter) with type I DM. Brachial
   artery dilation to flow (flow-mediated dilation {[}FMD]) and to the
   direct smooth muscle dilator glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) were assessed
   noninvasively using high resolution ultrasound at baseline and after six
   weeks of treatment.
   RESULTS Atorvastatin resulted in a 48 +/- 10\% decrease in serum LDL
   cholesterol levels, whereas L-arginine levels increased by 247 +/- 141\%
   after L-arginine therapy. By analysis of covariance, treatment with
   atorvastatin resulted in a significant increase in FMD (p = 0.018.
   L-Arginine therapy had no significant effect on endothelial function,
   and there was no significant change in dilation to GTN after either
   intervention.
   CONCLUSIONS In young patients with type I DM, improvement in endothelial
   dysfunction can be demonstrated after just six weeks of treatment with
   atorvastatin. In contrast to studies of hypercholesterolemia, however,
   L-arginine had no benefit. Treatment with atorvastatin at an early stage
   may have an impact on the progression of atherosclerosis in these high
   risk patients. (C) 2000 by the American College of Cardiology.}},

Abstract = {{Monodisperse PMMA beads of a size varying between 200 and 400 nm have
   been prepared by a modified emulsion polymerization technique. These
   beads sediment well on substrates to form 3-dimensional face-centered

   (area up to 10 x 10 cm) with an opalescent layer of the beads thus
   creating films with opaline structure, which can be used as photonic
   crystals. Choosing PMMA as the material of the beads brings several
   advantages, e.g., the PMMA photonic films can be precisely patterned by
   e-beam lithography with the feature resolution down to one bead in width
   and various fluorescent dyes can be incorporated in PMMA balls.
   Dye-impregnated PMMA opaline photonic films demonstrate the incomplete

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{While a significant amount of work has been and continues to be devoted
   to the description and analysis of the technical performance of flexible
   AC transmission systems (FACTS), very little attention has been paid to
   the economics of these devices. The most frequently stated economic
   benefit of FACTS devices is that they enable postponement of network
   reinforcement, This paper describes a linear programming approach for
   computing the maximum savings in operating costs that could be secured
   from installing ultimate (100\%) FACTS, This gives the volume of the
   ``market{''} potentially available for FACTS. As the main aim of this
   paper is to assess the competitiveness of FACTS against network
   reinforcement, only FACTS devices used for active power control are
   modeled, The volume of the market for FACTS, defined as the difference
   between the gross benefit of full network flexibility and the net
   benefit of network reinforcement is determined for a wide range of line
   reinforcement costs. It is shown that economics of FACTS are system
   specific and depend strongly on the cost of reinforcement. It is further
   concluded that at values of network reinforcement costs presently used
   in practice, FACTS devices may find it difficult to compete favorably
   with network reinforcement. The model employed in this evaluation takes
   account of inter-temporal load variations as well as network security
   constraints in addition to the usual generator output and transmission
   thermal limits.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of ciliates as a food source to survival of
   first-feeding surgeonfish larvae, Paracanthurus hepatus, was examined in
   rearing experiments. The larvae were exposed to eight treatments; i.e. a
   tintinnid, Amphorellopsis acuta (1.0 x 10(4), 5.1 x 10(3) and 2.2 x
   10(3) cells l(-1)) and a naked ciliate, Euplotes sp. (1.3 x 10(4), 8.0 x
   10(3) and 5.0 x 10(3) cells l(-1)), plus two controls without ciliates.
   Highest survival of the larvae over the first 4-8 days was observed in
   the highest density of A. acuta. Rearing experiments also showed that
   the survivals of larvae fed with A. acuta were higher than those fed
   with Euplotes sp. Gut content analyses revealed loricae of A. acuta in
   the larvae. Although Euplotes sp. (lacking loricae) was never recognized
   in those larval guts, feeding on Euplotes sp. by larvae was confirmed
   using the ciliate labeled with fluorescent microspheres, implying that
   the feeding on naked ciliates by fish larvae has been overlooked. The
   results strongly suggested that both tintinnid and naked ciliates play
   important roles as alternative food sources to copepod nauplii by
   enhancing the survivability of fish larvae, especially those with a
   smaller mouth.}},

Abstract = {{1 The effects of bile acids on intracellular Ca2+ concentration
   {[}Ca2+](i) and nitric oxide production were investigated in vascular
   endothelial cells.
   2 Whole-cell patch clamp techniques and fluorescence measurements of
   {[}Ca2+](i) were applied in vascular endothelial cells obtained from
   human umbilical and calf aortic endothelial cells. Nitric oxide released
   was determined by measuring the concentration of NO2-.
   3 Deoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid and the taurine conjugates
   increased {[}Ca2+](i) concentration-dependently, while cholic acid
   showed no significant effect. These effects resulted from the first
   mobilization of Ca2+ from an inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)-sensitive
   store, which was released by ATP, then followed by Ca2+ influx.
   4 Both bile acids and ATP induced the activation of Ca2+-dependent K+
   current. Oscillations of {[}Ca2+](i) were occasionally monitored with
   the Ca2+-dependent K+ current in voltage-clamped cells and Ca2+
   measurements of single cells.
   5 The intracellular perfusion of heparin completely abolished the ATP
   effect, but failed to inhibit the bile acid effect.
   6 Deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid enhanced NO2- production
   concentration-dependently, while cholic acid did not enhance it.
   7 The bile acids-induced nitric oxide production was suppressed by
   NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, exclusion of extracellular Ca2+ or
   N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulphonamide hydrochloride (W-7)
   and calmidazolium, calmodulin inhibitors.
   8 These results provide novel evidence showing that bile acids increase
   {[}Ca2+](i) and subsequently nitric oxide production in vascular
   endothelial cells. The nitric oxide production induced by bile acids may
   be involved in the pathogenesis of circulatory abnormalities in liver
   diseases including cirrhosis.}},

Abstract = {{Secreted motility-stimulating factors are often expressed and secreted
   at low concentrations that are difficult to detect by Northern or
   Western blot analysis. Autotaxin (ATX) is a tumor-secreted autocrine
   motility-stimulating factor that has been associated with tumor invasion
   and metastatic potential. Although ATX has a number of enzymatic
   activities, it is most sensitively detected by its induced chemotactic
   response. After transfecting ATX cDNA into NIH3T3 fibroblasts, we
   developed a motility-based method to screen the resulting cloned cells
   for secretion of active protein. We placed the cloned and transfected
   cells into the bottom wells of a modified Boyden chamber and placed
   responding cells (A2058 human melanoma cells) into the upper wells.
   After overnight incubation, the membrane that separated the two chambers
   was removed and stained. Simple densitometry measurements were
   sufficiently accurate to determine which clones secreted active protein.
   Utilizing this method, 4 positive cell lines were chosen out of 36
   tested clones. Further tests on the expanded cell lines determined that
   all 4 were secreting ATX. Thus, this modified Boyden chamber assay
   appears to provide a rapid and highly adaptable means to identify cells
   that secrete motility-stimulating factors. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton

Abstract = {{Creep deformation behaviors in lamellar TiAl alloys have been
   investigated. As in the case with metals, the normal primary creep stage
   was observed. As creep strain increased within the primary regime,
   dislocation density decreased, and creep activation energy increased
   from 300 kJ/mol, the activation energy of the selfdiffusion of Ti in
   TiAl, to about 380 kJ/mol, that of steady state creep deformation.
   During primary creep deformation of lamellar TiAl, as the initial
   dislocation density decreased, the alpha(2)-phase was found to transform
   to a gamma-phase, generating new dislocations which contributed to the
   creep deformation. In other words, this phase transformation is the
   source of the dislocation generation for continuous creep deformation.
   Therefore, we suggest that phase transformation is the rate controlling
   processes having an activation energy of about 400 kJ/mol, which is
   higher than that of self-diffusion. A small amount of prestrain was
   found to be responsible for the reduction of initial dislocation
   density. In addition, this prestrained specimen showed significantly
   reduced primary creep strain, and the creep activation energy in the
   primary stage was measured to be about 380 kJ/mol. These results dearly
   confirm the suggested creep deformation mechanism of lamellar TiAl
   alloys.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes electrically conductive polymer blends consisting
   of polyaniline (PANI) dispersed in a polymer matrix. Melt blending of
   previously mixed, coagulated and dried aqueous dispersions of PANI and
   the polymer matrix lead to high conductivities at extremely low PANI
   concentrations (similar to0.5 wt\% PANI) In these blends the surface
   properties (surfactants used) of ate PANI and the polymer particles play
   a major role in the structuring process, in addition to the very small
   size of the PANI particles. In another approach i.e. conventional melt
   blending of PANI powder with a given polymer powder the success of
   generating an efficient conductive network depends on the PANI/polymer
   interaction level. A high interaction level for example similar
   solubility parameters) leads under dynamic hot blending conditions to
   the formation of conductive networks, but still at relatively high PANI
   concentration >10 wt\% PANI). To further reduce the PANI conductivity
   threshold concentration, ternary PANI/ polymer/polymer blends can be
   designed in which PANI is selectively attracted to the minor polymer
   component, thus generating double-percolation structures. The threshold
   PANI concentration in the ternary blends may be reduced by a factor of
   similar to2 compared to the binary blends. Further reduction ran be
   expected in special ternary blends designed so that the PANI particles
   will mostly locate at the interfaces, rather than within the dispersed
   minor polymer particles. The blending method of aqueous dispersions is
   limited to matrix polymers which can be synthesized by emulsion
   polymerization. Thus, the conventional melt blending procedure and also
   the formation of ternary blend systems are particularly beneficial for
   condensation type polymers, whereas melt blending of PANI/polymer
   powders prepared by the aqueous dispersions method is beneficial for the
   addition-type polymers. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   Raillet \& Henry, 1912 sp. were found in the esophagus and stomach of
   the great egret Egretta alba (Gmelin, 1789) (Aves: Ardeidae). The
   nematodes were identified as Contracaecum multipapillatum (Drasche,
   1882) on the basis of the following features: ratio of ventricular
   appendage length to esophagus length, ratio of intestinal caecum length
   to esophagus length, spicule lengths, number and arrangement of
   postcloacal papillae (3-4 pairs of adanal papillae, 1 double pair, and a
   subterminal group of 2 subventral and 3 sublateral pairs). A complete
   description of the adult specimens of C. multipapillatum is given in the
   present paper, together with a discussion regarding the validity of
   other species of Contracaecum reported from Argentina. Contracaecum
   philomultipapillatum Labriola and Suriano, 1996 is reduced to a junior
   synonym of C. multipapillatum, and Contracaecum longicaecum Schuurmans

Title = {{Comparison of heat and pressure treatments of skim milk, fortified with
   whey protein concentrate, for set yogurt preparation: effects on milk
   proteins and gel structure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DAIRY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{67}},

Pages = {{329-348}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Heat (85 degrees C for 20 min) and pressure (600 MPa for 15 min)
   treatments were applied to skim milli fortified by addition of whey
   protein concentrate. Both treatments caused > 90 \% denaturation of
   beta-lactoglobulin. During heat treatment this denaturation took place
   in the presence of intact casein micelles; during pressure treatment it
   occurred while the micelles were in a highly dissociated state. As a
   result micelle structure and the distribution of beta-lactoglobulin were
   different in the two milks. Electron microscopy and immunolabelling
   techniques were used to examine the milks after processing and during
   their transition to yogurt gels. The disruption of micelles by high
   pressure caused a significant change in the appearance of the milk which
   was quantified by measurement of the colour values L{*}, a{*} and b{*}.
   Heat treatment also affected these characteristics. Casein micelles are
   dynamic structures, influenced by changes to their environment. This was
   clearly demonstrated by the transition from the clusters of small
   irregularly shaped micelle fragments present in cold pressure-treated
   milk to round, sepal ate and compact micelles formed on farming the milk
   to 43 degrees C. The effect of this transition mas observed as
   significant changes in the colour indicators. During yogurt gel
   formation, further changes in micelle structure, occurring in both
   pressure and heat-treated samples, resulted in a convergence of colour
   values. However, the microstructure of the gels and their rheological
   properties were very different. Pressure-treated mill; yogurt had a much
   higher storage modulus but yielded more readily to large deformation
   than the heated milk yogurt. These changes in micelle structure during
   processing and yogurt preparation are discussed in terms of a recently
   published micelle model.}},

   dynamical relaxation behaviors of the thermoremanent magnetization

   A change in mineral nutrition (measured as mineral contents of the

   electrode array. A prototype of this new kind of analyser was developed
   and constructed to test the technique. Bench tests were performed to
   calibrate the prototype and the obtained results were comparable to
   those of commercial analysers. Body composition tests were conducted on
   67 subjects of both sexes. Besides the bioimpedance analysis,
   anthropometric measures, consisting of weight, height, circumference and
   skinfold thickness, were also obtained from the subjects to allow an
   estimation of the body composition from anthropometric equations
   established in the literature. The results point to a good correlation

Abstract = {{As inexpensive interventions gain empirical support, there is an
   increasing risk that such data may be used by health maintenance
   organizations to unfairly restrict the number and type of therapy
   sessions reimbursed for all clients, even those less likely to benefit

   clients who may not respond to specific therapies and to empirically
   support ways to treat them. Successful treatment of nonresponders is
   also valuable because predictors of treatment failure tend to predict
   cost related to medical and disability expenses. Using generalized
   anxiety disorder as an example, this article suggests a flexible and
   comprehensive approach to cost-benefit analysis in psychotherapy that
   includes clients who may not improve in response to current data-based
   interventions. In addition, suggestions are made for the identification

Abstract = {{Allogeneic or xenogenic tissues exhibit prolonged survival when grafted
   into the brain parenchyma in comparison to grafting into peripheral
   sites. The brain, therefore, has long been considered an immunologically
   privileged site. However, the immunological privilege of the brain is
   not absolute, and it cannot shield neural xenografts from rejection. In
   our laboratory, we are interested in determining how to prevent neural
   xenograft rejection. To do so, we need to first understand how the
   immune system responds to CNS antigens leading to graft rejection. In
   order to monitor immune system responses to CNS antigens an adoptive
   transfer system was used to directly track CNS antigen-specific CD4(+) T
   cell responses in vivo. This would then allow us to monitor changes in
   the number, activation state, and anatomic distribution of
   antigen-specific cells. We have found that, after intracerebral
   injection of xeno peptide antigens with adjuvant, antigen-specific cells
   accumulated in the cervical lymph node, proliferated there for several
   days, and then disappeared slowly from the nodes. Interestingly, peptide
   antigens given intracerebrally also stimulated a strong antigen-specific
   CD4(+) T cell response. Moreover, cells remaining in the lymph node 8
   days after antigen stimulation produce IL-2 with secondary antigenic
   challenge. Previous studies have shown that the administration of
   antigens without adjuvant in a monomeric form via either the
   intraperitoneal or intravenous route has failed to induce cell-mediated
   immunity and resulted in antigen-specific T cell unresponsiveness. Our
   findings demonstrate that antigen delivered intracerebrally can activate
   immune responses in a manner different than antigen delivered to
   peripheral sites outside of the CNS. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Levels of elastin-derived peptides (EDP) were determined by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in sera of 28 children with
   Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (mean age 11.6 +/- 2.8
   years, diabetes duration 5.1 +/- 2.5 years). None of the children had
   clinical or laboratory evidence of vascular complications. The children
   were followed over a period of 6 years, and 24 healthy children of
   similar age and sex served as a control group. During the investigative
   period, 10 diabetic patients had increased EDP levels, with 9 having
   been diabetic for more than 5 years and 1 patient less than 5 years.
   Seven of these patients developed diabetic microvascular complications.
   In this group, EDP were independently associated with age (r = .39, P =
   .047), retinopathy (r = .48, P = .034), and antibodies to advanced
   glycation endproducts (AGE) (r = .52, P = .018). The data of this pilot
   study are not strong enough to appear that EDP are a useful predictor of
   subsequent development of microvascular complications. This may be due
   to the small number of subjects, short duration of the study, manner in
   which EDP or the endpoints were measured, or frequency of which EDP
   measurements were made. Further prospective and longer studies of larger
   populations are needed to identify the role of EDP as an early marker
   for the development of diabetic microvascular complications. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{An analytical procedure is explored to construct the profiles of the
   spectral lines formed in a stochastic multicomponent atmosphere. A model
   one-dimensional problem is solved for the atmospheres in both local
   thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE. The results previously
   obtained by the authors for the LTE atmosphere are generalized to
   include, in particular, correlations of the random variations in the
   physical properties of the structural elements. It is shown that the
   stochastic multicomponent atmosphere may produce a kind of double-peaked
   profile, which is usually associated with the multiple scattering
   effects.
   The problem of the line formation in a stochastic non-LTE atmosphere is
   considered, assumpting the complete redistribution over frequencies with
   allowance for the absorption in continuum.. For the line profile, a
   closed-form analytical expression is derived. The computed profiles are
   compared with those for an homogeneous deterministic atmosphere with
   preliminarily averaged physical properties. This allows us to conclude
   that the discrepancy between the line profiles relevant to these two
   cases may become significant, whereas the normalized profiles are fairly
   close to each other.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular SRC (c-SRC), which is the human homolog of the Rous sarcoma

   Recently, a subset of colon cancers have shown a nonsense mutation at
   codon 531, which truncates c-SRC directly C-terminal to the c-SRC kinase
   regulatory domain. This specific mutation has been demonstrated to be
   activating, transforming and tumorigenic and to promote metastasis. We
   investigated 100 rectal cancers, half of which had tumor spread outside
   the rectum, for this mutation by using direct sequencing. None of these
   tumors displaced any genetic alteration at this locus, and we thus
   conclude that the codon 531 mutation is a mle cause of c-SRC activation

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel configuration of an elevated base station
   using an adoptive array for TDMA systems, which can simultaneously
   decrease the CCI (co-channel interference) and form a circular cell. The
   proposed base station comprises two sets of transceivers and antenna
   arrays, and an adaptive beam control unit. The transceivers work in
   different time slots. The circular cell that suppresses the interference
   is achieved by integrating the pattern control of the two antenna
   arrays. The effectiveness of the proposed base station configuration is
   evaluated by field measurements using an adaptive array testbed. We
   confirm that the proposed base station achieves a channel capacity that
   is approximately 30\% greater than that of a base- station employing an
   omni-directional antenna and generates an omni-zone with reduced CCI in
   an actual microcell system. Furthermore, we confirm by computer
   simulation that the proposed base station establishes a communicable
   area that is approximately 1.8 times larger than that of a base station
   employing an omni-directional antenna.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical analysis is conducted of the retention of a dispersed
   phase fluid within a (multiphase) fluidised bed, in terms of the
   behaviour of mixed phase particles, or composite particles of the solid
   and dispersed fluid phases. By analysis of the thermodynamic stability
   of such particles due to interfacial tension - in the general case
   considering an ``n-plet{''} (n solid grains surrounding a dispersed
   phase droplet) - solutions are obtained for the Gibbs free energy of
   several detachment processes as sets of dimensionless equations which
   are solved numerically. The analysis indicates that all geometrically
   possible mixed particles require energy for their rupture, of which the
   minimum energy rupture process (for a preferentially nonwetting
   dispersed phase) is isolated solid particle detachment. Thus, if
   sufficient energy is available, an n-plet will shed solid particles in
   successive rupture processes, such that if these reach the point at
   which the n-plet is either buoyant or elutriable, it will be released
   from the bed. The analysis determines the energy required for
   mixed-phase particle rupture and the limits of retention of such
   particles in any given fluidised bed. The derived energy functions are
   compared to the energy available for mixed particle rupture in Part II

   where different coals were charged in the test coke oven, showed that
   the internal gas pressure in the plastic layer depends not only on the
   one kind of coal in plastic phase but also on the other kind of coal in
   resolidifying phase near the oven walls. The relative volume of coke
   transformed from the unit volume of coal was measured using X-ray CT
   scanner and it varied greatly across the coke oven width depending on
   the kinds of coals. The volume change of coal during plastic and
   resolidifying phase affects the density and the internal gas pressure of
   the plastic layer. The relative volume of semicoke and coke transformed
   from the unit volume of coal near the oven walls is higher for a high
   coking pressure coal than that for a low coking pressure coal. This
   leads to the high density of the plastic layer and the generation of
   dangerously high internal gas pressure in the oven centre.}},

Abstract = {{Stimulation of the pharynx by injection of minute amounts of water
   induces prolonged period of lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) relaxation
   and augmentation of the crural diaphragm (CD) contraction. The purpose
   of this study was to determine the effects of stimulating
   mechano-receptors at the laryngopharynx on the LOS and CD by using an
   air pulse stimulation device. Air pulses were delivered via the internal
   channel of a flexible endoscope. Oesophageal, LOS, and CD pressures; CD
   electromyogram; and oesophageal pH 5 cm above the LOS were recorded in
   nine healthy subjects. Stimulation of the laryngopharynx induced LOS
   relaxation in the absence of swallow and oesophageal peristalsis. The
   stimulation of epiglottis and arytenoid produced higher incidence of LOS
   relaxation compared to the base of tongue. The magnitude of LOS
   relaxation differed significantly between the three anatomical sites,
   with greater relaxation occurring at the epiglottis and arytenoid
   compared with the base of the tongue. None of the LOS relaxations
   induced by laryngeal stimulation resulted in inhibition of the CD or
   gastroesophageal reflux. We conclude that stimulation of the
   laryngopharyngeal mechanoreceptors induces LOS but not CD relaxation.
   The LOS relaxation induced by laryngopharyngeal stimulation is not
   accompanied by acid reflux in fasting state.}},

Abstract = {{In conventional sources of coherent Cherenkov electromagnetic radiation,
   the electrons move linearly, guided by external magnetic fields. In the
   absence of such fields, the electrons can move radially, being affected
   by the beam self-fields as well as by the radial component of the
   electric field of the wave. This radial motion can, first, improve the
   coupling of electrons to the field of a slow wave localized near the
   wall of a slow-wave structure, and second, cause an energy exchange
   between the electrons and the wave due to an additional transverse
   interaction. This interaction, in particular, can lead to an
   experimentally observed excitation of nonsymmetric transverse electric
   waves in Cherenkov devices. In plasma-filled sources, the beam
   self-fields can be compensated for by ions, leading to a known ion
   focusing of the beams. In such regimes, the beam can be surrounded by an
   ion layer creating a potential well for electrons which can be displaced
   from stationary trajectories by transverse fields of the wave. The
   operation of such sources when the presence of ions and the radial
   electric field of the wave play competing focusing and defocusing roles,
   and electron interception by the walls restricts the output power level,
   is analyzed in stationary and nonstationary regimes.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{106}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Eosinophils are a source of cytokines within the airways of
   asthmatic individuals that may exert an important immunoregulatory
   influence.
   Objectives: We examined IL-12 messenger (m)RNA and protein expression in
   eosinophils from peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid
   obtained from subjects with atopic asthma (n = 7), patients with chronic
   bronchitis (n = 5), and nonatopic healthy control subjects (n = 7). To
   further define this IL-12(+) population of eosinophils for the
   expression of other cytokines, we colocalized IL-12 and IL-5 within the
   peripheral blood eosinophils.
   Methods: To detect IL-12 mRNA and protein expression, we used in situ
   hybridization and immunocytochemistry techniques. The
   double-immunocytochemistry technique was used to localize IL-12 protein
   to BAL eosinophils and to colocalize IL-5 and IL-12 in peripheral blood
   eosinophils.
   Results: IL-12 mRNA and immunoreactive protein were localized to
   peripheral blood eosinophils. BAL fluid-derived eosinophils from
   asthmatic subjects were also reactive to IL-12. The percentage of
   peripheral blood eosinophils expressing mRNA for IL-12 was significantly
   lower in asthmatic subjects compared with that found in eosinophils
   obtained from patients with chronic bronchitis (P < .001) and control
   patients (P < .05). Colocalization studies demonstrated that the
   percentages of IL-12(+) eosinophils that are also IL-5(+) were 72\% in
   asthmatic subjects and only 11\% in control subjects (P < .001).
   Conclusion: These results suggest that eosinophils are a potential
   source of IL-12. Eosinophil-derived IL-12 may contribute and modulate
   the local allergic inflammatory responses.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of {[}C-11]-methionine positron
   emission tomography (MET PET) in radiotherapy (RT) treatment planning
   and long-term follow-up in patients with low-grade glioma.
   Patients: Thirteen patients with low-grade astrocytoma and 1 with
   anaplastic astrocytoma underwent sequential MET PET and magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) before and 3, 6, 12, and 21-39 months after RT,
   respectively. Ten patients were studied after initial debulking surgery
   or biopsy and 4 in the recurrence phase.
   Methods: A total of 58 PET scans mere performed. After transmission
   scanning, a median dose of 425 MBq of MET was injected intravenously and
   emission data was acquired 20 min after injection for 20 min. The uptake
   of MET in tumor area was measured as standardized uptake value (SUV) and
   tumor-to-contralateral brain SUV ratios were generated to assess
   irradiation effects on tumor metabolism. Functional imaging with PET was
   compared with concurrent R-W in designing the RT planning volumes and in
   assessment of response to RT during a median follow-up time of 33
   months.
   Results: In 12 patients (86\%), tumor area was clearly discernible in
   the baseline PET study. In the remaining 2 patients with a suspected
   residual tumor in MRI, PET showed only a diffuse uptake of MET
   interpreted as negative in the original tumor area. In the dose planning
   of RT, MET PET was helpful in outlining the gross tumor volume in 3 of
   11 cases (27\%), whereas PET findings either coincided with MRI (46\%)
   or were less distinctive (27\%) in other cases. In quantitative
   evaluation, patients with a low tumor SUV initially had significantly
   better prognosis than those with a high SUV. Tumor-to-contralateral
   brain uptake ratios of MET discriminated well patients remaining
   clinically stable from those who have since relapsed or died of disease.
   Conclusion: Quantitative MET PET has prognostic value at the time of
   initial treatment planning of low-grade glioma,Some patients may benefit
   of RT volume definition with MET PET, which seems to disclose residual
   tumor better than MRI in selected cases. Stable or decreasing uptake of
   MET in tumor area after RT during follow-up seems to be a favorable
   sign. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.}},

   using the 14.3 mu m, 7.7 mu m and 15 mu m LW3, LW6 and LW9 filters,
   along with ISOPHOT spectrometry of the nuclear region of NGC 7714 were
   obtained and are presented. Strong ISOCAM emission was detected from the
   central source in NGC 7714, along with strong PAH features, the emission
   line {[}Ar II], molecular hydrogen at 9.66 mu m and a blend of features
   including {[}S IV] at 10.6 mu m. IR emission was not detected from the
   companion galaxy NGC 7715, the bridge linking the two galaxies or from
   the partial stellar ring in NGC 7714 where emission ceases abruptly at
   the interface between the disk and the ring.
   The morphology of the system can be well described by an off-centre
   collision between the two galaxies. The LW3/LW2 ratio, where the LW2
   flux was synthesized from the PHT-S spectrum, LW9/LW6 and LW3/LW6 ratios
   suggest that the central burst within NGC 7714 is moving towards the
   post-starburst phase, in agreement with the age of the burst. Diagnostic
   tools including the ratio of the integrated PAH luminosity to the 40 to
   120 mu m infrared luminosity and the far-infrared colours reveal that
   despite the high surface brightness of the nucleus, the properties of
   NGC 7714 can be explained in terms of a starburst and do not require the

Abstract = {{The significant progress made in pediatric oncology during recent years
   has been due to a major breakthrough in the field of molecular biology
   and the introduction of new therapeutic strategies that take into
   account both the quality and the duration of life. Molecular biology has
   already been instrumental in more fully categorizing the `small
   round-cell tumor' group, and in reclassifying the `Ewing family' tumors.
   It also provides a valuable tool for the prognostic evaluation of
   neuroblastomas through the analysis of the N-myc oncogene. In addition,
   it has permitted the identification of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome of
   predisposition to cancer in the child, thereby raising the problematical
   ethical issue of communicating relevant information to subjects at risk.
   Two examples illustrate innovative strategic concepts: 1) Burkitt's
   lymphoma, or an example of the successful de-intensification of
   treatment; and 2) brain tumors in young children, regarding which the
   desire to improve the quality of life has led to innovative attempts to
   replace radiotherapy by chemotherapy. Considerable progress has been
   made in the field of neuropsychology, thereby permitting an imp,improved
   assessment of disorders and a better management of rehabilitation
   programs. New anti-cancer agents and also chemo- and radiotherapy that
   spare healthy tissue are also being developed. Gene therapy and
   molecular biology will play a major role in future therapeutic
   strategies, and are now at the preclinical trial stage. This significant
   overall progress leads to a reconsideration of the organizational
   approach toward treatment of the pediatric patient population suffering
   from cancer, and a critical assessment of disease management, which
   should take into account not only the technical aspects of the disease
   but also familial and social considerations (C) 2000 Editions

Abstract = {{In aging aircraft, the synergetic interaction between corrosion and
   fatigue has been shown to reduce the life expectancy of aluminum alloys.
   The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of corrosion, in
   terms of mass loss per unit area, on the static strength and fatigue
   life of 7075-T6 aluminum alloy. This was an experimental study in which
   test specimens were corroded in a laboratory environment. The corrosion
   process was accelerated by use of a corrosion cell. Test specimens were
   cut from flat sheets of aluminum and covered with masking material to
   restrict corrosion to a confined area, After testing, the fatigue life,
   ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and hardness of the specimens were
   observed to drop significantly with small amounts of corrosion. After
   the initial decrease, the UTS was observed to decrease linearly with
   increasing corrosion levels. The fatigue life of the specimens decreased
   in an inverse exponential fashion as mass loss per unit area increased,
   The hardness values of the corroded surfaces were also observed to drop.
   The topology of the pits and the related subsurface damage produced
   areas of high stress concentration resulting in the immediate reduction
   of UTS and fatigue life of the specimens. Subsurface corrosion damage
   was responsible for the reduction in hardness.}},

Abstract = {{Neurosin, a novel type of trypsin-like serine protease, has been shown
   to be preferentially expressed in human brain by northern blotting. We
   examined neurosin immunolabeling in the brains of neurologically normal
   persons and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and with Parkinson's
   disease. We also identified the expression of the mRNA for neurosin by
   in situ hybridization histochemistry and reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The neurosin antibody
   stained all of the nuclei of various cell types. In neurons, there was
   also staining of neuronal cytoplasm, nucleoli and their processes. In
   AD, staining of neurons with processes was rare in the damaged areas.
   Some senile plaques, extracellular tangles and Lewy bodies were also
   positive for neurosin. Expression of the mRNA for neurosin was seen in
   neurons in the gray matter, and in microglial cells in the white matter.
   In AD, the intensity of the signal for neurosin mRNA in the gray matter
   was decreased compared with normal control brains. The relative levels
   of neurosin mRNA in AD brains, measured by RT-PCR, were lower than those
   in controls. These results suggest that in human brain neurosin plays
   various physiological roles, and that in AD this molecule, like other
   serine proteases, may have a role in the degradation of such substances
   as beta-amyloid protein.}},

Abstract = {{Rap2 is a member of the Ras family of GTPases and exhibits 60\% identity
   to Rap1, but the function and regulation of Rap2 remain obscure. We
   found that, unlike the other Ras family proteins, the GTP-bound active
   form exceeded 50\% of total Rap2 protein in adherent cells. Guanine
   nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rap1, C3G, Epac (or cyclic AMP
   {[}cAMP]-GEF), CalDAG-GEFI, PDZ-GEF1, and GFR efficiently increased the
   level of GTP-Rap2 both in 293T cells and in vitro. GTPase-activating
   proteins (GAPs) for Rap1, rap1GAPII and SPA-1, stimulated Rap2 GTPase,
   but with low efficiency. The half-life of GTP-Rap2 was significantly
   longer than that of GTP-Rap1 in 293T cells, indicating that low
   sensitivity to GAPs caused a high GTP/GDP ratio on Rap2. Rap2 bound to
   the Ras-binding domain of Raf and inhibited Ras dependent activation of
   Elk1 transcription factor, as did Rap1. The level of GTP-Rap2 in rat 3Y1
   fibroblasts was decreased by the expression of v-Src, and expression of
   a GTPase-deficient Rap2 mutant inhibited v-Src-dependent transformation
   of 3Y1 cells. Altogether, Rap2 is regulated by a similar set of GEFs and
   GAPs as Rap1 and functions as a slowly responding molecular switch in
   the Rap1 signaling cascade.}},

Abstract = {{The reprecipitation method is a useful technique to fabricate organic
   microcrystals such as polydiacetylene (PDA), low-molecular-weight
   aromatic compounds, organic functional dyes, which features are located
   in a mesoscopic phase between a single molecule and bulk crystals, and
   organic microcrystals are expected to exhibit peculiar optical and
   electronic properties. In the present article, the effects of added
   surfactants and temperature were investigated to develop and establish
   further the reprecipitation method to control crystal size, shape of PDA
   microcrystals. Especially, we were much interested in reprecipitation
   conditions and formation mechanism to form fibrous PDA microcrystals. In
   addition, as some trial applications, it has been successful to trap an
   isolated PDA microcrystal and to prepare well-defined PDA microcrystal
   thin film, using a layer-by-layer procedure. This technique utilized an
   electrostatic adsorption between microcrystals with highly negative zeta
   -potential in an aqueous dispersion liquid and polyelectrolyte
   (polycation) film. As a result, the value of chi ((3))(omega) for the
   resulting layered PDA microcrystal thin film was confirmed to be
   enhanced by a factor of about 100, owing to concentration effect.

Abstract = {{The lungs have attracted increasing attention as a site for
   administration of drugs, including macromolecules that are poorly
   absorbed from the intestine. There have been a number of basic studies
   in which peptide solutions were administered to experimental animals via
   the lungs. Although there have been several studies of pulmonary peptide
   absorption from dry powder formulations, a simpler and more inexpensive
   apparatus for administration of dry powders would enhance rapid
   screening of the formulations. In this study, we developed a simple
   apparatus to disperse dry powders. The apparatus has two 3-way
   stopcocks; one allows dispersal of powders at a constant pressure and
   airflow, and the other allows rats to breathe before and after
   administration. Dry powders of fluorescein (FL) and FITC-dextran (FD4)
   were manufactured by the spray-drying technique. The effects of
   operating conditions on the absorption of these model drugs were
   examined in rats. The C-max for FL from dry powder was lower than that
   from solution and mean residence time was extended, suggesting that
   dissolution was the rate-determining step for FL absorption from dry
   powder. For FD4, the rate of absorption may not be regulated by
   dissolution but by epithelial transport. Absorption of insulin from
   spray-dried powder via the rat trachea was investigated using this
   apparatus. Intratracheally administered spray-dried insulin powder
   decreased plasma glucose level to a greater extent than spray-dried
   insulin solution administered via the same route. Thus, the apparatus is
   simple, inexpensive, and useful for rapid screening of dry powder
   formulations. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmaceutical

Abstract = {{The fellodistomid Proctoeces lintoni is a common parasite of the gonads
   of key-hole limpets Fissurella spp. (Archaeogastropoda). It has also
   been found in the mantle of Octopus vulgaris and as an intestinal
   parasite of haemulid and gobiesocid fishes. Fissurella crassa, a host
   for progenetic P. lintoni, can be found from Huarmey, Peru (10 degrees
   S) to Chiloe, Chile (42 degrees S). Proctoeces lintoni has been found
   parasitizing fishes and molluscs from Callao, Peru (12 degrees S) to
   Valdivia, Chile (39 degrees S). Progenesis is thought to be a
   latitude-dependent phenomenon, and high progenesis is expected at higher
   latitude. In the present article, the association between latitude and
   progenesis was examined over a latitudinal gradient of about 3,000 km.
   Data suggest that progenesis of P. lintoni infecting F. crassa was not
   associated with latitude. Low levels of progenesis found in the Peruvian
   population could be a consequence of parasite-induced mortality rather
   than of low latitude, as would be predicted by the latitude dependence
   hypothesis.}},

   hydrodynamics of waters in the Orinoco River. Plants and river water
   were sampled in ten sites, three of them with high salinity. The

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative education program at the University of
   Gavle, Sweden. The program, creative programming, combines traditional
   methods of teaching computer graphics, with other cross-disciplinary
   areas such as art, cognition, and film. The uniqueness of the program is
   represented by the students who are accepted and the teaching
   environment they are put in. A judicial process is used to screen
   applicants, with and without portfolios to the program. This is followed
   by an examination of intellectual capacity, practical examination, and
   finally an interview. Together, these are used as guidelines to
   determine if the student is a suitable candidate for the program. The
   final group selected has varying backgrounds, ranging from the
   professional artist to the traditional computer scientist. They are then
   immersed in a lab environment for the whole duration of the education on
   the campus. The remainder of the education involves a period in
   industry. The combination of selective students, a lab environment has
   produced very satisfactory results, and can be used as basis for further
   developing the education. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Lipo-chitin oligosaecharides (LCOs) are usually produced and isolated
   for structural analysis from bacteria cultured under laboratory rather
   than field conditions. We have studied the influence of bacterial growth
   temperature on the LCO structures produced by different Rhizobium
   leguminosarum strains, using thin-layer chromatographic,
   high-performance liquid chromatographic, and mass spectrometric
   analyses. Wild-type R, leguminosarum by. viciae Al was shown to produce
   larger relative amounts of nodX-mediated, acetylated LCOs at 12 degrees
   C than at 28 degrees C, indicating that the activity of nodX (a gene
   encoding an LCO O-acetyl transferase) is temperature dependent.
   Interestingly, symbiotic resistance genes sym1 and sym2 found in
   primitive pea cultivars are also temperature sensitive, only being
   active at low temperatures, at which they block nodulation by R.
   leguminosarum by. viciae strains lacking nodX: We therefore propose that
   the gene-for-gene relationship between plant and bacterium has a
   temperature-sensitive mechanism as an adaptation to environmental
   conditions. An R, leguminosarum by. trifolii strain was also shown to
   produce larger relative amounts of nodX-mediated, acetylated LCOs at 12
   degrees C than at 28 degrees C. The major components synthesized by the
   two strains are produced at both temperatures but in different relative
   amounts, while some minor components are only produced at one of the two
   temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. - The aim of this study was to assess parental opinions on the
   advantages and disadvantages of a pediatric oncology day hospital (DH)
   so that the structure can be better adapted to the children's needs and
   parents' expectations and provide a potentially valid alternative to
   conventional hospitalization (CH).
   Methods. - Over a 15-day period, 39 parents of children treated at a DH
   were approached and asked to fill in a questionnaire on their opinion of
   the advantages and disadvantages of a DH compared to a CH.
   Results. - The results of this survey were significant The majority of
   parents preferred the DH to the CH (69\% versus 15\%). The illness was
   perceived as being less severe; and as the child was not continually in
   the CH context, he/she was able to forget the illness and the hospital
   to some extent, and was therefore not as anxious. The DH appeared to be
   better adapted to the child's needs and facilitated the pursuit of
   normal family life and everyday activities, but imposed constraints on
   social and professional activities. On the other hand, the CH provided a
   reassuring treatment context including more comprehensive information,
   and in particular a better integration of the child and careful
   monitoring of the disease within the oncology department, and closer
   relations between the different parents visiting the hospital. In spite
   of the high preference rate for the DH, in some instances certain
   disadvantages could outweigh the advantages, e.g., fatigue due to
   journeys to and from the hospital, or living too far away from the DH; a
   lack of punctuality which meant that the parents were unable to plan
   their day with any certainty; insufficient comfort (noise, a limited
   number of rooms available); inadequate information; a lack of privacy;
   and the anxiety connected with having to assume too much responsibility
   Conclusion. - Overall, if was concluded that the parents appeared to
   appreciate the aims of the DH (i.e., limiting the treatment constraints
   imposed on the patient and on the parents themselves, thereby
   maintaining the quality of family life, assuring adequate treatment,
   reducing cost of treatment). However, the authors consider that the DH
   has to be organized in such a way that it takes into account the
   following: the social aspects, i.e., living conditions, parents' social,
   economic and professional status; parents' and children's psychological
   traits, expectations; and access to a local care system. The DH should
   also have sufficient means and staff at its disposal. Without taking
   these factors into consideration, the DH and other alternatives to the
   CH will not be able to adequately care for the patients, or meet the
   parents' expectations, and may even have a negative effect on the
   family. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.}},

   0.87\% with Oxyrase(TM) during 8 h, whereas it increased only to 0.52\%
   without Oxyrase(TM). In the same period, pH decreased from 6.8 to 5.15
   with Oxyrase(TM) but only to 6.12 without Oxyrase(TM). In all cultures,
   Oxyrase(TM) enhanced the bacterial growth rate (mu) and reduced
   generation time (g) (P < 0.05). The greatest effect of Oxyrase(TM) on
   growth was observed with B. bifidum, followed by the mired yogurt
   culture and L. acidophilus.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present an approach for documenting object-oriented
   application frameworks and use the documentation to guide the framework
   instantiation process. Our approach is based on a shift from a
   framework-centered to a functionality-centered documentation, through
   which a tool can guide the instantiation process according to the
   functionality required for the new application. The fundamental idea of
   our work is the combination of the concept of user-tasks modeling and
   least commitment planning methods to guide the instantiation process.
   Based on these techniques, the tool is able to present the different
   high level activities that can be carried out when creating a new
   application from a framework to the developer, taking as a basis the
   documentation provided by the designer through instantiation rules.}},

Abstract = {{Thermokarst is developing in the boreal forests of Alaska where ice-rich
   discontinuous permafrost is thawing. Thawing destroys the physical
   foundation (ice-rich soil) on which boreal forest ecosystems rest
   causing dramatic changes in the ecosystem. Impacts on the forest depend
   primarily on the type and amount of ice present in the permafrost and on
   drainage conditions. At sites generally underlain by ice-rich
   permafrost, forest ecosystems can be completely destroyed. In the
   Mentasta Pass area, wet sedge meadows, bogs, thermokarst ponds, and
   lakes are replacing forests. An upland thermokarst site on the
   University of Alaska Campus consists of polygonal patterns of troughs
   and pits caused by thawing ice-wedge polygons. Trees are destroyed in
   corresponding patterns. In the Tanana Flats, ice-rich permafrost
   supporting birch forests is thawing rapidly and the forests are being
   converted to minerotrophic floating mat fens. At this site, an estimated
   83\% of 2.6{*}10(5) ha was underlain by permafrost a century or more
   ago. About 42\% of this permafrost has been influenced by thermokarst
   development within the last 1 to 2 centuries. Thaw subsidence at the
   above sites is typically 1 to 2 m with some values up to 6 m. Much of
   the discontinuous permafrost in Alaska is extremely warm, usually within
   1 or 2 degrees C of thawing, and highly susceptible to thermal
   degradation. Additional warming will result in the formation of new
   thermokarst.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The study was carried out to compare urinary biochemical and
   physicochemical environments in patients who had undergone bladder
   substitution with the ileal-urethral Kock reservoir, and who had no
   actual urinary infection, with those of healthy subjects. Material and
   Methods: The participants were 23 male patients who had undergone
   bladder substitution with the ileal-urethral Kock reservoir and 25
   healthy men. All subjects had sterile urine at the time of urine
   collection. Concentrations of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus,
   creatinine, citrate, oxalate, and ammonia in 24-h urine samples were
   measured. Estimates of ion activity products of calcium oxalate (CaOx),
   calcium phosphate (CaP), brushite (Bru), and magnesium ammonium
   phosphate (MAP) in urine were calculated according to Tiselius. Results:
   Then was no significant difference in 24-h urinary volume between
   patients with a bladder substitute and the healthy controls. For most of
   the other measured values the results for patients differed
   significantly from those for controls. The most striking findings were
   markedly lower urinary excretion rates of citrate (p < 0.0001) and
   higher urine pH (p < 0.0001) in patients compared with controls. These
   findings were reflected in significantly higher levels of urinary
   supersaturation with respect to CaOx (p < 0.0001), CaP (p < 0.0001), Bru
   (p < 0.0001) and MAP (stuvite) (p < 0.0001) in patients with a bladder
   substitute compared with healthy subjects. Corlclusions: Hypocitraturia
   seems to be the main risk factor for calcium stone formation in
   non-infected Kock reservoir patients, and citrate supplementation
   appears to be the most obvious choice for stone prophylaxis in patients
   with intestinal urinary diversion and recurrent renal stone formation.}},

Abstract = {{With recently derived algorithms, it is possible to calculate the
   relative phylogenetic distinctiveness of taxa with respect to patterns
   of phylogenetic branching. We extended this approach by exploring the
   relative extent to which taxa represent phenotypic biodiversity. We
   devised a method, based on the use of independent contrasts, that
   measures the amount of phenotypic change that occurs when lineages
   diverge. We use this method to quantify the extent to which a taxon
   represents the phenotypic diversification that has occurred in the past.
   We applied our method to an analysis of variation in clutch size across
   133 avian families. All families did not contribute equally to
   representing clutch size diversification. The top 10 avian families in
   terms of representing clutch size diversification were the mesites
   (Mesitornithidae), cranes (Gruidae), bustards (Otidae), new world quail
   (Odontophoridae), seriemas (Cariamidae), finfoots ( Heliornithidae),
   swallows (Hirundinidae), megapodes (Megapodiae), and guans (Cracidae).
   The 217 species in these 10 families (2.3\% of all bird species, 7.5\%
   of families) represented 19.3\% of diversification in clutch size.
   Seventeen percent of overall clutch size diversification was represented
   by taxa threatened with extinction. The 10 families that represent the
   greatest proportion of overall clutch size diversification threatened by
   extinction were the mesites (Mesitornithidae), kagu (Rhynochetidae),
   cranes (Gruidae), kiwis (Apterygidae), new world quail (Odontophoridae),
   megapodes (Megapodiae), cassowaries (Casuariidae), finfoots
   (Heliornithidae), guans (Cracidae), and logrunners (Orthonychidae). The
   42 threatened species (0.5\% of all bird species, 3.8\% of all
   threatened bird species) in these 10 families encompassed 53\% of the
   clutch size diversification whose representation was threatened with
   extinction. Our results suggest that this type of analysis could
   potentially help prioritize species-based conservation efforts by
   identifying those taxa that contribute most toward representing the
   evolutionary processes that lead to current phenotypic biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To prospectively examine changes in retinal light sensitivity
   following blunt ocular trauma in eyes with traumatic hyphaema with no

   Method Sixteen patients who sustained hyphaema after blunt ocular trauma
   without visible traumatic retinal lesions underwent visual field testing
   on the C 30-2 programme of the Humphrey field analyser as soon as visual
   acuity recovered to 0.7 or more with correction.
   Results Significant reduction in retinal sensitivity with MD (mean

   patients 1 week after injury. MD y values significantly improved 1 month
   after injury (p < 0.001) and even more so after 4 months (p < 0.00004).
   After 4 months only in one eye (6\%) was a significant reduction in

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Pathologies of cerebral circulation are one of the most frequent causes
   of mortality and morbidity among the populations of Western countries.
   The incidence of ischemic events presumed to have a cardioembolic origin
   varies from 13\% to 34\% in the largest international multi-center
   studies. However, some authors have reported an incidence of general
   cardiogenic stroke ranging from 23\% to 36\% in younger patients.
   Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a useful investigation for
   identifying cardiac sources of embolism in patients without vascular
   alterations involving the carotid and vertebral districts.
   This study comprised 73 patients with unexplained stroke who were
   investigated by both transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and TEE.
   Vascular echocolor sonography had been performed in all of them with
   negative results. TEE demonstrated: atrial or ventricular thrombosis in
   6 patients (8\%), intracavitary neoplasm in 2 (2\%), spontaneous
   echocontrast in 11 (13\%), valve strands in 6 (7\%), complex aortic
   plaque in 10 (11\%), patency of the foramen ovate in 17 (19\%), atrial
   septal aneurysm in 9 (11\%), dystrophy and mitral calcifications in 9
   (11\%). In the other 18 patients, TEE did not reveal any anomalies.
   Definite sources of stroke (clots and tumors) were identified in 14\% of
   all the lesions; however, the majority (86\%) were potential sources.
   A comparison of the two echocardiographic techniques demonstrated a
   greater sensitivity and specificity of TEE. Although TEE was superior to

Abstract = {{In baculovirus-based high-level expression of cloned foreign genes, the
   viral very late gene promoters of polyhedrin (polh) and p10 are
   extensively exploited. Here we report the cloning and characterization
   of the p10 gene from a local isolate of Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrosis
   virus (BmNPV). The gene harbours a 213-bp open reading frame encoding a
   protein of 70 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 7.5 kDa.
   The BmNPV p10 showed deletion of a single A at +210 nucleotide compared
   to the prototype baculovirus, Autographa californica multinucleocapsid
   nucleopolyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV), p10 gent, resulting in a
   translational frameshift to generate a termination codon and
   consequently a truncated polypeptide instead of the 10-kDa protein. This
   protein P7.5 from BmNPV has a putative leucine zipper dimerization motif
   towards the N-terminal end and the central nuclear disintegration domain
   but the carboxy-terminal domain implicated in protein association for
   fibrillar structure formation is absent. Phylogenetic analysis revealed
   that p10 is highly conserved among baculoviruses and the BmNPV strains
   are more closely related to AcMNPV than other baculoviruses. The
   transcription of p10 is regulated in a temporal manner. reaching maximal
   levels by 72 h post-infection. RNAase protection and primer extension
   analysis mapped the transcription start sites at -70 and -71 nt with
   respect to the ATG, within the conserved baculovirus late gene motif
   TAAG. The upstream region showed complete homology to the strong
   promoter of the AcMNPV p10. suggesting that this promoter from BmNPV
   could also be exploited for high-level expression of cloned Foreign
   genes in silkworm cells or larvae.}},

Abstract = {{A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was
   conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in relieving
   the symptoms of panic disorder. One hundred three patients were randomly
   assigned to receive double-blind treatment with either gabapentin (dosed
   flexibly between 600 and 3,600 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. No
   overall drug/placebo difference was observed in scores on the Panic and
   Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) (p = 0.606). A post hoc analysis was used to
   evaluate the more severely ill patients as defined by the primary
   outcome measure (PAS score greater than or equal to 20). In this
   population, the gabapentin-treated patients showed significant
   improvement in the PAS change score (p = 0.04). In patients with a PAS
   score of 20 or greater, women showed a greater response than men
   regardless of treatment. Adverse events were consistent with the known
   side effect profile of gabapentin and included somnolence, headache, and
   dizziness. One patient experienced a serious adverse event during the
   study. No deaths were reported. The results of this study suggest that
   gabapentin may have anxiolytic effects in more severely ill patients

Abstract = {{Many studies have shown a positive correlation among screw pullout
   strength, screw insertional torque, bone thickness, and areal bone
   mineral density (BMD) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.
   Variations are significant in the anatomy of the occipital bone. But no
   studies have correlated these variables with respect to the two
   locations commonly used for plate fixation to the occiput. The purpose
   of this study was to determine the thickness and quality of the
   occipital bone and to con-elate these variables with the insertional
   torque of screws and the pullout strength of plates secured into two
   different locations on the occiput. The occiputs of 12 adult human fresh
   frozen cadaveric specimens were used. The specimens were analyzed by
   dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Direct thickness measurements of the
   occiput were performed. Areal and volumetric BMD were measured. A simple
   pelvic reconstruction plate (3.2 mm) was fixed to the occiput either
   laterally or at the midline with bicortical 4-mm cancellous screws.
   Torque was recorded at the time of insertion of each screw. Axial
   pullout tests were performed on all specimens. The peak lend, failure
   load, stiffness, and energy to failure were recorded for each construct.
   Statistical analysis showed that the average thickness of occipital bone
   is greater in the midline than laterally. Occipital bone is thicker and
   screw torque is greater close to the inion. There is a positive
   correlation between bone thickness, areal BMD as measured by dual-energy
   X-ray absorptiometry, screw insertional torque, and strength of
   fixation. A plate fixed in the midline region of the occiput provides
   more rigid fixation than a plate fixed laterally. Areal BMD correlates
   better than volumetric BMD with bone thickness and is a reliable
   predictor of the strength of occipital fixation.}},

Abstract = {{Lentiviral Vectors have the potential to play an important role In

   complementary DNA expression for portal vein injection Into C57B1/6
   mice. Increasing doses of hFIX-expressing lentivirus resulted in a
   dose-dependent, sustained increase in serum hFIX levels up to
   approximately 50-60 ng/ml, Partial hepatectomy resulted in a 4- to
   6-fold increase (P < 0.005) in serum hFIX of up to 350 ng/mL compared
   with the nonhepatectomized counterparts. The expression of plasma hFVIII
   reached 30 ng/mL (15\% of normal) but was transient as the plasma levels
   fell concomitant with the formation of anti-hFVIII antibodies, However,
   hFVIII levels were persistent in immunodeficient C57BI/6 scid mice,

Abstract = {{Surface activated room temperature bonding (SAB) has been proposed as a
   new process which can overcome many problems caused by traditional high
   temperature bonding. For an application of this technology, it is
   expected to elucidate mechanical properties and fracture behavior under
   the environment where it is supposed to be used. In this study, tensile
   tests were conducted for a Al/Sapphire joint cyclic heat treated to 400
   degrees C. That brought about increase of bonding strength, which
   provides SAB process with good outlook for application. We pursued an
   analysis including residual stress by combination of FEM calculation and
   experimental observations. The findings of this research are summarized
   as follows. Softening of bulk Al due to heat treatment increased the
   bonding strength by decreasing stress concentration, but the ultimate
   tensile strength of the joint remained constant. Specimens held at high
   temperature for a long time showed shrinkage of interfacial defects,
   which resulted in the increase of bonding strength. On the other hand,
   it became clear that relaxation of residual stress as well as bulk
   softening is a contributing factor for the increase in bonding strength
   for the specimens held at high temperature for a short time.}},

Abstract = {{Neural inspiratory time (TI) is a measurement of fundamental importance
   in studies of patient-ventilator interaction. The measurement is usually
   based on recordings of flow, esophageal pressure (Pes), and
   transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), but the concordance of such estimates
   of neural TI with a more direct measurement of neural activity has not
   been systematically evaluated. To address this issue, we studied nine
   ventilator-supported patients in whom we employed esophageal electrode
   recordings of the diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMC) as the reference
   measurement of neural TI. Comparison of the indirect estimates of neural
   TI duration, based on flow, Pes, and Pdi against the reference
   measurement, revealed a mean difference (bias) ranging from -54 to 612
   ms during spontaneous breathing and from -52 to 714 ms during mechanical
   ventilation; the respective precisions (standard deviations of the
   differences) ranged from 79 to 175 ms and from 74 to 221 ms. Because an
   indirect estimate of neural TI duration could be identical to that of
   the reference measurement and yet be displaced in time, this lag or lead
   was quantified as the phase angle of neural TI onset. Flow-based
   estimates of the onset of neural TI displayed a systematic lag, which
   may be explained at least in part by concurrent intrinsic positive
   end-expiratory pressure. In conclusion, the indirect estimates of the
   onset and duration of neural TI in ventilator-dependent patients
   displayed poor agreement with the diaphragmatic EMG measurement of
   neural TI.}},

Abstract = {{Clam species belonging to the family Veneridae (Mollusca: Bivalvia)
   represent very important marine products, especially in the European
   countries. The increasing economic interest in marine edible molluscs
   has strongly enhanced the need for a routine method of unambiguous
   recognition of species in Fresh and preserved material, mainly intended
   to prevent mislabelling and commercial frauds. Here a procedure for
   identification of soft parts is proposed, by means of SDS-PAGE total
   protein patterning. In fresh material, this technique allowed
   recognition of four main regions of diagnostic bands, which have been
   named V1 (111-99 kDa), V2 (44 kDa), V3 (33-30 kDa) and V4 (19-13 kDa).
   The main diagnostic region appears to be the V3 band series. SDS-PAGE
   analysis allows the same technique to be used with denatured samples,
   such as cooked and preserved soft parts, giving reproducible results,
   very similar to those of fresh material.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed analysis of microearthquake waveforms recorded at Mt. Etna
   shows, with some exceptions, that first pulse of events with magnitude M
   greater than or equal to 2.5 is consistent with the presence of a slow
   initial phase which precedes a phase of high-speed rupture propagation.
   This is in agreement with experimental results, theoretical models and
   laboratory experiments which considered gradually increasing rupture
   velocity or slip. In order to investigate the dependence of the pulse
   shapes on the azimuth we analyze recordings for six earthquakes (M
   2.7-3.7) with well constrained focal mechanisms computed by a high
   number of observations (21-27). For each earthquake, we observe that the
   values of the slow phase duration (t(sip)) and those of the high-speed
   rupture duration (t(ris)), compared over the focal sphere, exhibit a
   spatial distribution which seem to depend strictly on the type of
   rupture mechanism. Moreover, waveforms of very closely located
   earthquakes do not exhibit similar characteristics in the pulse shapes,
   which would exclude that the waveforms of analyzed earthquakes are
   influenced drastically by attenuation effects and that the slow initial
   phase is the result of the propagation path. These and other evidence
   suggest that: i) the nucleation phases are mainly a source effect, and
   ii) directivity effects must be adequately considered on pulse width
   measurements.}},

   individual flow pulses across the pylorus during liquid gastric emptying
   remain unclear. Our objective was to determine the factors leading to
   individual flow pulses, their relative contributions and the role of the
   vagus nerve in their modulation. Proximal gastric tone had a strong
   positive correlation with the volume of the corresponding transpyloric
   flow pulse whereas pyloric tone had an inverse correlation. Antral
   contractions were associated with the presence but not the volume of the
   pulse. Acute vagal blockade retarded emptying via loss of proximal
   gastric tone and increased outflow resistance and loss of propagating
   antral pressure waves. In conclusion, the major determinants of the
   volume of pulsatile transpyloric flow are proximal gastric and pyloric
   tone. The vagus nerve plays a key role in regulating both proximal
   gastric and pyloric tone as well as moderating propagating antral
   contractions.}},

Abstract = {{The striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) family is
   expressed within dopaminoceptive neurons of the CNS and is particularly
   enriched within the basal ganglia and related structures. Alternative
   splicing produces several isoforms that are found in a number of
   subcellular compartments, including postsynaptic densities of medium
   spiny neurons. The variants include STEP61, a membrane-associated
   protein, and STEP46,a cytosolic protein. The C terminals of these two
   isoforms are identical, whereas the N-terminal domain of STEP61 contains
   a novel 172 amino acid sequence that includes several structural motifs
   not present in STEP46. Amino acid sequencing revealed a number of
   potential phosphorylation sites in both STEP isoforms. Therefore, we
   investigated the role of phosphorylation in regulating STEP activity.
   Both STEP61 and STEP46 are phosphorylated on seryl residues by a
   cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-mediated pathway in striatal
   homogenates. The specific residues phosphorylated in STEP61 were
   identified by site-directed mutagenesis and tryptic phosphopeptide
   mapping as Ser160 and Ser221, whereas the major site of phosphorylation
   in STEP46 was shown to be Ser49. Ser160 is located within the unique N
   terminal of STEP61. Ser221 and Ser49 are equivalent residues present in
   STEP61 and STEP46, respectively, and are located at the center of the
   kinase-interacting motif that has been implicated in protein-protein
   interactions. Phosphorylation at this site decreases the activity of
   STEP in vitro by reducing its affinity for its substrate. In vivo
   studies using striatal slices demonstrated that the neurotransmitter
   dopamine leads to the phosphorylation of STEP via activation of D1
   receptors and PKA.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Few objective data characterizing the pretreatment swallow
   function of patients with head and neck cancer are available.
   Methods. Pretreatment swallowing function in 352 patients with various
   lesions was evaluated with videofluoroscopy and compared with control
   subjects.
   Results. Patients had significantly longer oral and pharyngeal transit
   times, greater amounts of oral and pharyngeal residue, shorter
   cricopharyngeal opening durations, and lower swallow efficiencies.
   Swallow function worsened significantly with increased tumor stage, and
   patients with oral or pharyngeal lesions had worse swallow function than
   patients with laryngeal lesions. Frequency of complaint of swallow
   difficulty before treatment was 59\%. Patients with lower stage tumors
   had fewer complaints of swallowing, as did patients with oral cavity
   lesions.
   Conclusions. Despite demonstrating significant differences from control
   subjects, patients had highly functional swallows before treatment. The
   tendency for patients not to perceive a swallowing problem is consistent
   with the highly functional nature of their pretreatment swallow. (C)

Abstract = {{The effect of easily ionized elements (EIE) in d.c. plasma (DCP) has
   been modeled and experimentally investigated. The introduction of the
   EIEs in the U-shaped DCP decreases a `potential barrier' due to an
   internal radial electric field, which allows the partially ionized
   analyte better entry into the hot plasma zone and produces enhancement
   of the analyte spectral emission. Compared to the equilibrium
   concentration, the increased electron concentration in the fringe region
   due to large radial gradients is accounted for in the model. By
   comparing model predictions to experimental data, the validity of the
   model is tested. The main features of the effect, the large enhancement
   at small addition of EIE and almost equal enhancement of ion and atom
   line intensities, are fairly well described by the model. The results
   are believed to be applicable to the inverted Y-shaped DCP. The effect
   in the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) has been briefly discussed from
   the point of view of the proposed model. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper explores the role of nursing Interaction within the context
   of handovers and seeks to identify the clinical discourses used by
   registered nurses, student nurses and care assistants in acute elderly
   care wards, to determine their influence on the delivery of patient
   care. The study design involved an ethnographic approach to data
   collection which involved: observations of formal nursing end of shift
   reports (23 handovers) and informal interactions between nurses (146
   hours); interviews (n = 34) with registered nurses, student nurses and
   care assistants; and analysis of written nursing records. A grounded
   theory analysis was undertaken. Data were collected from five acute
   elderly care wards at a district general hospital in the south of
   England. Results from this empirical study indicate that handovers were
   formulaic, partial, cryptic, given at high speed, used abbreviations and
   jargon, required socialized knowledge to interpret, prioritized
   biomedical accounts and emphasized physical aspects of care. Patients'
   resuscitation status was highly salient to all grades of nurse. Doing
   `paperwork' was accorded less status and priority than patient care, and
   was regarded as excessively time consuming, Despite this, there was
   evidence of repetition in nursing documents. Moreover, the delivery of
   clinical nursing appeared to be guided by personal records rather than
   formal records.}},

Abstract = {{The biochemical basis of the anti-proliferative effect of exogenous
   glutathione was investigated in A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells. Previous
   observations have implicated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-mediated
   pro-oxidant reactions as a primary mechanism of the extracellular
   effects of glutathione. In 2 cell lines (A2780 and ICROV-I), glutathione
   led to H2O2 production, but only A2780 cells, characterized by low
   expression of detoxification enzymes, were sensitive to the thiol
   compound, in A2780 cells, glutathione exposure resulted in DNA
   single-strand break formation, as measured by alkaline elution.
   Glutathione-induced DNA damage generated significant levels of apoptosis
   in A2780 cells, but not in IGROV-I cells. The capability of glutathione
   to induce apoptosis was associated with cleavage of
   poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase and with generation of a low-molecular-weight
   form of the pro-apoptotic protein bax. In A2780 cells, glutathione
   exposure was followed by p21 and Bax induction and p53 up-regulation, as
   expected for genotoxic stress. Consistently, analysis of cell-cycle
   perturbations demonstrated the occurrence of G(2)M accumulation after
   exposure to glutathione, similar to what was observed for H2O2. Taken
   together, these results indicate that the cytotoxic effect of
   extracellular glutathione, related to membrane metabolism, is mediated
   by production of H2O2 leading to DNA damage and a cellular response
   involving p53. These findings might also provide insights into the
   cellular and molecular determinants of chemosensitivity to DNA damaging
   agents, as oxidative stress is implicated in p53-dependent apoptosis.

Abstract = {{We verified the usefulness of water quality indices (WQI) to assess the
   water quality from multiple measured parameters, and to evaluate spatial
   and temporal changes. Measured parameters include many of those
   recommended by the GEMS/Water UNEP program. Two WQI (subjective and
   objective-WQI(sub) and WQI(obj)) take into consideration 20 parameters.
   Another index (minimal-WQI(min)) was developed considering only three
   parameters: turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and either conductivity or
   dissolved solids. WQI(sub) tends to overestimate the pollution due to
   the use of a subjective constant, which is not necessarily correlated
   with the measured parameters. WQI(min) shows a similar trend to WQI(sub)
   and WQI(obj) at a lower analytical cost; however, it should be combined
   with WQI(obj) to corroborate the results. The use of WQI could be of
   particular interest for developing countries, because they provide
   cost-effective water quality assessment as well as the possibility of
   evaluating trends. As a case study, we report on the use of WQI to
   evaluate spatial and seasonal changes in the water quality from the
   Suquia River in Cordoba City (Argentina) and nearby locations. The city
   urban activity produces a serious and negative effect on the water
   quality; this is particularly severe in locations following the city
   sewage discharge. The dry season shows the worst water quality. (C) 2000

   extract S3. In contrast, antipeptide-delta (codons 151-162) does not
   react with Sm25 but cross-reacts with other schistosome proteins,
   including candidate vaccine antigens paramyosin (Sm97) and
   glutathione-S-transferases (Sm26, Sm28, Sj26). Recombinant protein r4 x
   47, constructed to express multiple copies of codon sequence 117-163
   (containing delta), reacts with anti-delta and is uniquely recognized by
   protective Fischer twice-infected (F-2x) rat antiserum. immunization
   with r4 x 47 induces antibodies with cross reactivities similar to
   anti-delta, but which also recognize Sm25. Despite these
   cross-reactivities with protective antigens, rodents vaccinated with r4
   x 47 were not protected against cercarial infection. On the basis of
   these data, two hypotheses are proposed: (1) antigenic epitopes other
   than delta are present within the r4 x 47 sequence which induce
   antibodies reactive with Sm25 and/or (2) peptide-delta assumes
   alternative antigenic conformations, dependent upon the context of
   neighbouring sequences, some of which mimic epitopes of proteins encoded
   by other schistosome genes. These mimotopes are not targets of
   protective antibodies.}},

Abstract = {{We perform a systematic numerical optimization of pre- and
   post-compensation normalized sections using standard and dispersion
   compensating fibers for non-return to zero 10-Gbits/s single channel
   systems. By independently varying the power at the different types of
   fibers inputs and the compensation ratio, we find that post-compensation
   performs better than precompensation at the expense of stricter
   parameter tolerance. Moreover, we show that both pre- and
   post-compensated systems can be significantly improved by using passive
   predistortion at the transmitter.}},

   structure,,more MA caregivers were adult children even though the elder
   had a living spouse, MA caregivers provided less help, fewer MAs
   lived,pith elders, and MA elders had better functional abilities, in
   spite of having similar health problems to their NHW counterparts For
   caregiving experience, MA care givers had and used less social support
   felt less social restriction and less change in elder-caregiver-family

Title = {{The potential role of antisense oligodeoxynucleotide therapy for
   cardiovascular disease}},
Journal = {{DRUGS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{239-248}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Current drugs used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease are
   effective but compliance is poor and they are short acting (hours or one
   day). Gene therapy offers a way to produce long-lasting effects (weeks,
   months or years). Antisense inhibition is being developed for the
   treatment of hypertension, myocardial ischaemia and improved allograft
   survival in human vascular bypass grafts. We are currently using 2
   strategies: (i) antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS-ODNs) which are
   delivered nonvirally and (ii) antisense DNA delivered in viral vectors
   to inhibit genes associated with vasoconstrictive properties. It is not
   necessary to know all the genes involved in hypertension, since many
   years of experience with drugs show which genes need to be controlled.
   AS-ODN are short, single-stranded DNA that can be injected in naked form
   or in liposomes. AS-ODN targeted to angiotensin type 1 (AT(1))
   receptors, angiotensinogen (ATG), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
   and beta(1) adrenoceptors effectively reduce hypertension in rat models.
   A single dose is effective for up to one month when delivered with
   liposomes. No adverse or toxic effects have been detected, and repeated
   injections are effective. For viral delivery, adeno-associated virus
   (AAV) is used with a construct to include a cytomegalovirus or
   tissue-specific promoter, antisense DNA to ATG, ACE or AT(1) receptors
   and a reporter gene. Results in rats and transgenic mice show
   significant prolonged reduction of hypertension, with a single dose
   administration of AAV-AS. Left ventricular hypertrophy is also reduced
   by antisense treatment. AS-ODNs to AT(1) receptors, ATG and beta(1)
   adrenoceptors provide cardioprotection from the effects of myocardial
   ischaemia. The AT(1) receptor is more protective than losartan and does
   not increase plasma angiotensin as losartan does.}},
