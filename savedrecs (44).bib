Abstract = {{The rheological behavior of suspensions containing cross-linked polymer
   particles (microgels) was studied. Under flow, these particles behave as
   soft spheres due to the shear-induced deformability of their external
   polymeric layer and the suspensions are strongly shear-thinning. At
   concentrations where particles are densely packed, the suspensions
   present a solidlike behavior involving elasticity and yield stress. The
   rheological modeling of such suspensions was based on the concept of the
   effective volume fraction of particles, which depends on hydrodynamic
   forces. In this sense, microgel particles were assumed to have a simple
   core-shell configuration and to interact through a repulsive
   polymer-polymer potential. The viscosity equation resulting from the
   modeling allows: (a) appropriate correlation of the experimental data
   shear stress versus shear rate in steady shear flow and (b) accounting
   for the softness of particles, which changes with concentration and
   shear stress. Al so the predictions of the model showed to be quite
   consistent with results obtained previously for the same suspensions
   through different techniques such as dynamic rheometry and rheoptics.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(amidoamine) starburst dendrimers (SBDs) form stable supramolecular
   structures (complexes) with DNA and confer protection against
   degradation by nucleases. Such properties make SBDs excellent candidates
   for application in gene delivery strategies. Formation of supramolecular
   structures by two generations of SBDs, namely 2SBD and 6SBD, with calf
   thymus DNA was examined at varying r = {[}SBD](surface
   groups/{[}DNA](base pairs) through various physicochemical techniques
   including electronic absorption spectroscopy (UV), circular dichroism
   (CD), DNA thermal denaturation studies (melting profiles), and electron
   paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. EPR spectroscopy of
   nitroxide-labeled dendrimers provides information on the interactions
   between SBDs and DNA, whereas the other techniques mainly monitor the
   structural variations of DNA following formation of SBD-DNA complexes.
   At the lowest r values (r < 1), both dendrimers slightly affect DNA
   conformation within the general framework of B-type structure; minor
   stabilization effects of the double helix were detected through analysis
   of the melting profiles. When r increases, extensive precipitation of
   the SBD/DNA adducts takes place due to charge neutralization effects. A
   persistent opalescence of the solution prevents recording of CD spectra
   up to r = 100 for 2SBD and r = 200 for 6SBD. However, at these r values,
   EPR analysis indicates that a saturation of the interacting sites on DNA
   occurs which allows calculation of the formation constant of the SBD-DNA
   adducts. By further increasing the {[}SBD]/{[}DNA] ratio, DNA
   resolubilizes. At the high r values, both SBDs form stable soluble
   supramolecular structures with DNA due to a ``salting in{''} effect.
   EPR, CD, and UV results allow us to propose a model for the formation of
   different supramolecular structures in the various r ranges.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Plasma triglyceride concentration has been an inconsistent
   independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, perhaps because of
   the metabolic heterogeneity among VLDL particles, the main carriers of
   triglycerides in plasma.
   Methods and Results-We conducted a prospective, nested case-control
   study in the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) trial, a randomized
   placebo-controlled trial of pravastatin in 4159 patients with myocardial
   infarction and average LDL concentrations at baseline (115 to 174 mg/dL,
   mean 139 mg/dL). Baseline concentrations of VLDL-apolipoprotein (apo) B
   (the VLDL particle concentration), VLDL lipids, and apoCIII and apoE in
   VLDL+LDL and in HDL were compared in patients who had either a
   myocardial infarction or coronary death (cases, n=418) with those in
   patients who did not have a cardiovascular event (control subjects,
   n=370) in 5 years of follow-up. VLDL-cholesterol, VLDL-triglyceride,
   VLDL-apoB, apoCIII and apoE in VLDL+LDL and apoE in HDL were all
   interrelated, and each was a univariate predictor of subsequent coronary
   events. The significant independent predictors were VLDL-apoB (relative
   risk {[}RR] 3.2 for highest to lowest quintiles, P=0.04), apoCIII in
   VLDL+LDL (RR 2.3, P=0.04), and apoE in HDL (RR 1.8, P=0.02). Plasma
   triglycerides, a univariate predictor of coronary events (RR 1.6,
   P=0.03), was not related to coronary events (RR 1.3, P=0.6) when apoCIII
   in VLDL+LDL was included in the model, whereas apoCIII remained
   significant. Adjustment for LDL- and HDL-cholesterol did not affect
   these results.
   Conclusions-The plasma concentrations of VLDL particles and apoCIII in
   VLDL and LDL are more specific measures of coronary heart disease risk
   than plasma triglycerides perhaps because their known metabolic
   properties link them more closely to atherosclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{The antibiotic puromycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, was shown

   a viral early/late promoter was constructed and characterized. VV-pac
   grew in the presence of puromycin at concentrations that were inhibitory
   for the parental VV and toxic for the cells. Isolation of recombinant VV
   usually relies on plaque purification under selective conditions.
   Because virus plaquing was not feasible under inhibitory puromycin

Abstract = {{Exchangeable serum apolipoproteins and amphipathic alpha -helical
   peptides are effective inhibitors of sterol (free and esterified
   cholesterol) uptake at the small-intestinal brush border membrane. The
   minimal structural requirement of an inhibitor is an amphipathic alpha
   -helix of 18 amino acids. The inhibition is competitive, indicating that
   the inhibitor binds to scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) present
   in the brush border membrane and responsible for sterol uptake. Binding
   of apolipoprotein A-I to SR-BI of rabbit brush border membrane is
   cooperative, characterized by a dissociation constant K-d = 0.45 muM and
   a Hill coefficient of n = 2.8, The cooperativity of the interaction is
   due to binding of the inhibitor molecule to a dimeric or oligomeric form
   of SR-BI held together by disulfide bridges. Consistent with the
   competitive nature of the inhibition, the K-d value agrees within
   experimental error with the IC50 value of inhibition and with the
   inhibition constant K-I, After proteinase K treatment of brush border
   membrane vesicles, the affinity of the interaction of apolipoprotein A-I
   expressed as K-d is reduced by a factor of 20, and the cooperativity is
   lost. The interaction of proteinase R-treated brush border membrane
   vesicles with apolipoprotein A-I is nonspecific partitioning of the
   apolipoprotein into the lipid bilayer of brush border membrane vesicles.}},

Abstract = {{To simulate the evolution of an oil-in-water emulsion toward
   flocculation and coalescence, a modification of a standard Brownian
   dynamics algorithm was made. The resulting program takes into account
   the effects of surfactant diffusion and interfacial adsorption on the
   drop-drop interaction potential. Different realizations of the possible
   surfactant distributions are considered. In this work, the evolution of
   a small 64-particle system in the presence of a surfactant concentration
   gradient is studied. These results are compared with the predictions of
   well-known analytical formulas, which do not account for non-homogeneous
   surfactant distributions or a time-dependent surfactant adsorption. The
   particles are assumed to interact through a DLVO potential, which
   changed with surfactant concentration. The variation of the total number
   of particles with time follows the analytical predictions of Borwankar
   et al. for initial and intermediate steps of the
   flocculation/coalescence process. However, significant differences in
   the drop size distribution were found for longer times.}},

Abstract = {{Associative properties of random copolymers of sodium
   2-(acrylamido)-2-methylpropane-sulfonate (AMPS) with
   N-hexylmethacrylamide (C(6)MAm) and with N-octadecylmethacrylamide
   (C(18)MAm) in aqueous solutions were investigated comparing with those
   of AMPS copolymers with N-dodecyl-methacrylamide (C(12)MAm) reported
   previously. For characterization by fluorescence, all the polymers were
   labeled with 1 mol \% of naphthalene by terpolymerization using
   N-(1-naphthylmethyl)methacrylamide. The polymers possessing C(6) or
   C(12) alkyl chains exhibit a strong tendency for intramolecular
   hydrophobic association to form unimolecular micelles when the C(n)MAm
   (n = 6, 12) contents in the polymers are in the ranges of 30-70 and
   10-50 mol \% for the C(6) and C(12) chains, respectively. A similar
   tendency was observed for the polymers possessing C(18) chains when the
   C(18)MAm contents are in the range of 5-20 mol \%, but polymer micelles
   formed were not completely unimolecular. Both the lower and upper limits
   of the C(n)MAm contents for all the three polymers decrease
   significantly with increasing the length of the alkyl chain. When the
   CnMAm contents are either lower or higher than these limits, the
   polymer-bound alkyl chains undergo interpolymer associations.
   Fluorescence depolarization and (1)H NMR relaxation times indicate that
   local motions of naphthalene labels and alkyl chains are more
   pronouncedly restricted in hydrophobic domains formed by longer alkyl
   chains. An inclination to the self-association of these polymers was
   discussed in terms of the ratio of the total number of carbon atoms in
   hydrophobes to the number of SO(3)(-) in a polymer chain. A conclusion
   is that with C(6) chains one needs to incorporate more carbon atoms into
   a polymer than with C(12) and C(18) chains to attain the same extent of
   hydrophobe associations. In other words, the CH(2) and CH(3) residues in
   the C(6) chain are much less effective than those in the C(12) and C(18)
   chains for the self-association when compared at the same
   hydrophobe/charge ratio in a polymer chain, whereas there is no
   significant difference between those in the C(12) and C(18) chains.
   Thus, the ability of the C(6), C(12), and C(18) chains per carbon atom
   to associate is in the order C(18) greater than or equal to C(12) much
   greater than C(6).}},

Abstract = {{Determination of Li-6/Li-7 ratios using Li2BO2+ ions analysed by thermal
   ionisation mass spectrometry with ion counting has been investigated by
   numerical simulation and experiment. It is possible to solve for one or

   more of the ratios of the 54, 55, 56, 57, 58 and 59 masses of Li2BO2+
   are measured. Monte Carlo simulation of data sets suggests that
   within-sample precision on measurement of Li2BO2+ mass ratios is largely
   limited by counting statistics and should result in precision as good as
   0.25 parts per thousand (1a) on the Li-6/Li-7 ratio. However
   repeatability of Li-6/Li-7 and B-10/B-11 ratios gives precisions no
   better than approximately +/-3 parts per thousand (1 sigma) and the
   probable cause is fractionation of the Li-6/Li-7 ratio on the filament
   due to the large Li+ ion beam produced during analysis of Li2BO2+. Plots
   of variation of sample fractionation with time confirms that
   fractionation is primarily controlled by varying Li-6/Li-7 ratio rather
   than varying fractionation of Li2BO2+ or B-10/(11) ratio. (Int J Mass

   After expansion in m(2)/s the quartic terms, i.e., those proportional to

   current induced rates. predictions relevant for charm, bottom and top

Abstract = {{Novel macrocyclic bis(disulfide)tetramine ligands and several Cu(II) and
   Ni(II) complexes of them with additional ligands have been synthesized
   by the oxidative coupling of linear tetradentate N2S2 tetramines with
   iodine. Facile demetalation of the Ni(II) oxidation products affords the
   free 20-membered macrocycles meso-9 and rac-9 and the 22-membered
   macrocycle 16, all of which are potentially octadentate N4S4 ligands.
   X-ray structure analyses reveal distinctly different conformations for
   che two isomers of 9; meso-9 shows a stepped conformation in profile
   with the disulfide groups corresponding to the rise of the step, whereas
   rac-9 exhibits a V conformation with the disulfide groups near the
   vertex of the V. No metal complexes of rac-9 have been isolated.
   Crystallographic studies of three Cu(II) complexes reveal that depending
   upon the size of the macrocyclic ligand and the nature of the additional
   ligands (I-, NCO-, and CH3CN), the Cu(II) coordination geometry shows
   considerable variation (plasticity), with substantial changes in the
   Cu(II)-disulfide bonding. Thus, a diiodide salt contains six-coordinate
   Cu(II) to which all four bridging disulfide sulfur atoms form strong
   equatorial bonds. In contrast, isocyanato complexes of the 20- and
   22-membered macrocycles exhibit trigonal-bipyramidal Cu(II) and
   distorted cis-octahedral Cu(II) geometries, respectively, having only
   one and no short equatorially bound sulfur atoms. The coordination
   geometry of the latter complex can also be described as four-coordinate
   seesaw with two semicoordinated S(disulfide) ligands. Disulfide -->
   Cu(II) ligand-to-metal charge transfer absorptions of both
   isocyanato-containing Cu(II) species appear too weak to observe,

Abstract = {{In aquatic systems, bottom sediments have often been considered as the
   main methylmercury (MeHg) production site. In tropical floodplain areas,
   however, floating meadows and flooded forests extend over large areas
   and can be important Hg methylating sites. We present here a
   cross-system comparison of the Hg net methylation capacity in surface
   sediments, flooded soils and roots of floating aquatic macrophytes,
   assayed by in situ incubation with Hg-203 and extraction of formed
   (MeHg)-Hg-203 by acid leaching and toluene. The presence of mono-MeHg
   was confirmed by thin layer chromatography and other techniques. Study
   areas included floodplain lakes in the Amazon basin (Tapajos: Negro and
   Amazon rivers), the Pantanal floodplain (Paraguay river basin),
   freshwater coastal lagoons in Rio de Janeiro and oxbow lakes in the
   Mogi-Guacu river, Sao Paulo state. Different Hg levels were added in
   assays performed in 1994-1998, but great care was taken to standardise
   all other test parameters, to allow data comparisons. Net MeHg
   production was one order of magnitude higher (mean 13.8\%, range
   0.28-35) in the living or decomposing roots of floating or rooted
   macrophyte mats (Eichhornia azurea, E. crassipes, Paspalum sp.,
   Eleocharis sellowiana, Salvinia sp., S. rotundifolia and Scirpus
   cubensis) than in the surface layer of underlying lake sediments (mean
   0.6\%, range 0.022-2.5). Methylation in flooded soils presented a wide
   range and was in some cases similar to the one found in macrophyte roots
   but usually much lower. In a Tapajos floodplain lake, natural
   concentrations of MeHg in soil and sediment cores taken along a
   lake-forest transect agreed well with data on net methylation potentials
   in the same samples. E. azurea, E. crassipes and Salvinia presented the
   highest methylation potentials, up to 113 times higher than in
   sediments. Methylation in E. azurea from six lakes of the Paraguay and
   Cuiaba rivers, high Pantanal, was determined in the 1998 dry and wet
   seasons and ranged from 1.8 to 35\%. Methylation was lower in washed
   roots than in untreated roots of E. azurea and methylation in solids
   isolated from the roots, was higher than in sediments but lower than in
   untreated roots. This indicates that the methylation in roots zones
   occurs mainly in the root-associated solids. Floating meadows are sites
   of intense production of biomass and of highly bioavailable MeHg and
   appear to be an essential link of the MeHg cycle in tropical aquatic
   systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mining of mercury deposits located in the California Coast Range has
   resulted in the release of mercury to the local environment and water
   supplies. The solubility, transport, and potential bioavailability of
   mercury are controlled by its chemical speciation, which can be directly
   determined for samples with total mercury concentrations greater than
   100 mg kg(-1) (ppm) using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). This
   technique has the additional benefits of being non-destructive to the
   sample, element-specific, relatively sensitive at low concentrations,
   and requiring minimal sample preparation. In this study, Hg L-III-edge
   extended Xray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were collected
   for several mercury mine tailings (calcines) in the California Coast
   Range. Total mercury concentrations of samples analyzed ranged from 230
   to 1060 ppm. Speciation data (mercury phases present and relative
   abundances) were obtained by comparing the spectra from heterogeneous,
   roasted (calcined) mine tailings samples with a spectral database of
   mercury minerals and sorbed mercury complexes. Speciation analyses were
   also conducted on known mixtures of pure mercury minerals in order to
   assess the quantitative accuracy of the technique. While some calcine
   samples were found to consist exclusively of mercuric sulfide, others
   contain additional, more soluble mercury phases, indicating a greater
   potential for the release of mercury into solution. Also, a correlation
   was observed between samples from hot-spring mercury deposits, in which
   chloride levels are elevated, and the presence of mercury-chloride
   species as detected by the speciation analysis. The speciation results
   demonstrate the ability of XAS to identify multiple mercury phases in a
   heterogeneous sample, with a quantitative accuracy of +/-25\% for the
   mercury-containing phases considered. Use of this technique, in
   conjunction with standard microanalytical techniques such as X-ray
   diffraction and electron probe microanalysis, is beneficial in the
   prioritization and remediation of mercury-contaminated mine sites. (C)

Abstract = {{Objectives: (1) To measure the extent of use of preventer medications
   (ie, inhaled corticosteroids or cromones) and possession of written
   asthma management plans (AMPs) among people with asthma in New South
   Wales in 1997. (2) To assess factors associated with underuse of
   preventer medications and AMPs.
   Design and setting: A cross-sectional survey by computer-assisted
   telephone interviews of a stratified random sample of the adult
   population of New South Wales, Australia.
   Participants: People aged 16 to 54 years with asthma diagnosed by a
   doctor and causing symptoms or requiring treatment in the preceding year
   (n=1372).
   Results: Although 55.2\% of survey participants had used preventer
   medications in the preceding year, only 27.8\% had used them regularly.
   Only 34.7\% had a written AMP Preventer medications were judged to be
   indicated for 54\% of the study population, but only 42.5\% of this
   group had used them regularly (43.1\% had a written AMP). Younger adults
   were less likely to use preventer medications regularly, but there was
   no difference in use of preventer medications by sex, urban/rural
   residence, or manner of purchasing reliever medications (either on
   prescription or ``over the counter{''}). Past smokers used preventers
   more commonly than current smokers, with never smokers having an
   intermediate prevalence of regular preventer use. Age, sex, urban/rural
   residence, and manner of purchasing reliever medications were not
   related to the possession of an AMP.
   Conclusion: Despite the trend towards increased use of preventer
   medications and written AMPs during the 1990s, undertreated asthma
   remains a major public health problem in Australia.}},

Abstract = {{beta -Catenin has been identified as an oncogene in several tumors
   including colorectal cancers. beta -Catenin gene is activated by
   interstitial deletions involving exon 3 in colorectal carcinomas of
   Japanese population, in contrast to amino acid substitutions detected
   among Caucasian population. The aim of this study was to examine the
   type and frequency of beta -catenin gene mutation during early stages of
   colorectal tumorigenesis. We screened 100 colorectal adenomas For
   somatic mutations in the beta -catenin gene by single-strand
   conformation polymorphism method, as well as polymerase chain reaction
   amplification. In cases with mutations, sequencing analyses and
   immunohistochemical staining were also performed. Somatic interstitial
   deletions of 272-413 bp, each of which included all parts of tron 3,
   were detected in three tumors. However, no adenoma carried missense
   mutations. We confirmed accumulation of aberrant beta -catenin protein
   in cytoplasm and nuclei of adenoma cells by immunohistochemical
   analysis. Our results suggested that activation of the beta -catenin
   gene by interstitial deletions involving exon 3 might be less frequent
   compared with frequent alterations of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)
   gene, but could be an early event in colorectal tumorigenesis equivalent
   to APC gene alterations in the Japanese population. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recent findings suggest that infants can remember words from stories
   over 2 week delays (Jusczyk, P. W., gr Hohne, E. A. (1997). Infants'
   memory for spoken words. Science, 277, 1984-1986). Because music, like
   language, presents infants with a massively complex auditory learning
   task, it is possible that infant memory for musical stimuli is equally
   powerful. Seven-month-old infants heard two Mozart sonata movements
   daily for 2 weeks. Following a 2 week retention interval, the infants
   were tested on passages of the familiarized music, and passages taken
   from similar but novel music. Results from two experiments suggest that
   the infants retained the familiarized music in long-term memory, and
   that their listening preferences were affected by the extent to which
   familiar passages were removed from the musical contexts within which
   they were originally learned. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Gold extraction and its commercialization in the Amazon region is mainly
   by rudimentary procedures. Therefore, during the process of extraction
   and recovery of this precious metal, large amounts of mercury vapors are
   thrown into the environment. This paper is an attempt to establish a
   correlation between the concentration of total mercury in the urine of
   workers at the gold shop in the Municipality of Itaituba, Para, and the
   information related to the lifestyles of each individual studied.
   Through statistical analysis, it was possible to divide the workers into
   three groups: people with normal mercury concentrations, {[}Hg] less
   than or equal to 10 ppb, (29\%); with concentrations at the biological
   limit of tolerance, {[}Hg] up to 50 ppb, (49\%); and contaminated
   people, {[}Hg] greater than or equal to 50 ppb (22\%), It may be
   concluded that fish consumption, time of alcohol consumption, number of
   amalgam fillings, as well as working hours, are important variables when
   evaluating mercurial contamination of people who are occupationally
   exposed to mercury vapors. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The heterogeneous-homogeneous model of acetaldehyde oxidation involving
   surface processes and feedback (inhibition) has been considered. The
   leading active centres of chain process, peroxy radicals (RCO3), produce
   an inhibitor - highly vibrationally excited molecules of formaldehyde
   (CH2O(v)) on the surface of the reaction vessel and react with them in
   the volume. On the example of CH3CHO, it is shown that at
   low-temperature oxidation of organic compounds the appearance of
   concentration oscillations is possible. The trajectories and bifurcation
   changes of the reaction by the variation of parameters have been
   investigated. The influence of number of surface active centres, of
   rates of inhibitors quenching, the adsorption and heterogeneous
   recombination of radicals on the reaction dynamic have been studied.
   The parametrical analysis has shown that the slow quenching of excited
   formaldehyde and rather fast transfer of its internal energy to leading
   radicals result in autooscillations. The increase of the quenching rate
   brings to the oscillations damping. The latter is observed also with the
   reduction of the ratio of rate constants of radicals adsorption to their
   surface reaction. It is shown that the quenching rate influences the
   number of pulses. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The potential-energy surfaces for the abstraction reactions of carbenes
   with oxirane and thiirane have been characterized in detail by using
   density functional theory (B3LYP/6-31G{*}), which include zero-point
   corrections. Six carbene species: dimethylcarbene, cyclobutylidene,
   cyclohexylidene, phenylchlorocarbene, methoxyphenylcarbene, and
   dimethoxycarbene have been chosen in this work as model reactants. All
   the interactions involve the initial formation of a loose donor-acceptor
   complex followed by a heteroatom shift via a two-center transition
   state. The complexation energies, activation barriers, and enthalpies of
   the reactions were used comparatively to determine the relative carbenic
   reactivity, as well as the influence of substituents on the reaction
   potential-energy surface. As a result, our theoretical investigations
   indicate that. irrespective of deoxygenation and desulfurization. the
   relative carbenic reactivity decreases in the order: cyclobutylidene >
   dimethylcarbene approximate to cyclohexylidene > phenylchlorocarbene >
   methoxyphenylcarbene much greater than dimethoxycarbene. Namely, the
   alkyl-substituted carbene abstractions are much more favorable than
   those of the pi -donor-substituted carbenes. Moreover, for a given
   carbene, while both deoxygenation and desulfurization are facile
   processes, the deoxygenation reaction is more exothermic but less
   kinetically favorable. Furthermore, a configuration-mixing model based
   on the work of Press and Shaik is used to rationalize the computational
   results. The results obtained are in good agreement with available
   experimental observations, and allow a number of predictions to be made.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the effect of establishing an emergency
   department observation ward (OW) on admission numbers, average length of
   stay (ALOS) for the entire hospital and overall bed days for conditions
   commonly treated in the OW.
   Setting: Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital (SCGH), Perth, a tertiary
   referral teaching hospital.
   Design: Retrospective analysis of routinely collected hospital data for
   the 10 most common diagnosis-related group (DRG) categories of patients
   discharged from the OW for the financial years 1995-96 to 1998-99.
   Comparison of these data with those for adult patients at the other
   Perth teaching hospitals over the same period.
   Main outcome measures: For patients in the 10 most common DRGs: numbers
   of admissions to the OW compared with other inpatient wards; total
   number of patients admitted to the hospital compared with total bed
   days; ALOS at SCGH compared with other Perth teaching hospitals.
   Results: Increased admissions to the OW were paralleled by a decrease in
   admissions for the same DRG codes to other inpatient wards. ALOS
   remained approximately the same from 1995-96 to 1998-99 for patients in
   the OW (one day) and other inpatient wards (4.38 to 4.20 days). However,
   overall ALOS for patients in these DRGs fell by over a third (from 3.97
   to 2.59 days) over this time. The total number of patients in these DRGs
   treated by the hospital increased by 19\% over the four years, but the
   total number of bed days fell by 23\%. By contrast, the ALOS for
   patients in the same DRGs treated at the other Perth teaching hospitals
   rose 8\% (from 2.12 to 2.28 days).
   Conclusion: Establishment of a formal emergency department OW results in
   the more efficient management of certain groups of patients, with a
   decrease in overall hospital bed days and length of stay.}},

   (IL-4Rs) but not IL-12Rs are expressed on naive CD4(+) T cells, IL-4 has
   no apparent advantage over IL-12 in driving naive T cell differentiation
   when the cells are primed with both IL-4 and IL-12 in vitro. It was
   found that IL-4-induced phosphorylation of Janus kinases 1 and 3, IL-4R
   alpha, signal transducer and activator of transcription 6, and insulin
   receptor substrate 2 was strikingly but transiently inhibited by TCR
   Ligation both in conventional and TCR transgenic T cells, TCR engagement
   also blocked the expression of an IL-4-inducible gene. Signals induced
   by other cytokines, including IL-e, IL-6, and interferon alpha, but not
   by insulin-like growth factor 1, were also blocked by TCR engagement.
   The capacity of various inhibitors to reverse TCR-mediated inhibition of
   IL-4 signaling suggested that activation of the Ras-mitogen-activated
   protein kinase pathway and of the calcineurin pathway contribute to
   desensitizing IL-4R. IL-4 responsiveness returned at about the time
   (similar to 12 h) that IL-12-mediated signaling was first observed.
   Thus, through different mechanisms, neither IL-4R nor IL-12R has any
   clear advantage in polarizing cells; rather, the availability of
   cytokine is probably the limiting factor in this process.}},

   gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The particulate matter contained
   mainly acids, aliphatic components, and minor levels of alcohols,
   aldehydes, ketones, and aromatic compounds. Samples showed higher
   concentrations of material in the submicrometer size range. The mass
   distribution of compounds presented a mode for diameters < 0.49 <mu>m,
   confirming the secondary origin of aerosol products formed by
   nucleation/condensation mechanisms from gaseous precursors. Another mode
   was present for compounds in particles with diameters between 1 and 3

Abstract = {{A symmetry-based, nondisplacive mechanism for the first-order B3
   reversible arrow B1 phase transition exhibited by many binary
   semiconductors is proposed. Using a single-molecule R3m unit cell, the
   energetic and dynamical features of the transformation are disclosed
   along a transition path characterized by the internal coordinate, the

   calculations on the wide-gap semiconductor ZnO are performed to

   energy surfaces and Bader analysis of the electronic density are used to
   describe the atomic rearrangements, the energy profile along the
   transition coordinate, and the effects of the external pressure on this
   profile. The geometry and energy of the transition state are determined,
   and the bonding details of the transformation identified. The proposed
   mechanism explains the change in coordination from 4 (B3) to 6 (B1), the
   less covalent Zn-O bond in the B1 structure, and the transformation of
   ZnO from a direct-gap (B3) to an indirect-gap (B1) material.}},

Abstract = {{T independent antigens elicit antibody responses in the absence of

   Most bacterial polysaccharides including the pneumococcal polysaccharide

   accessory cell function play a critical role in the failure of neonates
   to respond to such TI-2 antigens. Immune responses to these TI-2 stimuli
   are also reduced in the aged, also due to a quantitative deficiency in
   accessory cells. Agents that can stimulate accessory cell function may
   provide an alternative strategy to improve the immunogenicity of the

Abstract = {{Different methods for the numerical solution of stochastic differential
   equations arising in the quantum mechanics of open systems are
   discussed. A comparison of the stochastic Euler and Heun schemes, a

   error measure the convergence behaviour of these schemes for stochastic
   differential equations of the continuous spontaneous localization type
   is investigated. The general theory is tested by two examples from
   quantum optics. The numerical tests confirm the expected convergence
   behaviour in the case of the Euler, the Heun and the second order
   scheme. On the contrary, the heuristic Runge-Kutta scheme turns out to
   be a first order scheme such that no advantage over the simple Euler
   scheme is obtained. The results also clearly reveal that the second

   Ectopic expression of either gene results in U937 differentiation. In
   this paper, we describe a mechanism by which p21 and HOXA10 may act ill

   together with its trimeric partners PBX1 and MEIS1, activate p21
   transcription, resulting in cell cycle arrest and differentiation. These

Abstract = {{We report on midinfrared intersubband transitions between the quantized

   spectroscopy, we were able to resolve two absorption lines in the
   120-160 meV range. The first absorption line follows the polarization
   selection rules for intersubband transitions and exhibits photoinduced
   excitation profile that resembles the photoluminescence excitation
   spectrum of the quantum wires. The second absorption resonance, at a
   higher energy, is not polarized and resembles the photoluminescence
   spectrum of the side quantum wells. Based on these results and energy
   level calculations, we assign the first absorption resonance to
   intersubband transition between the quantized subbands of the quantum
   wires. The origin of the second resonance is less clear. We propose a
   model that attributes this resonance to an interface localized exciton

Abstract = {{A 1.2 V GaAs power pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistors
   (PHEMT's) for personal handy phone system (PHS) handset application was
   developed. The power PHEMT has a dual delta doped AlGaAs/InGaAs/GaAs
   based structure with compact device layout. The 6.72 mm device exhibits
   maximum power added efficiency (PAE) of 43.62\% at 1.2V drain bias with
   an output power of 22.18 dBm. Under 1.9 GHz pi /4-shifted quadrature
   phase shift keying (QPSK) modulated PHS signal, the device shows an
   adjacent channel leakage power (P-adj) Of -56.86 dBc at 600 kHz apart
   from the center frequency and a linear efficiency of 41.31\%. This is
   the first report on the 1.2-V operation power PHEMT for PHS handset

Abstract = {{Many of the recent advances in the understanding of the pathological

   the development of assays that can specifically quantitate in biological
   milieu amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides ending at amino-acid positions
   Ala-42 (A beta(42)) and Val-40 (A beta(40)). The existing technologies,
   however, although proven in their utility are limited in their
   application with regards to sample manipulation and suitability for
   high-throughput screening. To overcome these limitations, in this report
   we describe the development of a novel homogeneous time-resolved
   fluorescence (HTRF) immunoassay for A beta(42) and A beta(40) peptides.
   This assay has the sensitivity selectivity and dynamic range to allow
   specific, direct quantitation of A beta peptides in cell culture medium,
   plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue extracts, and has the major
   advantage of minimising sample manipulation and its inherent

Abstract = {{The aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region is a potent hematopoietic site
   in the midgestation mouse conceptus and first contains colony-forming
   units-spleen day II (CFU-S-11) at embryonic day 10 (E10), Because
   CFU-S-11 activity is present in the AGM region before the onset of
   hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) activity, CFU-S-11 activity in the complex
   developing vascular and urogenital regions of the AGM was localized.
   From E10 onward, CFU-S-11 activity is associated with the aortic
   vasculature, and is found also in the urogenital ridges (UGRs), Together
   with data obtained from organ explant cultures, in which up to a 16-fold
   increase in CFU-S-11 activity was observed, it was determined that
   CFU-SH can be increased autonomously both in vascular sites and in UGRs,
   Furthermore, CFU-S-11 activity present in vitelline and umbilical
   vessels. This, together with the presence of CFU-S-11 in the UGRs 2 days

Abstract = {{While much of the suspended particulate matter found in the ambient air

   are particulate sulphate, formed from the precursor, sulphur dioxide,
   and secondary organic aerosols, formed from oxidation of terpenes and
   aromatic hydrocarbons. A Lagrangian dispersion model has been used to
   describe the emissions, transport and transformation of SO2 into
   particulate sulphate. The origins of the particulate sulphate are
   delineated in two separate pollution episodes which occurred during
   1996. A photochemical trajectory model is used to describe the formation
   of secondary organic aerosols and to assess the relative contributions

Abstract = {{Wild-type promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein and an increasingly
   documented number of cellular proteins are localized within discrete
   nuclear structures known as PML nuclear bodies or PODs (potential
   oncogenic domains). Even though POD function remains elusive, the
   integrity, topology, and molecular composition of these nuclear
   compartments have been associated with certain human diseases, including
   cancer, autoimmunity, neurodegenerative disorders, and viral
   propagation. At the molecular level, PML protein has been shown to be a
   coactivator of nuclear hormone receptors, whereas its oncogenic
   counterpart PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha, which promotes POD
   disaggregation, has been found to activate activator protein-1
   transcription in a retinoic acid-dependent manner. Recently, we
   demonstrated that the CREB-binding protein (CBP) associates with PML
   protein in vitro and is recruited to the PODs in vivo in a
   signal-dependent manner. In exploring the consequence of this
   association, we proposed that POD nuclear bodies are regulatory cellular
   domains where proteins such as the CBP and CBP-interacting molecules may
   be activated or inactivated to coordinate signal-activated cellular
   response. This paper discusses the association of PML nuclear bodies
   with transcription control and underscores the pharmacological aspects
   of such an observation. BIOCHEM PHARMACOL 60;8:1197-1201, 2000. (C) 2000

   the films, in which case the reflectivity profile must be modeled to
   derive the density. The mass density can also be derived from the
   valence electron density via the plasmon energy, which is measured by
   electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). We formally define an
   interband effective electron mass m{*}, which accounts for the finite
   band gap. Comparison of XRR and EELS densities allows us to fit an
   average m{*} = 0.87m for carbon systems, m being the free-electron mass.
   We show that, within the Drude-Lorentz model of the optical spectrum,
   m{*} = {[}1-n(0)(-2)]m, where n(0) is the refractive index at zero
   optical frequency. The fraction of sp(2) bonding is derived from the
   carbon K-edge EELS spectrum, and it is shown how a choice of ``magic{''}
   incidence and collection angles in the scanning transmission electron
   microscope can give sp(2) fraction values that are independent of sample
   orientation or anisotropy. We thus give a general relationship between
   mass density and sp(3) content for carbon films.}},

Abstract = {{A Mycoplasma agalactiae genomic fragment carrying Four vsp-related genes
   (designated avg: agalactiae variable genes) was cloned, sequenced and
   compared to the vspA gene of Mycoplasma bovis. The following features
   were revealed: (i) the presence of a highly conserved rsp 5' upstream
   region; (ii) a highly homologous vsp N-terminal end encoding a putative
   lipoprotein signal sequence; (iii) sequence divergence of the rest of
   the mature proteins. By using avg specific probes in Southern blot
   analysis of genomic DNAs of M. agalactiae strains as well as of isolates
   from infected animals, marked DNA polymorphism of avg fragments was
   demonstrated. In addition, the avg genomic fingerprints were monitored
   for a period of 7 months, in isolates of M. agalactiae from an
   individual chronically infected animal. The results provided evidence
   that a chromosomal region of M. agalactiae, carrying vsp-related genes,
   undergoes rearrangements in vivo in the natural animal host during the
   course of infection. (C) 2000 Federation of European Microbiological

Abstract = {{A substantial number of new granule neurons are produced in the dentate
   gyrus in adulthood in a variety of mammalian species, including humans.
   Numerous studies have demonstrated that the production and survival of
   new hippocampal neurons can be enhanced or diminished by hormones and
   experience. Steroid hormones of the oval-ies and adrenal glands have
   been shown to modulate the production of immature neurons by affecting
   the proliferation of granule cell precursors. Aversive experiences have
   been demonstrated to decrease the production of immature granule cells,
   whereas enriching experiences, including learning, have been shown to
   enhance the survival of new hippocampal cells. These studies indicate
   that adult-generated neurons represent a unique form of structural
   plasticity that can be regulated by the environment, and furthermore
   suggest that new neurons play an important role in hippocampal function.

Abstract = {{Pentoxifylline was evaluated as a method to increase motility of
   cryopreserved equine spermatozoa. In a preliminary experiment,
   pentoxifylline (3.5 mM or 7.0 mM) was added to extended semen that was
   chilled to 4 degreesC. Motility was evaluated at 8-h intervals for 48 h.
   The addition of 3.5 or 7.0 mM pentoxifylline appeared to increase the
   motility of chilled spermatozoa compared to controls. Based on these
   results, similar concentrations of pentoxifylline were added to semen
   either before or after cryopreservation.
   The addition of pentoxifylline (3.5 or 7.0 mM) to semen before
   cryopreservation significantly (P < 0.001) decreased total and
   progressive motility compared to controls. However, the addition of
   pentoxifylline (3.5 or 7.0 mM) to cryopreserved semen immediately after
   thawing significantly (P < 0.01) increased total and progressive
   motility compared to controls. These results indicate that

   depression and other psychiatric disorders in adulthood. This article
   reviews preclinical studies examining the effects of early stress,
   factors that modify the impact of these experiences, and neurobiological
   changes associated with major depression. Preclinical studies
   demonstrate that early stress can alter the development of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic
   corticotropin releasing hormone, monoaminergic, and gamma -aminobutyric
   acid/benzodiazepine systems, Stress has also been shown to promote
   structural and functional alterations in brain regions similar to those
   seen in adults with depression. Emerging data suggest, however, that the
   long-term effects of early sa-ess can be moderated by genetic factors
   and the quality of the subsequent caregiving environment, These effects
   also can be prevented or reversed with various pharmacologic
   interventions. Preclinical studies of early stress can provide valuable
   insights in understanding the pathophysiology and treatment of major
   depression. They also can provide an important tool to use to
   investigate interactions between genes and environments in determining
   an individual's sensitivity to stress, More research is needed to
   understand how inherent factors interact with experiences of abuse and

   Objectives. To investigate the clinical results of this new surgical
   procedure.
   Summary and Background Data. irreducible atlantoaxial kyphosis in
   rheumatoid arthritis results from a destruction of the craniocervical
   joint ligaments and the anterior aspects of the lateral atlantoaxial
   joints. The development of a paradental synovial pannus and atlantoaxial
   joint impaction prevents reduction by conservative treatment, such as
   skull traction. Posterior surgical procedures for the treatment of the
   irreducible atlantoaxial kyphosis with spinal cord compression have been
   associated with high morbidity and mortality.
   Methods. Fifteen consecutive patients were treated by transoral odontoid
   resection. The fixation was: performed with anterior plating, according
   to the method of Harms in combination with posterior wire fusion
   according to Brooks. Before and after surgery, evaluation was performed
   using the parameters of pain (visual analog scale), range of motion, and
   subjective assessment:of improvement and the Health Assessment
   Questionnaire. The neurologic deficit was defined according to the
   classifications proposed by Ranawat, Frankel, and Nurwick. Plain
   radiographs, including lateral flexion and extension views, and magnetic
   resonance scans were obtained.
   Results. No perioperative fatality occurred. The average clinical and
   radiographic follow-up was 50.7 +/- 15.6 months (range, 26-77).
   Postoperative pain was relieved (mean pain score before surgery, 7.9 +/-
   1.87; after surgery, 3.8 +/- 1.27), and the range of motion of all
   patients increased {[}mean 21.5 +/- 14.0 degrees for rotation; mean 17.2
   +/- 5.54 degrees for bending). The score on the Health Assessment
   Questionnaire increased in three patients, remained unchanged in three
   and decreased in six patients (three had died). All patients improved at
   least one Ranawat Lever after surgery, except a patient in Ranawat Class
   II, whose condition remained unchanged. All patients were satisfied with
   the procedure and reported subjective improvement.
   Conclusion. Transoral plate fixation combined with posterior wire
   fixation after transoral odontoid resection is an effective, reliable,
   and safe procedure for the treatment of irreducible atlantoaxial
   kyphosis in rheumatoid arthritis.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. This was a prospective multicenter clinical trial of a
   lumbar interbody fusion cage with a minimum of 4 years' follow-up.
   Objectives. To determine whether the early positive clinical results in
   fusions with lumbar cages, such as the Bagby and Kuslich (BAK) cage, are
   maintained beyond 2 years.
   Summary of Background Data. Threaded cages have been used increasingly
   for the treatment of symptomatic degenerative intervertebral disc
   disease. Concerns about the long-term clinical outcomes of this
   procedure have been posed, particularly regarding bony fusion viability,
   revision rates, potential adjacent level disease, and late
   complications.
   Methods. The study cohort was a 196-patient subset from a prospective
   investigational device exemption; In addition to early postoperative
   examinations, these patients were examined biannually with a minimum of
   4 years' follow-up. Patient outcome was assessed by a 6-point scale that
   evaluated pain relief, and functional improvement was determined by
   changes in activities of daily living. Fusion rates and return to work
   were determined. Complications and secondary operations were reported
   and categorized as non-device related or device related.
   Results. The patient cohort with 4-year follow-up represented 25.6\% of
   the original study population eligible at that time. Overall, the
   largest percentage of pain relief and functional improvements occurred
   by 3 months, and these improvements were maintained at each follow-up.
   Overall fusion rate was 91.7\% and 95.1\% at 2 and 4 years,
   respectively. In this cohort, 39.5\% of patients were working or were
   able to work within 3 months of surgery. After 4 years, 62.7\% of
   patients were gainfully employed or able to work. The late-occurring
   complication rate in this cohort was 13.8\% (27/196). Complications
   necessitating a second operation occurred in 8.7\% (17/196), whereas
   reoperations that were deemed device related were performed in 3.1\%
   (6/196).
   Conclusions. This study indicates that the early positive benefits of
   interbody fusion cage procedures: are maintained through 4 years with
   acceptably low morbidity.}},

Abstract = {{The photodissociation of CF2=CFCl at 193 nm has been studied by product
   translational spectroscopy. Results show that the molecule undergoes

   0.1:1.4. When photolyzed with polarized laser light, reactions (1) and
   (3) were detected with fragments recoiling anisotropically, indicating
   that dissociation occurs primarily on the excited potential energy
   surface. From the maximum kinetic energy derived for reactions (2) and
   (3), a upper limit of 110 and 90 kcal/mol was determined for the C-F
   bond and the C-Cl bond dissociation energy, respectively. In addition to
   these primary dissociation channels, we have observed the secondary

Abstract = {{We present our results in this paper in two parts. In the first part, we
   consider the Cauchy problem for the axially symmetric equation partial
   derivative (2)(x)u + partial derivative (2)(x)u + k/x partial derivative
   (x)u = 0 with entire Cauchy data given on an initial plane (see Eq.
   (2.1)). We solve the Cauchy problem and obtain its solutions in two
   cases, depending on whether k is a positive even integer or k is a
   positive odd integer. For k odd, we demonstrate that the solution has
   more singularities due to the propagation of the singularities of the
   coefficients. In the second part, the Cauchy problem for the same
   equation is considered, but instead, its entire Cauchy data are given on
   an initial sphere (see Eq. (3.1)). Whenever k is a positive even
   integer, we obtain the global existence of the solution and determine
   all possible singularities. Whenever k is a positive odd integer, we
   discuss both local and global solutions. As a consequence of our results

Abstract = {{Oligodendrocytes are glial cells devoted to the production of myelin
   sheaths. Myelination of the CNS occurs essentially after birth. To
   delineate both the times of oligodendrocyte proliferation and
   myelination, as well as to study the consequence of dysmyelination in
   vivo, a model of inducible dysmyelination was developed. To achieve
   oligodendrocyte ablation, transgenic animals were generated that express
   the herpes virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-TK) gene under the control of
   the myelin basic protein (MBP) gene promoter. The expression of the
   MBP-TK transgene in oligodendrocytes is not toxic on its own; however,
   toxicity can be selectively induced by the systemic injection of animals
   with nucleoside analogs, such as FIAU
   {[}1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-delta-arabinofuranosyl)5-iodouracil]. This
   system allows us to control the precise duration of the toxic insult and
   the degree of ablation of oligodendrocytes in vivo.
   We show that chronic treatment of MBP-TK mice with FIAU during the first
   3 postnatal weeks triggers almost a total depletion of oligodendrocytes
   in the CNS. These effects are accompanied by a behavioral phenotype
   characterized by tremors, seizures, retarded growth, and premature
   animal death. We identify the period of highest oligodendrocytes
   division in the first 9 postnatal days. Delaying the beginning of FIAU
   treatments results in different degrees of dysmyelination.
   Dysmyelination in MBP-TK mice is always accompanied by astrocytosis.
   Thus, this transgenic line provides a model to study the events
   occurring during dysmyelination of various intensities. It also
   represents an invaluable tool to investigate remyelination in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Colonization of former mining areas by a highly mobile arthropod group,
   spiders (Arachnida), is studied based on a comparative analysis of four
   mining areas of different age and habitat structure including adjacent
   undisturbed areas. Species number was lowest in sparsely vegetated
   sites, and highest in dense vegetation regardless of age. Species number
   may exceed that of undisturbed adjacent sites after 70 years. Similarity
   among the sites ranges from 26 to 75\% (Sorensen index). A DCA
   ordination of sites revealed a grouping into three relatively distinct
   clusters, one including the vegetation free sites, the second the
   sparsely vegetated short grass sites, and the third both the plant
   species rich, mature, short grass sites and the tall grass stands.
   Environmental variables were related to the species composition by means
   of CCA. However, most of these relations proved to be spurious being
   either not significant or if so, showing a low contribution to variance
   explanation. The influence of scale parameters such as area size and
   distance (when analysing all data, data from mining areas only, or data
   from one mining area separately) becomes visible in all analyses. A
   detailed analysis including age as an independent variable shows that
   age has some influence on the structure of the whole data set including
   undisturbed sites, but not within the subset of the mining areas. Using
   data from one mining area only it is shown that the influence of age and
   spatial autocorrelation effects cannot be properly distinguished on the
   larger scales. A more detailed account on the known autecology of the

   involving these impurities and vacancies in cubic boron nitride (c-BN).
   The formation energies and the electronic and structural properties of

   that, under a boron-rich condition, both the carbon and the oxygen
   impurities at the nitrogen site (C-N and O-N) have formation energies
   comparable to or lower than those calculated for the vacancies, which
   are the lowest-energy intrinsic defects. Regarding defect complexes, we
   find that the donor character observed for the nitrogen vacancy (V-N)
   can be compensated by the C-N impurity in the formation of a V-N-C-N
   complex which has low formation energies. We also find that the V-B-O-N
   complex has low formation energies under n-type conditions. In contrast
   to the above mentioned complexes, we find that the V-B-C-B complex has
   high formation energies under a boron-rich condition, and shall only

Abstract = {{Thiamine deficiency (TD) in both humans and experimental animals results
   in severe compromise of mitochondrial function and leads to selective
   neuronal cell death in diencephalic and cerebellar structures. To
   examine further the influence of TD on neuronal survival in relation to
   metabolic changes, primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule cells were
   exposed to thiamine-deficient medium for up to 7 days in the absence or
   presence of the central thiamine antagonist pyrithiamine (Py), Exposure
   of cells for 7 days to thiamine-deficient medium alone resulted in no
   detectable cell death. On the other hand, 50 mu M Py treatment led to
   reductions of thiamine phosphate esters, decreased activities of the
   thiamine-dependent enzymes alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and
   transketolase, a twofold increase in lactate release (P < 0.001), a
   lowering of pH, and significant (58\%, P < 0.001) cell death. DNA
   fragmentation studies did not reveal evidence of apoptotic cell death.
   Addition of 50 mu M alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) or 100 mu M of
   butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) to Py-treated cells resulted in
   significant neuroprotection. On the other hand, addition of 10 mu M
   MK-801, an NMDA receptor antagonist, was not neuroprotective. These
   results suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role in
   thiamine deficiency-induced neuronal cell death. Insofar as this
   experimental model recapitulates the metabolic and mitochondrial changes
   characteristic of thiamine deficiency in the intact animal, it might be
   useful in the elucidation of mechanisms involved in the neuronal cell
   death cascade resulting from thiamine deficiency. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss,

   new method was applied to a set of KNET data in the Tohoku area of

Abstract = {{The PBMA, by its amplitude and extent, is a major structure of the
   geology of France, but its origin remains poorly known. Based on the
   data of two important national programs, the ECORS program and the Deep
   Geology of France (DGF) program, the last interpretations propose that
   the anomaly is related to an oblique oceanic suture formed during the
   Variscan collision between the North Brittany block and the Brabant
   block. The study of the electrical properties of the crust, by the
   magneto-telluric (MT) method, along the seismic profile ECORS-'Nord de
   la France', reveals the existence of a strong subvertical electrical
   discontinuity in the Tourly region, located between the Seine fault and
   the Bray fault. This discontinuity, marking the frontier between two
   electrically different crusts, probably corresponds to a subvertical and
   not oblique Variscan suture zone. As the axis of the PBMA. is located
   about 50 km to the west of this electrical discontinuity, it has no
   genetic relation with the Variscan suture. Its origin is older, probably
   Precadomian. (C) 2000 Academie des sciences / Editions scientifiques et

Abstract = {{Dendritic cells (DC) are highly specialized APC that are critical for
   the initiation of T cell-dependent immune responses. DC exert a sentinel
   function while immature and, after activation by inflammatory stimuli or
   infectious agents, mature and migrate into lymphoid organs to prime T
   cells. We have analyzed integrin expression on monocyte-derived DC
   (MDDC) and found that expression of CD49d integrins (CD49d/CD29 and
   CD49d/beta 7) was induced/up-regulated during TNF-alpha- or
   LPS-initiated MDDC maturation, reflecting the induction/up-regulation of
   CD49d and beta 7 mRNA, CD49d mRNA steady-state level increased more than
   10 times during maturation, with the highest levels observed 24 h after
   TNF-alpha treatment. CD49d integrin expression conferred mature
   MDDC,vith an elevated capacity to adhere to the CS-1 fragment of
   fibronectin, and also mediated transendothelial migration of mature
   MDDC, Up-regulation of CD49d integrin expression closely paralleled that
   of the mature DC marker CD83. CD49d integrin expression was dependent on
   cell maturation, as its induction was abrogated by N-acetylcysteine,
   which inhibits NF-kappa B activation and the functional and phenotypic
   maturation of MDDC. Moreover, CD49d integrin up-regulation and MDDC
   maturation were prevented by SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38
   mitogen-activated protein kinase, but were almost unaffected by the
   mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-related kinase kinase 1/2
   inhibitor PD98059, Our results support the existence of a link between
   functional and phenotypic maturation of MDDC and CD49d integrin
   expression, thus establishing CD49d as a maturation marker for MDDC. The
   differential expression of CD49d on immature and mature MDDC might
   contribute to their distinct motility capabilities and mediate mature DC
   migration into lymphoid organs.}},

   with the measured frequency of magnetospheric held line resonances, and
   is up to an order of magnitude smaller than for a dipolar magnetic

Abstract = {{This work reports the discovery and functional characterization of
   catalytically active hammerhead motifs within satellite DNA of the
   pDo500 family from several Dolichopoda cave cricket species. We show
   that in vitro transcribed RNA of some members of this satellite DNA
   family do self-cleave in vitro, This self-cleavage activity is
   correlated with the efficient in vivo processing of long primary
   transcripts into monomer-sized RNA. The high sequence conservation of
   the satellite pDo500 DNA family among genetically isolated Dolichopoda
   schiavazzii populations, as well as other Dolichopoda species, along
   with the fact that satellite members are actively transcribed in vivo
   suggests that the hammerhead-encoding satellite transcripts are under
   selective pressure, perhaps because they fulfil an important
   physiological role or function. Remarkably, this is the third example of
   hammerhead ribozyme structures associated with transcribed repetitive
   DNA sequences from animals. The possibility that such an association may
   not be purely coincidental is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Effective protection against Listeria monocytogenes requires Ag-specific
   CD8(+) T cells.-A substantial proportion of CD8(+) T cells activated
   during L. monocytogenes infection of C57BL/6 mice are restricted by the
   MHC class Ib molecule H2-M3. In this study, an H2-M3-restricted CD8(+) T
   cell clone specific for a known H2-M3 epitope (fMIGWII) was generated
   from L, monocytogenes-infected mice. The clone was cytotoxic, produced
   IFN-gamma, and could mediate strong protection against L, monocytogenes
   when transferred to infected mice. Macrophages pulsed with heat-killed
   Listeriae presented Ag to the clone in a TAP-independent manner. Both
   TAP-independent and -dependent processing occurred in vivo, as
   TAP-deficient mice infected,vith L, monocytogenes were partially
   protected by adoptive transfer of the clone, This is the first example
   of CD8(+) T cell-mediated, TAP-independent protection against a pathogen
   in vivo, confirming the importance of alternative MHC class I processing
   pathways in the antibacterial immunity.}},

Title = {{Salt conservation, free surface, and varying levels: a new formulation
   for ocean general circulation models}},

Volume = {{105}},

Abstract = {{In order to clarify the link between ocean salt content (OSC)
   conservation and the freshwater flux formulation in ocean general
   circulation models (OGCMs), a varying level thickness, nonlinear free
   surface version of the OPA is presented. Linear/nonlinear free surface
   equations are solved using an original approach based on an explicit
   damping of fast external gravity waves. The method leaves both the
   potential vorticity equation and the equilibrium state unchanged. Its
   numerics and cost are quite similar to those of implicit schemes. When
   nonlinearities are kept, a variable first level thickness is required.
   Its discretization is determined by volume and energy constraints. The
   OSC conservation depends on the surface kinematic equation used. Four
   formulations are presented: (1) virtual salt flux (fixed ocean volume
   and no volume flux), (2) natural (fixed ocean volume and volume flux),
   (3) linear free surface (fixed volume and volume flux computed from a
   linear free surface equation), and (4) assumption free (variable volume
   computed from a nonlinear free surface equation). Their impact is
   illustrated in 25 year low-resolution global OGCM simulations. In all
   cases the first-order ocean response is quite similar, as the
   concentration-dilution effect always exists. Formulations 4 and 2 ensure
   a strict conservation of the OSC. Nevertheless, the difference in
   formulation 3 is not strong enough to play a significant role: the
   conservation is almost perfect. Only formulation 1 neglects fresh
   water-driven surface pumping. This mainly modifies the sea surface
   salinity of the ocean basin where river runoffs are strong. No
   significant difference is found between the other formulations as a
   large time step dampens high-frequency free surface motion. The best
   compromise for climate is the linear free surface formulation. It allows
   a nearly exact OSC conservation, introduces the fresh water-driven
   pumping, and runs faster than all the other formulations.}},

Abstract = {{Ce ions in (CexLa1-x)B-6 have a Gamma (8) ground multiplet, which is
   fourfold degenerate and has orbital and spin content. The interaction
   between Ce ions is of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) type,
   which competes with the Kondo screening. The conduction states of the
   compound are described by three approximately ellipsoidal pockets
   centered at the X points of the cubic lattice. The RKKY interaction is
   calculated considering the interference of the three pockets. The
   interaction strength strongly depends on the relative position of the
   ions, as well as on the relative orientation of the line joining two
   ions td the cubic crystalline field axis. The sixteen states of a pair
   of Ce ions are split by the RKKY interaction into a singlet, a triplet,
   and a twelvefold degenerate level. The ground state is always either a
   singlet or a tripler, depending on the sign of the interaction. Using
   the exact Bethe ansatz solution of a model for a pair of interacting
   impurities with Gamma (8) ground multiplet, we calculate the occupation
   of the levels, the magnetic-field susceptibility, the specific-heat
   gamma coefficient, and the Wilson ratio for the ground state as a
   function of the ratio of the RKKY coupling strength to the Kondo
   temperature along the main crystallographic directions. As a consequence
   of the RKKY splitting a pair of impurities always has a quadrupolar
   moment. The implication of the interactions on the quadrupolar order of
   CeB6 is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a femtosecond time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy

   high nonlinear refractive index were used as the Kerr media to obtain a
   subpicosecond time resolution. When a quartz plate was used as the Kerr
   medium. the Kerr efficiency and the instrumental response time of our
   spectroscopic system were 5-10\% and similar to 250 fs, respectively. By
   employing the OKG method, we revealed the internal conversion from S-2
   to S-1 state of beta -carotene with a low fluorescence quantum yield and
   an ultrafast fluorescence decay time, and the lifetime of the S-2 state
   was determined to be 210 fs. An advantage of the OKG method relative to
   the conventional up-conversion technique is its ability to directly
   obtain time-resolved luminescence spectra, and thus the OKG method might
   be superior to the up-conversion technique to investigate ultrafast

Abstract = {{We investigate the phenomenology of warm inflation and present generic

   amplitude of their spectra calculated. In addition we derive the ratio

   adiabatic, isocurvature and tensor perturbations formed in the warm
   inflationary era. These results are presented in a simplified and
   compact approach that is generally applicable. Our results are
   illustrated by inflation models with polynomial and exponential
   potentials. We compare our analytic results against numerical models and
   find excellent agreement. Finally, presently available data are used to
   put constraints on warm inflation and we discuss how near-future
   observations may distinguish the warm inflationary scenario from
   standard supercooled inflation. The main observable difference is the
   different scalar-to-tensor ratio, and that the consistency relation

Abstract = {{The combination of hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV)
   vaccinations can offer convenience, increased compliance and cost
   saving. We have studied the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of
   combined hepatitis A and B vaccination in young adults (16-35 years
   old). Eighty healthy young adults were divided into two random groups.
   One group received the combined hepatitis A and B vaccine (HAB) in one
   arm while the other group was administered concomitant hepatitis A and B
   vaccines (HAV + HBV) in the right and left arms, respectively. The
   immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety were assessed after each dose
   in both the groups. In local symptoms, the percentage of the combined
   HAB group was lower than the HAV + HBV group, and the general symptoms
   were noted in approximately 30\% of each group without any significant
   difference. No serious adverse effects were noted. All the subjects were
   seropositive for antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) after one dose
   of vaccine, and remained seropositive after three doses in both groups.
   The seropositive rate for antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen
   (anti-HBs) was significantly higher (84\%) in the combined HAB group
   than the concomitant HAV + HBV group (62\%), (p < 0.05) after dose two,
   and all the subjects were seropositive (100\%) after the third dose. The
   GMTs of anti-HAV and anti-HBs were not significantly different between
   groups 1 and 2 (p > 0.1) except in month 6 when the GMT of anti-HBs was
   higher in HAB group (p = 0.0039). The combined HAB vaccine was found to
   be safe, well tolerated and had less local symptoms in young adults. The
   immunogenicity and reactogenicity were similar to the concomitant HAV +
   HBV vaccines. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions of TCE with ``clean{''} and ``partially oxidized{''}

   reactions with FeO depending on the moisture content of the reaction
   medium. Unlike the aqueous phase, water was a critical variable
   competing with TCE for adsorption sites a nd, above a critical limit,
   serving as a proton donor for the hydrogenolysis of TCE. The adsorption
   of water (relative humidity, RH = 6-97\%) was fit to a multilayer BET
   isotherm. The extent of water adsorption was nearly identical for both
   forms of FeO on a surface area basis, i.e., mol/m(2). The adsorption of
   TCE decreased by more than 1 order of magnitude from 6\% to 10\% RH,
   after which a more stable region (<50\% decrease between 20\% and 97\%
   RH) appeared above monolayer water coverage (<similar to>26\% RH). The
   removal of TCE from the gas phase was strictly by adsorption up to a

Abstract = {{The variability of winter average U.S. precipitation displays strong
   geographical dependence with large variability in the southeastern and

   precipitation with Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) is examined in

   first SVD mode indicates the U.S. precipitation pattern that is
   associated with the tropical El Nino/La Nina SST variation, while the
   second and third SVD modes relate the precipitation variability in the
   Pacific Northwest and southeast that is associated with the North
   Pacific SST variation. About 45\% of the U.S. precipitation
   variabilities is related to the Pacific SST anomalies, among which, 35\%
   is related to the North Pacific SST and 10\% is related to the tropical
   Pacific SST. Each SVD precipitation pattern is associated with
   well-organized 500-mb height and zonal mean zonal wind anomalies. It is
   shown that the North Pacific SST anomalies associated with the U.S.
   precipitation are primarily driven by extratropical atmospheric

Title = {{How ocean vertical mixing and accumulation of warm surface water

Number = {{20}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{This work utilizes an equatorial Pacific domain ocean general
   circulation model that achieves a sharp equatorial thermocline. The
   model has been developed for simulation of the El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation phenomenon and employs an integer power (IP) vertical mixing
   scheme formulation that is based on the observations of Peters. Gregg,
   and Toole.
   Model experiments are used to investigate the influence of warm surface
   water accumulation upon vertical mixing scheme performance.
   Straightforward techniques, applicable to any model, are used to
   diagnose the warm surface water accumulation. It is shown that if warm
   surface water is allowed to accumulate it can prevent the IP vertical
   mixing scheme from maintaining a Sharp thermocline. Experiments reveal
   that, in the present model, the accumulation of the warm surface water
   occurs as a consequence of the model's zonal walls and their sponge
   layers. A parameterized wall heat transport scheme is then used to
   prevent: the accumulation of warm surface water and this allows the IP
   scheme to maintain a sharp thermocline, but not the Pacanowski and
   Philander vertical mixing scheme.
   Results from a literature survey suggest that the problem of warm
   surface water accumulation may not be uncommon in other tropical ocean
   models with zonal walls and sponge layers, and that this may be one of
   the causes of the long-standing diffuse thermocline problem in these
   models. It is concluded that to achieve a sharp equatorial thermocline
   it is necessary for an ocean model to maintain realistic meridional heat
   transports and so correctly regulate the amount of warm surface water in
   the tropical ocean, and it is demonstrated that problems with vertical
   mixing and warm surface water accumulation can look confusingly similar.
   The ability of warm surface water accumulation to prevent a vertical
   mixing scheme from achieving a sharp thermocline may have influenced
   previous assessments of vertical mixing schemes.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated causes and consequences of interspecific competition
   among canopy-tree species with different shade-tolerance. The shading
   effects caused by neighbors were determined fur three tree species,
   shade-tolerant Fagus crenata, and intermediate tolerant Quercus crispula
   and Magnolia obovata, in six even-aged stands containing different
   proportions of each species. The competitive attributes (sensitivity to
   suppression and intensity of shading) varied considerably among species.
   Shade-tolerant F. crenata caused most intensive shading effects probably
   because of its deeper crown depth. Less-tolerant Q. crispula decreased
   its stem growth and crown depth markedly in association with the
   presence of shade-tolerant F. crenata. In contrast, F. crenata and M.
   obovata were less influenced by their neighbors; it may be due to its
   own higher shade-tolerance in the case of F. crenata and larger initial
   growth rates in ill. obovata. We suppose that differences in initial
   species composition may lead a species to have different dominance in
   stand development. When shade-tolerant species are absent in mixture,
   less shade-tolerant species could maintain their dominance for a long
   period. In contrast, mixture with tolerant species would reduce the
   dominance of less-tolerant species, unless they had growth advantage in
   early stage in development. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Complex hydrological events such as floods always appear to be
   multivariate events that are characterized by a few correlated
   variables. A complete understanding of these events needs to investigate
   joint probabilistic behaviours of these correlated variables. The
   lognormal distribution is one of frequently selected candidates for
   flood-frequency analysis. The multivariate lognormal distribution will
   serve as an important tool for analysing a multivariate flood episode.
   This article presents a procedure for using the bivariate lognormal
   distribution to describe the joint distributions of correlated flood
   peaks and volumes, and correlated flood volumes and durations. Joint
   distributions, conditional distributions, and the associated return
   periods of these random variables can be readily derived from their
   marginal distributions. The approach is verified using observed
   streamflow data from the Nord river basin, located in the Province of
   Quebec, Canada. The theoretical distributions show a good fit to

Abstract = {{The fatigue crack growth behavior of gamma-based titanium aluminides
   (TiAl) with a fine duplex structure and lamellar structure has been
   investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) in situ observation
   in vacuum at 750 degrees C and room temperature. For the duplex
   structured material the fatigue crack growth rates are dominated by the
   maximum stress intensity, particularly at 750 degrees C. The threshold
   stress intensity range for fatigue crack growth at 750 degrees C is
   lower than that at room temperature for any corresponding stress ratio.
   The fatigue crack growth rate at 750 degrees C is affected by creep
   deformation in front of the crack tip. The severe crack blunting occurs
   when the stress ratio is 0.5. For the lamellar structured material the
   scatter of fatigue crack growth data is very large. Small cracks
   propagate at the stress intensity range below the threshold for long
   fatigue crack growth. The effects of microstructure on fatigue crack
   growth are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights

   cell lines and corresponding tissues; (iii) SULT gene expression in
   normal cultured cells is generally comparable to the expression in

   is mainly tissue specific; however, both promoters are frequently used
   in SULT 1A3 expression; and (v) the expression profile of SULT 1A1, 1A3,

Abstract = {{Background Smoking and airway lability, which is expressed by histamine
   airway hyper-responsiveness, are known risk factors for development of
   respiratory symptoms. Smoking is also associated with increased
   mortality risks. We studied whether airway hyper-responsiveness is
   associated with increased mortality, and whether this risk was
   independent of smoking and reduced lung function.
   Methods We followed up 2008 inhabitants of the communities of
   Vlagtwedde, Vlaardingen, and Meppel (Netherlands), who had histamine
   challenge test data, from 1964-72 for 30 years. Follow-up was 99\%
   successful (29 patients lost to follow-up) with 1453 participants alive
   and 526 deaths (246 died from cardiovascular disease, 54 from lung
   cancer, and 21 from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease {[}COPD]).
   Findings Mortality from COPD increased with more severe
   hyper-responsiveness; relative risks of 3.83 (95\% CI 0.97-15.1), 4.40
   (1.16-16.7), 4.78 (1.27-18.0), 6.69 (1.71-26.1), and 15.8 (3.72-67.1)
   were associated with histamine thresholds of 32 g/L, 16 g/L, 8 g/L, 4
   g/L, and 1 g/L, respectively, compared with no hyper-responsiveness.
   These risks were adjusted for sex, age, smoking, lung function,
   body-mass index, positive skin tests, eosinophilia, asthma, and city of
   residence.
   Interpretation Increased histamine airway hyperresponsiveness predicts
   mortality from COPD. Although this trend was more pronounced in smokers,
   an increasing proportion of COPD deaths with increasing
   hyperresponsiveness was also present among individuals who had never
   smoked.}},

Abstract = {{To elucidate the detailed process of exocytosis at the highest possible
   accuracy, we dissociated the pancreatic acinus of the guinea pig and
   observed zymogen granules under a video-enhanced contrast differential
   interference contrast (VEC-DIC) microscope. The preparation was thin
   enough to resolve each zymogen granule with the best clarity. When
   acinar cells were stimulated with ACh (20 muM), many zymogen granules
   near the lumen showed an abrupt light intensity change. For a period of
   10 s immediately before exocytosis, zymogen granules neither shifted
   their position nor altered their shape within an accuracy of 38 nm, The
   time required for individual granules to change the light intensity (the
   releasing time) ranged from 0.15 to 0.70 s. After each response, the
   granule maintained its altered contrast for a few seconds until it was
   retrieved to a planar membrane. No compound exocytosis including
   granule-granule fusion was observed. We concluded that the exocytosis is
   not directly initiated by any supramolecular change but by a purely
   molecular event. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Tick-borne meningo-encephalitis (TBE) is caused by a
   flavivirus species that is transmitted from rodents to humans by Ixodes
   ticks. The clinical picture of central nervous system involvement varies
   from febrile headache to lethal encephalitis. To date no specific
   treatment exists, although protective active immunisation is available.
   Methods: We present the clinical and epidemiological data from 73
   patients with TEE who acquired the infection in Canton Thurgau in the
   years 1996-1999.
   Results: Canton Thurgau is a state in eastern Switzerland with a
   population of 230 000. Within the last five years the reported cases of
   TEE have increased more than threefold. The area where infectious tick
   bites were registered has expanded from the western to the eastern part
   and now encompasses the entire state. The risk of infection is clearly
   related to frequent activities in wooded areas, though outdoor
   activities not in forests also carry a considerable risk. In >80\% of
   the cases a postviral neurasthenic syndrome develops involving absence
   from work for two months on average. In the elderly and patients who
   present with encephalitic symptoms, a worse outcome with persistent
   neurological symptoms or even death has been observed.
   Conclusion: The increasing incidence of TEE, the expansion of infectious
   ticks to the east and high morbidity justify active immunisation against
   TEE on a broad scale in Canton Thurgau.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. To describe the profile of clients seen across the broad spectrum
   of dedicated alcohol and drug treatment services in New Zealand.
   Methods. 217 randomly selected alcohol and drug treatment workers in New
   Zealand were interviewed by telephone, yielding a randomly selected
   sample of 291 clients. Workers were asked to identify the age, gender,
   ethnicity, main substance use problem and geographical location of
   clients.
   Results. 60\% of clients were male, 28\% were Maori, the mean age was 31
   years and the largest group of clients were seen for alcohol related
   issues (45\%), followed by cannabis (27\%) and opioids (17\%). None of
   these variables differed significantly across
   residential/non-residential services. Significant trends to emerge were:
   that Maori clients were more likely to live rurally and to be in
   treatment for cannabis use, women were more likely to be in treatment
   for benzodiazepine use and less likely for cannabis use, opioid users
   were more likely to be seen at Crown Health Enterprise funded services,
   and cannabis users were (on average) younger than other clients, while
   alcohol users were older.
   Conclusions. Alcohol and drug treatment services are dominated by
   clients seeking assistance with alcohol and cannabis use problems. Women
   are not under-represented in this population Maori are over-represented.
   This contrasts with the absence of Asian clients and an
   underrepresentation of Pacific Island clients. There are some
   significant variations in the types of drugs used by different
   demographic treatment seeking populations. In contrast, client
   differences across treatment settings are minimal.}},

   binding of {[}H-3]mesulergine in the presence of the selective 5-HT2A
   receptor Ligand spiperone. Both {[}H-3]MDL 100,907 and
   {[}H-3]mesulergine demonstrated high affinity binding to single sites in
   rabbit membranes. Based on Scatchard plots of {[}H-3]MDL 100,907
   binding, the mean B-max was 8.5 +/- 0.7 fmol/mg tissue and the mean K-d
   was 33.1 +/- 3.5 pM. For {[}H-3]mesulergine binding the mean B-max was
   3.70 +/- 0.58 fmol/mg tissue and the mean K-d was 0.35 +/- 0.05 nM.
   Binding of {[}H-3]MDL 100,907 to the 5-HT2A receptor and of
   {[}H-3]mesulergine to the 5-HT2C receptor was confirmed by displacement
   studies with highly selective 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor ligands. The
   pharmacological profile of these ligands in rabbits correlated highly
   with published values for 5-HT2A (r = 0.91, P < 0.001) and 5-HT2C (r =
   0.94, P < 0.001) receptors in humans. There was also a high correlation
   between the profiles for human and rat 5-HT2C receptor(r = 0.92, P <
   0.001), but not for 5-HT2A receptors (r = 0.53, P > 0.10). It was
   concluded that the rabbit provides an appropriate animal model for
   studies attempting to predict the pharmacology of human 5-HT2A and
   5-HT2C receptors. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) with phorbol
   la-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is known to decrease c-myc mRNA by
   blocking transcription elongation at sites near the first exon/intron
   border. Treatment of HL-60 cells with either PMA or bryostatin 1, which
   acutely activates protein kinase C (PKC), decreased the levels of myc
   mRNA and Myc protein. The inhibition of Myc synthesis accounted for the
   drop in Myc protein, because PMA treatment had no effect on Myc
   turnover. Treatment with PMA or bryostatin 1 increased nuclear protein
   binding to MIE1, a c-myc intron 1 element that defines an RFX1-binding X
   box. RFX1 antiserum supershifted MIE1-protein complexes. Increased MIE1
   binding was independent of protein synthesis and abolished by a
   selective PKC inhibitor, which also prevented the effect of PMA on myc
   mRNA and protein levels and Myc synthesis. PMA treatment increased RFX1
   in the nuclear fraction and decreased it in the cytosol without
   affecting total RFX1. Transfection of HL-60 cells with myc reporter gene
   constructs showed that the RFX1-binding X box was required for the
   downregulation of reporter gene expression by PMA. These findings
   suggest that nuclear translocation and binding of RFX1 to the X box
   cause the down-regulation of myc expression, which follows acute PKC
   activation in undifferentiated HL-60 cells.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of adult nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons exhibit a
   bistable membrane potential that fluctuates between a relatively
   hyperpolarized (Down) state (average = -76 mV) and a less hyperpolarized
   (Up) state (average = -60 mV) near tiring threshold. During in vivo
   extracellular recordings from nucleus accumbens neurons, we used
   microiontophoresis to apply glutamate and selected neurons that fired in
   bursting patterns reflecting a subthreshold bistable membrane potential.
   The average frequency of bursts events was 0.85 Hz. The average burst
   duration was 392+/-3.5 ms, with an average of 13.4 spikes and an average
   spike frequency of 30.6+/-3.1 Hz, per burst. To determine the
   involvement of the L-type calcium channel in the bursting pattern, we
   applied the benzothiazepine L-type calcium channel blocker, diltiazem.
   Diltiaem rapidly (<2 min) and reversibly decreased the burst duration by
   29\% and the frequency of spikes within a burst by 30\% without changing
   the overall burst event frequency. The results provide the first in vivo
   electrophysiological evidence implicating an L-type calcium channel that
   modulates glutamate-induced burst firing of nucleus accumbens neurons.

Abstract = {{The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify binding partners of
   NuMA, a component of the nuclear matrix in interphase cells. By using
   the C-terminal half of NuMA as bait, a human cDNA sequence coding for a
   223-amino acid protein with a non-helical N-terminal domain and a
   C-terminal a-helical portion was identified and fully sequenced. It was
   identical to GAS41, a sequence amplified in human gliomas, The sequence
   of the homologous Drosophila protein was established, and the alignment
   for GAS41 from nine different species showed that GAS41 is a general
   eukaryotic protein found in species as diverse as Arabidopsis,
   Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, yeast, and man. Northern blot
   analysis showed a single transcript in eight human tissues. A polyclonal
   antibody to GAS41 showed a dotted staining pattern in interphase nuclei
   and a uniform distribution in mitotic cells. A GFP-GAS41 fusion protein
   displayed equivalent patterns. In vitro GAS41 bound to the C-terminal
   part of the rod region of NuMA, as shown by dot overlay and by surface
   plasmon resonance measurements. The K-d of the complex was 2 x 10(-7) M.
   GAS41 is related to the AF-9 and ENL proteins, which are putative
   transcription factors found as fusion proteins in some acute leukemias.
   The NuMA/GAS41 interaction may provide a link between nuclear structure
   and gene expression.}},

Abstract = {{The c-myc gene is translocated to one of the immunoglobulin genes in
   Burkitt's lymphoma resulting in deregulated expression of c-myc. Several
   enhancers have been shown to be important for expression of the
   immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. Four enhancer regions
   (murine-hypersensitive sites (MHS) 1, 2, 3, and 4) located 3' of the
   murine immunoglobulin heavy chain gene play a role in activating
   expression of the translocated c-myc gene. The enhancer regions also
   result in a shift in transcriptional initiation from the P2 promoter to
   P1 that is characteristic of the translocated c-myc allele. We found
   that the most 3' enhancer region (MHS4) activated the c-myc promoter by
   46-fold in the Raji Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, and it was the most
   active enhancer in these cells. The addition of enhancer regions MHS1,2
   and 3 to MHS4 increased c-myc transcription by an additional 3-fold and
   resulted in the full promoter shift from Pa to P1. By deletion analysis
   of enhancer region MHS4, we located a region that was critical for the
   transcriptional activity of MHS4. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
   analysis revealed that NF-kappa B/Rel family members bound to this
   region. Mutation of the NF-kappa B binding site abolished both the
   enhancer activity and the promoter shift activity of MHS4. An active
   NF-kappa B site was also identified in the human HS4 enhancer.
   Inhibition of c-myc promoter activity driven by the immunoglobulin
   enhancers was observed with expression of a super-repressor I kappa B
   alpha construct. These results indicate that the NF-kappa B/Rel
   transcription factors play an important role in the deregulation of the
   translocated c-myc gene in Burkitt's lymphoma and suggest that
   interference with NF-kappa B function may represent a new approach to
   the treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma.}},

   at 2 and 41\% (relative to apoB100) of its amino acid sequence. We
   conducted similar studies using monoclonal antibodies against the NH,
   and COOH termini of apoB100 in HepG2 cells. After radiolabeling,
   microsomes were immunoisolated from transfected CHO cells using
   anti-c-Mye or anti-HA antibodies. Throughout a 60-min chase in the
   presence of N-acetyl-leucylnorleucinal, more than 90\% of microsomes
   were isolated by anti-HA antibodies, whereas less than 10\% were
   isolated by anti-c-Mye antibodies. Proteinase K digestion of total
   microsomes consistently generated two fragments (similar to 70 and
   similar to 120 kDa) of apoB42 containing the NH, terminus throughout the
   chase; no fragments containing the COOH terminus were detected.
   Immunofluorescent studies of transfected CHO cells were consistent with
   results from the labeling studies. Essentially identical results were
   obtained from pulse-chase studies in both native and apoB42-transfected
   HepG2 cells. The present studies support a model in which, in the
   absence of adequate core lipid synthesis, there is partial translocation
   of apoB leading to cytosolic exposure, ubiquitination, and proteasomal
   degradation directly from the original translocation channel.}},

Abstract = {{Platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR beta) in fibroblasts
   is concentrated in caveolae where it controls the tyrosine
   phosphorylation of multiple proteins. Caveolae are enriched in
   cholesterol and sphingolipids, but the role of these lipids in PDGFR
   signal transduction is unknown. We report that introduction of
   cholest-4-en-3-one into caveolae membranes uncouples PDGFR
   autophosphorylation from tyrosine phosphorylation of neighboring
   proteins. Cholest-4-en-3-one appears to interfere with the normal
   interaction between PDGFR and its partners. The results suggest that
   tightly packed caveolae lipids form a membrane platform that functions
   as a lipid scaffold for organizing the molecular interactions of
   multiple signaling pathways.}},

Title = {{Gating of inward rectifier K+ channels by proton-mediated interactions

Abstract = {{Ion channels play an important role in cellular functions, and specific
   cellular activity can be produced by gating them. One important gating
   mechanism is produced by intra- or extracellular ligands, Although the
   ligand-mediated channel gating is an important cellular process, the
   relationship between ligand binding and channel gating is not well
   understood, It is possible that ligands are involved in the interactions
   of different protein domains of the channel leading to opening or
   closing. To test this hypothesis, we studied the gating of Kir2.3 (HIR)
   by intracellular protons. Our results showed that hypercapnia or
   intracellular acidification strongly inhibited these channels. This
   effect relied on both the N and C termini, The CO2/pH sensitivities were
   abolished or compromised when one of the intracellular termini was
   replaced. Using purified N- and C-terminal peptides, we found that the N
   and C termini bound to each other in vitro. Although their binding was
   weak at pH 7.4, stronger binding was seen at pH 6.6, Two short sequences
   in the N and C termini were found to be critical for the N/C-terminal
   interaction. Interestingly, there was no titratable residue in these
   motifs, To identify the potential protonation sites, we systematically
   mutated most histidine residues in the intracellular N and C termini, We
   found that mutations of several histidine residues in the C but not the
   N terminus had a major effect on channel sensitivities to CO2 and pH(i).
   These results suggest that at acidic pH, protons appear to interact with
   the C-terminal histidine residues and present the C terminus to the N
   terminus. Consequentially, these two intracellular termini bound to each
   other through two short motifs and closed the channel. Thus, a novel
   mechanism for K+ channel gating is demonstrated, which involves the N-
   and C-terminal interaction with protons as the mediator.}},

Abstract = {{Since a negative calcium balance is present in spontaneously
   hypertensive rats, we searched for the gene(s) involved in this
   dysregulation. A cDNA library was constructed from the spontaneously
   hypertensive rat parathyroid gland, which is a key regulator of
   serum-ionized calcium. From seven overlapping DNA fragments, a 1100-base
   pair novel cDNA containing an open reading frame of 224 codons was
   reconstituted. This novel gene, named HCaRG (hypertension-related,
   calcium-regulated gene), was negatively regulated by extracellular
   calcium con centration, and its basal mRNA levels were higher in
   hypertensive animals. The deduced protein showed no transmembrane
   domain, 67\% alpha-helix content, a mutated calcium-binding site
   (EF-hand motif), four putative ``leucine zipper{''} moths, and a nuclear
   receptor-binding domain. At the subcellular level, HCaRG had a nuclear
   localization. We cloned the human homolog of this gene. Sequence
   comparison revealed 80\% homology between rats and humans at the
   nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Tissue distribution showed a
   preponderance in the heart, stomach, jejunum, kidney (tubular fraction),
   liver, and adrenal gland (mainly in the medulla). HCaRG mRNA was
   significantly more expressed in adult than in fetal organs, and its
   levels were decreased in tumors and cancerous cell lines. We observed
   that after 60-min ischemia followed by reperfusion, HCaRG mRNA declined
   rapidly in contrast with an increase in c-myc mRNA. Its levels then rose
   steadily to exceed base Line at 48 h of reperfusion. HEK293 cells stably
   transfected with HCaRG exhibited much lower proliferation, as shown by
   cell count and {[}H-3]thymidine incorporation. Taken together, our
   results suggest that HCaRG is a nuclear protein potentially involved in
   the control of cell proliferation.}},

Abstract = {{In astrocytes, thyroxine modulates type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase
   levels by initiating the binding of the endosomes containing the enzyme
   to microfilaments, followed by actin-based endocytosis. Myosin V is a
   molecular motor thought to participate in vesicle trafficking in the
   brain. In this report, we developed an in vitro actin-binding assay to
   characterize the thyroid hormone-dependent binding of endocytotic
   vesicles to microfilaments. Thyroxine and reverse triiodothyronine (EC,,
   levels similar to 1 nM) were >100-fold more potent than
   3,5,3'-triiodothyronine in initiating vesicle binding to actin fibers in
   vitro, Thyroxine-dependent vesicle binding was calcium-, magnesium-, and
   ATP-dependent, suggesting the participation of one or more myosin
   motors, presumably myosin V. Addition of the myosin V globular tail,
   lacking the actin-binding head, specifically blocked thyroid
   hormone-dependent vesicle binding, and direct binding of the myosin V
   tail to enzyme-containing endosomes was thyroxine-dependent, Progressive
   NH2-terminal deletion of the myosin V tail and domain-specific antibody
   inhibition studies revealed that the thyroxine-dependent
   vesicle-tethering domain was localized to the last 21 amino acids of the
   COOP terminus. These data show that myosin V is responsible for thyroid
   hormone-dependent binding of primary endosomes to the microfilaments and
   suggest that this motor mediates the actin-based endocytosis of the type
   II iodothyronine deiodinase.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the effects of active site-directed, fibrinogen recognition
   exosite (FRE)-directed and bifunctional thrombin inhibitors, on
   shear-induced platelet reactivity (adhesion/aggregation) and dynamic
   coagulation (coagulation of flowing blood). An in vitro test for
   shear-induced haemostatic plug formation and dynamic coagulation
   (haemostatometry) was employed using non-anticoagulated rat blood. The
   active site-directed inhibitors (argatroban, P891, P899) caused
   inhibition of platelet reactivity and coagulation at 1-, 100- and 100-mu
   M concentrations, respectively. Bifunctional inhibitors (P553, P1053)
   exerted inhibitory effects at 0.1 mu M. A dimeric bifunctional inhibitor
   P824 caused significant inhibition at 1 mu M The FRE-directed inhibitor
   (P960) inhibited shear-induced platelet reactivity at 10 mu M but the
   dynamic coagulation at 1 mu M. Combination of active site-directed
   argatroban and FRE-directed P960 did not show any synergistic effect.
   The most potent inhibition was observed in monomeric bifunctional
   inhibitors. The inhibitory effects were compared with the K-i values
   against human thrombin and with the IC50 values against fibrin clot
   formation. The minimum effective concentrations on shear-induced
   platelet reactivity and dynamic coagulation were comparable with the
   IC50 values, but not with the K-i values. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Intracellular iron homeostasis is regulated, in part, by interactions
   between iron-regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) and iron-responsive
   elements (IREs) in ferritin and transferrin receptor mRNAs. In addition
   to iron, cellular oxidative stress induced by H2O2, nitric oxide, and
   hypoxia, and hormonal activation by thyroid hormone and erythropoeitin
   have each been shown to regulate IRP binding to IREs. Hormonal signals,
   in particular mediated through protein kinase C (PKC), play a central
   role in the modulation of IRP/IRE interactions since phorbol esters were
   shown to activate IRP binding (Eisenstein, R. S., Tuazon, P. T.,
   Schalinske, K. L., Anderson, S. A., and Traugh, J. A. (1993) J. Biol.
   Chem. 268, 27363-27370). In pituitary thyrotrophs (TtT97), we found that
   thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and epidermal growth factor (EGF)
   increased IRP binding to a ferritin IRE, dependent on PKC and
   mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity. In contrast, TRH and
   EGF decreased IRP binding in pituitary lactotrophs (GH3), despite
   activation of PKC and MAPK. IRP1 and IRP2 levels remained constant and
   IRP2 binding was predominant throughout. TRH and EGF markedly decreased
   IRP binding in MAPK kinase inhibitor-treated GH3 cells, whereas, they
   increased IRP binding in phosphatase inhibitor-treated GH3 cells.
   IRE-dependent CAT reporter translational expression closely reflected
   IRP binding to the ferritin IRE in both GH3 and TtT97 cells.
   Interestingly, ferritin protein levels were regulated similarly by TRH
   in both cell lines. These data link two different cell receptor systems
   to common signaling pathways that regulate IRP binding and ferritin
   expression. Remarkably, for TRH and EGF, these effects may be
   PKC-dependent or -independent determined by the cell type.}},

Abstract = {{We examined p53 protein stability and DNA damage-induced p53-dependent
   responses in a human leukemic CEM cell line and two teniposide-resistant
   sublines, CEM/VM-1 and CEM/VM-1-5 (similar to 40 and 400-fold resistant
   to teniposide, respectively). Although all cell lines contain the same
   p53 mutations at codons 175 (Arg-->His) and 248 (Arg-->Gln), the
   constitutive levels of p53 were progressively increased with the
   resistance of the cells to teniposide, By pulse-chase experiments, we
   found that the half-lives of mutant p53 protein were approximately 12,
   17, and >30 h in CEM, CEM/VM-1, and CEM/VM-1-5 cells, respectively. The
   prolonged half-lives of p53 in these cells is consistent with the fact
   that the protein harbors the indicated mutations. Of note, however, is
   the fact that the increased p53 protein half-lives in the two
   drug-resistant cell lines corresponds to a proportional decrease in MDM2
   protein levels but an increase in p53-MDM2 binding interactions. This
   suggests that MDM2-mediated p53 degradation may be altered in our
   leukemic cell lines. The DNA damage-induced p53 response is fully
   functional in the drug-sensitive CEM cells containing a mutant p53, but
   this pathway is attenuated in the drug-resistant cells. Specifically,
   while the mutant p53 was phosphorylated at serine-15 in response to
   ionizing radiation in all these cell lines, mutant p53 induction in
   response to teniposide or ionizing radiation and induction of the
   p53-target genes, p21 and GADD45 only occurred in the drug-sensitive CEM
   cells. As assessed by MTT cytotoxicity assay, CEM cells were also
   significantly more sensitive to ionizing radiation, compared to the
   drug-resistant cell lines, and this correlated with p53 induction.
   Collectively, these results suggest that changes in constitutive mutant
   p53 protein levels, p53-MDM2 binding interactions, and altered
   regulation of the DNA damage-inducible p53-dependent pathway may play a
   role in drug- and radiation-responsiveness in these cells.}},

Abstract = {{We report direct measurements of ultrafast electronic relaxation
   dynamics in BiI3 colloidal nanoparticles using femtosecond transient
   absorption spectroscopy and compare with PbI2, a similar layered iodide
   semiconductor. The BiI3 nanoparticles are prepared using colloidal
   chemistry methods in different solvents, including ethanol, I-butanol,
   acetonitrile, water, and in aqueous poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix as
   well as in inverse micelles. The particle sizes and shapes are
   determined using low- and high-resolution transmission electron
   microscopy. The peak positions of the electronic absorption spectra of
   both PbI2 and BiI3 can be explained using a
   particle-in-a-rectangular-box model. The absorption peaks are found to
   blue shift, and at the same time, the particle size decreases upon aging
   under light for PbI2. These changes are proposed to be caused by
   breakdown of initially formed large single-layered particles into small
   multilayered particles. The differences and similarities in their
   electronic absorption spectra are also addressed. The electronic
   relaxation dynamics in BiI3 nanoparticles are directly monitored, and
   the relaxation is found to be sensitive to solvent and insensitive to
   particle size, similar to that of PbI2. The dynamics are somewhat
   dependent on the probe wavelength but independent of excitation
   intensity. Also similar to PbI2, there appear to be oscillatory features
   at early times with a period changing with solvent but not with particle
   size. These features seem to be characteristic of these layered iodide
   semiconductor nanoparticles. For BiI3, however, the oscillation period
   is slightly shorter and overall relaxation is faster than that in PbI2
   in the same solvent. The electronic relaxation is much faster in aqueous
   solution containing PVA and in inverse micelles with no oscillations
   observed at early times. The results suggest that the surface play a
   major role in the electronic relaxation process of both BiI3 and PbI2.
   The influence of particle size is relatively minor in the size range
   studied (2- 100 nm), probably because the relaxation is dominated by
   surface characteristics that do not vary significantly with size. It
   could also be that the size is much larger than the exciton Bohr radius
   (0.61 nm for bulk BiI3), and thereby spatial confinement is not
   significant in affecting the relaxation process.}},

Abstract = {{Near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) is used to characterize
   nanoscale topographic and fluorescence features of pristine films of the
   stiff-chain polymer polyfluorene. The pristine films of polyfluorene
   bearing two hexyl (1) or dodecyl (2) groups at the 9 position were
   studied. Pristine films appear isotropic using conventional polarized
   light microscopy. NSOM images show two distinct types of film
   morphology, the first of which is characterized by 50-150 nm clusters in
   the topography. These clusters seen in films of 1 and 2 correlate
   directly with regions of lower fluorescence. The cluster correlated
   fluorescence (CCF) is unpolarized and has a slightly greater percent
   contribution from low energy emission than the rest of the polymer film.
   The larger and more frequent regions of CCF in films of 1 versus films
   of 2 indicate they are formed due to poor solubility. NSOM images show a
   second type of morphology that is characterized by 50-500 nm polarized
   domains denoted as long range order (LRO). These domains are distributed
   uniformly in pristine films of 1 and 2. Unlike CCF, the topography and
   fluorescence of LRO do not correlate. A method of NSOM image math is
   introduced to quantify film anisotropy from simultaneously collected
   fluorescence images at orthogonal polarizations. The anisotropy of 2 is
   found to be significantly larger than 1. NSOM images collected at 440 \&
   600 nm show that intra- and interpolymer emitting species are
   distributed evenly throughout the film's LRO. Additional polarization
   images show that intra- and interpolymer fluorescence are polarized
   along the same axis. The dominance of LRO in 2 and the large
   interpolymer emission in 2 (as measured in previous studies) implies
   that the LRO, not the clusters, is responsible for most of the
   interpolymer emission in these polymer films.}},

Abstract = {{Transformation of chick embryo fibroblasts by the v-Jun oncoprotein
   correlates with a down-regulation of the extracellular matrix protein
   SPARC and repression of the corresponding mRNA, Alteration in SPARC
   expression has been repeatedly reported in human cancers of various
   origin, and is thought to contribute to the remodeling of the
   extracellular matrix during neoplastic progression, Transcriptional
   control of SPARC is poorly understood, We show here that (i)
   v-Jun-mediated repression of the endogenous SPARC gene is enhanced by
   Fra2 but alleviated by ATF2, Fra2 and ATF2 being the two major partners
   of v-Jun in the transformed cells; (ii) high basal activity as well as
   repression by v-Jun and modulation by Fra2 and ATF2 is restricted to a
   small proximal fragment (-124/+16) of the chicken SPARC promoter; (iii)
   the activity of this minimal promoter is modulated by all the AP1 family
   members known in chickens (c-Jun and JunD; c-Fos and Fra2; ATF2; c-Maf,
   MafA, and MafB), Taken together these data demonstrate that, at least in
   avian primary cells, SPARC expression is under the control of the AP1
   transcription factor. Further studies with the minimal (-124/+16)
   promoter fragment are needed to understand how this control takes place
   at the molecular level.}},

Abstract = {{EPR and ESI-MS/MS evidence is presented that in the absence of an
   olefinic substrate the reaction between the Mn-III(salen) complexes Al
   (X = Cl) and A2 (X = PF6) and PhIO or NaOCl as oxygen sources leads to
   paramagnetic Mn-IV(salen) complexes. Depending on the solvent and the
   counterion, two distinct Mn-IV (salen) complexes intervene. In CH2Cl2,
   regardless of the counterion, a ClOMnIV(salen) complex (B1) and a
   HOMnIV(salen) complex (B1') are formed by Cl and H atom abstraction from
   CH2Cl2, and the latter deprotonates to the neutral OMnIV(salen) complex
   (B2). In EtOAc as solvent, only the complex B2 is obtained from Al (X =
   Cl), presumably by inner-sphere electron transfer from the chloride ion.
   The Mn-IV(salen) complexes display the following reaction modes toward
   1,2-dihydronaphthalene (1), styrene (2), and the radical probe 3 as
   substrates: Complex B1 chlorinates the olefins 1/2 through an
   electrophilic :pathway to yield the 1,2-dichloro adducts 1a/2a and the
   chlorohydrins 1b/2b (nucleophilic trapping of the initially formed
   benzylic cation), while with olefin 3 the ring-opened dichloro product
   3a results. Complex B2, however, epoxidizes these olefins through a
   radical pathway, as evidenced by the formation of isomerized stilbene
   oxide 4c (cis/trans ratio 36: 64) from cis-stilbene (4). The relevance
   of these paramagnetic Mn-IV(salen) species in Jacobsen-Katsuki catalytic
   epoxidations is scrutinized.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a strategy to tune the orientation of immobilized
   proteins on electrodes of general applicability to different types of
   proteins. We orient ferredoxin:NADP(+) reductase molecules onto a
   modified gold electrode by introducing a genetically engineered metal
   binding site on a selected region of the protein surface and covering
   the gold surface with a self-assembled monolayer of thiols appended with
   nitrilotriacetic acid groups complexed with metal transition ions. Two
   mutants were designed to have a histidine pair (His-X-3-His) on
   surface-exposed alpha -helices located in one of the two protein
   domains. It was first demonstrated that the mutant proteins in solution
   retain their full activity and that the kinetic constants of the redox
   catalytic steps are not affected by the mutations. The enzyme-modified
   gold electrodes were then analyzed for the amount and distribution of
   protein on their surface and for their activity using atomic force
   microscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The two electrode-bound mutant
   enzymes manifested differences in the amount and distribution of bound
   molecules, in the kinetic constants of their redox catalytic steps, and
   most interestingly, in their ability to transfer electrons to a redox
   mediator covalently attached to the self-assembled monolayer. We
   conclude that the position of the mutated alpha -helix determined the
   orientation of the protein with respect to the surface and. as a result,
   its competence to establish direct electrical communication with the
   electrode.}},

Abstract = {{Using ROSAT PSPC data, we have performed several tests aimed at
   understanding the origin of the soft X-ray spectral component detected
   from the bulge of M31. We find that a significant soft component in the
   spectrum of the bulge is spatially correlated with the unresolved X-ray
   emission near the core of M31, which is probably a hot interstellar
   medium or perhaps a population of multiple faint sources. For the first
   time, we extracted the spectrum of this unresolved emission, by removing
   point sources dominating the integral spectrum of the bulge, and found
   it to be responsible for most of the soft excess. A soft spectral
   component is not at all needed to fit the point-source spectrum that
   remains after subtracting the unresolved emission. Tl-le integral
   spectra of bright point sources, both inside and outside of the M31
   bulge, can be fitted with a single power law in the ROSAT band. Our
   analysis rules out the previous suggestion that all bulge emission in
   M31 may be generated by low-mass X-ray binaries (Irwin \& Bregman).}},

   gate arrays to provide electronic functionality and intraplane

   Some of the characteristics exhibited by encryption algorithms and ways
   in which these are applicable to smart-pixel technology are described.
   The implementation of an algorithm in current use, the SAFER K-64, and
   its interfacing to an electronic host are then considered in detail. It
   is shown that this encryption algorithm maps well onto smart-pixel
   technology because it involves only parallel data transfers, simple
   regular operations, and interconnections plus a relatively low rate of

Abstract = {{Prochymosin (chymosin) contains three disulfide bonds: Cys45-Cys50,
   Cys206-Cys210, and Cys250-Cys283. We have demonstrated that
   Cys250-Cys283 is indispensable fur correct refolding of prochymosin,
   whereas Cys45-Cys50 is dispensable but has some contribution to the
   stability and substrate specificity of the enzyme. Here, we report the
   results about the functions of Cys206-Cys210 by site-directed
   mutagenesis studies. In a glutathione redox system C206A/C210A mutant
   exhibited oxidative refolding, kinetics and efficiency (similar to 40\%
   reactivation) similar to those of the wild-type prochymosin, indicating
   that Cys206-Cys210 is also dispensable for refolding. However,
   C206S/C210S and single-site mutants (C210A, C210S, and C206A) showed
   only about 3 and 0-0.4\% reactivation, respectively. This is quite
   different from the Cys45-Cys50 deficient mutants (C45A, C50A, C45A/C50A,
   C45D, C50S, C45D/C50S, C45A/C50S), which have comparable refolding
   efficiencies, implying that the substituents at position 206 and 210
   play more important role in determining correct refolding than those at
   position 45 and 50. Urea-induced denaturation and fluorescence quenching
   studies indicated that the prochymosin mutants C206A/C210A and
   C206S/C210S were 2.1 and 4.8 kJ/mol less stable than prochymosin and
   some tryptophan residue in the mutated molecules was less exposed.
   However, the wild-type and mutant prochymosins shared similar far-UV CD
   and fluorescence emission spectra and similar specific potential
   activity, suggesting that the overall conformation was maintained after
   mutation. Activity assay and kinetic analysis revealed that mutation did
   not change the specific milk-clotting activity significantly but
   resulted in an increase in K-m, and k(cat) toward a hexapeptide
   substrate. On the basis of the above-mentioned perturbance of
   tryptophanyl microenvironment and the three-dimensional structure of
   chymosin, we proposed that deletion of Cys206-Cys210 may induce a
   propagated conformational change, resulting in a perturbance of the
   local conformation around active-site cleft and in turn, an alteration
   of the substrate specificity.}},

Abstract = {{A microtubule-associated protein, gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA)
   receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), was previously identified as
   binding to the intracellular domain of GABA(A) receptors by using the
   yeast two-hybrid screen. In the present work, immunofluorescent staining
   and green fluorescent protein-tagged receptor subunits showed that
   CABARAP is associated with and promotes the clustering of GABAA
   receptors in QT-6 quail fibroblasts. The tubulin-binding motif of
   GABARAP and the gamma 2 subunit of the receptor are required. Disruption
   of microtubules prevents the clustering in a time-dependent manner. When
   green fluorescent protein-tagged alpha 1 or gamma 2 subunit coexpressed
   with beta 2, gamma 2L, and GABARAP was used, recordings from visually
   identified cells revealed that clustered GABAA receptor had an EC50 of
   about 20 mu M, vs. 5.7 mu M for the diffuse receptor. Clustered
   receptors deactivated faster and desensitized slower than the diffuse
   receptors, because of decrease in the apparent affinity of GABA binding.
   Different properties for clustered receptors relative to unclustered
   receptors in heterologous cells suggest that homologous differences
   between extrasynaptic and synaptic clustered receptors in neurons may be
   due to the organization of the postsynaptic machinery.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a procedure to solve the identification inverse problems
   for two-dimensional potential fields is presented. The procedure relies
   on a boundary integral equation (BIE) for the variations of the
   potential, flux, and geometry. This equation is a linearization of the
   regular BIE for small changes in the geometry. The aim in the
   identification inverse problems is to find an unknown part of the
   boundary of the domain, usually an internal flaw, using experimental
   measurements as additional information. In this paper this problem is
   solved without resorting to a minimization of a functional, but by an
   iterative algorithm which alternately solves the regular BIE and the
   variation BIE. The variation of the geometry of the flaw is modelled by
   a virtual strain field, which allows for greater flexibility in the
   shape of the assumed flaw. Several numerical examples demonstrate the
   effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach. Copyright (C)

   above 120 degrees C, the tensile properties of the fibers decrease
   drastically. We also discuss the influence of heat, water, and engine

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the expression of apoptosis-inducing- ligand
   and receptor molecules in patients with MS. Background: Dysregulation of
   apoptosis may induce autoimmune conditions, possibly through inadequate
   termination of immune responses, and could be of importance for
   pathogenesis of MS. Methods: Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of two
   apoptosis-related members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor
   family, Fas and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor 2
   (TRAIL-R-2), and their ligands, Fas ligand (FasL) and TRAIL, were
   quantified by competitive reverse transcription PCR in unstimulated
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 47 untreated patients with MS and
   46 control subjects, Results: The expression of FasL was increased in
   patients with MS compared with healthy control subjects. Analysis of
   clinical subgroups revealed that the increase was marked in
   relapsing-remitting MS, being especially high in remission (p = 0.0002),
   but less so in chronic progressive MS (p = 0.14). Compared with healthy
   control subjects, TRAIL mRNA levels were also upregulated in patients
   with MS (p = 0.0001) but did not differ between clinical subgroups. The
   expression of TRAIL-R, was slightly elevated in patients with MS (p =
   0.02) whereas the expression of Fas was similar in patients and control
   subjects. The ratio of expression levels for two isoforms of TRAIL-R,,
   TRICK2a and TRICK2b, in patients with MS differed from healthy control
   subjects (p = 0.04). Conclusions: There was increased expression of both
   FasL and TRAIL in peripheral blood lymphocytes. It remains to be
   determined whether this increased expression represents a
   disease-promoting autoimmune process or is merely the effect of a
   secondary compensatory mechanism that downregulates the inflammatory
   response.}},

Abstract = {{The curvature of dA tracts has been proposed to be important in the
   recognition, packaging, and regulation of DNA. The effects of dA tracts
   on the gel mobility, rate of cyclization, and other properties of DNA
   have been extensively studied. The consensus value for the curvature
   induced by a single dA tract is about 18 degrees. There are two main
   competing models for the origin of the curvature of dA tracts. One model
   assigns the central role to sequence-dependent steric clashes and the
   other to sequence dependent interactions with cations. The temperature
   dependence of the shape functions, the molecule specific part of the
   diffusion coefficients, of a set of six DNAs has been examined here. The
   set contains DNAs with dA tracts in or out of phase with respect to the
   helical repeat as well as those with scrambled dA-dT regions. The
   results show that the curvature of dA tracts is highly temperature
   dependent and that the curvature is largely melted out by 40 degrees C.
   The curvature melts out before there is significant premelting, or
   breathing of the dA tracts or the scrambled dA-dT regions. The curvature
   does not appear to reach a plateau value at low temperatures. A
   qualitative model for the melting of the curvature of dA tracts is
   proposed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the iterative algorithm proposed by Kozlov et al. for the
   Cauchy problem for the Laplace equation is extended in order to solve
   the Cauchy steady-state heat conduction problem in an anisotropic
   medium. The iterative algorithm is numerically implemented using the
   boundary element method (BEM). The convergence and the stability of the
   numerical method, as well as various types of accuracy, convergence and
   stopping criteria, are investigated. The numerical results obtained
   confirm that provided an appropriate stopping regularization criterion
   is imposed, then the iterative BEM produces a convergent and stable
   numerical solution with respect to increasing the number of boundary
   elements and decreasing the amount of noise added into the input data.
   An efficient stopping regularization criterion to cease the iterative
   process is proposed and the rate of convergence of the algorithm is
   improved by using various relaxation procedures between iterations. A
   new concept of a variable relaxation factor is proposed. Analytical
   formulae for the coefficients of the matrices resulting from the direct
   application of the BEM in an anisotropic medium are also presented.

Abstract = {{Disease resistance is associated with a plant defense response that
   involves an integrated set of signal transduction pathways. Changes in
   the expression patterns of 2.375 selected genes were examined
   simultaneously by cDNA microarray analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana after
   inoculation with an incompatible fungal pathogen Alternaria brassicicola
   or treatment with the defense-related signaling molecules salicylic acid
   (SA), methyl jasmonate (MJ), or ethylene, Substantial changes (up- and
   down-regulation) in the steady-state abundance of 705 mRNAs were
   observed in response to one or more of the treatments, including known
   and putative defense-related genes and 106 genes with no previously
   described function or homology, In leaf tissue inoculated with A.
   brassicicola, the abundance of 168 mRNAs was increased more than
   2.5-fold, whereas that of 39 mRNAs was reduced. Similarly, the abundance
   of 192, 221, and 55 mRNAs was highly (>2.5-fold) increased after
   treatment with SA, MJ, and ethylene, respectively. Data analysis
   revealed a surprising level of coordinated defense responses, including
   169 mRNAs regulated by multiple treatments/defense pathways. The largest
   number of genes coinduced (one of four induced genes) and corepressed
   was found after treatments with SA and MJ. In addition, 50\% of the
   genes induced by ethylene treatment were also induced by MJ treatment.
   These results indicated the existence of a substantial network of
   regulatory interactions and coordination occurring during plant defense
   among the different defense signaling pathways, notably between the
   salicylate and jasmonate pathways that were previously thought to act in
   an antagonistic fashion.}},

   compared with conventional electron microscopy approaches. Using atomic
   force microscopy the spatial distribution of the impact-modifying
   ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) domains could be readily identified
   whereas small angle light scattering was used to quantify overall domain
   size distribution. EPR domains from a few hundred nanometers to a few
   microns in size were observed with average sizes that vary from the edge
   to the center of the polypropylene particle. In addition, it has been
   observed that the morphology shifts from discrete domains to
   bicontinuous as the EPR content is increased. (C) 2000 John Wiley \&

   was observed spectroscopically during the commissioning of NIRSPEC, the
   new infrared spectrometer on Keck II. The emission-line spectrum is used
   to place limits on the metallicity. Comparing these new measurements
   with others available from the literature, we find that strong oxygen
   emission in LBGs may suggest subsolar metallicity for these objects. The
   {[}O III] lambda 5007 line is also used to estimate the star formation
   rate (SFR) of the LBGs. The inferred SFRs are higher than those
   estimated from the UV continuum, and may be evidence for dust

   Calculations were performed for half-monolayer, one-monolayer and
   two-monolayer coverages of hydrogen, fluorine and coadsorbed hydrogen
   and fluorine, the latter at a 1:1 stoichiometry. Tn all three cases, we
   found a rather strong attractive pairing-interaction between adsorbed
   atoms on the same dimer. We also found a weak attractive
   clustering-interaction between pairs of dimers with two adsorbed atoms
   each. For paired-fluorine dimers, this attractive clustering interaction
   is approximately 0.1 eV. In the case of coadsorption, we find that mixed
   dimers are energetically favored. Thus, our calculations suggest that,
   in the case of coadsorption, the hydrogen and fluorine atoms do not

   dimers, and single molecules. At a higher density, more complex
   structures appear and an extended, albeit very dynamical, H-bond network
   can be identified. These structures have important consequences for the

   the peculiar chemical behavior of a supercritical system and allows

   Experimental results for the In-rich (2 X 4) InP(001) surface show two

   until now. We identify two possible surface states showing no

   <(Gamma)over bar>-(J) over bar' directions of the surface Brillouin zone
   (SBZ), The energetically highest state, located close to the valence

   direction and is most likely a P-dimer-bond state. The second state,
   located at - 4.4 eV binding energy, is assigned to a surface resonance.

   case and a criminal case in the 1998 trial (GEP'98) and two paternity
   testing cases in 1999 (GEP'99) were included and the statistical
   evaluation of the evidence was requested in both cases. In the GEP'99
   trial, a theoretical paternity testing case was included. A total of 52
   DNA genetic markers were used by the participants in the GEP'98 trial,
   which increased to 101 in GEP'99. Despite this increasing number of
   participating labs, results remained quite satisfactory. All the labs
   used PCR-based DNA polymorphisms with an increasing number of markers,
   obtaining good results. SLPs were used by a decreasing number of labs
   but the results indicated a good level of expertise despite the
   different protocols used.
   Good results were also obtained for mtDNA despite the difficulties
   presented by the samples due to the presence of length heteroplasmy in
   some samples in both trials. The detection of heteroplasmy should,
   however, be improved.
   Similar conclusions were reached for both, the paternity and the
   criminal case by all the labs. Common methodologies for the statistical
   evaluation of the paternity case were used and the paternity index and
   the probability of paternity (with an a priori value of 0.5) reported by
   most of the labs. Also, a great uniformity was found in the evaluation
   of the criminal case despite the lack of a specific hypothesis in the
   design of the exercise. Some errors in statistical programs or in
   calculations were detected in a theoretical paternity case included in
   the GEP'99 trial for statistical analysis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Sediments from nine floodplain lakes in Pantanal were analyzed for a
   large-scale (300 km) survey of mercury (Hg) load in sediments and soils
   of the Alto Pantanal and to study the relationship between Hg and
   reactive aluminum, iron, and manganese oxy-hydroxides. The results were
   compared with the Hg content in river and stream sediments from the
   Pocone gold mining area, where Hg has been extensively used and still is
   in use. The results indicate that the Hg concentrations were elevated in
   river sediment close to the mining area in Bento Gomes river basin
   (average in the < 74-mu m fraction 88.9 ng Hg g(-1) dry wt.;
   interquartile range 50.3-119.5), but there was no clear indication that
   the local Hg emissions have contaminated the remote floodplain lakes,
   where concentrations were surprisingly low (average in the < 74-mu m
   fraction 33.2 ng Hg g(-1) dry wt, sediment; interquartile range
   18.4-46.8), in particular when considering geochemical characteristics
   of the sediment. The sediment from the floodplain lakes contained less
   Hg-tot and more reactive iron oxy-hydroxides than soils from the Tapajos
   area in the Amazon basin. This resulted in a mass ratio between Hg and
   amorphous oxy-hydroxides of only 5 x 10(-6) for Hg-tot/Fe-oxa
   (interquartile range 3-7 x 10(-6)). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with regional stabilization of linear
   time-invariant systems by dynamic output feedback controllers subject to
   known bounds on the magnitudes of the control inputs. Specifically, we
   consider the achievable region of attraction, i.e. the set of vectors
   with the following property: There exists a (nonlinear) controller such
   that any closed-loop state trajectory converges to the origin as long as
   the initial state belongs the set. Two subsets of such set are
   characterized. One is derived from the linear analysis that considers
   the behavior of the states in the linear (non-saturated) region only,
   while the other is based on the nonlinear analysis using the multi-leap
   circle criterion. The main result of this paper shows that the two sets
   are exactly the same. Thus we conclude that the circle criterion does
   not help, within our framework, to increase the size of the region of
   attraction in saturating control synthesis when compared with that
   resulting from the linear analysis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{A totally in situ surface passivation process of InP consisting of
   growth of an ultrathin Si interface control layer (Si ICL) and its

   characterized and optimized by in situ ultrahigh vacuum (UHV)
   contactless capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. An electron cyclotron
   resonance (ECR)-N-2 plasma process and a nitrogen radical process were
   compared for partial nitridation of Si ICL. In situ XPS measurements
   provided useful information on the thickness and composition of the
   nitrided surface layer. UHV C-V measurements showed that the nitridation
   process using ECR-N-2 plasma was more favorable, realizing a full swing
   of Fermi level almost over the entire bandgap. A
   metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) capacitor was fabricated by further
   depositing a thick Si3N4 layer on the ECR plasma processed structure.
   Conventional MIS C-V measurements confirmed an excellent interface
   property, proving the effectiveness of the in situ passivation process.

Abstract = {{Background: Computerized order entry systems have the potential to
   prevent errors, to improve quality of care, and to reduce costs by
   providing feedback and suggestions to the physician as each order is
   entered. This study assesses the impact of an inpatient computerized
   physician order entry system on prescribing practices.
   Methods: A time series analysis was performed at an urban academic
   medical center at which all adult inpatient orders are entered through a
   computerized system. When physicians enter drug orders, the computer
   displays drug use guidelines, offers relevant alternatives, and suggests
   appropriate doses and frequencies.
   Result: For medication selection, use of a computerized guideline
   resulted in a change in use of the recommended drug (nizatidine) from
   15.6\% of all histamine(2)-blocker orders to 81.3\% (P<.001).
   implementation of dose selection menus resulted in a decrease in the SD
   of drug doses by 11\% (P<.001).
   The proportion of doses that exceeded the recommended maximum decreased
   from 2.1\% before order entry to 0.6\% afterward (P<.001). Display of a
   recommended frequency for ondansetron hydrochloride administration
   resulted in an increase in the use of the approved frequency from 6\% of
   all ondansetron orders to 75\% (P<.001). The use of subcutaneous heparin
   sodium to prevent thrombosis in patients at bed rest increased from 24\%
   to 47\% when the computer suggested this option (P<.001). All these
   changes persisted at 1- and 2-year follow-up analyses.
   Conclusion: Computerized physician order entry is a powerful and
   effective tool for improving physician prescribing practices.}},

Abstract = {{Unlike many other sexually dimorphic systems, gonadal secretions do not;
   explain sex differences in the morphology of the telencephalic song
   control nuclei of zebra finches. It is important to understand whether a
   novel mechanism for controlling structure is restricted to the forebrain
   regions specialized for song, and whether other areas respond more
   typically to gonadal steroids. Therefore, the effects of sex and adult
   androgen manipulation on the neuromuscular end of the song control
   system (tracheosyringeal portion of the hypoglossal nucleus, nXIIts, and
   the syrinx, or vocal organ) were investigated. Because lesion and
   axotomy experiments indicate a right-side bias in the functional control
   of song, asymmetry in the motor nucleus and in the ventralis and
   dorsalis syrinx muscles was also tested. Male-biased dimorphisms existed
   in the volume of nXIIts, and in syrinx mass and size of muscle fibers,
   but not in motoneuron number or size. Asymmetries favoring the right
   side were detected in nXIIts volume and motoneuron number in males, as
   well as in ventralis and dorsalis fiber size in both sexes. Hormone
   manipulations had no effect on nXIIts size, neuron size, or number.
   Testosterone treatment of adult females increased all of the syringeal
   measures, but the only effect of flutamide in males was to decrease
   syrinx weight. Thus, male-biased sexual dimorphisms and right side
   dominance in both nXIIts and the syrinx may facilitate singing behavior.
   Adult androgen exposure can induce partial masculinization of the
   syrinx, but other factors must be important in mediating the sex
   differences in both that structure and the volume of nXIIts. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{In this work, the wear behaviour of coated components subjected to
   sliding contact conditions is investigated using a multiscale
   micromechanics approach. Periodic unitcell-type continuum mechanics
   models are used to predict localized deformation patterns at the scale
   of the coating thickness (mesoscale) and the rate of material removal
   due to repeated sliding contact. To that purpose, realistic contact
   loads determined at the component level (macroscale) are applied at the
   mesoscopic level. The results indicate that the deformation of the
   coating is controlled by the cyclic accumulation of plastic deformation,
   or ratchetting, at the coating subsurface. Based on a ratchetting
   failure criterion, a wear equation is proposed and applied to
   investigate parametrically the influence of the principal material,
   loading and surface roughness parameters on the wear rate. The results
   reveal that the wear rate increases with contact pressure and depends on
   coating thickness and the roughness of the counterpart surface. It was
   also found that a reduction in the friction coefficient and an increase
   in the coating strain hardening behaviour can considerably improve the
   wear resistance of coated components.}},

   concurrent partnership network is developed. The model employs pair
   approximations of higher-order correlations to derive equations of
   motion in terms of numbers of pairs and singletons. The model is derived
   from an underlying stochastic process of partnership network formation
   and disease transmission. The model is analysed numerically and the
   final size and time evolution are considered for various levels of
   concurrency as measured by the concurrency index kappa(3) of Kretzschmar
   and Morris. Additionally, a new way of calculating R-0 for spatial
   network models is developed. It is found that concurrency significantly
   increases R-0 and the final size of a sexually transmitted disease, with
   some interesting exceptions.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: TO study distinctive clinical features of pheochromocytoma
   in the setting of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) in
   comparison with sporadic pheochromocytoma.
   PATIENTS AND METHOD: All patients diagnosed of sporadic pheochromocytoma
   (n = 29) and in the setting of MEN 2A (n = 16) between 1976 and 1998 in
   a tertiary hospital were included in the study. The following variables
   were compared: age at diagnosis, symptoms, presence and characteristics
   of hypertension, size of the tumor, localization and malignancy. The
   accuracy of diagnostic tests was also evaluated.
   RESULTS: The pheochromocytoma associated to MEN 2A had a higher
   prevalence in our study (35.5\%) and the diagnosis was performed earlier
   than for sporadic pheochromocytoma (29.1 {[}7.8] vs. 47,5 {[}10.9]
   years; p < 0.001), Other distinctive features in comparison with
   sporadic pheochromocytoma were: bilaterality (81.25 vs. 3.44\%; p <
   0.001), absence of symptoms (44 vs 11\%; p < 0.05) and paroxysmal
   hypertension. Concerning the diagnostic tests, it must be noted the low
   sensitivity (60\%) of vanillylmandelic acid in MEN 2A.
   CONCLUSIONS: The pheochromocytoma in the setting of MEN 2A is diagnosed
   at younger age and frequently asymptomatic and bilateral. In view of the
   high prevalence of MEN 2A in our country, a genetic analysis should be
   performed in all patients with pheochromocytoma, especially when it is
   bilateral.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{206}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The gating of ion channels has been modeled by assuming that the
   transitions between open and closed states is a memoryless process.
   Nevertheless, analysis of records of unitary current events suggests
   that the kinetic process presents short-term memory, i.e. the open- and
   closed-dwell times are short-term correlated. Here the rescaled range
   analysis (RIS Hurst analysis) is used as a method to test long-term
   correlation, in single calcium-activated potassium channels present in
   Leydig cells. The Hurst coefficients, calculated for four different
   voltages (V) are: 0.634 +/- 0.022 (n = 3) for V = +20 mV; 0.635 +/-
   0.012 (n = 4) for V = +40 mV; 0.606 +/- 0.020 (n = 4) for V = +60 mV and
   0.608 +/- 0.026 (n = 4) for V = +80 mV. This indicates that open- and
   closed-dwell times are long-term correlated and do not change with the
   voltage applied to the patch at a 5\% significance level (F = 2.2402; p
   = 0.140715). Randomly shuffling the experimental data removes the
   correlation in all voltages. When the Hurst method was applied to the
   results from a simulated three-state Markovian model, it could not
   account for the long-term correlation found in the experimental data. In
   this case, H has the following values: 0.5498 +/- 0.018 (n = 100) for V
   = +20 mV; 0.5557 +/- 0.0202 (n = 100) for V = +40 mV; 0.5565 +/- 0.0246
   (n = 100) for V = 60 mV and 0.5595 +/- 0.0247 (n = 100) for V = +50 mV.
   Even a four-state Markovian model was not adequate to correctly simulate
   the long-term memory found experimentally, with H values significantly
   different from those found for the experimental data, in the same
   voltage range (F = 15.0355; p = 0.00001). In conclusion, this paper
   shows that: (1) the open- and closed-dwell times of the single
   calcium-activated potassium channel of Leydig cells are long-term
   correlated; (2) three- and four-state Markovian models, which describe
   very well the dwell time distributions, are not adequate to describe the
   long-term correlation found between the open and closed states of this
   ion channel. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Recent data suggest that sterol regulatory-binding protein (SREBP)-1c
   plays a key role in the transcriptional regulation of different
   lipogenic genes mediating lipid synthesis as a key regulator of fuel
   metabolism. SREBP-1c regulates its downstream genes by changing its own
   mRNA level, which led us to sequence and analyze the promoter region of
   the mouse SREBP-1c gene. A cluster of putative binding sites of several
   transcription factors composed of an NF-Y site, an E-box, a
   sterol-regulatory element 3, and an Spl site were located at -90 base
   pairs of the SREBP-1c promoter. Luciferase reporter gene assays
   indicated that this SRE complex is essential to the basal promoter
   activity and confers responsiveness to activation by nuclear SREBPs,
   Deletion and mutation analyses suggest that the NF-Y site and SRE3 in
   the SRE complex are responsible for SREBP activation, although the other
   sites were also involved in the basal activity. Gel mobility shift
   assays demonstrate that SREBP-1 binds to the SRE3, Taken together, these
   findings implicate a positive loop production of SREBP-1c through the
   SRE complex, possibly leading to the overshoot in induction of SREBP-1c
   and its downstream genes seen in the livers of refed mice. Furthermore,
   reporter assays using larger upstream fragments indicated another region
   that was inducible by addition of sterols. The presence of the SRE
   complex and a sterol-inducible region in the same promoter suggests a
   novel regulatory Link between cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{RPE65 is essential for all-trans- to Il-cis-retinoid isomerization, the
   hallmark reaction of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Here, we
   identify regulatory elements in the Rpe65 gene and demonstrate their
   functional relevance to Rpe65 gene expression. We show that the 5'
   flanking region of the mouse Rpe65 gene, like the human gene, lacks a
   canonical TATA box and consensus GC and CAAT boxes. The mouse and human
   genes do share several cis acting elements, including an octamer, a
   nuclear factor one (NFI) site, and two E-box sites, suggesting a
   conserved mode of regulation. A mouse Rpe65 promoter/beta-galactosidase
   transgene containing bases -655 to +52 (TR4) of the mouse 5' flanking
   region was sufficient to direct high RPE-specific expression in
   transgenic mice, whereas shorter fragments (-297 to +52 or -188 to +52)
   generated only background activity. Furthermore, transient transfection
   of analogous TR4/luciferase constructs also directed high reporter
   activity in the human RPE cell line D407 but weak activity in the
   non-RPE cell Lines HeLa, HepG2, and HS27. Functional binding of
   potential transcription factors to the octamer sequence, AP-4, and NFI
   sites was demonstrated by directed mutagenesis, electrophoretic mobility
   shift assay, and cross linking. Mutations of these sites abolished
   binding and corresponding transcriptional activity and indicated that
   octamer and E-box transcription factors synergistically regulate the
   RPE65 promoter function. Thus, we have identified the regulatory region
   in the Rpe65 gene that accounts for tissue-specific expression in the
   RPE and found that octamer and E-box transcription factors play a
   critical role in the transcriptional regulation of the Rpe65 gene.}},

Abstract = {{The residue Cys10 in E. coli glutathione transferase (GST) is apparently

   activity toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene at pH 6.5. This mutation
   increased both the k(cat) and K-m values for GSH and affected the
   pH-activity profile the enzyme. The side chain of Cys10 is thought to be
   important for construction of the GSH-binding site and partly for

Abstract = {{Calcyclin (S100A6) is an S100 calcium-binding protein whose expression
   is up-regulated in proliferating and differentiating cells. A novel
   30-kDa protein exhibiting calcium dependent calcyclin-binding
   (calcyclin-binding protein, CacyBP) had been identified, purified, and
   cloned previously (Filipek, A, and Kuznicki, J, (1998) J. Neurochem. 70,
   1793-1798). Here, we have defined the calcyclin binding region using
   limited proteolysis and a set of deletion mutants of CacyBP. A fragment
   encompassing residues 178-229 (CacyBP-(178-229)) was capable of full
   binding to calcyclin, CacyBP-(178-229) was expressed in Escherichia coli
   as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified. The protein
   fragment cleaved from the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was
   shown by CD to contain 5\% alpha-helix, 15\% beta-sheet, and 81\% random
   coil. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to determine calcyclin
   dissociation constants of 0.96 and 1.2 mu M for intact CacyBP and
   CacyBP-(178-229), respectively, indicating that the fragment can be used
   for characterization of calcyclin-CacyBP interactions. NMR analysis of
   CacyBP-(178-229) binding-induced changes in the chemical shifts of
   N-15-enriched calcyclin revealed that CacyBP binding occurs at a
   discrete site on calcyclin with micromolar affinity.}},

Abstract = {{A method for determination of Po-210 and Pb-210 in rainwater samples is
   described. This method was developed to permit measurement of the
   radionuclides in rainwater samples collected at short time intervals (2
   weeks) on a small area (0.5 m(2)) and to give results with the minimum
   delay. This was achieved by estimating Pb-210 from counts of the
   daughter Bi-210 after allowing 30 days for ingrowth. Po-210 was measured
   directly by alpha-spectrometry. The radionuclides were collected from
   rainwater samples by co-precipitation with manganese dioxide then the
   precipitate was dissolved in a small volume of HCl/H2O2. Po-210 was
   plated onto silver and counted immediately and stable Bi was added to
   the solution which was allowed to stand for 30 days. After this time,
   Bi-210 was separated from the Pb-210 by extraction into 0.2\% DDTC in
   chloroform and precipitated as bismuth oxychloride. The bismuth
   oxychloride was collected by filtration and the Bi-210 counted using a
   gas-flow proportional counter. Pb-210 activity was inferred from the
   Bi-210 activity. This procedure allowed rapid, sensitive and cost
   effective measurement of Bi-210 in rain water with a limit of detection
   4.2 mBq and a coefficient of variation of 2\% for four replicate
   analyses at the 1.0 Bq level. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{We purified the most potent thrombin inhibitor described to date from
   the rhynchobdellid leech Theromyzon tessulatum. Designated theromin, it
   was purified to apparent homogeneity by gel permeation and anion
   exchange chromatography followed by two reverse-phase steps of high
   performance liquid chromatography. The primary sequence of theromin (a
   homodimer of 67 amino acid residues including 16 cysteine residues) was
   determined by a combination of reduction and s-beta-pyridylethylation,
   Edman degradation, trypsin enzymatic digestion, and matrix-assisted
   laser desorption mass spectrometry measurement. Theromin exhibits no
   sequence homology with any other thrombin inhibitors. Furthermore,
   theromin significantly diminishes, in a dose-dependent manner, the level
   of human granulocyte and monocyte activation induced by
   lipopolysaccharides. In summary, this potent thrombin inhibitor promises
   to have high biomedical significance.}},

   77\%; 2b: Cp' = Cp{*}, 87\%). Similarly, the reaction of Ib with
   2-pyridone in the presence of Et3N gave
   Cp{*}Fe(CO)(2)SiMe2SiMe2O(2-C5H4N) (3, 43\%). Photolysis of 2a, 2b, and

   quantitatively, in which an acetoxy or 2-pyridyloxy group bridges two
   silylene ligands to form a six-membered chelate ring. 4a and 5 were
   structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction
   experiments. All the Fe-Si bonds are significantly shorter than normal
   Fe-Si single bonds and are consistent with their unsaturated bond
   character. The six-membered chelate ring consists of two entirely

Abstract = {{Mannose binding protein (MBP; mannose-binding lectin) forms part of the
   innate immune system. By binding directly to carbohydrates on the
   surfaces of potential microbial pathogens, MBP and MBP-associated serine
   proteases (MASPs) can replace antibodies and complement components C1q,
   C1r, and C1s of the classical complement pathway. In order to
   investigate the mechanisms of MASP activation by MBP, the cDNAs of rat
   MASP-1 and -2 have been isolated, and portions encompassing the
   N-terminal CUB and epidermal growth factor-like domains have been
   expressed and purified. Biophysical characterization of the purified
   proteins indicates that each truncated MASP is a Ca2+-independent
   homodimer in solution, in which the interacting modules include the
   N-terminal two domains. Binding studies reveal that both MASPs associate
   independently with rat MBP in a Ca2+-dependent manner through
   interactions involving the N-terminal three domains. The biophysical
   properties of the truncated MASPs indicate that the interactions with
   MBP leading to complement activation differ significantly from those
   between components C1q, C1r, and C1s of the classical pathway. Analysis
   of MASP binding by rat MBP containing naturally occurring mutations
   equivalent to those associated with human immunodeficiency indicates
   that binding to both truncated MASP-1 and MASP-2 proteins is defective
   in such mutants.}},

Abstract = {{Constitutive activating mutations of the TSHR gene, have been detected
   in about 30 per cent of hyperfunctioning human thyroid adenomas and in a
   minority of differentiated thyroid carcinomas. The mutations activating
   the TSHR gene(s) in the thyroid carcinomas, were located at the codon
   623 changing an Ala to a Ser (GCC-->TCC) or in codon 632 changing a Thr
   to Ala or Ile (ACC-->GCC or ACC-->ATC). In order to study if the
   constitutively activated TSHR gene(s) has played a role in the
   determination of the malignant phenotype presented by these tumors, we
   investigated: (1) the transforming capacity after transfection of mouse
   3T3 cells, of a TSHR cDNA activated by an Ala-->Ser mutation in codon
   623 or an Thr-Ile mutation in codon 632 and (2) the pathway(s)
   eventually responsable(s) for the malignant phenotype of the cells
   transformed by these constitutively activated TSHR cDNAs, Our results
   show that (1) the TSHRM623 or(M632) cDNAs give rise to 3T3 clones
   presenting a fully neoplastic phenotype (growth in agar and nude mouse
   tumorigenesis); this phenotype was weaker in the cells transformed by
   the 632 cDNA; (2) suggest that the fully transformed phenotype of our
   3T3 cells, may be the consequence of the additive effect of the
   activation of at least two different pathways: the cAMP pathway through
   G(alpha s) and the Ras dependent MAPK pathway through G(beta gamma) and
   PI3K and (3) show that the PI3K isoform playing a key role as an
   effector in the MAPK pathway activation in our 3T3-transformed cells is
   PI3K gamma. Signaling from PI3K gamma to MAPK appears to require in our
   murine cellular system a tyrosine kinase (still not characterized), Shc,
   Grb2, Sos, Ras and Raf. It is proposed that the constitutively activated
   TSHR genes detected in the thyroid carcinomas, may have played an
   oncogenic role, participating in their development through these two
   pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic light-scattering measurements of liquid ethanol/dodecane
   mixtures have been performed using a self-beating digital photon
   correlation spectrometer. The binary system exhibits an upper critical
   consolute point at a mole fraction x(c) = 0.687 of ethanol. The critical
   temperature of our sample was T-c = 285.64 +/- 0.05 K. Along with shear
   viscosity data the decay rate of the autocorrelation function of the
   scattered light has been used to determine the mutual diffusion
   coefficient D, the fluctuation correlation length xi, and the
   characteristic relaxation rate omega(D) of the order parameter
   fluctuations as a function of reduced temperature. For the mixture of
   critical composition these quantities follow power law behavior, as
   predicted theoretically. The amplitude of the relaxation rate of the
   ethanol/dodecane system is omega(0) = (8.0 +/- 0.2) x 10(9) s(-1) from
   dynamic light scattering, which compares with omega(0) = 2.8 x 10(9)
   s(-1) and omega(0) = 4.4 x 10(9) s(-1) as resulting from broadband
   ultrasonic spectra. Fitting the light-scattering data at different
   scattering angles to the universal dynamic (Kawasaki) function yields
   omega(0) = (7.7 +/- 0.7) x 10(9) s(-1). Critical mixtures with an amount
   of 0.2\% (w/w) water added resulted in an enhancement of T-c by about
   3.5 K and in a small increase (10\%) in the amplitude D-0 of the mutual
   diffusion coefficient. Light-scattering data for five ethanol/dodecane
   mixtures of noncritical composition are in conformity with the
   pseudospinodal conception. It remains unclear, however, whether
   noncritical exponents have to be used in the power laws. Using the
   critical exponents in the evaluation of data the amplitude xi(0) of the
   correlation length displays a relative maximum at the critical
   composition where D-0 adopts a relative minimum.}},

   and reduction of overall power and energy losses are considered. The
   capacitor allocation constraints due to capacitor-switching transients
   are taken into account. These constraints are extremely important if
   pole-mounted capacitors are used together with a substation capacitor
   bank. A genetic algorithm is used as an optimization tool. An
   illustrative example is presented. The algorithm is currently in use in

Abstract = {{We report calculations of free energies of binding, Delta G(bind),
   between a diverse set of nine ligands and avidin as well as between a
   peptide and streptavidin using the recently developed MM/PBSA approach.
   This method makes use of a molecular dynamics simulation of the
   ligand-protein complex to generate a thermally averaged ensemble of
   conformations of the molecules that are involved in the complex
   formation. Based on this set of structures, a free energy of binding is
   calculated using molecular mechanical and continuum solvent energies as
   well as including estimates of the nonpolar solvation free energy and
   solute entropy. We compare in our simulations different classes of
   ligands, involving biotin derivatives, the dye
   2-(4'-hydroxyazobenzene)benzoic acid (HABA), and a cyclic hexapeptide,
   which cover a large range of binding free energies from -5 to -20
   kcal/mol. Our calculations are able to reproduce experimental Delta
   G(bind) values with a very good correlation coefficient of r(2) = 0.92.
   This agreement is considerably better than the results obtained with an
   alternate approach, the linear interaction energy approximation, for
   this system (r(2) = 0.55).}},

Abstract = {{We have cloned a cDNA representing mouse phosphodiesterases (PDE) 7A1.
   The open reading frame encodes a protein of 482 amino acids with a
   predicted molecular mass of 55417. Like human PDE7A variants, mouse
   PDE7A1 and A2 are 5' splice variants from a common gene. The distinct
   N-terminal sequence of mouse PDE7A1 is highly homologous to the
   corresponding sequence of human PDE7A1 with a similarity of 98\% but not
   to that of mouse PDE7A2 (with a similarity of 12\%), and is more
   hydrophilic than that of mouse PDE7A2. Mouse PDE7A1 expressed in SF9
   cells has been compared with human PDE7A1 under identical conditions.
   Mouse PDE7A1 has a Km for cAMP of 0.2 mu M, an optimal pH of 7.5, an
   IC50 value of 14 mu M for 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), and is
   dependent on Mg2+ for activity. All these characteristics are very
   similar to those of human PDE7A1. In mice, PDE7A1 is expressed in
   tissues of the immune system (lymph node, thymus, spleen, and blood
   leukocyte), testis, brain, kidney and lung but not in skeletal muscle,

Abstract = {{Context A growing proportion of young children in the United States
   participate in day care, and these children are considered to be at high
   risk for influenza infection. Whether vaccinating day care children
   reduces household transmission of influenza is not known.
   Objective To evaluate the effect of vaccinating day care children on
   reducing influenza-related morbidity among their household contacts.
   Design Single-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted during the
   1996-1997 influenza season.
   Setting Ten day care centers for children of US Navy personnel in San
   Diego, Calif. Participants A total of 149 day care attendees (aged 24-60
   months) and their families were randomized; 127 children and their 328
   household contacts received 2 vaccine doses and were included in the
   analysis.
   Interventions Inactivated influenza vaccine was administered to 60
   children with 162 household contacts, and hepatitis A vaccine as a
   control was administered to 67 age-matched children with 166 household
   contacts.
   Main Outcome Measures Information regarding febrile respiratory
   illnesses and related morbidity for household contacts of
   influenza-vaccinated vs control children (subgrouped by
   influenza-vaccinated and unvaccinated contacts), obtained by telephone
   interviews with parents every 2 weeks from November 1996 through April
   1997,
   Results Influenza-unvaccinated household contacts (n=120) of
   influenza-vaccinated day care children had 42\% fewer febrile
   respiratory illnesses (P=.04) compared with unvaccinated household
   contacts of control children. Among school-aged household contacts (aged
   5-17 years), there was an 80\% reduction among contacts of vaccinated
   children (n=28) vs contacts of unvaccinated children (n=31) in febrile
   respiratory illnesses (P=.01), as well as reductions of more than 70\%
   in school days missed (P=.02), reported earaches (P=.02), physician
   visits (P=.007), physician-prescribed antibiotics (P=.02), and adults
   who missed work to take care of ill children (P=.04),
   Conclusions These results indicate that vaccinating day care children
   against influenza helps reduce influenza-related morbidity among their
   household contacts, particularly among school-aged contacts. Future
   studies should be conducted in civilian populations to assess the full
   effect of vaccinating day care children against influenza.}},

Abstract = {{5,6-Dichloro-7,7,7-trifluoro-4-thia-5-heptenoyl-CoA (DCTFTH-CoA) is an
   analogue of a class of cytotoxic 4-thiaacyl-CoA thioesters that can
   undergo a beta-elimination reaction to form highly unstable thiolate
   fragments, which yield electrophilic thioketene or thionoacyl halide
   species. Previous work demonstrated that the medium-chain acyl-CoA
   dehydrogenase both bioactivates and is inhibited by these CoA thioesters
   through enzyme-catalyzed beta-elimination of the reactive thiolate
   moiety {[}Baker-Malcolm, J, F., Haeffner-Gormley, L., Wang, L., Anders,
   M. W., and Thorpe, C, (1998) Biochemistry 37, 1383-1393]. This paper
   shows that DCTFTH-CoA can be directly bioactivated by the enoyl-CoA
   hydratase (ECH) with the release of
   1,2-dichloro-3,3,3-trifluoro-1-propenethiolate and acryloyl-CoA. In the
   absence of competing exogensus trapping agents, DCTFTH-CoA effects rapid
   and irreversible loss of hydratase activity. The inactivator is
   particularly effective at pH 9.0, with a stoichiometry approaching 1 mol
   of DCTFTH-CoA per enzyme subunit. Modification is associated with a new
   protein-bound chromophore at 360 nm and an increase in mass of 89 +/- 5
   per subunit. Surprisingly, ECH exhibiting less than 2\% residual
   hydratase activity retains essentially 100\% beta-eliminase activity and
   continues to generate reactive thiolate species from DCTFTH-CoA. This
   leads to progressive derivatization of the enzyme with additional UV
   absorbance, covalent cross-linking of subunits, and an eventual complete
   loss of beta-eliminase activity. A range of exogenous trapping agents,
   including small thiol nucleophiles, various proteins, and even
   phospholipid bilayers, exert strong protection against modification of
   ECH. Peptide mapping, thiol titrations, UV-vis spectrophotometry, and
   mass spectrometry show that inactivation involves the covalent
   modification of Cys62 and/or Cys111 of the recombinant rat liver ECH.
   These data suggest that enoyl-CoA hydratase is an important enzyme in
   the bioactivation of DCTFTH-CoA, in a pathway which does not require
   involvement of the medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase.}},

Abstract = {{Laser scanning confocal microscopy combined with fluorescence recovery
   after photobleaching is an effective tool to measure the diffusion
   coefficients of macromolecules in cross-linked hydrogels and polymer
   solutions. In this study, the effects of enzyme treatment on the
   diffusion of macromolecules (FITC-dextran) in guar solutions and
   titanium-guar hydrogels are examined. Enzyme treatment with
   beta-mannanase, a polymer backbone cleaving enzyme, quickly increases
   the diffusion coefficient of the probe molecules in both solutions and
   hydrogels to that in water. Enzyme treatment of guar solutions and
   hydrogels with alpha-galactosidase, a side chain cleaving enzyme,
   displays a unique behavior due to changes in the fine structure of guar.
   The removal of galactose branches from the mannan backbone of guar
   creates additional hyperentanglements ii.e., cross-links), which reduce
   the water holding capacity of guar and induce syneresis. If the depth at
   which the diffusion coefficient is measured remains constant, a minimum
   is observed in the diffusion coefficient asa-galactosidase enzyme
   treatment time increases. At the site of measurement, the sample changes
   from a homogeneous guar system to a phase-separated polymer-rich
   hydrogel and finally to a dilute polymer phase as the polymer-rich
   hydrogel phase precipitates below the site of measurement. The diffusion
   coefficient in the dilute polymer phase increases to that in water,
   while the diffusion coefficient in the hydrogel phase continues to
   decrease to a value of approximately 6 x 10(-8) cm(2)/s.}},

Abstract = {{Although the correct folding of green fluorescent protein (GFP) is
   required for formation of the chromophore, it is known that wild-type
   GFP cannot mature efficiently in vivo in Escherichia coli at 37 degrees
   C or higher temperatures that the jellyfish in the Pacific Northwest
   have never experienced. Recently, by random mutagenesis by the
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, a mutant called Cycle3 was
   constructed. This mutant had three mutations, F99S, M153T, and V163A, on
   or near the surface of the GFP molecule and was able to mature correctly
   even at 37 degrees C {[}Crameri et al. (1996) Nat. Biotechnol. 143,
   315-319]. In the present study, we investigated the differences in their
   folding behavior in vitro. We observed the folding and unfolding
   reactions of both wild-type GFP and the Cycle3 mutant by using green
   fluorescence as an indicator of the formation of the native structure
   and examining hydrogen-exchange reactions by Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy. Both proteins showed unusually slow refolding and
   unfolding rates, and their refolding rates were almost identical under
   the native state at 25 and at 35 degrees C. On the other hand,
   aggregation studies in vitro showed that wild-type GFP had a strong
   tendency to aggregate, while the Cycle3 mutant did not. These results
   indicated that the ability to mature efficiently in vivo at 37 degrees C
   was not due to the improved folding and that reduced hydrophobicity on
   the surface of the Cycle3 mutant was a more critical factor for
   efficient maturation in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of local curvature of a sample surface on capillary and
   interface tension adhesion forces of the water meniscus formed between
   the AFM tip and sample in air is demonstrated both theoretically and
   experimentally. We propose an analytical solution for capillary and
   tension adhesive force derived from approximation of the thermodynamic
   equilibrium of a symmetric water meniscus formed at the tip-sample
   contact region. It is shown that the sample local curvature strongly
   affects the water meniscus geometry and the adhesion force. Compared to
   the force computed for a flat sample surface, the theoretical model
   predicts a larger/smaller adhesive force for a concave/convex local
   curvature. Our theoretical predictions were confirmed by experiment.
   Atomic force spectroscopy measurements were performed for a silicon
   nitride cantilever and a standard sample of platinum-covered quartz
   patterned with 1.5 x 1.5 mu m square, 20 nm deep pits. Maps of sample
   surface topography and adhesive force showed a much larger force at the
   bottom of the pit edge, where the local curvature was concave. This was
   contrasted with a much smaller force observed at the top of the pit
   edge, where the local curvature was convex.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and density of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating
   polypeptide (PACAP) binding sites as well as PACAP-specific receptor 1
   (PAC1-R), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide/PACAP receptor 1 (VPAC1-R),
   and VPAC2-R mRNAs have been investigated in the rat brain from embryonic
   day 14 (E14) to postnatal day 8 (P8). Significant numbers of binding
   sites for the radioiodinated, 27-amino-acid form of PACAP were detected
   as early as E14 in the neuroepithelia of the metencephalon and the
   myelencephalon. From E14 to E21, the density of binding sites in the
   germinative areas increased by 3- to 5-fold. From birth to P12, the
   density of binding sites gradually declined in all neuroepithelia except
   in the external granule cell layer of the cerebellum, where the level of
   binding sites remained high during the first postnatal weeks. Only low
   to moderate densities of PACAP binding sites were found in regions other
   than the germinative areas, with the exception of the internal granule
   cell layer of the cerebellum, which contained a high density of sites.
   The localization of PACAP receptor mRNAs was investigated by in situ
   hybridization using {[}S-35] uridine triphosphate-specific riboprobes.
   The evolution of the distribution of PAC1-R and VPAC1-R mRNAs was very
   similar to that of PACAP binding sites, the concentration of VPAC1-R
   mRNA being much lower than that of PAC1-R mRNA. In contrast, intense
   expression of VPAC2-R mRNA was observed in brain regions other than
   germinative areas, such as the suprachiasmatic, ventral thalamic, and
   dorsolateral geniculate nuclei. The discrete localization of PACAP
   binding sites as well as PAC1-R and VPAC1-R mRNAs in neuroepithelia
   during embryonic life and postnatal development strongly suggests that
   PACAP, acting through PAC1-R and/or VPAC1-R, may play a crucial role in
   the regulation of neurogenesis in the rat brain. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss,

   for the series of complexes 2 in which ligands X, L, and, for X = Cl,
   the phosphine P(4-C6H4R)(3) (R = F, H, Me) were varied independently
   show systematic changes in the parameters delta(Sn-119), delta(Rh-103),

Abstract = {{The yeast transcription factor Yap1 activates expression of antioxidant
   genes in response to oxidative stress. Yap1 regulation involves nuclear
   accumulation, but the mechanism sensing the oxidative stress signal
   remains unknown. We provide biochemical and genetic evidence that upon
   H2O2 treatment, Yap1 is activated by oxidation and deactivated by
   enzymatic reduction with Yap1-controlled thioredoxins, thus providing a
   mechanism for autoregulation, Two cysteines essential for Yap1 oxidation
   are also essential for its activation by H2O2, The data are consistent
   with a model in which oxidation of Yap1 leads to disulfide bond
   formation with the resulting change of conformation masking recognition
   of the nuclear export signal by Crm1/Xpo1, thereby promoting nuclear
   accumulation of the protein. In sharp contrast to H2O2, diamide does not
   lead to the same Yap1 oxidized form and still activates mutants lacking
   cysteines essential for H2O2 activation, providing a molecular basis for
   differential activation of Yap1 by these oxidants, This is the first
   example of an H2O2-sensing mechanism in a eukaryote that exploits the
   oxidation of cysteines in order to respond rapidly to stress conditions.}},

Abstract = {{PD-1 is an immunoinhibitory receptor expressed by activated T cells, B
   cells, and myeloid cells. Mice deficient in PD-1 exhibit a breakdown of
   peripheral tolerance and demonstrate multiple autoimmune features. We
   report here that the ligand of PD-1 (PD-LI) is a member of the B7 gene
   family. Engagement of PD-1 by PD-L1 leads to the inhibition of T cell
   rcceptor-mediated lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion. In
   addition, PD-1 signaling can inhibit at least suboptimal levels of
   CD28-mediated costimulation. PD-L1 is expressed by antigen-presenting
   cells, including human peripheral blood monocytes stimulated with
   interferon gamma, and activated human and murine dendritic cells. In
   addition, PD-L1 is expressed in nonlymphoid tissues such as heart and
   lung. The relative levels of inhibitory PD-L1 and costimulatory
   B7-1/B7-2 signals on antigen-presenting cells may determine the extent
   of T cell activation and consequently the threshold between tolerance
   and autoimmunity. PD-L1 expression on nonlymphoid tissues and its
   potential interaction with PD-1 may subsequently determine the extent of
   immune responses at sites of inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{A series of functionally substituted cyclopentadienyl derivatives of
   silver and copper have been synthesized and characterized. Reactions
   between sodium acetyl- or carbomethoxycyclopentadienylide,

   Ag{[}C5H4C(O)CH3](PPh3) and Ag{[}C5H4CO2CH3](PPh3) in yields of 57-58\%.
   Corresponding copper analogues were prepared using {[}BrCu(PPh3)](4).
   Similar reactions between sodium acetyl- or
   carbomethoxycyclopentadienylide and AgSO3CF3 in the presence of the
   bidentate ligand 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane afforded the chelated
   compounds Ag{[}C5H4C(O)CH3]{[}Ph2P(CH2)(2)PPh2] and
   Ag{[}C5H4CO2CH3]{[}Ph2P(CH2)(2)PPh2] in 55-72\% yields. Dinuclear
   compounds of the type {[}Ag(C5H4PPh2(PR3)](2) (R = Ph, Et) resulted in
   36-49\% yield from reactions of silver chloride with the appropriate
   phosphine in refluxing toluene, followed by cooling to -78 degrees C and
   subsequent reactions with Lithium diphenylphosphinocyclopentadienide.
   The compounds M(C5Ph5)(PEt3) (M = Ag, Cu) containing five bulky phenyl
   substituents were obtained in 44-56\% yield from reactions of sodium
   pentaphenylcyclopentadienide and {[}CIM(PEt3)](4) in THF. In general,
   the new organosilver compounds containing functional substituents on the
   cyclopentadienyl ring as well as binuclear phosphine derivatives
   exhibited enhanced thermal and oxidative stabilities compared with the
   parent compound Ag(C-5H5)(PPh3). P-31 NMR studies of the compounds have
   been undertaken and are in agreement with the proposed structures.}},

Abstract = {{The final steps in the biosynthesis of the plant hormones abscisic acid
   (ABA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) have been shown to be catalyzed by
   aldehyde oxidases (AO). We have cloned three putative functional AO
   genes (TAO1, TAO2 and TAO3) and two putative AO pseudogenes (TAO4 and
   TAO5) in tomato. The TAO1 cDNA described here includes the correct amino
   terminus of the encoded TAO1 protein and is different at the 5'-end from
   the TAO1 sequence in GenBank (accession number U82558). Northern
   analysis shows that TAO1 is expressed mainly in vegetative tissues and
   TAO2 is expressed in both vegetative and reproductive tissues. TAO3
   expression was not detectable by Northern hybridization. These results
   suggest that each AO may play different roles in the regulation of
   tomato growth and development. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An experiment to assess the impact of intermittent irrigation on
   Anopheles larval populations, rice yields and water use was conducted in
   the Mwea rice irrigation scheme in Kenya. Four water regimes including
   intermittent irrigation were tested in a complete randomized block
   experimental design. Intermittent irrigation was carried out on a weekly
   schedule, with flooded conditions from Saturday through Tuesday morning.
   Larval sampling at each plot was conducted every Monday and prior to
   draining of intermittently irrigated subplots on Tuesday. All the adult
   anopheline mosquitoes emerging from larvae collected in the experimental
   plots were identified as being An. arabiensis. By far the highest
   numbers of An. arabiensis Ist instar larvae were found in the
   intermittently irrigated subplots, indicating that the water regime
   provided the most attractive environment for egg laying. However, the
   ratio between the 4th and 1st instar larvae in the subplots was only
   0.08, indicating very low survival rates. In contrast, the 4th/1st
   instar ratio for subplots with other water management regimes ranged
   between 0.27 and 0.68, suggesting a correspondingly higher survival than
   observed with intermittent irrigation. The total number of 4th instars
   was almost the same in the intermittently irrigated subplots and the
   irrigation system normally practised by the farmers. The failure to
   eliminate larval development up to the 4th instar in the former method
   was attributed to residual pools of water. Larval abundance fluctuated
   throughout the 12-week sampling period. The highest larval densities
   were recorded in the 3 weeks after transplanting the rice seedlings.
   Afterwards, larval numbers dropped dramatically as the height of rice
   plants increased. Rice yields at harvest did not show statistically
   significant differences among subplots with different water regimes. The
   average yield per hectare ranged from 4.8-5.3 metric tonnes. The average
   daily water percolation/seepage rate was 3.6 mm and did not
   significantly differ among different water management regimes. Further
   research is necessary to, among other things, determine whether rice
   yields could be increased by having flooded and drained intervals that
   were different from those used in this study. It would likewise be
   important to assess on a wider scale the feasibility of implementing
   intermittent irrigation with respect to farmer acceptance and required
   changes in irrigation system design and management. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A pathogenic role of Th2 cells and their cytokine products (IL-4 and
   IL-10, Th2 cytokines) on the development of herpes simplex myelitis
   (HSM) was studied in mice exposed to footpad injection of herpes simplex
   virus type 2 (HSV-2). Morbidity and mortality of mice with HSM (HSM
   mice) increased when they were treated with a mixture of Th2 cytokines.
   Additionally, survival rates of HSM mice increased when they were
   treated with a mixture of mAbs for Th2 cytokines. As compared with HSM
   mice treated with saline, the growth of HSV-2 in spinal cords of HSM
   mice treated with the mixture of Th2 cytokines increased. Th2 cells
   (myelitis-associated Th2 cells, MTh2 cells) were demonstrated among
   cerebrospinal fluid cells from HSM mice. After the stimulation with
   HSV-2 antigen (Ag), MTh2 cells from HSM mice previously treated with the
   mixture of Th2 cytokines produced enhanced amounts of Th2 cytokines into
   their culture fluids, as compared with the amount of Th2 cytokines
   produced by MTh2 cells. Th2 cells were also demonstrated in mono-nuclear
   cells from spleens of HSM mice. When compared with HSM mice inoculated
   with splenic CD4(+) T cells from normal mice, morbidity and mortality of
   HSM mice inoculated with MTh2 cells markedly increased. These results
   indicated that the severity of HSM induced in mice by footpad injection
   of HSV-2 was influenced by MTh2 cells or Th2 cytokines released from
   these MTh2 cells. Th2 responses manifested in mice by HSV-2 infection
   may act as a pathogenic enhancer of HSM severities. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Primiparous cows with low body condition at calving have an extended
   anovulatory period. Induction of ovulation and oestrus is possible with
   progesterone treatment but the response to this treatment differs
   between Friesian and Jersey breeds. The objective of this study was to
   describe changes in pulsatile LI-I secretion and the synchrony of
   developing ovarian follicles that occur during a progesterone treatment
   period of 5 days in primiparous anovulatory cows. The experimental model
   compared the progesterone treatment with spontaneous post-partum changes
   as well as a breed comparison in a factorial design.
   Thirty-six cows (Jersey n = 19 and Friesian n = 17) were managed to
   calve with a low body condition score (BCS < 4.5). Daily changes in
   ovarian follicle size were observed with transrectal ultrasonography in
   each cow from 8 days post-partum. Thirty of these cows were diagnosed to
   be anovulatory at 12-18 days post-partum (day 0) and allocated to a
   treatment (ra = 16) or a control group tit = 14), balanced for breed.
   Each treated cow had a progesterone-releasing controlled internal
   drug-releasing (CIDR) device inserted vaginally for 5 days while control
   cows were left untreated. Changes in plasma LII concentrations were
   measured with intensive blood sampling over 8 h on days -1, 1, and 4.
   Blood samples were also collected daily (06:00 h) for determination of
   plasma progesterone as well as oestradiol concentrations on days 6 and
   8.
   Treatment with progesterone was associated with a transient initial
   decrease (day 1) in both LH pulse frequency and mean LII concentrations
   after device insertion, but both had returned to pre-treatment levels by
   day 4. Jersey cows had a greater pulse frequency, but there was no breed
   difference in mean LH concentrations. Patterns of ovarian follicle
   growth were affected by progesterone treatment with an increase in
   diameter of the dominant follicle (DF) identified after treatment
   initiation. This followed an earlier emergence of a new DF after device
   insertion. Follicular response to progesterone was dependent on the
   diameter of the DF present at treatment initiation. Those follicles
   greater than or equal to 9 mm were replaced by a new DF during treatment
   such that the DF observed at the time of device removal was large
   (greater than or equal to 9 mm) and growing in 13/16 cases.
   Progesterone was not effective for the induction of an LH surge,
   ovulation and oestrus in anovulatory cows with a low BCS. However,
   treatment was associated with synchronous development of a DF so that it
   was large and growing at the end of the treatment period in most cases.
   This synchronous development may be due to the transient suppression of
   LH and the presence of an LH-dependent DF. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Thin films of AlN(Er) were deposited on M2 steel substrates using r.f.
   reactive magnetron sputtering starting from an aluminium target in
   Ar/N-2 mixtures. Er doping was achieved by partially covering the
   aluminium target with an adequate number of erbium pieces. All
   depositions were achieved with a discharge power of 600 W, P-N2/P-tot =
   0.5 and a total pressure of 0.74 Pa. The Al/(N + Al) ratio in the
   as-deposited films varied between 0.48 and 0.51 while Erbium contents
   ranging from 0.2 to 3.5 at.\% were achieved. X-ray diffraction showed
   that the AlN(Er) films with Erbium contents up to 1.4 at.\% have a
   crystalline structure with a preferential orientation on the (002)
   planes. However, as a consequence of lattice distortion and/or defect
   generation originated by the incorporation of Er atoms in the AIN
   structure, the films became amorphous for higher Er contents. The
   highest hardness values were obtained for the crystalline AIN(Er) films
   (up to 31 GPa at 1.2 at.\% of Er) while a significant decrease of the
   hardness was observed when the films became amorphous (22.5 GPa at 3.5
   at.\%). The mean critical loads for cohesive failure measured by scratch
   test were quite similar for all the coatings (varying from 7 to 8 N)
   revealing the brittle character of the deposited films. The mean
   critical loads for adhesive failure were in the range of 12 N for low Er
   content to 22 N for the higher Er content. Concerning the possible use
   of AIN(Er) films in tools applications, these films have a suitable
   hardness but a poor adhesion to steel alloys when compared with layers
   usually used for mechanical protection. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

Abstract = {{The polar Kerr rotation and ellipticity spectra of epitaxially grown
   (001)-oriented half-metallic Sr2FeMoO6 thin films have been determined
   in the photon energy range from 1.2 to 4.9 eV. The Kerr rotation
   spectrum shows three maxima at E=1.6, 4.0, and 4.65 eV. The maxima at
   4.0 and 4.65 eV are consistent with spin-polarized band structure
   calculations for interband transitions from the O-2p to the
   minority-spin pi{*}Mo/Fe and majority-spin Mo-t(2g) bands, respectively.
   The overall maximum intrinsic Kerr rotation is Theta(K)=-0.045 degrees
   at a photon energy of 4.65 eV. The maximum of Theta(K) at E=1.6 eV
   coincides with a minimum in the reflectivity due to the plasma edge of
   Sr2FeMoO6 and, therefore, is not related to an interband transition. (C)

Abstract = {{A sensitive, simple method for the determination of trace amounts of

   of samarium at 505 nm as Sm-CAS-CPC complex. Optimal conditions such as
   reagent amounts, and pH for the samarium determination were reported.
   The effects of foreign ions were also investigated. The proposed method

Abstract = {{The efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of multiple sclerosis

   glucocorticoids have two different effects on the vulnerability of human

   CD95-independent, but caspase-dependent manner; (ii) steroids protect T
   cells from CD95-mediated apoptosis which, however, is also
   caspase-dependent. An increase in BCL-2 expression is observed upon
   incubation with steroids. Thus, inhibition of CD95-mediated T cell
   apoptosis may be an undesirable side-effect resulting in survival of
   activated T cells and the maintenance of pathogenic immune responses
   might explain the lack of long-term glucocorticoid therapy. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{A 46-year-old woman with exertional myalgia developed slowly progressive
   weakness in her lower extremities. She had slight muscle weakness in her
   facial and upper extremities, and severe muscle weakness and atrophy in
   lower extremities more marked in the proximal portions. Serum creatine
   kinase was slightly elevated. After ischemic forearm exercise test,
   blood ammonia had no elevation although lactate level increased
   normally. The computed tomography revealed that a characteristic
   distribution of skeletal muscle involvement with proximal and flexor
   muscles more severely affected than distal and extensor in the lower
   extremities. In addition, the left sternocleidomastoid muscle showed
   marked atrophy with an asymptomatic weakness of over 20 years duration
   suggesting abnormal development. Needle EMG examination showed a large
   number of easily recruited, short-duration, low-amplitude motor unit
   potentials in all extremities. Muscle biopsy showed absence of adenosine
   monophosphate deaminase activity with normal cytochrome c oxidase and
   phosphorylase activity. With the muscle enzyme activity assay, adenosine
   monophosphate deaminase activity was found to be lower than 0.2\% Of the
   controls. The DNA analysis revealed that she was compound heterozygote
   involving two missense mutations (R388W and R425H) in exon 9 and exon 10
   of AMPD1 gene. This is the first report of primary myoadenylate
   deaminase deficiency with progressive weakness and atrophy caused by
   novel compound heterozygous mutations of AMPD1 gene, and suggests that
   adenosine monophosphate deaminase is closely related not only to energy
   metabolism but also to the development of skeletal muscle. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{A six-stage operation policy for routing of flood hydrographs of return
   periods from 1.01 year up to the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) for any
   dam having a gated spillway is proposed. The gate opening rules are
   determined depending on the recent pool level. Regardless of the size
   and timing of any incoming floods, the fixed rules of the six-stage
   operation policy will provide optimum routing for all, which are
   classified into six different groups based on their return periods. 10-,
   100-, 1000-, 10 000- 100 000-year floods, and PMF are the upper limits
   for the six groups. Next, an Incremental Dynamic Programming programme
   is developed to optimize both the firm and secondary energies of
   hydroelectric generation at monthly periods. First, the six-stage flood
   routing programme is applied sequentially to three dams, all on the
   Seyhan River in Turkey, for 18 combinations resulting from different
   active storages, and optimum flood operation policies for all three dams
   for all Is combinations are determined. Second, the Dynamic Programming
   programme is applied to these three darns, and optimum hydroelectricity
   generation policies for an 18 combinations are computed. Finally, the
   optimum active and flood retention storages for the three darns are
   determined so as to maximize the net probability-weighted present worth
   of hydroelectricity benefits minus flood damage costs.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of networks from liquid crystalline polyesters bearing
   allyl groups as lateral substituents is reported. Crosslinking is
   performed both by thermally activated radical reaction and by UV
   irradiation of film samples containing the suitable activator. Moreover,
   fibrous samples have been crosslinked in the solid state by UV
   irradiation, ``quenching{''} the nematic organisation on a macroscopic
   scale and resulting in a macro-oriented network. Crosslinking does not
   hamper molecular mobility. As a consequence, the degree of orientation
   and the length of crosslinked fibres change continuously and reversibly
   upon heating and cooling through the isotropisation transition. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{This paper presents techniques for fabricating microscopic, curvilinear
   features in a variety of workpiece materials. Microgrooving and
   microthreading tools with cutting widths as small as 13 mum are made by
   focused ion beam sputtering and used for ultraprecision machining. Tool
   fabrication involves directing a 20 keV gallium beam at polished
   cylindrical punches made of cobalt M42 high-speed steel or C2 tungsten
   carbide to create a number of critically aligned facets. Sputtering
   produces rake facets of desired angle and cutting edges having radii of
   curvature equal to 0.4 mum. Clearance for minimizing frictional drag of
   a tool results from a particular ion beam/target geometry that accounts
   for the sputter yield dependence on incidence angle. It is believed that
   geometrically specific cutting tools of this dimension have not been
   made previously. Numerically controlled, ultraprecision machining with
   microgrooving tools results in a close match between tool width and
   feature size. Microtools are used to machine 13-mum wide, 4-mum deep,
   helical grooves in polymethyl methacrylate and 6061 AI cylindrical
   workpieces. Microgrooving tools are also used to fabricate sinusoidal
   cross-sectional features in planar metal samples. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A successful pregnancy has been postulated to be the result of a
   discrete balance between T-helper 1 (Th 1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) type
   cytokines involved in growth and development of the conceptus. The aim
   of the present study was to examine the effect of Th1 cytokines
   (interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF
   alpha)) on the release of Th2 cytokines including IL-6 and IL-10 by
   trophoblast cells obtained from term placenta. Trophoblast cells
   isolated by enzymatic disaggregation and Percoll gradient fractionation
   were cultured in supplemented medium alone or with varying
   concentrations of the selected recombinant cytokines. After 48 h of
   incubation, samples of the culture supernatant were analyzed for the Th2
   cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 using specific ELISA assays. Both IL-I beta and
   TNF alpha had no effect on the cell number and viability as determined
   by MTT assay. IL-1 beta significantly, stimulated trophoblast release of
   lL-6 in a dose-dependent manner (3.3-, 5.5-, 10.3- and 22.4-fold higher
   compared to the control at 10, 50, 100, 500 U IL- 1 beta /ml
   respectively, p < 0.05). TNF<alpha> also stimulated release of IL-6 by
   there cells. However, the stimulation at lower concentrations was not
   very high and a significant (p < 0.05) stimulation was observed only at
   higher concentrations (1.1-, 1.3-, 2.6- and 5.9-fold higher at 500,
   1000, 1500, 2000 U TNF<alpha>/ml respectively). In contrast, neither IL-
   1 beta or TNF alpha exerted any significant effect on IL-10 release by
   term trophoblast cells (p > 0.05). The results of this study provide
   evidence that production of Th2 cytokines might be under the control of
   different regulatory pathways.}},

Abstract = {{The role of nitric oxide in resistance to cryptococcal infection was
   investigated. Mice deficient in inducible nitric oxide synthase (INOS)
   did not survive a primary intratracheal infection as did INOS-replete
   control mice. Despite adequate recruitment of host cells and generation
   of interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha at the
   site of infection, INOS-deficient mice failed to clear yeast from their
   lungs by five weeks of infection, in contrast to wild-type mice.
   INOS-deficient mice also had higher yeast brain burdens than did control
   mice after a primary intracerebral infection. Therefore, generation of
   nitric oxide is required for resistance to primary cryptococcal
   infection. However, INOS-deficient mice vaccinated subcutaneously and
   rechallenged intravenously had lung and brain yeast burdens equivalent
   to those of vaccinated controls, and therefore expressed effective
   acquired immunity to Cryptococcus neoformans. Cells harvested from
   infected INOS-deficient mice by bronchoalveolar lavage acted as
   anti-cryptococcal effecters in vitro at an effector:target ratio of
   100:1, provided IFN-gamma was present, but did not inhibit yeast
   proliferation at a 10:1 effector:target ratio as cells from wild-type
   mice did. Therefore, INOS activity is important for anti-cryptococcal
   function of effecters of immunity during the primary response, but not
   for the generation or expression of secondary immunity to C. neoformans.}},

Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Thyroglossal duet cysts (TDC) in children have a
   variable sonographic appearance. Some reports have suggested that TDCs
   appear on ultrasound as well defined, cystic masses with thin walls and
   posterior enhancement, whereas others have documented a heterogeneous
   echopattern within these lesions, In our experience, although TDCs in
   children have a variable ultrasound appearance, the most common
   appearance is that of a pseudosolid mass closely related to the hyoid
   bone. In this study we report on 23 patients with thyroglossal duct
   cysts and document the ultrasonic patterns.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients in whom the diagnosis of TDC was made
   clinically (by at least two head and neck surgeons) and in whom
   ultrasound detected a cystic mass related to the hyoid bone, were
   included in this study, Sonograms of 23 children with TDCs were
   reviewed. The features evaluated included their location, internal
   echogenicity, posterior enhancement, the presence of septa, a solid
   component and a fistulous tract, The echopattern was not correlated with
   the biopsy results.
   RESULTS: Three patterns of TDCs were identified: anechoic (13\%);
   pseudosolid (56.5\%); and a heterogeneous pattern (30.5\%). The majority
   were midline (82.6\%), showed posterior enhancement (56.5\%), and had
   thin walls (82.6\%).
   CONCLUSION: On ultrasound, TDCs in children are not simple cysts but
   have a complex pattern ranging from a typical anechoic cyst to a
   pseudosolid appearance (most common). Ahuja, A. T. et al. (2000).

Abstract = {{Background: Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) associated with Shiga toxin
   (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection is one of the
   diseases causing acute renal failure in young children. Although HUS is
   still a serious disease in children, no reliable predictive markers for
   HUS nor markers of disease severity are available so far. Recently, we
   experienced a sporadic case of typical HUS caused by Stx-producing E.
   coli O157:H7 and detected, at the prodromal stage, a high level of serum
   fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product-E (FDP-E) fraction.
   Methods: To assess the usefulness of FDP-E for the treatment of HUS in
   clinical practice, we retrospectively examined serum levels of FDP-E in
   22 patients with bloody diarrhea with or without HUS.
   Results: There were significantly increased levels of serum FDP-E in
   patients with HUS, but not in those without HUS. Furthermore, serum
   levels of FDP-E may correlate with disease severity in patients with
   HUS.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that serum levels of FDP-E may be a
   useful marker of HUS in clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{Background-The purpose of this study was to describe findings on
   sequential high resolution computed tomographic (CT) scans of nine
   patients with non-specific interstitial pneumonia.
   Methods-Thin section CT scans of nine patients with pathologically
   proven non-specific interstitial pneumonia were evaluated
   retrospectively. All patients underwent sequential CT scanning (mean
   follow up 3.1 years (range 1-8)).
   Results-The predominant finding on the initial CT scans in seven
   patients was patchy areas of ground glass opacity in both the central
   and peripheral lung, with (n = 5) or without (n = 2) irregular areas of
   consolidation. In another two patients areas of consolidation in both
   the central and peripheral lung were seen as the predominant
   abnormality. The initial parenchymal abnormalities had resolved
   completely in four patients with predominant ground glass opacity
   without bronchiolectasis. Some of the bronchiectasis and
   bronchiolectasis resolved. In two patients bronchiectasis and
   bronchiolectasis occurred at one year and two years of follow up,
   respectively. In two patients with predominant consolidation the
   consolidation decreased but persisted, and in one patient the
   consolidation evolved into honeycombing. In the other patient
   bronchiectasis progressed over the course of seven years, forming
   varicoid bronchiectasis.
   Conclusion-Patients with non-specific interstitial pneumonia may recover
   completely after treatment with corticosteroids, but as many as half of
   these patients will have persistent pulmonary abnormalities on CT scans
   including bronchiectasis and honeycomb lung.}},

Abstract = {{When transmitted over practical communication channels, compressed video
   can suffer severe degradation. One approach to combat the effect of
   channel errors is error concealment. It is an attractive choice because
   it does not increase the bit rate: it does not require any modifications
   to the encoder, it does not introduce any delays and it can be applied
   in almost any application. Conventional temporal concealment techniques
   estimate one concealment displacement for the whole damaged block and
   then use translational displacement compensation to conceal the block
   from a reference frame. The main problem with such techniques is that
   incorrect estimation of the concealment displacement can lead to poor
   concealment of the whole or most of the block. Two novel temporal
   concealment techniques are presented. In the first technique, motion
   field interpolation is used to estimate one concealment displacement per
   pel of the damaged block and then each pel is concealed individually. In
   this case, incorrect estimation of a concealment displacement will only
   affect the corresponding pel. On a block level this may affect few pels
   rather than the entire block. Ln the second technique, multi-hypothesis
   motion compensation is used to combine the first technique with a
   boundary matching temporal concealment technique to obtain a more robust
   performance. Simulation results, within both an isolated error
   propagation environment and an H.263 codec, show the superior subjective
   and objective performance of the proposed techniques when compared with
   conventional temporal concealment techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The output signal sensitivity to optical component contamination and

   detector is analyzed. The analysis carried out the new topology
   characterized by the selective feedback loop incorporating the optical
   part of the detector. Depending on the loop gain frequency shaping in
   the electrical part of the loop, dual-stability enhancement of the input
   threshold level can be achieved, The stable de output signal can be
   preserved by the high de loop gain value, as an option to the standard
   serial filter de rejection. The detector passband gain stability is
   achieved by the high loop gain selectivity, eliminating feedback at very
   low or passband frequencies. The proposed topology can be easily adopted
   to both digital and low-cost analog detector designs.
   The special case of the threshold sensitivity neutralization through the
   cancellation of the output de signal sensitivity and passband gain
   sensitivity is considered, too, as an option suitable for low-cost
   detectors.
   In addition to the described linear settlement, two nonlinear solutions
   are presented, the first of them based on the foregoing linear circuit
   analysis. Despite its nonlinear nature, this alternative solution is not
   troublesome for analog implementation, since the nonlinear function
   required is realized by the standard variable gain amplifier. Another
   nonlinear method requires logarithmic function implementation, so that
   its suitability depends on the particular design requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Contamination of the environment by toxic compounds is a problem of
   global concern and in addressing this problem, it is necessary to
   identify the mechanisms by which specific agents exert their toxic
   effects, and develop effective, inexpensive strategies for detecting
   compounds in their biologically active and available form. We have used
   reporter gene fusion technology to identify genes, in the genetically
   well-characterized bacterium Escherichia coli, whose expression is
   affected by specific environmental toxins. As an added benefit of our
   approach, we have elaborated methods to use these gene fusion clones as
   biosensors to detect specific toxic agents, such as arsenic oxyanions.
   Arsenic is an abundant and useful element which is also an environmental
   toxin that can pose severe risks to health. Arsenic toxicity varies with
   oxidation state, organometallic form, and bioavailability. The
   Escherichia coli arsB fusion strains respond specifically to arsenic in
   its toxic, oxyanionic form, and can detect bioavailable amounts of these
   oxyanions in contaminated water samples. Combinations of different
   biosensor clones and assay automation will augment the use of
   luminescent biosensors for the detection of specific toxic agents in the
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{From the perspective of urban historiography, Caracas is often thought
   to have been asleep from the 1880s until the first decades of this
   century. On the contrary, this paper tries to demonstrate how the city
   underwent major urban changes, whereby public hygiene reforms were
   incorporated into the urban policing agenda as early as the 19th
   century. As a consequence of a medical debate fuelled by the high
   mortality rate in the capital, the government adopted some
   administrative measures inspired by Europe's sanitary reforms, which
   contributed to shape Venezuela's modern urbanism-a contribution which
   has been disregarded up to now.}},

Abstract = {{The mycoflora of 3 hybrids of freshly harvested corn grains collected
   from three regions of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil (Assis, Capao

   analyzed focusing on the influence of abiotic factors (moisture content,
   water activity, temperature and rainfall) on both the prevalence of
   Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium moniliforme, and the ability of these
   genera isolates to produce aflatoxins and fumonisins, respectively. In
   the three surveyed regions, the fungal population comprised mainly
   Fusarium spp., Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp. and 2 others
   filamentous fungal genera, which were isolated from corn kernels showing
   water activity of 0.30 to 0.99 and moisture content of 5.0\% to 20.2\%.
   Among the genera Fusarium and Aspergillus, the most frequent species
   were F. moniliforme and A. flavus, respectively. Concerning the
   toxigenic potential of F. moniliforme, all isolated strains (40)
   produced fumonisins at 20 mug/g to 2168 mug/g (FB1) and/or 10 mug/g to
   380 mug/g (FB2). From the 10 A. flavus isolates, 6 strains (60.0\%)

Abstract = {{Cold gelation of whey proteins is a two-step process. First, protein
   aggregates are prepared by a heat treatment of a solution of native
   proteins in the absence of salt. Second, after cooling of the solution,
   gelation is induced by lowering the pH at ambient temperature. To
   demonstrate the additional formation of disulfide bonds during this
   second step, gelation of whey protein aggregates with and without a
   thiol-blocking treatment was studied. Modification of reactive thiols on
   the surface of the aggregates was carried out after the heat-treatment
   step. To exclude specific effects of the agent itself, different
   thiol-blocking agents were used. Dynamic light scattering and
   SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis were used to show that the size of the
   aggregates was not changed by this modification. The kinetics of
   gelation as determined by the development of pH and turbidity within the
   first 8 h of acidification were not affected by blocking thiol groups.
   During gelation, formation of large, covalently linked, aggregates
   occurred only in the case of unblocked WPI aggregates, which
   demonstrates that additional disulfide bonds were formed. Results of
   permeability and confocal scanning laser microscope measurements did not
   reveal any differences in the microstructure of networks prepared from
   treated or untreated whey protein aggregates. However, gel hardness was
   decreased 10-fold in gels prepared from blocked aggregates. Mixing
   different amounts of blocked and unblocked aggregates allowed gel
   hardness to be controlled. It is proposed that the initial
   microstructure of the gels is primarily determined by the acid-induced
   noncovalent interactions. The additional covalent disulfide bonds formed
   during gelation are involved in stabilizing the network and increase gel
   strength.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Can renal insufficiency in subjects with acute intermittent
   porphyria (AIP) be due solely to AIP?
   Design. A population-based study.
   Subjects. Subjects with AIP greater than or equal to 18 years of age (n
   = 386) in the four most northerly counties of Sweden.
   Interventions. Screening with creatinine clearance at 24 h. Patients
   below the lower reference level underwent a repeat clearance test and,
   if still low, also chromEDTA clearance.
   Results. 286 (74\%) subjects performed the creatinine clearance test and
   in 57 clearance was low; the second clearance proved normal in 23 who
   were then excluded. Eighteen subjects with other possible medical
   reasons for renal insufficiency, ethical reasons or refusing further
   examinations were also excluded. The 16 remaining subjects with no
   explanation for their renal insufficiency other than AIP were then
   studied in detail. All 14 women, mean age 52 years, and two uraemic men,
   58 and 67 years, had manifest AIP. Twelve patients had hypertension (HT)
   and four were normotensive in spite of renal insufficiency. Histological
   findings of renal biopsies revealed diffuse glomerulosclerotic and
   interstitial changes with additional ischaemic lesions.
   Conclusion. Protracted vasospasm in attacks of AIP may be a cause of
   renal lesions. This is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The involvement of the cental nervous system in echinococcosis has an
   estimated incidence of about 2\%-4\%. Intracranial echinococcosis can be
   distinguished into three forms: intracerebral, extracerebral and
   combined.
   Extracerebral intracranial echinococcosis may manifest itself in three
   ways:
   a) osseous with the initial involvement of the spongiosa. Only 2\% of
   cysts are located in the skeleton and of these only 3\%-4\% are in the
   skull;
   b) extradural: the space may be infected by the embryos of scolexes or
   embryos through the blood vessels: by the manifestation of a cerebral
   cyst through the integral dura mater or by the erosion of a hydatid bone
   cyst in the extradural space;
   c) combined: with simultaneous intracerebral, extradural and osseous
   cysts.
   The extradural location is extremely rare and it etiopathogenesis is
   still not fully understood. However, if can be distinguished into three
   forms: osseus, extradural space and combined with simultaneous
   intracerebral, extradural and osseus involvement.
   Out of the 16 cases of extracerebral intracranial hydatid cysts reported
   in the literature, only seven were diagnoses by CT.
   We report an extradural intracranial hydatid cyst in a 14-year-old girl,
   whose etiological diagnosis was suspected by CT.
   The CT findings are characteristic showing a cystic lesion, with a
   CSF-like content and a convex margin towards the cerebral parenchyma. No
   enhancement of the lesion wall was observed after contrast medium
   administration, or significant perilesional oedema. Calcifications are
   very rare. In our case, the inner table of the skull in contact with the
   lesion appeared thinned with focal erosions of the inner table related
   to the primary osseous lesions, induced by the development of extradural
   cysts. These findings (nail scratch) may be considered pathognomonic for
   an extradural hydatid cysts.}},

Abstract = {{In the field of mobile agricultural and off-road machinery, there is a
   growing interest to examine the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle under
   construction with a view to improve passenger comfort and machine
   performance. As many of these machine constructors are small sized,
   specialised companies are required to execute vibration tests and to
   evaluate vibration levels. Because most of these machines are heavy
   constructions with exceptional proportions, it is obvious to perform
   vibration tests on the factory floor by means of a low power mobile
   excitation device such as an electro-hydraulic shaker. This paper shows
   that an air spring, parallel to the actuator of an electro-hydraulic
   shaker, results in considerable power savings. The behaviour of the
   shaker is discussed at its resonance frequencies. For small band
   excitation signals, extra power savings can be achieved by tuning the
   spring stiffness and by using the air spring at constant pressure.
   Experiments on a one degree of freedom vertical shaker show good
   agreement with the theory and demonstrate that the different mode shapes
   of an agricultural tractor can be sufficiently excited with a nominal
   hydraulic power of 500 W. (C) 2000 ISTVS. All rights reserved.}},

   than two orders of magnitude than those previously measured for some of
   the polymers using the Z-scan technique at the same wavelength. The
   electronic contribution to the fast non-linearity is greater than the
   nuclear (orientational) contribution by a factor of at least 4. The
   presence of a single 8-(dimethylamino)naphthyl ligand at silicon

Abstract = {{The vascular system of kidney of the camel is strikingly different from
   that of other domestic animals. The right and left renal arteries
   emanated independently from the ventrolateral aspect of abdominal aorta
   behind cranial mesenteric artery at the level of cranial border of third
   and fourth lumbar vertebra respectively. The renal artery after short
   lateral course divided into medial and lateral lobar arteries before
   reaching the hilus. The lobar artery after entering into the hilus gave
   9-11 interlobar arteries. These interlobar arteries at the
   corticomedullary junction formed 2 - 7 arcuate arteries. The arcuate
   arteries detached numerous straight branches from their convex surfaces
   and then ended by dividing into 2 - 4 terminal branches. The straight
   branches and the terminal branches were present in a radiating manner as
   interlobular arteries.}},

Abstract = {{The releasing rates of inorganic ions in lichens when a thallus sample
   is sonicated under water, were studied. Ramalina farinacea samples taken
   from two locations exposed to atmospheric pollution sources at Els Ports
   (Castellon, Spain), and from three control locations, were used. Samples
   without visual symptoms of injuries were sonicated from 3 to 6
   successive 10-min periods while renewing the water layer in between.
   Experiments with successive 2-min-sonication periods were also
   performed. The extracts were analysed by capillary zone electrophoresis,
   and K+, NH4+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42- and NO3- were detected. The
   apparently undamaged lichens sampled at locations exposed to SO2 and
   ozone sources released high amounts of K+ during the first sonication
   treatment and much lower amounts afterwards, whereas samples taken from
   control locations released approximately constant or increasing amounts
   of K+ along the successive sonication treatments. The initial releasing
   rates of other ions showed no significant differences between samples
   from control and polluted locations. The initial releasing rates of K+
   and the SO42-/Ca2+ molar ratio were found to be useful as pollution
   indicators. The data were correlated with chlorophyll fluorescence
   quantum yield measurements, and with data obtained by visual evaluation
   of injury symptoms produced by pollution on representative lichen
   samples taken from the same locations. (C) 2000 Adac/Editions

Abstract = {{In honeybees, the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles are partly genetically
   based and differ between subfamilies, which suggests that they might be
   used by the workers as labels for subfamily recognition. This ability
   could potentially form the basis for nepotistic conflicts between
   subfamilies that would be detrimental to the inclusive fitness of the
   colony. Here we have compared the subfamily hydrocarbon profiles of
   5-day-old workers maintained in isolation with those kept in their
   parental colony. We demonstrate that the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles
   tend to be less distant between most subfamilies within the hive
   compared with those held in isolation. The main consequence of this
   partial homogenization of the majority of subfamily signatures may
   result in a reduction of the number of recognizable subfamilies in the
   colony. Nevertheless, a few subfamilies retain very distinct cuticular
   hydrocarbon profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Background: RNA of RNA-DNA hybrids can be degraded by ribonucleases H
   present in all organisms including the eukaryote Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae. Determination of the number and roles of the RNases H in
   eukaryotes is quite feasible in S. cerevisiae.
   Results: Two S. cerevisiae RNases H, related to Escherichia coli RNase
   HI and HII, are not required for growth under normal conditions, yet,
   compared with wild-type cells, a double-deletion strain has an increased
   sensitivity to hydroxyurea (HU) and is hypersensitive to caffeine and
   ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS). In the absence of RNase H1, RNase H2
   activity increases, and cells are sensitive to EMS but not HU and are
   more tolerant of caffeine; the latter requires RNase H2 activity. Cells
   missing only RNase H2 exhibit increased sensitive to HU and EMS but not
   caffeine
   Conclusions: Mutant phenotypes infer that some RNA-DNA hybrids are
   recognized by both RNases H1 and H2, while other hybrids appear to be
   recognized only by RNase H2. Undegraded RNA-DNA hybrids have an effect
   when DNA synthesis is impaired, DNA damage occurs or the cell cycle is
   perturbed by exposure to caffeine suggesting a role in DNA
   replication/repair that can be either beneficial or detrimental to cell
   viability.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of continuous i.v. infusion of
   hydrocortisone or insulin on leptin secretion in humans.
   SUBJECTS: Six, nonfasting healthy adults (four women, two men), aged
   (mean +/- s.e.m.) 36.6 +/- 1.7 y; body mass index (BMI) 27.6 +/- 0.9
   kg/m(2).
   DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled. cross-over study, with a 2-week
   `wash-out' period.
   INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous infusion of hydrocortisone (3.3 mu g/(kg
   min)), insulin (1 mU/(kg min)) or normal saline (placebo) for 24 h.
   MEASUREMENTS: Blood sampling every 1-2 h for measurement of glucose,
   insulin, cortisol and leptin; subcutaneous abdominal fat biopsy for
   determination of leptin mRNA expression. RESULTS: Plasma cortisol
   increased to 50.0 +/- 0.4 mu g/dl during hydrocortisone infusion, but
   was unaltered during saline or insulin infusion. The plasma insulin
   levels were: 28.5 +/- 4.7 mu U/ml (placebo), 40.8 +/- 9.2 mu U/ml
   (hydrocortisone, P = 0.214), and 243 +/- 23.0 mu U/ml (insulin, P =
   0.0002). Peak hyperleptinemia occurred after 16 h of insulin and 20 h of
   hydrocortisone infusion; peak/baseline plasma leptin levels (ng/ml) were
   18.2 +/- 4.2/15.1 +/- 3.3 (placebo, P = 0.056), 42.1 +/- 7.0/16.0 +/-
   3.8 (hydrocortisone, + 163\%, P = 0.008) and 30.2 +/- 4.3/16.6 +/- 2.7
   (insulin, + 8396, P = 0.024), Adipocyte leptin mRNA increased by 350\%
   after the hydrocortisone infusion.
   CONCLUSION: Hydrocortisone, a natural glucocorticoid, induces
   hyperleptinemia in vivo, with a potency greater than that of insulin.
   The interaction between glucocorticoids and leptin may be of metabolic
   significance in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Colour and colour application science and technology are widely
   practised throughout the world today. However, there are questions which
   are still unresolved, and sometimes this is due to the experimental
   difficulties involved in pursuit of the answers. In the USA and Western
   Europe, recent years have seen the added commercial problems of excess
   global dye and chemical capacity, international sourcing, and pricing
   pressures. The result has been a complete reorganization of those
   multinational chemical companies with textile colour related divisions,
   followed by divestments, mergers, acquisitions, downsizing of services
   and a broad loss of colour and coloration expertise. Technical and
   commercial problems both have an impact on the future of textile colour
   application research, and this paper addresses some of these problems.

Abstract = {{An investigation was undertaken into the bioaccumulation of Cr, Cu and
   Fe in the gills, liver, muscle and skin of the fish Clarias gariepinus
   from two sites on the Olifants River in the Kruger National Park. During
   1994, four surveys (February, May, July and November) were undertaken.
   Metal bioaccumulation was analysed using atomic absorption
   spectrophotometry and was then applied to differentiate between the
   concentrations found at the two locations, and between all of the
   surveys. The greatest concentration of Cr was detected in the gills,
   suggesting that this was the prime site of absorption and loss of Cr to
   and from the aquatic environment. The concentrations of Cu and Fe were
   highest in the liver, which is a storage and detoxification organ for
   metal, followed by the gills. Mamba and Balule generally showed very
   little difference in the concentration of bioaccumulated metal. However,
   the gills as in the case of Cr generally showed high concentrations at
   Mambai while the liver as in the case of Fe, showed consistently higher
   concentrations at Balule. The possible effects that temperature, pH,
   hardness-and salinity have on the individual metals, as well as
   bioaccumulation of these metals, are discussed in detail. The continuous
   monitoring of the quality of water in the Olifants River is imperative
   for the future sustainability of the Kruger National Park.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE Androgens are essential in the maintenance of nitric
   oxide-mediated erectile activity in the rat. The objective of the
   present study was to investigate the role of androgens in regulating
   trabecular smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum in response
   to vasoactive challenge in men with erectile dysfunction (ED).
   DESIGN Retrospective, double-blind correlation analyses.
   PATIENTS Fifty-two impotent patients without confounding risk factors
   for ED were obtained from a total of 250 undergoing diagnostic
   evaluation.
   MEASUREMENTS All patients had dynamic colour duplex ultrasound (D-CDU)
   and hormonal evaluation for LH, total and free testosterone, SHBG and
   oestradiol.
   RESULTS Based upon D-CDU results patients were diagnosed as having
   arteriogenic (AR, n = 18; mean age 51) or corporeal venocclusive (CVO, n
   = 13; mean age 49) ED; in other patients (n = 21, mean age 43) a
   diagnosis of psychogenic (P)-ED was made by comprehensive psychogenic
   testing and confirmed by normal D-CDU results. AR and CVO patients had
   altered compliance of cavernous arteries recorded by D-CDU {[}20-25\%
   lower resistive index (RI) than patients with psychogenic ED], and lower
   free testosterone (FT) levels than psychogenic patients {[}42.3 +/- 3.5
   SE and 49.3 +/- 5.2 vs. 75.2 +/- 7.6 pmol/l, respectively; P < 0.01].
   More important, in all patients there was a strong direct correlation
   between resistive index values and FT levels (r = 0.47, P = 0.002); the
   relationship was maintained also when adjusted for age, SHBG and
   oestradiol (r = 0.37, P = 0.02).
   CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that in men with erectile dysfuntion
   low free testosterone may correlate independently of age with the
   impaired relaxation of cavernous endothelial and corporeal smooth muscle
   cells to a vasoactive challenge. These findings give clinical support to
   the experimental knowledge of the importance of androgens in regulating
   smooth muscle function in the penis.}},

Abstract = {{It has been proposed that Pasteurella multocide can invade the host
   tissues via the mucous membrane. Vitamin A (VitA) deficiency has been
   associated with mucous membrane damage, such as squamous metaplasia. The
   objective of this study was to determine the early stages in the
   pathogenesis of P. multocida in VitA-deficient turkeys and clinically
   healthy turkeys. Fifteen-week-old VitA-deficient and clinically healthy
   turkeys were inoculated with P. multocida P-1059, a virulent strain, and
   the portal of entry, invasion, and localization of P. multocide were
   studied by microbial examination of the trachea, liver, and lung and
   histologic examinations of internal organs. Higher mortality was found
   in VitA-deficient turkeys. Pasteurella multocida was first reisolated
   from the trachea, secondarily from the liver and blood, and finally from
   the lung in both groups. Invasion of P. multocide into tissues occurred
   between 3 hr and 24 hr postinoculation in both groups. Our findings
   suggest that altered membrane integrity in VitA-deficient birds did not
   appear to change the time course of the systemic spread of P. multocida
   infection in turkeys and that the increased mortality seen in the
   VitA-deficient turkeys may be associated with immune system impairment.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of gamma irradiation and some essential metals on growth and
   aflatoxin B-1 production by Aspergillus flavus in crushed corn were
   investigated. The production of aflatoxin by A. flavus was influenced by
   the addition of zinc, copper or iron and the effect gradually decreased
   with increasing metal concentration from 0 to 300 ppm. A. flavus grew
   and depleted zinc, copper and iron at initial concentration of 100, 200
   or 300 ppm. Presence of 100 ppm zinc, copper or iron plus gamma
   irradiation (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 kGy) enhanced the growth of A. flavus and the
   production of aflatoxin in contrast with irradiated samples alone. A.
   flavus was able to metabolize and deplete elements in all
   gamma-irradiated samples. These results suggest that stricter control of
   element levels in gamma irradiated grains could control aflatoxin

Abstract = {{Wood-based carbon was studied as a hydrogen sulfide adsorbent in three
   adsorption/regeneration cycles. The regeneration was done using a
   constant amount of either hot or cold water. The performance of carbon
   and efficiency of its regeneration were evaluated on the basis of the
   amount of hydrogen sulfide adsorbed and on the selectivity of the carbon
   surface for oxidation of H2S to sulfur oxides. The latter, as the
   products of surface reactions, made the regeneration feasible. To check
   the effect of aging/surface oxidation the tests were carried out on
   fresh and 3-year-stored carbon samples. The results obtained showed that
   the surface of fresh carbon can be regenerated to some extent, whereas
   in the case-of aged materials the water regeneration is inefficient due
   to the deposition bulky sulfur polymers resistant to oxidation at
   temperatures up to 100 degrees C. Both hot and cold water treatment
   results in similar degree of regeneration of the carbon surface.}},

Abstract = {{There is a large illegal trade in trapped houbara bustards Chlamydotis
   undulata macqueenii, which are smuggled into the Middle East for
   falconry. Mortality is high and is associated with poor transport
   conditions, malnutrition, overcrowding and exposure to multiple
   infectious diseases, in particular aspergillosis, avian pox and
   paramyxovirus type 1 virus. Other pathogens include Salmonella sp.,
   Pseudomonas sp., Trichomonas sp., intestinal endoparasites, avian
   leucosis, reovirus, adenovirus, paramyxovirus type 2 and Chlamydia sp.
   Various regional initiatives have been initiated to confiscate and
   rehabilitate illegally trapped birds. This paper reviews the causes of
   morbidity and mortality seen in illegally traded houbara bustards and
   provides health recommendations for those involved in rehabilitation.}},

Title = {{A coupled model of Titan's atmosphere and ionosphere}},
Journal = {{ICARUS}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with a coupled model of the upper atmosphere and
   ionosphere of Titan. The neutral atmosphere is described by a
   comprehensive photochemical model for 30 degrees solar zenith angle with
   molecular and turbulent diffusive transport taken into account. At the
   upper boundary (1430 km) escaping flux of light molecules is included in
   boundary conditions, while near the lower boundary (32 km) condensation
   of less volatile species is introduced. The atmosphere is coupled with
   the ionosphere via a large set of bi- and termolecular ion-neutral
   reactions. The ionosphere is considered to be in chemical equilibrium;
   in addition to ion-neutral reactions, recombination loss and ionization
   by solar photons as well as by saturnian magnetospheric electrons and
   photoelectrons appear in the mass balance equations. In the most
   advanced models, from several considered, heavy hydrocarbon ions and
   heavy nitriles are grouped and represented as two pseudoions. The peak
   ion density of 5200-6000 cm(-3), depending on the employed model, is
   obtained at a height of 970-1000 km, i.e., slightly lower than in
   previous ionospheric studies, which, however, were carried out for 60
   degrees solar zenith angle. The main ionospheric component near the peak
   is HCNH+; but at lower altitudes heavy nitriles followed by heavy
   hydrocarbons are more abundant, while near the upper boundary (>1400 km)
   CH5+ and C2H5+ compete with HCNH+. When termolecular reaction rates are
   increased to about 5 x 10(-23) cm(6) s(-1) as suggested by V. G. Anicich
   and M. J. McEwan (1997, Planet. Space Sci. 45, 897-923) for a
   nitrogen-dominated atmosphere, ion density profiles change significantly
   (50\%) in the lower part of the ionosphere, at 700-800 km. The
   astonishing result by J. L. Fox and R. V. Yelle (1997, Geophys. Res.
   Lett. 24, 2179-2192), whose ionospheric model prefers heavy pseudoions
   as main constituents near the peak, can, in part, be reproduced if the
   density of C4H2, a neutral molecule that controls heavy ion production
   rate, is increased by a factor of 100. The ionosphere is quite sensitive
   (up to 30\% change in density) to variation in recombination rates
   and/or electron temperature profile. As it can be expected, densities of
   certain minor neutral components are severely influenced by coupling
   with ions, e.g., by an order of magnitude for CH3C2H. Surprisingly
   enough, even some major neutral species, like CH4, show a 50\% change in
   the thermospheric density profile when ion-neutral reactions are
   introduced. This proves that for molecules in a shallow chemical
   equilibrium with other neutral species, even a small perturbation caused
   by reactions with ions can result in a significant change of the
   density. An interesting and reassuring conclusion has been obtained for
   HCN: to reach the agreement with the observed mixing ratio profile in
   the thermosphere, the loss due to polymerization should be considered
   together with a strongly productive interaction with ions. In view of
   the results obtained for the neutral atmosphere it seems that coupling
   with ions can be as important as other factors that shape the neutral
   density profiles and should be taken into account in future models that
   will aim at data interpretation from the Cassini/Huygens mission. (C)

Abstract = {{We present the quantum theory of a Stem-Gerlach system in contact with a

   the path integral technique, under a general condition when the system

   behavior of the density matrix in the long-time limit and compute the
   time scales of decay of the elements off-diagonal in the coordinate and
   the momentum space, for the cases of high temperature, zero temperature,

Abstract = {{We generalize the finite-range momentum- and density-dependent
   Seyler-Blanchard nucleon-nucleon effective interaction to the case of
   interaction between two baryons. This effective interaction is then used
   to describe dense hadronic matter relevant to neutron stars in the
   nonrelativistic Thomas-Fermi approach. We investigate the behaviour of
   nuclear symmetry energy in dense nuclear and hyperon matter relevant to
   neutron stars. It is found that the nuclear symmetry energy always
   increases with density in hyperon matter unlike the situation in nuclear
   matter This rising characteristic of the symmetry energy in the presence
   of hyperons may have significant implications on the mass-radius
   relationship and the cooling properties of neutron stars. We have also
   noted that with the appearance of hyperons, the equation of state
   calculated in this model remains causal at high density.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation of the structure of identified quark and
   gluon jets is presented. Observables related to both the global and
   internal structure of jets are measured; this allows for tests of QCD
   over a wide range of transverse momentum scales. The observables include
   distributions of jet-shape variables, the mean and standard deviation of
   the subjet multiplicity distribution and the fragmentation function for
   charged particles. The data are compared with predictions of
   perturbative QCD as well as QCD-based Monte Carlo models. In certain
   kinematic regions the measurements are sensitive mainly to
   perturbatively calculable effects, allowing for a test of QCD. The
   comparisons are also extended into regions where nonperturbative effects
   become large, and in this way the transition from hard to soft QCD is
   investigated. It is found that by including leading and next-to-leading
   logarithmic contributions in the QCD predictions, the agreement with the
   data can be extended to lower transverse momentum scales, especially fur
   gluon jets.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Celiac disease responds to dietary gluten withdrawal, but
   data on the long-term effects of gluten-free diets are discordant.
   Objective: Our aim was to evaluate the nutritional status and body
   composition of adult celiac disease patients consuming a gluten-free
   diet who were in clinical, biochemical, and histologic remission.
   Design: We studied 71 patients (51 women and 20 men; mean age: 27 y;
   range: 17-58 y) and 142 healthy control subjects matched by sex and age.
   The subjects' height, weight, body mass index, fat and lean mass, and
   bone mineral content (evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry)
   were measured; a 3-d dietary questionnaire was administered; and total
   daily energy, fat, carbohydrate, and protein intakes were calculated.
   Results: The weight. height, and body mass index of male celiac disease
   patients and the weight and body mass index of female celiac disease
   patients were significantly lower than the corresponding measurements in
   control subjects. The fat and lean mass of both male and female patients
   was significantly different from that of control subjects; however, bone
   mineral content was significantly lower only in females in whom celiac
   disease was diagnosed in adulthood. Total energy intake was lower in the
   patients than in the control subjects (9686 +/- 1569 and 11297 +/- 1318
   kJ/d in males and 6736 +/- 1318 and 7740 +/- 1715 kJ/d in females), and
   the diet of the patients was unbalanced, with a higher percentage of
   energy as fat and a lower percentage of energy as carbohydrates.
   Conclusions: Although strictly compliant with their gluten-free diet and
   in complete remission, patients with celiac disease showed differences
   in body composition and dietary intakes compared with control subjects.
   Strict follow-up and dietary advice in terms of the choice and
   composition of foods seem necessary to prevent malnutrition.}},

Abstract = {{Greenstone belts in the northern Murchison Terrane of the Yilgarn Craton
   contain an extensive suite of 2.9-3.0 Ga, porphyritic komatiites and
   komatiitic volcaniclastic rocks. These unusual Ti-rich Al-depleted
   komatiites have been sampled at Gabanintha and are characterised by
   higher incompatible-element abundances than most suites of
   Barberton-type Al-depleted komatiites. They form a petrogenetically
   related group with similar Ti- and incompatible-element-rich,
   Al-depleted porphyritic komatiites and komatiitic volcaniclastic rocks
   from Karasjok in Norway, Dachine in French Guiana and Steep Rock - Lumby
   Lake in Canada (here called Karasjok-type komatiites). Their
   Al-depletion results from magma generation at depths of > 250 km in the
   presence of residual majorite-garnet. The porphyritic textures and
   abundance of amygdales and volcaniclastic rocks typical of this type of
   komatiite are features of hydrous ultramafic magmas. The
   incompatible-element-rich ultramafic rocks from Dachine contain diamonds
   that were most likely picked up as parent magmas interacted with mantle
   lithosphere that had been hydrated and chemically modified. Consequently
   the interaction of Karasjok-type komatiite magmas with thick, island arc
   or continental mantle lithosphere may have resulted in their elevated
   water and incompatible-element contents. The occurrence of Karasjok-type
   komatiite lavas and volcaniclastic rocks in the northern Murchison
   Terrane suggests that during the Late Archaean that terrane had a
   hydrated, metasomatised or subduction-modified mantle lithosphere.}},

Abstract = {{The unprecedented growth of IP traffic is leading Internet service
   providers and network operators worldwide to investigate architectural
   alternatives for cost effective, reliable, scalable, and flexible
   multiterabit IP backbones. In this paper, several overlay, service, and
   transport layer networking architectures, which employ IP,MPLS,
   SONET/SDH, and DWDM technologies, are proposed and analyzed. Multiple
   parameters, such as network capacity, cost, restoration strategy,
   reconfigurability, and accommodation of preemptable traffic, are
   considered for the architectural comparison. Detailed network design and
   economic analysis are provided for the different alternatives
   considering a typical nationwide U.S. backbone with projected IP traffic
   in approximately three years. Several sensitivity analysis results are
   also shown, to evaluate the effect of cost changes in some of the
   critical technological factors in these architectures, such as 10 Gb/s
   optics cost or TP router cost. The results show the value of transport
   layer networking architectures for multiterabit IP backbones, and how,
   when compared to service layer architectures, they provide additional
   desirable features such as wavelength reconfigurability and restoration
   scalability.}},

Abstract = {{Parametric pumping with variation of the pH is an innovative
   ion-exchange process which allows heavy metals from mixed waste
   solutions to be recovered as single components and, therefore, to be
   recycled. The process is based on the addition of complexing agents to a
   mixture, on its separation into two half volumes and a periodic contact
   of an ion exchanger with both liquid phases. Optimum conditions for the
   separation with respect to the kind of complexing agent, its amount
   relative to the concentration of heavy metals and to the amount of ion
   exchanger material have been deduced in preliminary investigations.
   Using citric acid as complexing agent the separation of binary mixtures
   of divalent/divalent and trivalent/divalent metal ions has been
   investigated. The kinds of metal species forming more stable complexes
   are concentrated in the high-pH solution, the other ones in the low-pH
   solution. Separation is more successful the greater the difference of
   the ratio of non-complexed metal cations at the two operating pH values
   becomes. As a consequence, systems with copper as one component can be
   well separated. Less effective separations were found for mixtures of
   other divalent metals. The separation can be emphasized by applying a
   second separation step to the two half volumes. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The first study of the Tl2MoO4-Pr-2(MoO4)(3) system is reported. The
   system was studied by X-ray powder diffraction, differential thermal
   analysis, and visual polythermal analysis. Its phase diagram was mapped.
   Intermediate phase of compositions 1:1 and 5:1 with incongruent melting
   points of 910 and 620 degreesC were found in the system. A new polymorph
   of TlPr(MoO4)(2) was obtained. Tl5Pr(MoO4)(4) was prepared for the first
   time. Double molybdates Tl(5)Ln(MoO4)(4) were found to exist for all
   lanthanides from lanthanum to lutetium, including yttrium.
   Tl5La(MoO4)(4) is isostructural to its isoformula analogues, potassium
   lanthanum and rubidium lanthanum molybdates; it has a monoclinically
   distorted palmierite structure with a = 10.534(8) Angstrom, b =

Abstract = {{The La Plata River, though severely contaminated by intestinal parasites
   through the discharge of tons of crude fecal material from a main sewage
   channel, nevertheless provides drinking water to two-thirds of La Plata,
   Argentina, after conventional purification at a processing plant. With
   intestinal parasitosis being endemic here, we investigated the
   importance of this water in transmitting such pathogens to the city's
   populace by means of standard methodology for sample acquisition and
   processing involving filter-concentration of waterborne particulates. Of
   14 tap-water samples collected from the distribution network, 12
   pertained to four zones (A-D) within the city center; while the
   remaining 2 were obtained near the processing plant, 15 kilometers
   outside the city. Although parasites were found within the samples
   derived from the four urban zones, none were detected in the specimens
   obtained near the plant. The four downtown areas differed from each
   other as to the quantity and nature of the parasites present in their
   water: whereas zones A and B registered similar lower levels of
   contaminants, C and D exhibited higher values significantly different
   from the former two and from each other. Given an average parasite
   count/l citywide of 0.38 and a probability of encountering a parasite
   within 11 of water of 0.32, the municipal network is seen to contribute
   to the transmission of intestinal parasites. A routine system of
   water-quality control is therefore needed throughout the city along with
   the establishment of infrastructures for locating and eliminating
   peripheral sources of contamination.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To map the locus for autosomal dominant cataracts (ADCs) in a
   Brazilian family using candidate gene linkage analyses, describe the
   clinical variability, and identify potential mutations in the human beta
   A1-crystallin gene (CRYBA1), a candidate gene identified through linkage
   studies demonstrating cosegregation with markers on chromosome 17.
   METHODS. Members of a Brazilian family with ADC were studied. Clinical
   examinations and linkage analyses with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   polymorphisms of 22 anonymous markers and 2 within the neurofibromatosis
   type 1 gene were performed; two-point lod scores were calculated. DNA
   sequences of all 6 exons and 12 exon-intron boundaries of the beta
   A1-crystallin gene, a proximal candidate gene mapped to 17q11.1-q12 in
   one unaffected and two affected individuals, were screened and new
   variants assessed for cosegregation with the disease.
   RESULTS. Affected individuals exhibited variable expressivity of
   pulverulent opacities in the embryonal nucleus and sutures; star-shaped,
   shieldlike, or radial opacities in the posterior embryonal nucleus,
   and/or midcortical opacities. All known loci for ADC in this family on
   chromosomes 1 and 13 were excluded. A positive lod score on chromosome
   17 was calculated. This ADC locus was mapped to two potential regions on
   the long arm with an intervening recombination. The only known candidate
   gene in these regions was beta A1-crystallin. Three previously
   unreported single nucleotide variants were found in this gene, one in
   the donor splice junction site of intron C. This variant was found in
   all affected members and is presumed to be the causative mutation.
   CONCLUSIONS. An ADC locus was mapped in a Brazilian family with variable
   expressivity to either 17q23.1-23.2 or 17q11.1-12 based on linkage
   analyses. Analyses of DNA sequences of the beta A1-crystallin gene in
   this family revealed three new variants, one of which is within a donor
   splice junction and cosegregates with affected members.}},

   fluid-fluid coexistence is observed, in addition to the usual
   isotropic-nematic transition fur hard disk systems. For very small
   polymer coils (sigma (P)<0.1<sigma>(D)), a nematic-nematic demixing
   transition is observed, although this occurs at extremely high platelet
   density. The case of colloidal platelets and thin stiff rods is also
   examined. Demixing is observed in the isotropic phase for long rods and
   in the nematic phase for short rods, as for large and small polymer
   coils, respectively. However, the nematic-nematic demixing transition
   for platelet-rod mixtures occurs at a much lower platelet density than

Abstract = {{Mineral fertilization is a common management practice in short rotation
   forestry. The mycorrhizal formation of trees can be affected by
   fertilizer applications, however, very little is known on such effects
   in arable soils. The effects of a nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)
   fertilization on mycorrhizal formation of two poplar clones (Populus
   trichocarpa and P. tremula x tremuloides) were investigated at the
   plantation Abbachhof (South Germany). We determined the ectomycorrhizal
   colonization and the abundance of VAM spores in the soil during three
   years, and the species richness of sporocarps during one growing season.
   Approximately 26 to 73\% of the fine roots of P. trichocarpa and 41 to
   82\% of the fine roots of P. tremula x tremuloides were colonized with
   ectomycorrhizal fungi. The percentage of ectomycorrizal colonization on
   P. tremula x tremuloides was significantly reduced after both
   fertilization treatments. On P. trichocarpa only the P-fertilization
   reduced the ectomycorrhizal colonization. The composition of
   ectomycorrhizal morphotypes was significantly affected by the N and P
   fertilization on P. tremula x tremuloides, but not on P. trichocarpa.
   Sporocarps of 12 ectomycorrhizal fungi species were found at the
   plantation. Cortinarius uliginosus, Lactarius controversus and
   Krombholziella aurantiaca produced sporocarps only on control plots,
   whereas Cortinarius croceocaeruleus, Inocybe umbrina, Laccaria tortilis,
   Paxillus involutus and Rhizopogon roseolus produced sporocarps only on
   fertilized plots. Inocybe geophylla, I. glabripes, Laccaria laccata and
   Tuber borchii produced sporocarps on both control and fertilized plots.
   The density of VAM spores was lower in the rooting zone of Populus
   trichocarpa than under P. tremula x tremuloides. In an efficient
   management of these short rotation plantations mineral fertilizer
   applications must be low enough to avoid undesired suppressions of
   mycorrhizal formation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To evaluate the validity of racial/ethnic information in
   California birth certificate data.
   Data Sources. Computerized birth certificate data and postpartum
   interviews with California mothers.
   Study Design and Data Collection. Birth certificates were matched with
   face-to-face structured postpartum interviews with 7,428 mothers to
   compare racial/ethnic information between the two data sources.
   Interviews were conducted in Spanish or English during delivery stays at
   16 California hospitals, 1994-1995.
   Principal Findings. The sensitivity of racial/ethnic classification in
   birth certificate data was very high (94 percent to 99 percent) for
   African Americans, Asians/Pacific Islanders, Europeans/Middle
   Easterners, and Latinas (Hispanics). For Native Americans, however, the
   sensitivity was only 54 percent. The positive predictive value of birth
   certificate classification of race/ethnicity was high for all
   racial/ethnic groups (96 percent to 97 percent).
   Conclusions. Despite limited training of birth clerks, the maternal
   racial/ethnic information in California birth certificate data appears
   to be a valid measure of self-identified race and Hispanic ethnicity for
   groups other than Native Americans.}},

Abstract = {{Repetition plays a significant, productive role in the work of both
   Derrida and Deleuze. But the difference between these two philosophers
   couldnt be greater: it is the difference between negation and
   affirmation, between Yes and No. In Derrida, the productive energy of
   repetition derives from negation, from the necessary impossibility of
   supplementing an absence. Deleuze recognizes the kind of repetition
   which concerns Derrida, but insists that there is another, primary form
   of repetition which is fully positive and affirmative. I will argue that
   there is nothing in Derridas philosophy to match the affirmative,
   primary form of repetition articulated by Deleuze. Moreover, it is
   precisely this difference that accounts for the most exciting features
   of Deleuzes work: the possibility of breaking through to the other side
   of representation, beyond authenticity and inauthenticity,
   becoming-becoming.}},

   UK, it shows how job loss can result in increased recorded sickness

Abstract = {{Corticotrophin releasing factor has been shown in several models of
   tissue injury to be an effective treatment for edema. In a previous
   study we demonstrated this ability in two models of traumatic brain
   injury (TBI). The aim of this study was to assess whether human
   corticotrophin releasing factor (hCRF) could additionally improve motor
   and cognitive deficits. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised
   into five groups and injured with the Impact Acceleration Model of TBI.
   Groups I and II received sham injury followed by treatment with either
   drug vehicle or 100 mug kg(-1) hCRF respectively. Group III was injured
   with no treatment; Group IV animals were injured and treated with 50 mug
   kg(-1) hCRF and Group V were injured and treated with 100 mug kg(-1)
   hCRF. Animals were assessed both before and after injury with a battery
   of standardised neuropsychological tests including the Morris Water
   Maze, the Beam Walk Test, the Beam Balance Test and the Inclined Plane
   Test. Both 50 mug kg(-1) and 100 mug kg(-1) hCRF caused significant
   improvements in motor and cognitive functioning, confirming that in
   addition to edema-reducing properties, human corticotrophin releasing
   factor is also capable of improving motor and cognitive functioning
   Given the beneficial experimental effects of this compound, hCRF may be
   a useful clinical treatment, which requires formal evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue homeostasis is determined by a balance between proliferation and
   apoptosis. Various lesions in the brain are accompanied by proliferation
   and subsequent death of glial cells, but the mechanisms that limit this
   expansion of glial populations remains unknown. One possible candidate
   is the death ligand, FasL, and its receptor Fas, because the expression
   of both proteins was reported on glial cells. To elucidate the
   expression and putative function of Fas and FasL on proliferative glial
   cells, we performed stereotactic lesion of the entorhinal cortex of
   adult rats. Such lesions induce proliferation of astrocytes and
   microglial cells in the hippocampal fields of anterograde degeneration.
   Subsequently, the total number of both cell types returns to pre-lesion
   counts. We found that Fas and FasL is strongly upregulated on astrocytes
   in the zone of anterograde degeneration with a peak 5 days postlesion
   (dpl) and a return to control levels at 10 dpl. However, evidence for
   astrocytic cell death was neither detected by TUNEL staining,
   immunocytochemistry for c-Jun, and apoptosis-specific protein (ASP), nor
   by staining for morphologic hallmarks of apoptotic or necrotic cell
   death at the light and electron microscopic level. Thus, increased
   expression of Fas and FasL is not accompanied by cell death of reactive
   astrocytes during anterograde degeneration. GLIA 32:25-41, 2000. (C)

Abstract = {{Microstructure and properties of zirconium diboride based ceramics,
   sintered without sintering aids and with the addition of 4 wt\% of
   nickel, are evaluated. Although the two powder compositions have been
   densified by hot pressing, only the presence of Ni allows the
   achievement of high final densities (98\%), while pure ZrB2 present,, a
   residual porosity of about 13\%. All the same. this latter material has
   a rather constant flexural strength ((300-350 MPa) up to 1400degreesC,
   while the doped material exhibits an improved strength in the
   temperature range (500-800degreesC and a strong strength degradation
   above 1000degreesC. Phenomenologies governing thin, behaviour are
   discussed. The Ni-doped material reveals the presence of Ni-rich grain
   boundary phases mainly located at triple points and of spherical shaped
   particles of glassy phase constituted by boron oxide and metal cations,
   At high temperatures, these features favour the surface and subsurface
   degradation because of oxidation reaction, that propagates toward the
   bulk material through the grain boundaries. Other mechanical (hardness,
   toughness, Young's modulus) and physical (thermal expansion, electrical
   resistivity) properties are discussed in terms of the microstructural
   characteristics and composition.}},

Abstract = {{The space-time structure of two-photon and three-photon entangled states
   is analysed and the Wigner functions for these states are developed. The
   analysis of the Wigner functions is made in real position-momentum space
   where position goes with time in a retarded frame and the momentum of
   the photon in free space is proportional to frequency. The entanglement
   of the photons in frequencies and wave vectors is due to the phase
   matching conditions. By the use of narrow-band filters the dominant
   entanglement effect is due to phase matching conditions in frequencies,
   and under this condition the description of the three-photon entangled
   state becomes analogous to that of the two-photon. The motion of the
   entangled photons is seperated into the centre of mass motion and the
   relative motion between the photons, including two or three degrees of
   freedom for the two-photon and three-photon, respectively. Under the
   approximation of narrow-band filters we get for each degree of freedom a
   Gaussian wave packet in position momentum with the corresponding time

Abstract = {{The use of corrosion free fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites as
   reinforcement to concrete is currently being seen as a promising option
   to generate durable concrete structures. However, there exists very
   little credible information about its field application and performance.
   This paper describes the Joffre Bridge project, in Sherbrooke (Quebec,
   Canada), over the St-Francois River, where Carbon Fibre Reinforced
   Polymer (CFRP) was used as reinforcement for a portion of the concrete
   deck slab. The bridge consists of five longitudinal spans with lengths
   varying from 26 to 37 m. Each span has a concrete deck supported by five
   steel girders at 3.7 m. A part of the concrete deck slab (7.3 x 11.5 m)
   and a portion of the traffic barrier and the sidewalk were reinforced
   with Carbon (CFRP) and Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP)
   reinforcement. The bridge was extensively instrumented with many
   different types of gauges, including integrated fibre optic sensors
   (FOS) into FRP reinforcement. The performance of the bridge had been
   assessed under static and dynamic loading using calibrated heavy trucks.
   Moreover, structural design and construction details of the bridge and
   instrumentation were performed. The results from calibrated field tests
   on the bridge are presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{An important issue in data visualization is the recognition of complex
   dependencies between attributes. Past techniques for identifying
   attribute dependence include correlation coefficients, scatterplots, and
   equi-width histograms. These techniques are sensitive to outliers, and
   often are not sufficiently informative to identify the kind of attribute
   dependence present We propose a new approach, which we call independence
   diagrams. We divide each attribute into ranges; for each pair of
   attributes, the combination of these ranges defines a two-dimensional
   grid. For each cell of this grid, we store the number of data items in
   it We display the grid, sealing each attribute axis so that the
   displayed width of a range is proportional to the total number of data
   items within that range. The brightness of a cell is proportional to the
   density of data items in it As a result, both attributes are
   independently normalized by frequency, ensuring insensitivity to
   outliers and skew, and allowing specific focus on attribute
   dependencies. Furthermore, independence diagrams provide quantitative
   measures of the interaction between two attributes, and allow formal
   reasoning about issues such as statistical significance. We have
   addressed several technical challenges in making independence diagrams
   work, ranging from the treatment of categorical attributes to visual
   artifacts of cell-to-pixel mapping. Our experimental evaluation, using
   both AT\&T and synthetic data, shows that independence diagrams allow
   the easy identification of various kinds of attribute dependence that
   would be difficult to identify using conventional techniques. (C) 2000

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We develop the concept of supersymmetry in singular spaces, apply it in
   an example for 3-branes in D = 5 and comment on 8-branes in D = 10. The
   new construction has an interpretation that the brane is a sink for the
   flux and requires adding to the standard supergravity a (D - 1)-form
   field and a supersymmetry singlet field. This allows a consistent
   definition of supersymmetry on a S-1/Z(2) orbifold, the bulk and the
   brane actions being separately supersymmetric. Randall-Sundrum
   brane-worlds can be reproduced in this framework without fine tuning.
   For fixed scalars, the doubling of unbroken supersymmetries takes place
   and the negative tension brane can be pushed to infinity. In more
   general BPS domain walls with 1/2 of unbroken supersymmetries, the
   distance between branes in some cases may be restricted by the
   collapsing cycles of the Calabi-Yau manifold. The energy of any static
   x(5)-dependent bosonic configuration vanishes, E = 0, in analogy with
   the vanishing of the hamiltonian in a closed universe.}},

Abstract = {{In Ref. 1, a new model for the description of the financial markets
   dynamics has been proposed. Traders move on a two dimensional lattice
   and interact by means of mechanisms of mutual influence. In the present
   paper, we present results from large-scale simulations of the same model
   enhanced by the introduction of rational traders modeled as
   moving-averages followers. The dynamics now accounts for log-normal
   distribution of volatility which is consistent with some observation of
   real financial indexes(7) at least for the central part of the
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Arteriovenous (AV) fistulae are well recognized as the preferred
   vascular access for hemodialysis, yet national data show that only 23\%
   of patients used an AV fistula in 1997. To identify barriers to the
   placement of native AV fistulae, the Renal Network of the Upper Midwest,
   Inc. (End-Stage Renal Disease {[}ESRD] Network 11) initiated a vascular
   access project to look at the process of referral for patients beginning
   hemodialysis in the first 6 months of 1999. Of these patients, 63\%
   began hemodialysis with a catheter as the only access, 22\% had an AV
   fistula placed (but only 14\% used an AV fistula for their first
   dialysis treatment), and 15\% began with a graft. About 40\% of patients
   were referred to a nephrologist less than 1 month before dialysis,
   allowing little chance for permanent access placement. Yet 27\% of
   patients used a catheter on the first hemodialysis treatment and were
   seen by a nephrologist more than 1 month before starting dialysis,
   indicating the presence of an opportunity to improve. At 6 months after
   initiation of dialysis, 25\% of patients who began dialysis using a
   catheter were using an AV fistula and 35\% were using a graft. Network
   11 plans to use this information to promote early referral of patients
   to a nephrologist and subsequent prompt referral of such patients to a
   vascular surgeon. Other activities to improve vascular access management

Abstract = {{Our aim was to characterize expression and mutation of beta-catenin in
   the progression of Barrett esophagus to adenocarcinoma.
   Immunohistochemical analysis of beta-catenin was performed on
   paraffin-embedded tissue from 30 cases with adenocarcinomas and
   premalignant lesions. To determine whether there is a correlation
   between beta-catenin nuclear accumulation and exon 3 mutation of this
   gene, mutational analysis by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand
   conformation polymorphism was performed on DNA extracted from the same
   30 adenocarcinomas. As a result, the prevalence of reduced expression of
   beta-catenin on the membrane, with or without nuclear staining increased
   significantly from low-grade (LG) to high-grade (HG) dysplasia. Focal
   nuclear staining for beta-catenin was present in 19 cases of
   adenocarcinoma, and nuclear staining was associated significantly with
   progression from metaplasia to LG dysplasia. In addition, in glands with
   clear histologic transition from metaplasia to LG dysplasia, nuclear
   accumulation of beta-catenin was found only in the LG dysplastic areas.
   No mutation in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene was detected in
   adenocarcinomas. These results demonstrate that disturbance of the
   APC/beta-catenin pathway, as indicated by nuclear accumulation of
   beta-catenin, is a common and early event during neoplastic progression
   in Barrett esophagus.}},

Abstract = {{Myelin-specific T lymphocytes are considered essential in the
   pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. The myelin basic protein peptide
   (a.a. 83-99) represents one candidate antigen; therefore, it was chosen
   to design an altered peptide ligand, CGP77116, for specific
   immunotherapy of multiple sclerosis. A magnetic resonance
   imaging-controlled phase II clinical trial with this altered peptide
   ligand documented that it was poorly tolerated at the dose tested, and
   the trial had therefore to be halted. Improvement or worsening of
   clinical or magnetic resonance imaging parameters could not be
   demonstrated in this small group of individuals because of the short
   treatment duration. Three patients developed exacerbations of multiple
   sclerosis, and in two this could be linked to altered peptide ligand
   treatment by immunological studies demonstrating the encephalitogenic
   potential of the myelin basic protein peptide (a.a. 83-99) in a subgroup
   of patients. These data raise important considerations for the use of
   specific immunotherapies in general.}},

Abstract = {{Anionic polymerization of N,N-dimethyl-2-methylene-3-buten-1-amine
   (5-(N,N-dimethylamino)-isoprene, DMAi) in toluene yields highly regio-
   and stereoregular polymers. The polymerization proceeds fast compared to
   non-polar dienes like butadiene or isoprene and polymers with almost
   exclusive trans-configuration are obtained. The amount of
   tuans-connected monomer units is found to rise with decreasing
   polymerization temperature and with increasing molecular weight to a
   limiting value of about 95\% at 25 kg/mol. Kinetic investigations reveal
   a polymerization behavior which does not follow simple first- or
   second-order kinetics with respect to monomer concentration.
   Poly{[}5-(N,N-dimethylamino)-isoprene] (PDMAi) synthezised in this way
   is semicrystalline with a degree of crystallinity of 55-60\%. It shows a
   broad melting interval at 70 degrees C besides a glass transition at -30
   degrees C. With the help of DSC, WAXS as well as cross-polarized light
   microscopy, the existence of two different crystal modifications is
   proven. The observed polymorphism is very similar to the one known from
   structurally related trans-polyisoprene (TPI). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A model of culture as a partially coherent system of signs comprised the
   most widely employed instrument for analyzing cultural meaning among the
   new cultural historians. However, the model failed to account for
   meanings that are produced by agents engaged in practices that are not
   guided by ``reading{''} the contrasts among signs. It also encouraged
   some analysts to conceive the difference between sign system and
   concrete practice as that between what is graspable as an intellectual
   form and what remains inaccessibly material or corporeal. This essay
   introduces three exemplars of the ties between signs and practices to
   show how the pragmatics of using signs comprises a structure and a
   generator of meaning in its own right. In the three exemplars, which are
   based on the tropes of metonymy, metaphor, and irony, I employ the
   analytic tools of linguistics to appreciate the non-discursive
   organization of practice. Analysis of the diverse logics for organizing
   practice offers promising means for investigating how signs come to seem
   experientially real for their users. Finally, this view of culture in
   practice suggests new hypotheses about the possible interdependencies as
   well as the lack of connection among the elements of a cultural setting.}},

Abstract = {{The optimization approach seems promising for the consistent
   initialization of DAEs for it can be applied to the resolution of
   over-determined or ill-conditioned algebraic consistency systems. Given
   the DAE system and all the additional constraints (feasible or not) that
   the user may impose, it must be found a set of initial conditions as
   close as possible to a consistent one. In other words, the deviation
   from the equations and constraints must be minimized in some norm. The
   choice of the optimization method is crucial for the successful
   implementation of the code. Derivative-based optimization methods and
   stochastic optimization methods are quite different techniques, with
   different drawbacks and potentialities. When combined, these strategies
   generally lead to very efficient search and optimization tools. There
   has been a growing interest in heuristic optimization methods since the
   emergence of massively parallel computers. However, the impact of such
   techniques on the dynamic simulation of chemical engineering systems -
   particularly in the initialization problem - has not been sufficiently
   studied. In several classes of important problems traditional
   optimization techniques may fail. due to either high computational cost
   or inherent limitations of gradient-type methods. A preliminary DAE
   initialization code using the optimization approach and a heuristic
   optimization algorithm, under development at PEQ/COPPE/UFRJ, is
   presented in this work. The code has been tested in some chemical
   engineering applications. Simple models frequently adopted in the DAE
   literature were used to provide a kind of benchmark for the
   initialization problem. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Because cytotrophoblastic cells (CTB) from first-trimester placenta form
   columns of invasive CTB they have been considered as a model for
   blastocyst implantation. This invasive behaviour is due to the ability
   of CTB to secret matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) because tissue
   inhibitor of MMP (TIMP) inhibits their invasiveness. Although CTB behave
   like metastatic cells, in vivo they are only transiently invasive (first
   trimester) and their invasion is normally limited only to the
   endometrium and to the proximal third of the myometrium. This temporal
   and spatial regulation of trophoblast invasion is believed to be
   mediated in an autocrine way by trophoblastic factors and in a paracrine
   way by uterine factors. Several types of regulators have been
   investigated: hormones, extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins and
   cytokines or growth factors. This review is not intended to be an
   exhaustive catalogue of all the potential regulators but is aimed at
   describing the mechanism of action of certain factors relevant in

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the risk of early death or acute myocardial
   infarction in patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass
   surgery for unstable coronary artery disease. Methods: Retrospective
   observational study of 853 patients operated on because of unstable
   coronary artery disease during 1990-1995. Results: There were 5.9\%
   deaths and 13.0\% nonfatal infarctions less than or equal to 30 days.
   These figures declined during the observation period and were 2.6\% and
   6.2\%, respectively, in 1995. The relative risk of early death or
   myocardial infarction was 50\% less during 1994-1995 than during
   1990-1991, after multivariate adjustment for several patient risk
   factors. The risk of death or infarction was almost twice as high in
   patients greater than or equal to 50 years than in those < 50 years of
   age. Multivariate analysis showed that aortic-cross-clamp time <greater
   than or equal to> 60 min, previous bypass surgery, pre-operative heart
   failure, emergency surgery, worse Braunwald class and non-use of an
   internal mammary artery graft were associated with an increased risk of
   death or infarction. Early mortality was 3.4\% (23/702) in unstable
   patients without symptoms of congestive heart failure, who were not
   operated on emergently after failed percutaneous coronary intervention
   and had not had previous cardiac surgery. Conclusions: We observed a
   marked reduction of the: risk of early death or myocardial infarction
   after surgery for unstable angina during the 6-year period 1990-1995.
   The risk reduction was not explained from operations performed on
   patients with less risk and indicates improved peri-operative patient
   management. (C)2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus woesei, is a strict anaerobe
   heterotroph that grows up to 110 degrees C. Its ferredoxin has now been
   purified to homogeneity under anaerobic conditions. P. woesei ferredoxin
   has a Mr value of 7,000 by gel electrophoresis. The Mr value was
   determined to be 14 000 and 6 500 by gel filtration in 0.2 M NaCl and
   0.5 M NaCl, respectively, suggesting that the purified protein exists as
   a dimer at lower ionic strength. Air-oxidized P! woesei ferredoxin had
   an UV-visible absorption spectra typical of 4Fe-type ferredoxins with an
   A(390)/A(280) ratio of 0.63. Its reduction potential was -360mV at room
   temperature as determined by direct electrochemistry. P. woesei
   ferredoxin showed to be extremely thermostable, being unaffected by a
   12h incubation at 95 degrees C. Interestingly, its N-terminus sequence,
   which represents approximately 1/3 of the total sequence, was determined
   to be more closely related to the sequences of extremely thermophilic
   bacterial ferredoxins (greater than or equal to 76\%) than it was to the
   sequence of a hyperthermophilic ferredoxin (56\%) isolated from an
   archaeon from the same genus, P. furiosus. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Reactive mechanical alloying (MA in H-2) of magnesium powder allowed us
   to obtain a partial conversion of Mg to MgH2. The ratio MgH2/Mg can be
   improved by increasing the milling time or by adding a 3 d-element (with
   the same initial particle size). X-ray diffraction was applied
   successfully to determine the quantity of MgH2 formed. The RMA allows us
   to eliminate the activation procedure generally requested for magnesium.
   The hydriding results from the combination of two steps: nucleation at
   first and then diffusion. A direct relationship exists between the
   nucleation duration and the specific surface area. It is demonstrated
   that RMA for a short time (2 h) is an effective way to strongly improve
   the hydrogen storage properties of both magnesium and (Mg + 10 wt.\% Co,

Title = {{Evidence for VIP1/PACAP receptors in the afferent pathway mediating

Abstract = {{1 We previously reported activation of an inhibitory adrenergic and a
   non-adrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) pathway during abdominal surgery
   relaxing the rat gastric fundus. In the present study, we investigated
   the possible role of nitric oxide (NO) and vasoactive intestinal
   polypeptide (VIP) in the NANC part of the surgery-induced fundic
   relaxation.
   2 The effect of the NO biosynthesis inhibitor N-G-nitro-L-arginine
   (L-NOARG), the non-selective VIP receptor antagonist
   {[}D-p-Cl-Phe(6),Leu(17)]-VIP and the selective VIP1 receptor antagonist
   {[}Acetyl-His(1),D-Phe(2),Lys(15),Arg(16),Leu(17)]-VIP was investigated
   on the non-adrenergic fundic relaxation induced by manipulation of the
   small intestine followed by resection of the caecum.
   3 Guanethidine partly reduced the manipulation-induced fundic
   relaxation. Addition of L-NOARG reduced this non-adrenergic component,
   whereas the non-selective VIP receptor antagonist had no significant
   effect. Combination of L-NOARG and the non-selective VIP antagonist
   however further reduced the relaxation to manipulation.
   4 The selective VIP1 receptor antagonist reduced the mean and maximal
   relaxation induced by abdominal surgery in the presence of guanethidine.
   When combined with L-NOARG, the relaxation of the gastric fundus was
   almost completely abolished. The VIP1 receptor antagonist alone had no
   significant effect on the mean and maximal relaxation, but enhanced
   recovery of fundic tone.
   5 In conclusion, as VIP1 receptors are not present in the rat gastric
   fundus, these results suggest that the NANC inhibitory pathway activated
   during abdominal surgery involves VIP1 receptors, most likely in the
   afferent limb. The inhibitory neurotransmitters released at the level of
   the gastric fundus smooth muscle are NO and a substance different from
   VIP.}},

Abstract = {{Statement of problem. Color stability, strength, and accuracy of fit are
   the main requirements for complete-ceramic crowns. The Proccra AllCeram
   crown system is a CAD/CAM system used to fabricate individual complete
   ceramic crowns that have a dry sintered, aluminum oxide core and appear
   to match clinical requirements. However, there are few articles about
   the clinical fit of all-ceramic crowns.
   Purpose. This in vivo study measured the accuracy of fit of Procera
   AllCeram crowns in anterior and posterior teeth.
   Material and methods. The clinical fit of 80 anterior and posterior
   Procera AllCeram crowns was evaluated by a replica technique with a
   light body silicone to fill space between crown and tooth and a heavy
   body silicone to stabilize the light body film. After removal from the
   artificial crowns, the replicas were segmented, and measurements of the
   film thickness were performed with a light microscope.
   Results. Medians of mean marginal gap widths were between 80 and 95 mum
   in anterior teeth and between 90 and 145 mum in posterior teeth. Medians
   of maximal marginal gap widths ranged from 80 to 180 mum in anterior
   teeth and from 115 to 245 mum in posterior teeth.
   Conclusion. The accuracy of fit achieved by Procera AllCeram was
   comparable to other conventional and innovative systems.}},

Abstract = {{Schistosomiasis mansoni is a major health problem, mainly occurring in
   developing countries. A large proportion of infected individuals suffers
   from motility-related gastrointestinal problems. In the present study
   the diffuse inflammatory response in the small bowel wall, as compared
   to the egg-induced granulomatous inflammation, was investigated. For
   this purpose, OF1 mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni 8-16 weeks
   prior to the experiment, and uninfected control mice were studied. The
   ileum showed both a diffuse mucosal inflammation as well as a
   granulomatous reaction. The diffuse mucosal inflammation caused an
   increase in the thickness of the mucosa, with blunting of the villi. A
   significant, transient increase of thickness of the muscularis propria
   after 12 weeks of infection was noted. There was an infection-related
   mast cell infiltrate in the muscularis propria, consisting of formalin
   fixation-insensitive connective tissue mast cells. Ganglionitis of the
   myenteric plexus was noted. Rarely, ganglia of the myenteric plexus
   contained apoptotic cells. A general pharmacological set of experiments
   showed a significant increase in intestinal contractility, both to
   exogenously administered, as well as to endogenously released
   neurotransmitters. Our results demonstrate that S. mansoni infection in
   the mouse ileum leads to diffuse specific enteric inflammation that is
   associated with an enhanced response to contractile agents.}},

Abstract = {{Spectrophotometric measurements were performed on intra- and/or

   peracute fatal trauma. The purpose of these measurements was to
   determine whether the visual colour impression of a fresh traumatic
   extravasation can give information on the localisation of the
   haemorrhage in a certain tissue layer. After visual assessment of the
   colour of the bruise, the spectral reflectance curves and the
   CIE-L{*}a{*}b{*} colour values were determined with the help of a diode
   array spectrophotometer. The localisation and size of the haemorrhages

   between the colour impression and the localisation of the bruise.
   Bruises localised near the surface have a more reddish appearance while
   bruises in deeper layers give a more bluish colour impression. An
   explanation may be found in the optical characteristics of skin. Blood
   localised in the subcutis appears blue on the surface due to scattering
   processes in the dermis (Rayleigh scattering), as the blue wavelengths
   of the light are scattered (and thus reflected) to a greater extent than

Abstract = {{Fish is an important food resource in Amazonian aquatic ecosystems.
   There is a strong cultural background regarding fish consumption (fish
   lore) among indigenous people in the Amazon. Mercury (Hg) ingestion
   through fish consumption has been a major route of Hg exposure among the
   riverside people along the Upper Madeira River. In this paper a diet
   questionnaire was used to identify patterns of fish consumption. The
   amount of fish consumed during the dry season and Hg levels in fish were
   combined to estimate Hg ingestion. Using as guidance hair Hg levels
   below 5 and 10 ppm as acceptable to protect the fetus and adult,
   respectively, along with an average daily fish consumption of 243 g per
   capita, we estimated the maximum acceptable number of fish meals per
   week for different fish species. Based on this analysis, it is suggested
   that there is a need to address risk communication for this exposed
   population in the context of health in terms of a fish advisory. For the
   fish advisory it is necessary to recommend to fish consumers, fishermen,
   and fish sellers an acceptable number of fish meals to be consumed

Abstract = {{I introduce a family of closeness functions between causal Lorentzian
   geometries of finite volume and arbitrary underlying topology. When
   points are randomly scattered in a Lorentzian manifold, with uniform
   density according to the volume element, some information on the
   topology and metric is encoded in the partial order that the causal
   structure induces among those points; one can then define closeness
   between Lorentzian geometries by comparing the sets of probabilities
   they give for obtaining the same posets. If the density of points is
   finite, one gets a pseudo-distance, which only compares the manifolds
   down to a finite volume scale, as illustrated here by a fully worked out
   example of two two-dimensional manifolds of different topology; if the
   density is allowed to become infinite, a true distance can be defined on
   the space of all Lorentzian geometries. The introductory and concluding
   sections include some remarks on the motivation for this definition and
   its applications to quantum gravity. (C) 2000 American Institute of

   differences between groups are acknowledged and respected at the same
   time that similarities are recognized and valued, board operations are
   more likely to be successful and focused on providing effective
   services. The case descriptions included here suggest that an
   organization's ability to manage the tension between intergroup
   differences and similarities is influenced by (a) organizational history
   of intergroup relations, (b) group identification, and (c)
   organizational practices that bridge group differences. Action

Abstract = {{Potential effects of earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris L.) inoculated
   into soil on fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were investigated for an
   untreated and a limed soil under beech in open topsoil columns under
   field conditions for 120 days. Gas fluxes from L. terrestris, beech
   litter and mineral soil from soil columns were measured separately in
   jars at 17 degreesC. The inoculation with L. terrestris and the
   application of lime had no effect on cumulative CO2 emissions from soil.
   During the first 3-4 weeks earthworms significantly (P<0.05) increased
   CO2 emissions by 16\% to 28\%. In contrast, significantly lower (P<0.05)
   CO2 emission rates were measured after 11 weeks. The data suggest that
   earthworm activity was high during the first weeks due to the creation
   of burrows and incorporation of beech litter into the mineral soil. Low
   cumulative CH4 oxidation rates were found in all soil columns as a
   result of CH4 production and oxidation processes. L. terrestris with
   fresh feces and the beech litter produced CH4 during the laboratory
   incubation, whereas the mineral soil oxidised atmospheric CH4.
   Inoculation with L. terrestris led to a significant reduction (P<0.02)
   in the CH4 oxidation rate of soil, i.e. 53\% reduction. Liming had no
   effect on cumulative CH4 oxidation rates of soil columns and on CH4
   fluxes during the laboratory incubation. L. terrestris significantly
   increased (P<0.001) cumulative N2O emissions of unlimed soil columns by
   57\%. The separate incubation of L. terrestris with fresh feces resulted
   in rather high N2O emissions, but the rate strongly decreased from 54 to
   2 mug N kg(-1) (dry weight) h(-1) during the 100 h of incubation. Liming
   had a marked effect on N2O formation and significantly (P<0.001) reduced
   cumulative N2O emissions by 34\%. Although the interaction of liming and
   L. terrestris was not significant, N2O emissions of limed soil columns
   with L. terrestris were 8\% lower than those of the control.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction At a time when a great number of diseases can be prevented
   by changing one's habits and life style, investigations have focused on
   understanding what adults and children believe to be desirable health
   practices and uncovering the factors associated with successful
   adherence to such practices. For these, causal attributions for health
   and illness were investigated among 96 Brazilian elementary school
   students.
   Methods Ninety six subjects, aged 6 to 14, were interviewed individually
   and their causal attributions were assessed through 14 true-false items
   (e.g. people stay well {[}healthy] because they are lucky). The
   relationship between the children's causal attributions and demographic
   characteristics were also examined.
   Results Overall, the results were consistent with previous researches.
   ``Taking care of oneself{''} was considered the most important cause of
   good health. ``Viruses and germs{''} and ``lack of self-care{''} were
   the most selected causes of illness. Analyses revealed significant
   relationship between subjects' causal attribution and their age, school
   grade level, socioeconomic status and gender.
   Conclusions The study findings suggest that there may be more
   cross-cultural similarities than differences in children's causal
   attributions for health and illness. Finding ways to help individuals
   engage in appropriate preventive-maintenance health practices without
   developing an exaggerated notion that the individuals can control their
   own health and illness is a challenge which remains to be addressed by
   further research.}},

Abstract = {{The response of the male tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) to
   conspecific whines of different frequencies was examined. In the first
   series of playback experiments (fixed frequency), three types of
   synthetic stimuli were used, corresponding to calls of high frequency
   (HFF; (x) over bar + 2 SD), mid-frequency (MFF; (x) over bar), and low
   frequency (LFF; (x) over bar - 2 SD) for the study population. In the
   second series of interactive playback experiments (relative frequency),
   whines of frequency relative to that of the male subject were used: male
   frequency + 2 SD (HRF), male frequency (MRF), and male frequency -2SD
   (LRF). In the fixed frequency experiments, male vocal response did not
   vary among treatments. However, in the relative frequency experiments,
   males responded with more whines, and above all, with more chucks, to
   stimuli of similar or higher frequency than to stimuli of lower
   frequency than their own. In other words, male vocal competition
   escalates when competitors have whines with similar or relatively higher
   frequencies to their own, but does not increase when competitors have
   call frequencies that are at the mean or higher for the population. This
   differential response might result from competition between males of
   different sizes, since the frequency of the whine and male size is
   significantly correlated.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have reported ischemia protection using various

   to global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, and to the combination of both
   3-NPA-pretreatment and subsequent global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.
   Brain homogenates of adult Wistar rats (n = 25) were analyzed for bcl-2

   Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Animals for mRNA analysis received
   3-NPA (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal; ``chemical preconditioning{''}) or
   vehicle (normal saline), and were either observed for 24 plus 3 hours or
   were subjected to 15 minutes of global cerebral ischemia 24 hours after
   the pretreatment and observed for 3 hours of reperfusion.
   Immunohistochemistry was applied to serial brain sections of additional
   rats (n = 68) to determine amount and localization of the respective
   Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression in various brain areas. One set of
   animals was injected with 3-NPA and observed for 3, 12, 24, and 96
   hours; a second set was exposed to 15 minutes global cerebral ischemia,
   3, 12, and 24 hours reperfusion; and a third set was pretreated with
   3-NPA or saline 24 hours before the ischemic brain insult and observed
   for 96 hours of reperfusion. The authors found single dose 3-NPA
   treatment to be associated with an elevated bcl-2:bax ratio (increased
   bcl-2 expression, decreased bax expression), both on the transcriptional
   (mRNA) and the translational (protein) level. The differential influence
   of 3-NPA was maintained during early recovery from global cerebral
   ischemia (3 hours), when 3-NPA pretreated animals showed higher bcl-2
   and lower bax mRNA levels compared with rats with saline treatment.
   Respective changes in protein expression were localized predominately in
   neurons vulnerable to ischemic damage. Compared with baseline, Bcl-2
   protein was significantly higher in surviving neurons at 96 hours after
   the insult, whereas Bax protein remained unchanged. However, at this
   late time of postischemic recovery (96 hours), the protein expression
   pat tern of surviving neurons was not different between animals with and
   without 3-NPA pretreatment. To the authors' knowledge, the current study
   is the first report on the differential expression of pro- and
   antiapoptotic genes after a single, nonlethal dose of 3-NPA. The current
   results suggest alterations in the balance between pro- and
   antiapoptotic proteins as a potential explanation for the reported
   protection provided by chemical preconditioning using 3-NPA in rats.}},

   process, in addition to the two processes already known. In this respect
   the relaxational behavior of ethanol resembles that of other primary
   alcohols. The relaxation time of this process exhibits strong deviations
   from thermally activated behavior. Most important, this process is the
   cause of the apparent excess wing, which was claimed to be present in
   the dielectric loss spectra of glass-forming ethanol. In addition,
   marked deviations of the spectra of ethanol from the scaling proposed by
   Dixon and Nagel have been detected.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed measurements of soil moisture and ET in semiarid forest
   environments have not been widely reported in the literature. In this
   study, soil moisture and water balance components were measured over a
   four-year period on a semiarid ponderosa pine hillslope, with
   evapotranspiration (ET) determined as the residual of measured
   precipitation, runoff, and change in soil moisture storage. ET accounts
   for approximately 95 percent of the water budget and has a distinctly
   bimodal annual pattern, with peaks occurring after spring snowmelt and
   during the late summer monsoon season, periods that coincide with high
   soil moisture. Weekly growing season ET rates determined by the
   hillslope water balance are found to be invariably below calculated
   potential rates. Normalized ET rates are linearly correlated (r(2) =
   0.62) with soil moisture; therefore, a simple linear relation is
   proposed. Growing season soil moisture dynamics were modeled based on
   this relation. Results are in fair agreement (r(2) = 0.63) with the
   observed soil moisture data over the four growing seasons; however, for
   two dry summers with little surface runoff, much better results (r(2) >
   0.90) were obtained.}},

Abstract = {{In luminescence and ESR studies, a systematic underestimate of the

   when there is significant variation of the natural dose within the

   explicitly for a material that exhibits a single-saturating-exponential
   growth of signal with dose. The result is valid for any geometry (e.g. a
   plain layer, spherical grain, etc.) and some illustrative cases are
   modelled, with the age bias exceeding 10\% in extreme cases. If the dose
   distribution within the sample can be modelled accurately, it is
   possible to correct for the bias in the estimates of equivalent dose
   estimate and age. While quantifying the effect would be more difficult,
   similar systematic biases in dose and age estimates are likely in other
   situations more complex than the one modelled. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

   lower Brody growth coefficients and larger asymptotic lengths than Dover
   sole from other areas. Further; there was an apparent latitudinal dine
   in maturation rates because males and females matured at smaller size
   and younger ages at higher latitudes. In contrast, no difference between
   male and female length-weight relationships was detected. In comparison
   with other pleuronectids, we found that Dover sole matured at relatively

Abstract = {{Objectives: To assess the feasibility of patient recruitment, the
   ability of patients and clinicians to comply with study protocols, and
   the use of data collection instruments to collect cost-effectiveness
   data, and to obtain variability estimates for sample-size calculations
   for a full-scale trial.
   Study Design: Prospective, observer-blinded, pilot randomized clinical
   trial.
   Setting: Primary contact chiropractic and medical clinics.
   Patients: Ages 20 to 65 years, with low back-related radiating leg pain
   (sciatica).
   Outcome Measures: Self-report questionnaires were administered at
   baseline and 3 and 12 weeks after randomization. The measures included
   leg and back pain severity, frequency and bothersomeness of symptoms,
   leg/back disability, medication use, global improvement, satisfaction
   and health care utilization.
   Interventions: Medical care, chiropractic care, and epidural steroid
   injections.
   Results: A total of 706 persons were screened by phone to deter mine
   initial eligibility. Of these, over 90\% of those persons contacted did
   not meet the entrance criteria. The most common reason for
   disqualification was that the duration of the complaint was longer than
   3 months. Twenty patients were randomized into the study. All 3 groups
   showed substantial improvements in the main patient-rated outcomes at
   the end of the 12-week intervention phase. For leg pain, back pain,
   frequency and bothersomeness of leg symptoms, and Roland-Morris
   disability score, the percent improvement varied from 50\% to 84\%, and
   the corresponding effect sizes ranged from 0.8 to 2.2. Bothersomeness of
   leg symptoms was the most responsive outcome associated with the largest
   magnitude of effect size. All within-group changes from baseline were
   statistically significant (P <.01). No between-group comparisons were
   planned or performed because of the insufficient sample size and high
   risk of committing type I and type II errors.
   Conclusions: Pilot studies such as these are important for the
   determination of the feasibility of conducting costly, larger scale
   trials. Recruitment for a full-scale study of sciatica of 1 to 12 weeks
   duration is not feasible, given the methods used in this pilot study.
   Our results do indicate, however, that there are substantial numbers of
   patients with sciatica more chronic in nature who would be interested in
   participating in a similar study. In addition, collaboration with a
   local health maintenance organization would likely facilitate clinician
   referrals and optimize the recruitment process. Patient and provider
   compliance was high in the pilot study, which indicates that most study
   protocols are feasible. Additionally, we were able to collect complete
   outcomes data, including those regarding health care use. A suggested
   modification by investigators and outside consultants has resulted in
   the replacement of the medication group with a minimal intervention
   control group tie, self-care advice). As a result, a second pilot study
   of patients with sciatica of more than 1 weeks duration has been planned
   before a full-scale trial is attempted.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. Silicone gel breast implants have been reported to rupture,
   but the prevalence of implant rupture in an unreferred population of
   women is not known. The objective of this study was to assess the
   prevalence of implant rupture and the presence of extracapsular silicone
   gel in an unreferred population of women without regard to the absence
   or presence of any local or systemic symptoms.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Women identified as part of a National Cancer
   Institute cohort study on breast implants, living in the Birmingham, AL,
   area were invited to undergo MR imaging of their current silicone gel
   breast implants at the Kirl;lin Clinic at the University of Alabama at
   Birmingham. Three radiologists independently examined and rated all MR
   images for signs of implant rupture and extracapsular silicone.
   RESULTS. A total of 344 women with silicone gel boast implants underwent
   MR imaging. Breast implant rupture was reported by at least two of three
   radiologists for 378 (55.0\%) of the 687 implants in this study. Another
   50 implants (7.2\%) were rated as indeterminate (suspicious) for
   rupture. A majority of women in this study, 265 (77.0\%) of 344, had at
   least one breast implant that was rated as ruptured or indeterminate.
   Radiologists also agreed that silicone gel could be seen outside the
   fibrous capsule that forms around the: implant in 85 (12.4\%) of the 687
   implants affecting 73 women (21.2\%). Factors that affected implant
   rupture were implant age and location (submuscular or subglandular). The
   median implant age at rupture was estimated to be 10.8 years with a 95\%
   confidence interval of 8.4-13.9 years.
   CONCLUSION. The prevalence of silent or occult silicone gel boast
   implant rupture is higher than was previously suspected. Most women in
   this study had MR imaging evidence of at least one ruptured silicone gel
   breast implant.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To determine the prevalence of myocardial perfusion
   abnormalities in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) using
   single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) dual isotope
   myocardial perfusion imaging (DIMPI).
   Methods, Consecutive female patients registered at the University of
   Toronto Lupus Clinic were offered DIMPI evaluation and all who accepted
   were studied. Patients underwent SPECT DIMPI using dipyridamole stress.
   Resting and stress images were acquired using thallium-201 ((TI)-T-201)
   and technetium 99m-sestamibi (Tc-99m sestamibi), respectively. We
   recorded segmental perfusion abnormalities, severity and reversibility
   of any abnormality, and number of vessel territories involved. Ejection
   fraction was also measured.
   Results. One hundred thirty patients were studied. Mean (SD) age and
   disease duration at study were 45.1 (11.1) years and 14.6 (9.4) years,
   respectively. Thirteen patients (10\%) had a history of angina pectoris
   or myocardial infarction. Overall, 52 (40\%) patients had an abnormality
   of myocardial perfusion, including 11 (85\%) with a history of angina or
   myocardial infarction. In those with no history of coronary artery
   disease, 41 (35\%) had an abnormality detected. The perfusion defect was
   reversible in 47 (90\%). In 37 (71\%) cases perfusion defects were seen
   in the region of a single vessel territory. Eighteen (13.8\%) patients
   had an ejection fraction (EF) < 50\%.
   Conclusion, Using SPECT DIMPI, 40\% of all women with SLE and 35\% of
   women with SLE with no history of coronary artery disease had
   abnormalities of myocardial perfusion, suggesting a high prevalence of
   early coronary artery disease. The early detection of disease will
   facilitate study of atherosclerotic risk factors; such women can also be
   targeted for a focused program of risk factor management.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reconstruction of first-pass bolus information
   to derive regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps is commonly
   performed in many centers; however, various protocols with different
   doses of paramagnetic contrast injections have been reported. We
   evaluated the dose dependency of rCBV maps in a brain tumor population
   by using three different doses of gadodiamide injection to evaluate
   their diagnostic accuracy in blinded reader sessions.
   METHODS: Eighty-three patients with intraaxial brain tumors (72 gliomas)
   were studied at three centers and randomized to receive a bolus
   injection of 0,1, 0,2, or 0.3 mmol/kg per body weight of gadodiamide.
   rCBV maps were generated from T2{*}-weighted gradient-echo echo-planar
   sequences at 1.5 T, Data processing was performed according to the
   indicator dilution theory.
   RESULTS: The mean contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was significantly
   different between gadodiamide doses of 0.1 and 0.2 mmol/kg (CNR = 8.7
   and 15.7) and between 0.1 and 0.3 mmol/kg (CNR = 17,7), No significant
   difference was found between doses of 0.2 and 0.3 mmol/kg, Sensitivity
   for the differentiation of benign and malignant brain tumors was 80\%,
   95\%, and 91\%, and specificity was 45\%, 54\%, and 43\% by blinded
   readings at 0,1, 0,2, and 0.3 mmol/kg, respectively, as compared with
   histologic findings. Nonblinded readings had a sensitivity of 83\%,
   100\%, and 90\% and a specificity of 82\%, 100\%, and 73\% at 0,1, 0,2,
   and 0.3 mmol/kg, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: A dose of 0.2 mmol/kg of gadodiamide is recommended for
   reconstruction of rCBV maps if data are acquired with the T2{*}-weighted
   protocol described.}},

Title = {{Classifying clinical decision making: interpreting nursing intuition,

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{990-998}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This is the second of two linked papers exploring decision making in
   nursing. The first paper, `Classifying clinical decision making: a
   unifying approach' investigated difficulties with applying a range of
   decision-making theories to nursing practice. This is due to the
   diversity of terminology and theoretical concepts used, which militate
   against nurses being able to compare the outcomes of decisions analysed
   within different frameworks. It is therefore problematic for nurses to
   assess how good their decisions are, and where improvements can be made.
   However, despite the range of nomenclature, it was argued that there are
   underlying similarities between all theories of decision processes and
   that these should be exposed through integration within a single
   explanatory framework. A proposed solution was to use a general model of
   psychological classification to clarify and compare terms, concepts and
   processes identified across the different theories. The unifying
   framework of classification was described and this paper operationalizes
   it to demonstrate how different approaches to clinical decision making
   can be re-interpreted as classification behaviour, Particular attention
   is focused on classification in nursing, and on re-evaluating heuristic
   reasoning, which has been particularly prone to theoretical and
   terminological confusion. Demonstrating similarities in how different
   disciplines make decisions should promote improved multidisciplinary
   collaboration and a weakening of clinical elitism, thereby enhancing
   organizational effectiveness in health care and nurses' professional
   status. This is particularly important as nurses' roles continue to
   expand to embrace elements of managerial, medical and therapeutic work.
   analysing nurses' decisions as classification behaviour will also
   enhance clinical effectiveness, and assist in making nurses' expertise
   more visible, In addition, the classification framework explodes the
   myth that intuition, traditionally associated with nurses' decision
   making, is less rational and scientific than other approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Brachychiton populneus (Sterculiaceae) (Schott et Endl.) R. Br.
   (kurrajong) is a small tree that occurs naturally ranging from southern
   Queensland to Victoria. It has been widely planted as an ornamental tree
   in south-western Australia. In Kings Park, B. populneus has moved from
   cultivation to become a weed in the adjoining bushland reserve. The aim
   of this study was to examine the ecology of B. populneus and the Kings
   Park environment in order to identify the particular conjunction of
   characteristics that have led to the species becoming a weed. The
   highest density of kurrajongs (69.3 trees ha(-1)) was observed in the
   most disturbed area of Kings Park, and there was a strong relationship
   between density of B. populneus and disturbance (P = 0.058). The most
   striking feature of the invasion was the tendency of B. populneus to
   occur beneath other tree species, and this was attributed to birds
   feeding on transported fruit in trees and rats building seed caches at
   their base. Mature trees produced large amounts of viable seed, but
   rates of seed predation were high. Weevils, beetle larvae and omnivorous
   vertebrates such as Australian ravens, magpies and introduced black rats
   were observed eating seeds. The foraging behaviour of the vertebrates
   may facilitate the dispersal of seeds for relatively long distances away
   from parent plants. Seeds that escape predation form a transient seed
   bank and germinate with the onset of the winter rains. Early in their
   development, seedlings allocate resources to form a large tap-rooted
   tuber that has substantial starch and water reserves, allowing seedlings
   to survive the long dry and hot summers in Perth. The study observed
   that B. populneus could survive at least one fire by resprouting from
   basal dormant buds. Brachychiton populneus appears to have become a weed
   in Kings Park because, first, it is dispersed widely into new sites
   through the foraging behaviour of vertebrates and once germinated has no
   grazing pressure, and, second, its development of a root tuber and
   ability to resprout means the seedlings are resilient in this frequently
   disturbed Mediterranean environment. While management of existing plants
   is relatively straightforward, continued vigilance will be required to
   avoid reinvasion.}},

Abstract = {{Micronemes are secretory organelles of the invasive stages of
   apicomplexan parasites and contain proteins that are important for
   parasite motility and host cell invasion. We have examined the induction
   of microneme secretion in the coccidian Eimeria tenella. When
   sporozoites were added to MDBK cells in culture, microneme proteins were
   secreted, capped backwards over the parasite surface and deposited onto
   underlying host cells from the posterior end of gliding parasites.
   Induction of secretion was also achieved by the addition of foetal calf
   serum, or purified albumin, to extracellular sporozoites. Microneme
   secretion per se was not dependent on parasites being able to move or to
   invade host cells. However, in the presence of cytochalasin D, which
   disrupts actin polymerisation and prevents parasite movement, microneme
   proteins were secreted from the apical tip but were not capped backwards
   over the sporozoite surface. These observations support the hypothesis
   that microneme proteins function as ligands which, when secreted out
   onto the parasite surface, form a link, either directly or indirectly,
   between the sub-pellicular actin-myosin cytoskeletal motor of the
   parasite and the surface of target host cells. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{In the preceding article, we demonstrated that activation of the
   hepatoportal glucose sensor led to a paradoxical development of
   hypoglycemia that was associated with increased glucose utilization by a
   subset of tissues. In this study, we tested whether GLUT2 plays a role
   in the portal glucose-sensing system that is similar to its involvement
   in pancreatic beta-cells, Awake RIPGLUT1 x GLUT2(-/-) and control mice
   were infused with glucose through the portal (Po-) or the femoral (Fe-)
   vein for 3 h at a rate equivalent to the endogenous glucose production
   rate. Blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations were continuously
   monitored, Glucose turnover, glycolysis and glycogen synthesis rates
   were determined by the H-3-glucose infusion technique. We showed that
   portal glucose infusion in RIPGLUT1 x GLUT2(-/-) mice did not induce the
   hypoglycemia observed in control mice but, in contrast, led to a
   transient hyperglycemic state followed by a return to normoglycemia;
   this glycemic pattern was similar to that observed in control Fe-mice
   and RIPGLUT1 x GLUT2(-/-) Fe-mice, Plasma insulin profiles during the
   infusion period were similar in control and RIPGLUT1 x GLUT2(-/-) Po-
   and Fe-mice. The lack of hypoglycemia development in RIPGLUT1 x
   GLUT2(-/-) mice was not due to the absence of GLUTS in the liver,
   Indeed, reexpression by transgenesis of this transporter in hepatocytes
   did not restore the development of hypoglycemia after initiating portal
   vein glucose infusion. In the absence of GLUTS, glucose turnover
   increased in Po-mice to the same extent as that in RIPGLUT1 x GLUT2-/-
   or control Fe-mice, Finally, co-infusion of somatostatin with glucose
   prevented development of hypoglycemia in control Po-mice, but it did not
   affect the glycemia or insulinemia of RIPGLUT1 x GLUT2(-/-) Po-mice,
   Together, our data demonstrate that GLUTS is required for the function
   of the hepatoportal glucose sensor and that somatostatin could inhibit
   the glucose signal by interfering with GLUTS-expressing sensing units.}},

Title = {{Foreign and chimeric external scaffolding proteins as inhibitors of
   Microviridae morphogenesis}},

Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{9347-9352}},

Abstract = {{Viral assembly is an ideal system in which to investigate the transient
   recognition and interplay between proteins. During morphogenesis,
   scaffolding proteins temporarily associate with structural proteins,
   stimulating conformational changes that promote assembly and inhibit
   off-pathway reactions. Microviridae morphogenesis is dependent on two
   scaffolding proteins, an internal and an external species. The external
   scaffolding protein is the most conserved protein within the
   Microviridae, whose canonical members are phi X174, G4, and alpha 3.
   However, despite 70\% homology on the amino acid level, overexpression
   of a foreign Microviridae external scaffolding protein is a potent
   cross-species inhibitor of morphogenesis. Mutants that are resistant to
   the expression of a foreign scaffolding protein cannot be obtained via
   one mutational step. To define the requirements for and constraints on
   scaffolding protein interactions, chimeric external scaffolding proteins
   have been constructed and analyzed for effects on in vivo assembly. The
   results of these experiments suggest that at least two cross-species
   inhibitory domains exist within these proteins; one domain most likely
   blocks procapsid formation, and the other allows procapsid assembly but
   blocks DNA packaging. A mutation conferring resistance to the expression
   of a chimeric protein (chiD(r)) that inhibits DNA packaging was
   isolated. The mutation maps to gene A, which encodes a protein essential
   for packaging. The chiD(r) mutation confers resistance only to a
   chimeric D protein; the mutant is still inhibited by the expression of
   foreign D proteins. The results presented here demonstrate how closely
   related proteins could be developed into antiviral agents that
   specifically target virion morphogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Aims and objectives: Many agents have been used in treatment of dentinal
   hypersensitivity in the past, but dentine bonding systems have recently
   been suggested as being effective. This study examined the effectiveness
   of a dentine bonding system in the treatment of dentinal
   hypersensitivity in dental practice conditions. Methods: Dentists in two
   dental practices agreed to carry out the project. One practice was in
   the UK, the other in India. A total of 34 patients who were diagnosed to
   have dentinal hypersensitivity were treated using the dentine bonding
   system. Patients were requested to record their perception of their pain
   on a 100mm linear scale, pre-treatment, one day and one week
   post-treatment. Results: All patients experienced relief of pain, both 1
   day and 1 week after treatment. Profile plots of the patients' perceived
   pain scores for the two practices separately indicated that there was a
   general trend across both practices for these to fall quite sharply one
   day after treatment and then generally level out one week
   post-treatment. There was evidence indicating a possible difference in
   pain perception in the two communities from which the patients were
   drawn. Conclusion: The dentine bonding system evaluated was successful
   in reducing the pain of dentinal hypersensitivity, at least in the short
   term.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperosmotic stress severely affects plant growth and development. To

   reporter gene. Moreover, the mRNA abundance of these cell cycle genes as
   well as CDC2bAt were monitored during salt stress, Upon NaCl treatment,
   the promoter activities and transcript levels of all cell cycle genes
   diminished initially in the shoot apex and were subsequently induced
   during salt-stress adaptation. Additionally, the promoter activities of
   CDC2aAt and CycA2;1 decreased in the vascular cylinder of the root in
   correlation with reduced lateral root formation. In the root tips, a
   regression of CDC2aAt, CycA2;1, and CycB1;1:gus expression was observed,
   concomitant with a shrinkage of the root meristem and inhibition of root
   growth. Our data indicate that salt stress interferes with cell cycle

Abstract = {{It has been proposed that the hippocampal formation is necessary for the
   acquisition of tasks that require the use of configural representations
   for their solution, including spatial learning and negative patterning.
   Tests of this influential view have, however, yielded conflicting
   results. For example fornix or hippocampal lesions, which reliably
   impair spatial learning, do not reliably impair negative patterning. A
   problem in interpreting these results has been the lack of controls for
   factors such as over-responding, excitatory effects of reward, and the
   possibility of non-configural solutions. At the same time, other studies
   have pointed to a role in configural learning for parahippocampal
   regions such as the perirhinal cortex. The present experiments
   controlled for the above factors and revealed that neither lesions of
   the fornix nor of the perirhinal/postrhinal cortex in the rat had any
   effect on negative patterning, although subsequent tests of object and
   spatial memory demonstrated the functional efficacy of the lesions.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of
   freezing mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) components at
   higher cell concentrations than are classically recommended for bone
   marrow. This approach might have potential benefits, such as lower cost
   of processing and storage and less risk of the complications associated
   with the transfusion of large component volumes and large quantities of
   DMSO.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In the first phase, small aliquots of 19
   apheresis components were cryopreserved at standard and higher cell
   concentrations (Aliquots A and B, respectively). In the second phase, 21
   apheresis components were split into two bags each and frozen at
   standard (Bag A) and high (Bag B) cell concentrations. The differences
   in viability, cloning efficiency, and nucleated cell recovery in Bags A
   and B were examined. Finally, the hematologic recovery of 10 patients
   who underwent autologous transplantation with PBPC components frozen at
   high cell concentrations was analyzed.
   RESULTS: The median cell concentration at freezing was 94 (57-100) x
   10(6) per mL and 291 (220-467) x 10(6) per mi for Aliquots A and B,
   respectively, and 90.9 (45.4-92) x 10(6) per mi and 332 (171-582) x
   10(6) per mt for Bags A and B, respectively. The viability was
   significantly lower in samples frozen at higher cell concentrations: 92
   versus 83 percent (p = 0.001) and 87 versus 77 percent (p<0.001) for
   Aliquots and Bags A and B, respectively. Significant differences were
   not observed in the recovery of total nucleated cells (102 vs. 101\% and
   98 vs. 105\%) or the cloning efficiency after thawing (13 vs. 16\% and
   27 vs. 23\%) for Aliquots and Bags A and B, respectively. The time to
   granulocyte engraftment greater than or equal to 0.5 x 10(9) per L and
   platelet engraftment greater than or equal to 20 x 10(9) per L was 9
   (8-11) and 10.5 (7-21) days, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: The cryopreservation of PBPC components at standard
   concentrations and 3.3 (1.8-6.2)-fold cell concentrations has no adverse

Abstract = {{Serum from 115 HIV negative renal transplant recipients having more than
   6 months follow-up was tested for the presence of mono- or oligoclonal
   immunoglobulins (molg) by immunoelectrophoresis or immunofixation.
   Mono/oligoclonal gammapathy was detected in 16 patients (13.9 \%). Eight
   of these patients had only one monoclonal band, whereas the other eight
   had two or more bands. Thirteen of the 16 patients (81.3\%) were IgG
   kappa positive, nine (56.3\%) were IgG lambda positive, four (25.0\%)
   were IgM lambda positive and only one (6.3\%) was IgM kappa positive.
   Six monoclonal patients (37.5\%) were IgG kappa positive and two
   monoclonal patients (12.5\%) were IgG lambda positive. The oligoclonal
   combination IgG kappa lambda was present in three patients (18.8\%), the
   combination IgG lambda +IgM lambda was present in two patients (12.5\%)
   and IgG lambda +IgM lambda was present in one patient. The triple
   combination IgM kappa lambda +IgG kappa lambda and IgM lambda +IgG kappa
   lambda was found in two patients (12.5\%). Ninety percent of these molg
   did not exceed 2 g/L. Molg appeared between 1 acid 28 months after the
   kidney transplantation (mean value:8.5 5.9 months) but were often
   transient, disappearing within 1 to 19 months in 13 patients (81.3\%).
   Nine of the 16 cases (56.3\%) disappeared before the end of the first
   year after detection. Risk factors for the appearance of these
   immunoglobulins have been identified as: the patient's age, the duration
   of haemodialysis, the occurrence of prior (anti-cytomegalovirus {[}CMV])
   infection, and therapy with cyclosporin A (CsA). The persistence of
   monoclonal gammapathy was associated with acute or reactivated
   Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and inability to convert IgM to IgG
   CMV antibodies. Futhermore, no association was established with previous
   hepatitis B or C infection or the number of rejection episodes. Kaposi's
   sarcoma was found in one patient (6.3\%) but had no correlation with the
   presence of molg. We recommend carefull follow up of renal transplant
   patients in whom molg have been discovered. (C) 2000 Editions

Abstract = {{Four multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows fitted with simple cannulas in
   the proximal duodenum and the rumen were offered four diets in a 4 X 4
   Latin-square design to evaluate the effect on energy and nitrogen
   balance of crop maturity of maize when offered as ensiled food with
   grass silage and a concentrate. Forage maize (cv. Hudson) tons ensiled
   at target dry matter (DM) contents of 230, 280, 330 and 380 g per kg
   fresh weight (FW). The mean values for volatile corrected DM (VCDM) and
   starch content of the maize for ages as given were 226, 278, 319 and 357
   g/kg FW and 180, 263, 327 and 401 g/kg VCDM respectively. Grass silage
   (GS) containing 247 g VCDM per kg FW was produced from the primary
   growth of a perennial ryegrass sword. The diets comprised 8.7 kg DM
   concentrate per day with one of four forage treatments offered ad
   libitum, in a 3 : 1 DIM ratio of maize silage with GS, designated T23,
   T28, T33 and T38. Each period was of 6 weeks with energy and nitrogen
   balances conducted zn respiration chambers over 6 days in either week 5
   or 6. There were no significant effects of maturity on DM intake.
   Changes in milk yield and composition were not significant but milk
   protein yield increased significantly (P < 0.05) with maize maturity up
   to T33 and was linearly related (P < 0.05) to changes in maize silage
   starch and neutral- and acid-detergent fibre (NDF, ADF) content. Total
   starch intake increased significantly (P < 0.01) with maturity but
   apparent digestibility of starch was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced
   only with the most mature maize silage (T38). NDF and ADF intake and
   amounts digested were not significantly different despite a numerical
   dl:cline with stage of maturity Total nitrogen intake and apparent
   digestibility were not significantly different although there were
   significant differences(P < 0.05) in the amount of nitrogen excreted as
   urine, which was greatest on T23 and least on T33, and milk which was
   least on T23 and greatest on T33. Mean gross energy (GE) intake
   increased by 17 MJ/day from T23 to T33 but the differences were
   non-significant. Faecal energy output on T23 was significantly lower (P
   < 0.05) than the other treatments whilst urine energy on T23 was
   significantly higher (P < 0.05) compared with T33. Methane energy losses
   were not significantly different. There were no significant differences
   between treatments in either GE digestibility or metabolizability,
   digestible or metabolizable energy (ME) intakes or in the partition of
   ME to heat, tissue or milk. The calculated ME concentrations of the
   maize silages were not significantly different with an overall mean of
   12.3 MJ/kg VCDM estimated at maintenance intake, or 0.63 MJ/MJ GE.
   Changes in maize silage composition resulted in a doubling of the ratio
   of digested starch to digested NDF (0.66, 0.94, 1.10 and 1.21) for
   treatments T23 to T38 respectively Despite this large change in digested
   nutrients no differences in the efficiency of energy utilization were
   detected.}},

   spectacularly modified by techniques of assisted ventilation. High
   resolution ultrasonography permits visualization of fetal cerebral
   anomalies, the treatment of hypoxic encephalopathy is advancing as is
   non-invasive cerebral hemodynamic monitoring. Neuroimaging techniques
   let us see not only the structure of the brain but also how it
   functions, to some extent. New antiepileptic drugs have appeared.
   Various treatable causes of neonatal convulsions have been identified.
   Infections and the incidence of hemorrhage in premature babies have
   fallen at the same time as new metabolic disease of neonatal onset
   (protein glycosilation, folinic-sensitive convulsions and
   adenylsuccinate deficiency) have been identified Ethics committees for
   consensual decisions in neonatal intensive cave units have become
   established. We emphasize the need for units for the follow-up of
   newborn babies with a risk of developing neurological complications,

Title = {{Measuring the appropriateness of long-term prescribing in United Kingdom
   general practice - is the British National Formulary the `Gold
   Standard'?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY AND THERAPEUTICS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{341-346}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: The British National Formulary (BNF) is an independent
   professional publication which is highly respected and widely used by
   health care professionals in the U.K. In addition, it has been
   translated into several languages for use outside the U.K. A set of
   prescribing indicators has been developed to assess the appropriateness
   of long-term prescribing in U.K. general practice, using the BNF as the
   `gold standard'.
   Objectives: The objective of this paper is to gain an understanding of
   why GPs may prescribe outside the recommendations given in the BNF.
   Methods: Twenty-two GPs were interviewed about a range of instances of
   potentially inappropriate prescribing for 101 patients under their care.
   These cases had been identified through the application of a set of
   prescribing indicators to the medical records of individual patients.
   The interview transcripts were repeatedly reviewed to identify cases
   where the GP felt that his/her prescribing was appropriate, even though
   it did not adhere to the guidance in the BNF.
   Results: The indicators which looked at total daily dose, recording of a
   valid indication, prescribing drugs of limited clinical value, generic
   prescribing and use of a potentially hazardous drug-drug combination all
   identified situations in which the GP would prescribe outside of the BNF
   guidance. In some cases they felt that the guidance was difficult to
   apply in clinical practice and in others they were either unaware of or
   did not believe it to be based on sound evidence. This may either be
   dictated by individual patient need or a consistent approach to
   prescribing a specific drug, based on their own clinical experience.
   Conclusions: This study has demonstrated that GPs will sometimes
   prescribe outside BNF guidance. With the continuing effort to improve
   prescribing in general practice, it is essential for those trying to
   influence prescribing behaviour to understand the complexity of this
   decisionmaking process. This should help inform the design and
   implementation of strategies to change behaviour in this area.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether primary care providers and thyroid
   specialists at Gundersen Lutheran Medical Center are evaluating thyroid
   nodules efficiently by following recently published clinical guidelines.
   Study Design: One-year retrospective chart review.
   Patients and Methods: We reviewed patient records from 1996 and
   tabulated the use of fine-needle aspiration cytology, radionuclide
   scanning, and thyroid ultrasonography by 49 primary care physicians
   evaluating 81 thyroid nodules and by 5 thyroid specialists evaluating 29
   thyroid nodules. The results were compared with our previous findings
   and those recently reported by others.
   Results: Fine-needle aspiration cytology was widely used by both groups
   of Gundersen Lutheran healthcare providers. primary care physicians used
   imaging studies modestly and generated \$106 per patient in unnecessary
   costs. Thyroid specialists occasionally used radionuclide scanning but
   did not use thyroid ultrasonography; they generated \$41 per patient in
   unnecessary costs. Overall, the introduction of fine-needle aspiration
   cytology at our institution has reduced the use of radionuclide scanning
   from 90\% to 12\% and the use of thyroid ultrasonography from 30\% to
   10\%. We also found that the frequency of surgery in patients with
   thyroid nodules fell substantially, yet detection of thyroid cancer in
   the operative specimens increased from 16\% to 43\% while the cost of
   removing a thyroid carcinoma decreased from \$64,000 to \$25,000.
   Conclusions: Fine-needle aspiration cytology, adopted as the initial
   test for diagnosing thyroid nodules by most of our healthcare providers,
   has reduced the use of imaging studies far below the frequency reported
   by others and has substantially decreased the cost of thyroid nodule
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Multinodular goiter (MNG) is a common disorder characterized by a
   nodular enlargement of the thyroid gland and occurring with a
   female:male ratio of 5:1. This article reports the analysis of an
   Italian three-generation pedigree MNG, including 10 affected females and
   2 affected males. After linkage to candidate regions previously
   implicated in various forms of goiter was excluded, a novel MNG locus
   was searched. Because no male-to-male transmission was present in the
   study pedigree, an X-linked autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance
   was hypothesized. Therefore, 18 markers spaced at 10-cM intervals on the
   ii chromosome were examined. A significant LOD score was observed in the
   Xp22 region, where marker DXS1226 generated a maximum LOD score of 4.73
   at a recombination fraction of 0. Analysis of six flanking
   microsatellites confirmed these data, and haplotype inspection delimited
   a 9.6-cM interval lying between DXS1052 and DXS8033.}},

Abstract = {{Isolated popliteal artery is defined as an obstruction of a superficial
   femoral artery with a patent popliteal segment followed by an obstructed
   distal popliteal artery or a patent leg artery less than 5 cm long.
   Purpose: The aim of this retrospective study was to report the results
   of surgical treatment and the causes of failures.
   Patients and methods: From 1988 to 1996, 31 patients with isolated
   popliteal artery were operated on with femoropopliteal bypass. The age
   of the patients ranged from 45 to 92 years, (mean: 79 years); all had
   critical ischemia that threatened limb viability. All underwent
   preoperative arteriography and diagnosis was confirmed by intraoperative
   arteriography.
   Results: In the postoperative course, there were 22 patent bypasses
   (68\%) with minor amputation in five patients, and nine thromboses that
   required a major amputation in seven patients, a trans-metatarsal
   amputation in one, and a medical treatment in one. With a mean 37-month
   follow-up, seven thromboses required a major amputation in five
   patients, a new bypass in one and a medical treatment in one. The death
   rate was 34\% at two years. The actuarial patency rates of the bypasses
   were 51\% at one year, 38\% at two years and 25\% at five years. The
   limb salvage rate was identical. The patency rates were 65\% at one, two
   and five years for venous bypasses and 38\%, 13\% and 0\% respectively
   for PTFE bypasses. Statistical analysis showed two causes of failure:
   the absence of a run-off branch and the use of PTFE prostheses. No other
   statistically significant cause of failure was demonstrated among those
   analysed. Favourable anatomic conditions for a bypass to a leg artery
   were not predictive of failure of a femoro-popliteal bypass on the
   isolated arterial segment.
   Conclusion: Bypass to isolated popliteal artery is indicated in patients
   whose limb viability is jeopardized. Results may be considered as
   satisfactory especially if there is a run-off branch and if a venous
   graft is available for the bypass. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et

   decreasing progressively upon raising the temperature to 65 degreesC. A
   reversible pretransition has been found in this complex near 70

   major conformational changes, but rather suggest altered base pairing
   and hydration of the carbonyl groups, accompanied by a slight distortion

   cytosine bases. Measurements in self-pressurized solutions of the
   complex at high temperature show that it melts at 103 degreesC in 0.1M

Abstract = {{All analyzed members of the spirochete genus Borrelia contain a linear
   chromosome about 910 kbp long. The complete sequence of the B.
   burgdorferi B31 genome predicts that its chromosome carries essentially
   all of this organism's housekeeping genes. In accordance with these
   bacterial species' obligatory parasitic lifestyle, its genes encode
   enzymes that are capable of only a minimal metabolism, in which all
   nucleotides, amino acids, fatty acids and enzyme cofactors must be
   scavenged from the host. In addition to the chromosome, all Borrelia
   isolates examined carry multiple linear and circular plasmids with
   lengths between 5 and 200 kbp. The plasmids, which account for over 600
   kbp in isolate B31, carry very few genes with homology to genes outside
   of the Borrelia genus. But they do carry numerous predicted lipoprotein
   genes, many of which are have been shown to be or are expected to be
   outer surface proteins. Ten of the linear plasmids have strikingly low
   protein coding potential for bacterial DNA. These plasmids have enjoyed
   numerous past duplicative rearrangements, which have resulted in the
   presence of a substantial fraction of the DNA that appears to be
   currently undergoing mutational decay, presumably because it is no

Abstract = {{The elderly have clearly been found to have both increased risk and
   severity of infections. Immunosenescence, the state of dysregulated
   immune function with aging, is felt to be a significant contributor to
   this increased risk. Extensive studies on inbred laboratory animals and
   in very healthy elderly humans have identified changes in immunity and
   have identified primarily phenotypic and functional changes in the T
   cell component of adaptive immunity. However, no compelling scientific
   evidence has shown that these changes have direct relevance to the
   common infections seen in the aged population. This perspective will at
   tempt to shed light on this dilemma. First, it will review clinically
   relevant infections in the elderly, focusing on influenza and influenza
   vaccination and how chronic illness contributes to increased risk and
   severity of infection/failed vaccine response. Next, key changes in
   immunity will be reviewed, keeping perspective of the impact of
   confounding variables such as nutrition. If the goal is to prevent
   serious infections in the elderly, it appears that the field of
   geriatric immunology/infectious disease is faced with the tremendous
   challenge of studying a very diverse population of chronically ill
   individuals in addition to the study of the very healthy elderly.
   Grouping individuals by dis ease severity or by level of impairment of
   specific components of immunity may assist in advancing our ability to
   improve host defense in an at risk population.}},

Abstract = {{Representation of video objects (VOs) using hierarchical 2-D
   content-based meshes for accurate tracking and level of detail (LOD)
   rendering have been previously proposed, where a simple suboptimal
   hierarchical mesh design algorithm was employed, However, it was
   concluded that the performance of the tracking and rendering very much
   depends on how well each level of the hierarchical mesh structure fits
   the VO under consideration, To this effect, this paper proposes an
   optimized design of hierarchical 2-D content-based meshes with a
   shape-adaptive simplification and temporal update mechanism for
   object-based video. Particular contributions of this work are: 1)
   analysis of optimal number of nodes for the initial fine level-of-detail
   mesh design; 2) adaptive shape simplification across hierarchy levels;
   3) optimization of the interior-node decimation method to remove only a
   maximal independent set to preserve Delaunay topology across hierarchy
   levels for better bitrate versus quality performance; and 4) a
   mesh-update mechanism which serves to update temporally 2-D dynamic mesh
   in case of occlusion due to 3-D motion and self-occlusion. The proposed
   optimized and temporally updated hierarchical mesh representation can be
   applied in object-based video coding, retrieval, and manipulation.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Automated-primary screening is frequently performed, but conventional
   smears have to be rescreened on coverslip edges because automated
   systems do not analyze cells near the coverslip edges because of
   focusing problems. This disadvantage can be overcome by obtaining
   conventional samples smeared in the center of the slide, e.g., by the
   Exact Touch (ET), a single sampler introduced by G. Saccomanno.
   PAPNET-assisted primary screening was performed on 263 samples collected
   by ET. The smears were classified as ``negative{''} or as ``review.{''}
   The negative cases were rapidly rescreened but not near the coverslip
   edges. The review cases were fully reanalayzed by the optic microscope.
   Ten positive smears were identified among the review cases: 3 smears
   showed changes due to human papillomavirus, 3 low-grade squamous
   intraepithelial lesions, and 4 high-grade squamous intraepithelial
   lesions. The detection of abnormal cells was easy by means of the
   combined use of ET and PAPNET.
   The ET-PAPNET technique was very useful in analyzing conventional smears
   and in reducing the time-consuming process of detecting abnormal cells.

Abstract = {{This study retrospectively assessed the utility of angio-CT in the
   identification and analysis of intracranial aneurysms in patients with
   subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) using digital angiography (DA) as a gold
   standard. A cohort of 97 patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage was
   investigated by angio-CT within 12 hours of acute SAH; 23 patients had
   angio-CT alone, whereas 74 underwent both angio-CT and DA. On average DA
   was performed within 24h.
   We identified 69 aneurysms in the 74 patients undergoing both angio-CT
   and DA (six patients had a double aneurysm and one had four;) and no
   aneurysms in 14 patients. Angio-CT failed to disclose the aneurysm in
   five cases, subsequently identified by DA. The false negative results
   were due to an err or in calculating the injection delay in one case and
   in another the aneurysm in the PICA was not opacified. DA was performed
   on the following day and in the meantime the conditions of the
   circulation and vessels may have changed. The remaining patients had
   aneurysms which were not well displayed due to sever tortuosity of the
   vessel associated with small lesion size and bony structures very close
   to the lesion.
   The sensitivity and specificity of angio-CT in the identification of
   aneurysms were 96\% and 100\% respectively with an overall predictive
   value of 96\%. This non-invasive technique proved quick, reliable and
   informative and often led to final diagnosis in SAH patients, especially
   in emergency patient management.}},

Abstract = {{Several compositions in the BaO-B2O3-TiO2 system have been studied the
   most important being BaTi4O9 with an added amount of (mol\%)
   5-50B(2)O(3) and BaTiO3 together with 25-50B(2)O(3). The melting
   temperatures were between 1100 and 1450 degreesC depending on the amount
   of B2O3. For the compositions with less than 40 mol\% TiO2 and more than
   20 mol\% B2O3 the materials obtained were vitreous. If the amount of
   TiO2 was greater than 50 mol\% they were crystalline even after
   ultrarapid quenching. The main physical properties were determined for
   both the vitreous and crystallised materials. The dielectric constant,
   e(r) and the tangent of dielectric loss, rand, have been measured at
   different frequencies for uncoated samples and those roared with silver:
   One of the most important characteristics for these samples was the
   stability of rand data over time and in the temperature range 0-120
   degreesC. For structural analysis, X-ray diffractometry, differential
   thermal analysis (DTA), optical and electron microscopy have been used
   on samples crystallised by controlled thermal treatments. X-ray analysis
   of the vitreous samples showed no crystalline compounds, while DTA data
   characterise the crystallisation tendency of these samples in the
   temperature range 600-800 degreesC. Structural investigations for the
   crystallised samples indicate the presence of the compounds BaTi4O9 and
   Ba2Ti9O20 together with rutile, TiO2. These crystallised samples
   obtained from the glass matrix were homogenous, the microstructure being
   without pores. In the samples with less then 40 mol\% TiO2 and move then
   20 mol\%; B2O3 a second ternary compound, Ba2Ti2B2O9, was identified.}},

   Program (ODP) Sites 806 (0 degrees N, 165 degrees E) and 847 (0 degrees

   shows a decline of taxa of Miocene origin between 4.5 and 4.0 Ma at both
   sites. Prior to this decline, Globoturborotalita species and
   Neogloboquadrina acostaensis dominated Sites 806 and 847 assemblages,
   respectively. Globoturborotalitids were not replaced by other
   thermocline dwellers after 4.2 Ma, which suggests a deepening of the
   thermocline and thickening of the warm pool at Site 806. At Site 847 in
   the eastern ``cold tongue,{''} N. acostaensis was gradually replaced by
   N. dutertrei. After 4.2 Ma, there was also a large increase (from 0.7 to
   1.3 parts per thousand) in the difference between the delta(18)O values
   of Globigerinoides sacculifer, a surface dweller, and Neogloboquadrina
   dutertrei, a seasonal thermocline dweller at Site 847; these data, in
   conjunction with faunal evidence, suggest that the temperature gradient
   in the upper photic zone increased significantly, largely because of
   subsurface cooling. The events in planktonic foraminifer evolution and
   ecology suggest that between 4.5 and 4.0 Ma a significant step was made
   toward development of the modern east-west gradient in surface
   hydrography. The timing of these events suggests that they were related
   to the closing of the Central American Seaway and subsequent changes in
   meridional temperature gradients and/or changes in air-sea interactions
   that modified tropical winds.}},

Abstract = {{In the experiment, hydroxyapatite coatings were obtained by using vacuum

   plasma spraying. Amorphous phase was formed due to rapid cooling of the
   melted hydroxyapatite droplet. The thermal instability of hydroxyapatite
   at temperature 1300 similar to 1400 degreesC caused a decomposition of
   HA powder into CaO and TCP. A rough-surfaced coating was obtained by
   plasma spraying. Pores and microcracks were observed as the
   characteristics of as received coating. A sintering process between the
   splats occurred in the process, which was caused by the degradation of
   thermal exchange property between coating and titanium substrate.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical method is proposed for solving the problem of coupled heat
   and moisture transfer in porous materials. The coupled partial
   differential equations and boundary conditions are first subjected to
   Laplace transformation, the equations are reduced to ordinary
   differential equations, then the equations are converted into a single
   fourth-order ordinary differential equation by introducing a
   transformation function. The solution of the equation can be easily
   obtained, and thus, the temperature and moisture distributions in the
   transform domain can be determined. Finally, the transformed values are
   analytically or numerically inverted to obtain the rime domain results.
   Therefore, the transient solution at any given time can be evaluated.
   The results are identical with published analytical solutions for a
   special case using decoupling technique, and they agree with a published
   analytical solution for wood slab. The method is compact enough to be
   generally applied to problems of heat and mass transfer in porous media.

Abstract = {{While the ectopic expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 has
   been shown to significantly increase both cell viability and antibody
   production in batch culture, some cell lines are refractory to these
   manipulations. For example, the NS/O and the P3x63Ag8.653 murine
   myelomas, which express high endogenous levels of the Bcl-2 homologue
   Bcl-xL, are both resistant to the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2. This
   indicates that, in these cells, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL may be functionally
   redundant. In order to define the role which Bcl-xL plays in hybridoma
   cultures, we used the Sp2/0-Ag14 cell line. This murine hybridoma
   expresses low levels of Bcl-xL and is highly sensitive to apoptosis
   induction by cycloheximide (CHX) and by amino acid depletion.
   Bcl-xL-transfected Sp2/0-Ag14 cells were more resistant than the wild
   type and the plasmid-containing cells to apoptosis induced by CHX and by
   glutamine depletion. Moreover, when compared to the vector-transfected
   control, Bcl-xL-Sp2/0 cells exhibited a substantial increase in
   viability in stationary batch culture. Interestingly, Sp2/0-Ag14 cells
   overexpressing Bcl-xL showed a growth behaviour that was similar to the
   parent myeloma cell line P3x63Ag8.653. Our results suggest that Bcl-xL
   expression levels are sufficient to account for the relative robustness
   of some hybridoma cell lines in stationary batch cultures.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal sediments may be considered contaminated with a metal if they
   have undergone an increase in concentrations above background levels due
   to anthropogenic inputs. The extent of contamination in Northern Irish
   coastal sediments was examined by a combination of statistical and
   graphical analysis utilising aluminium as a grain-size proxy. Enrichment
   of mercury, lead, zinc and copper was commonly observed in sediments
   throughout the study area, whereas concentrations of nickel, chromium
   and iron largely reflected levels in their source rocks. Belfast Lough
   was the most contaminated area, and it is suggested that the metals
   commonly associated with industrial and domestic discharges are more
   biologically available than at the other coastal sites studied.
   Concentrations of metals in Strangford Lough were close to or at
   background concentrations and may be used as a baseline to assess the
   degree of enrichment in other Irish coastal sediments. The area of fine
   sediments in the western Irish Sea had higher concentrations of metals
   than some inshore areas that could not be accounted for by grain-size
   differences alone. The sources and transport mechanisms of metals to the
   western Irish Sea and the influence of a seasonal gyre on contaminant
   accumulation are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: One process identified as detrimental in liver preservation
   is proteolysis.
   Methods: We tested the effects of adding antiproteolytic amino acids
   (L-alanine, L-glutamine, L-histidine, L-leucine, L-methionine,
   L-phenylalanine, L-proline, L-tryptophan) to the preservation medium, in
   a model of reperfusion of 24 h cold-stored rat livers.
   Results: During the preservation period, antiproteolytic amino acids
   inhibited the proteolysis observed in stored livers as shown by
   branched-chain amino acid fluxes, which switched from release to uptake.
   During reperfusion, cold storage of lives without the addition of
   antiproteolytic amino acids resulted in a decrease in the total amino
   acid and branched-chain amino acid uptake and a lower perfusion flow
   rate. The addition of antiproteolytic amino acids during liver storage
   resulted in the maintenance of total amino acid and branched-chain amino
   acid uptake and a significant improvement in the perfusion flow rate
   during reperfusion.
   Conclusions: The presence of antiproteolytic amino acids in the
   preservation medium might be of interest in improving hepatic graft
   viability in transplantation. (C) 2000 Blackwell Science Asia Pty Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A critical or clinical pathway defines the optimal care process,
   sequencing and timing of interventions by doctors, nurses and other
   health care professionals for a particular diagnosis or procedure.
   Clinical pathways are det-eloped through collaborative efforts of
   clinicians, case managers, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists and
   other allied health care professionals with the aim of improving the
   quality of patient care, while minimizing cost to the patient.
   The use of clinical pathways has increased over the past decade in the
   USA, the UK, Australia, and many other developed countries. However, its
   use in the developing nations and Asia has been sporadic. To the
   author's knowledge, there is to date, no published literature on the use
   and impact of clinical pathways on the quality and cost of patient care
   in the Asian health care setting. This paper provides a qualitative
   account of the development and implementation of a clinical pathway
   programme (using the example of patients with uncomplicated acute
   myocardial infarction) in an acute care general hospital in Singapore.
   The paper concludes that clinical pathways, when implemented in the
   context of an acute care hospital, can result in improvements in the
   care delivery process.}},

Abstract = {{The functional anatomy of Chinese character processing was investigated
   using fMRI. Right-handed Mandarin-English bilingual participants made
   either semantic or perceptual size judgements with characters and
   pictures. Areas jointly activated by character and picture semantic
   tasks compared to size judgement tasks included the left prefrontal
   region (BA 9, 44, 45), left posterior temporal, left fusiform, and left
   parietal regions. Character processing produced greater activation than
   picture processing in the left mid and posterior temporal as well as
   left prefrontal regions. The lateral occipital regions were more active
   during picture semantic processing than character semantic processing. A
   similar pattern of activation and contrasts was observed when English
   words and pictures were compared in another set of bilingual
   participants. However, there was less contrast between word and picture
   semantic processing than between character and picture processing in the
   left prefrontal region. When character and word semantic processing were
   compared directly in a third group, the loci of activation peaks was
   similar in both languages but Chinese character semantic processing was
   associated with a larger MR signal change. The semantic processing of
   Chinese characters, English words, and pictures activates a common
   semantic system within which there are modality-specific differences.
   The semantic processing of Chinese characters more closely resembles
   English words than pictures. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Sodium valproate is a highly effective treatment for bipolar
   disorder, but its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. We
   recently found with differential display polymerase chain reaction that
   valproate regulates the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress
   protein GRP78 in the rat cerebral cortex. In our study, we investigated
   the effect of this drug on the other members of the endoplasmic
   reticulum stress protein family, GRP94 and calreticulin, and we studied
   the brain regional distribution of GRP78, GRP94, and calreticulin.
   Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to measure protein levels of
   GRP78, GRP94, and calreticulin after treatment with sodium valproate
   (300 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) in specific rat brain regions.
   Results: We report here that chronic treatment with valproate also
   increased expression of other members of the endoplasmic reticulum
   stress protein family, such as GRP94 and calreticulin. The brain
   regional distribution of these changes was similar for all three
   proteins, with marked increase detected in the frontal cortex, parietal
   cortex, and CAI region of the hippocampus.
   Conclusions: Because GRP78, GRP94, and calreticulin possess molecular
   chaperone activity and bind Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum, the
   pharmacologic action of valproate may involve one or more of these
   processes. (C) 2000 Society of Biological Psychiatry.}},

Abstract = {{The reaction between Ni and eutectic BiSn solder at 85 degrees C, 100
   degrees C, 120 degrees C, and 135 degrees C was studied. Reaction times
   ranging from 25 h to 3600 h were used. Only Ni3Sn4 was detected as a
   result of the reaction. None of the other Ni;Sn intermetallic compounds
   and none of the Ni-Bi intermetallic compounds were observed. The growth
   of Ni3Sn4 followed diffusion-controlled kinetics and was very slow, with
   the layer thickness reaching only 16 mu m after 3600 h of aging at 135
   degrees C. The eutectic BiSn microstructure coarsened very quickly.
   Substantial coarsening can be observed at 135 degrees C for only 200 h
   of aging. Ln addition, fine Bi-rich particles within the Sn-rich phase
   of the solder were found. The amount of these fine Bi-rich particles
   increased with the aging temperature. It is believed that the formation
   of these fine Bi-rich particles is due to the fact that the Sn-rich
   phase can dissolve substantial amounts of Bi. It was also found that, as
   aging time increased, the region immediately adjacent to the Ni3Sn4
   layer was preferentially occupied by the Bi-rich phase. This is because
   Sn in that region had reacted with Ni to form Ni3Sn4, leaving a nearly
   continuous Bi-rich phase above the Ni3Sn4. Since Bi-rich alloys tend to
   be brittle, a nearly continuous Bi-rich phase might weaken the strength
   of a solder joint. The Ni3Sn4 grain size increased gradually from the
   Ni/Ni3Sn4 interface to the Ni3Sn4/BiSn interface, which is probably an
   Ostwald ripening phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the effect of vitrification with ethylene glycol
   (EG) for mature human oocytes in straws.
   Design: Prospective, randomized, in vitro experiments.
   Setting: Reproductive unit of a university hospital.
   Patient(s): Immature oocytes from 110 patients undergoing
   intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).
   Intervention(s): The immature oocytes were incubated to reach metaphase
   II (MII). The MII oocytes were treated with EG-based cryoprotectants and
   vitrified in straws. They were diluted in sucrose solutions, inseminated
   by ICSI, and cultured in vitro.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Survival, fertilization, and embryo cleavage.
   Result(s): The survival rates were greater for oocytes pretreated with
   1.5 M of EG (65\% for 0 minute, 93\% for 5 minutes, and 96\% for 10
   minutes). The oocytes vitrified in 60 and 90 seconds had a greater rate
   of fertilization than those vitrified in 120 seconds. There were no
   differences in survival and fertilization for vitrified oocytes diluted
   by three or four steps. The cleavage rates to the six- to eight-cell
   stage were comparable with controls. However, no blastocyst formation
   was observed in vitrified oocytes.
   Conclusion(s): Vitrification of human oocytes with EG in straws achieves
   a high rate of survival, fertilization, and early cleavage of embryos.
   Further studies should be conducted for the improvement of blastocyst
   formation. (Fertil Steril (R) 2000,74:804-8. (C) 2000 by American

   It is found that the critical strength of ferromagnetic coupling
   decreases with p for small p but increases for large enough p. It is
   also found that the plateau for large p is wide enough for moderate
   values of exchange coupling so that it should be easily observed

Abstract = {{The process of time-pressure fluid dispensing has been widely employed
   in the semi-conductor industry, where the fluid is applied to boards or
   substrates. In such a process, the now rate of fluid dispensed and the
   shape of fluid formed on the board are the two most critical performance
   indexes, yet extremely difficult to represent because of their complex
   behavior. This paper presents the development of a model for the
   time-pressure fluid dispensing process, by which the flow rate and shape
   can be established. Experiments have been performed to validate the
   model developed.}},

Abstract = {{1. Forskolin acts as an allosteric modulator of muscle-type nicotinic
   acetylcholine receptors. Receptors from mouse muscle and Torpedo
   electroplax demonstrate differential sensitivity to inhibition by
   forskolin. Previous work from this laboratory suggested that the gamma
   subunit is responsible for this differential sensitivity.
   2. We have used a series of mouse/Torpedo species-chimeric gamma
   subunits to further define the site of forskolin interaction with the
   gamma subunit. Analysis of the patterns of forskolin inhibition of
   receptors containing mouse/Torpedo chimeric gamma subunits along with
   the mouse alpha, beta, and delta subunits suggests that forskolin
   interacts with the small extracellular domain that links the M2 and M3
   transmembrane domains (the M2-M3 linker).
   3. We suggest that the M2-M3 linker domain plays an important role in
   the transduction of ligand binding to the conformational changes that
   result in channel opening.}},

Title = {{Effects of prenylated flavonoids and biflavonoids on
   lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide production from the mouse
   macrophage cell line RAW 264.7}},
Journal = {{PLANTA MEDICA}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{Certain flavonoid derivatives possess anti-inflammatory activity in
   vitro and in vivo. Besides their antioxidative properties and effects on
   the arachidonic acid metabolism including cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase
   inhibition, same flavones and flavonols were previously found to show
   inhibitory activity on nitric oxide production by inducible nitric oxide
   synthase (iNOS; NOS type 2) through suppression of iNOS induction. As
   part of our continuing investigations, the effects of unique and minor
   flavonoids (prenylated flavonoids and biflavonoids) on nitric oxide
   production from lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophage cell line (RAW
   264.7) were evaluated in order to establish their inhibitory activity on
   NO production and correlate this action with their in vivo
   anti-inflammatory potential. Among the derivatives tested, prenylated
   compounds including morusin, kuwanon C, and sanggenon D and biflavonoids
   such as bilobetin and ginkgetin were found to inhibit NO production from
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells at >10 muM. Inhibition
   of nitric oxide production was mediated by suppression of iNOS enzyme
   induction but not by direct inhibition of iNOS enzyme activity. An
   exception was echinoisoflavanone that inhibited iNOS enzyme activity
   (IC50 = 83 muM) and suppressed iNOS enzyme induction as well. While most
   prenylated derivatives showed cytotoxicity to RAW cells at 10 - 100 muM,
   all biflavonoids tested were not cytotoxic. Since nitric oxide (NO)
   produced by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) plays an important role in
   inflammatory disorders, inhibition of NO production by these flavonoids
   may contribute, at least in part, to their antiinflammatory and
   immunoregulating potential in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to assess the concurrent validity of
   center of pressure (COP) measurements during walking, comparing the
   Parotec System (an in-shoe pressure measurement device) to an Advanced
   Mechanical Technology Inc. (AMTI) force plate. Pearson correlation
   coefficients comparing COP displacement in the medial-lateral (ML) and
   anterior-posterior (AP) direction calculated from the two systems were
   greater than 0.70 for 52/67 trials (78\%) in the ML direction and were
   greater than 0.90 for 67/67 trials (100\%) in the AP direction. The mean
   root mean square (RMS) error for COP displacement in the ML direction
   was 0.56 +/- 0.3 cm and in the AP direction was 1.37 +/- 0.59 cm.
   Overall, the Parotec System showed good correlation and small RMS errors
   when compared to the AMTI force plate. Additional analysis to
   investigate sources of error pointed to the methods used for calculating
   the position and orientation of the subject's foot on the force plate.
   Subsequent analysis to eliminate some of these errors, compared force
   calculated from the Parotec System and the AMTI plate and showed good to
   excellent correlation (> 0.70) for 62/67 trials (93\%). Additional data
   were collected that allowed for elimination of methodological errors.
   Again force calculated from the two systems was compared using Pearsons.
   These data showed excellent correlation (> 0.90) for 20/20 trials
   (100\%). This study provides evidence of the validity of the Parotec
   System for measuring COP during ambulation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Solarisation of annealed and toughened sodium silicate glasses, and the
   effects of cerium and/or vanadium doping, were studied using radiation
   from a mercury lamp In accordance with existing reports, pure sodium
   silicate glasses exhibited severe solarisation but addition of cerium to
   the glass was found to prevent solarisation. However; cerium doping may
   not suppress solarisation when other polyvalent elements are present,for
   example it was found that sodium silicate glasses doped with both cerium
   and vanadium suffered solarisation, with transmission losses of up to
   8\% at 500 nm. It was discovered that thermally toughened glasses, with
   compressive stress in the surface regions, are more susceptible to
   solarisation. An additional 2\% transmission loss throughout the visible
   region was observed for all samples regardless of composition and
   assigned to absorption of ultraviolet ( UV) light by point defects
   produced by the toughening process. This transmission loss may have
   important implications for the efficiency of solar panels protected by

   the other half for up to 270 days. Troglitazone markedly reduced in vivo
   the hepatic triglyceride secretion rate (TGSR) and enhanced its removal
   from the circulation, leading to a normalization of plasma triglyceride
   levels. It also normalized the whole-body peripheral insulin resistance,
   the glucose homeostasis, and the elevated free fatty acids (FFAs)
   without detectable changes in plasma insulin levels. The clear
   alteration of the biphasic pattern of glucose stimulated insulin
   secretion in the in vitro perfused beta-cell islets of rats fed the SRD
   long-term (270 days) was also completely normalized when the SRD was
   supplemented with troglitazone for 2 months. The normalization of the
   altered patterns of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, as well as the
   enhancement of peripheral insulin sensitivity without detectable changes
   in plasma insulin, might be largely a result of the significant action
   of troglitazone in the decrease of circulating lipids and enhancement of
   whole-body glucose metabolism. Copyright (C) 2000 by W.B. Saunders

Abstract = {{The trapping dynamics of photogenerated electrons and holes in MoS2
   nanoclusters has been studied using time resolved emission polarization
   and absorption spectroscopies. These results are compared to absorption
   kinetics obtained on MoS2 nanoclusters with adsorbed DTDCI
   (DTDCI=diethylthiodicarbocyanine iodide) dye. The results indicate that
   emission from the MoS2 band edge state is polarized, while emission from
   trapped electrons and holes is unpolarized. This polarization difference
   is used to obtain the electron and hole trapping times and values of 275
   ps and 42 ps, respectively, are obtained. Decays having the same time
   constants are observed in the transient absorption results. The results
   obtained on the MoS2/DTDCI system show that electron injection occurs
   with a time constant of 12 ps. These kinetics also show a 225 ps decay
   component which is assigned to electron trapping and reverse electron
   transfer. The 225 ps decay time along with the 275 ps trapping time
   indicates that reverse electron transfer from the conduction band has a
   time constant of about 1.2 ns. Following trapping, reverse electron
   transfer from deep traps is slow. (C) 2000 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Objective: This study evaluated the relationship between client-case
   manager racial matching and both service use and clinical outcomes in a
   case management program for homeless persons with serious mental
   illness. Methods: The study focused on 1,785 clients from the first
   cohorts that entered the Center for Mental Health Services' Access to
   Community Care and Effective Services and Supports (ACCESS) program, a
   five-year demonstration program for homeless persons with mental illness
   established at 18 sites between 1994, and 1996, A series of two-way
   analyses of variance was used to assess the effect of client and case
   manager race and their interaction on changes in outcomes and service
   use over a 12-month period. Results: Although African Americans had more
   severe problems on several measures and higher levels of service use at
   baseline, no differences in service use at 12 months or in the changes
   in client outcomes as measured by nine variables were associated with
   the different pairings of African-American and white clients and case
   managers. White clients had a greater reduction in psychotic symptoms
   than did African-American clients, regardless of client-case manager
   racial palling, No differences were found between white and
   African-American clients on the amount of services received over time.
   Conclusions: This study found virtually no evidence of a relationship
   between client race, case manager race, or client-case manager racial
   matching on either outcomes or service use.}},

Abstract = {{Easy-to-use audio/video authoring tools play a crucial role in moving
   multimedia software from research curiosity to mainstream applications.
   However, research in multimedia authoring systems has rarely been
   documented in the literature. This paper describes the design and
   implementation of an interactive video authoring system called Zodiac,
   which employs an innovative edit history abstraction to support several
   unique editing features not found in existing commercial and research
   video editing systems. Zodiac provides users a conceptually clean and
   semantically powerful branching history model of edit operations to
   organize the authoring process, and to navigate among versions of
   authored documents. In addition, by analyzing the edit history, Zodiac
   is able to reliably detect a composed video stream's shot and scene
   boundaries, which facilitates interactive video browsing. Zodiac also
   features a video object annotation capability that allows users to
   associate annotations to moving objects in a video sequence. The
   annotations themselves could be text, image, audio, or video. Zodiac is
   built on top of MMFS, a file system specifically designed for
   interactive multimedia development environments, and implements an
   internal buffer manages that supports transparent lossless
   compression/decompression. Shot/scene detection, video object
   annotation, and buffer management all exploit the edit history
   information for performance optimization.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the status of smart structures technology development
   for application to rotorcraft systems. Though a large component of
   research is focused on the minimization of helicopter vibration, the
   methodology is equally applicable to such other problems as
   aeromechanical stability augmentation, handling qualities enhancement,
   stall alleviation, reduction of interior/exterior acoustic signatures,
   minimization of blade dynamic stresses and rotor head health monitoring.
   More than any other system, the structural, mechanical and aerodynamic
   complexity and the interdisciplinary nature of rotorcraft offer many
   opportunities for the application of smart structures technologies with
   the potential for substantial payoffs in system effectiveness.
   Primarily, two types of smart rotor concepts are under development:
   trailing-edge flaps actuated with smart actuators, and controllable
   twist blades with embedded piezoceramic actuators. For flap actuation,
   actuators range from piezo-bimorphs, piezo/electrostrictive stacks and
   piezo/magnetostrictive-induced composite-coupled actuation. Most smart
   actuators are moderate force and extremely small displacement devices
   and hence some form of mechanical amplification of induced displacement
   is needed to achieve desired flap deflections. Because of compactness
   and weight considerations, the stroke amplification of these devices has
   been a key barrier for application to rotor blades. Most of the current
   smart rotor models under development have adopted Froude scaling, but
   future developments are tending towards Mach-scale and full-scale
   designs. The state-of-art on modeling of actuators is improving rapidly.
   Shape memory alloys (SMA) show potential in providing large induced
   strains (up to 6\%), but are limited to low frequency (less than 1 Hz)
   applications such as tab adjustment for rotor tracking. Also, it is
   quite difficult to achieve fine-tune actuation control with SMAs.
   Database of smart actuator characteristics under different loads,
   frequency and temperature are non-existent. For in-flight tracking of
   rotor SMA-actuated tabs, it is important to incorporate adaptive control
   strategy and a locking mechanism. Comprehensive rotor analyses covering
   smart materials actuators are in development at this time. This paper
   will identify key barriers for applications of smart structure
   technology to rotorcraft systems and point out the need for future
   research in this area. Research in the application of smart structures
   technology to rotorcraft systems is in its early phase, and activities
   need to be expanded before this promising technology can be exploited in
   a competitive manner.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To characterize preoperative signs and symptoms in women with
   and without enteroceles.
   Methods: Three hundred ten women completed preoperative questionnaires
   and had prolapses graded according to the International Continence
   Society system. Signs and symptoms in 77 women (25\%) with enteroceles
   confirmed at surgery were compared with those in 233 women without
   enteroceles. Comparisons were tested for statistical significance with
   chi(2) tests, Fisher exact tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, and analysis
   of covariance.
   Results: Women with enteroceles were statistically Significantly older
   (median 67 versus 59 years, P <.001) and more likely to be
   postmenopausal (88\% versus 76\%, P =.04). More women with enteroceles
   had histories of hysterectomies (76\% versus 39\%, P =.001) and vaginal
   prolapse repairs (24\% versus 11\%, P =.008). Women with enteroceles had
   more advanced prolapses at points Ap, Bp, and C (all P <.001) but not
   point D. There were no significant differences in symptoms related to
   bowel function (infrequent bowel movements, straining, manual
   evacuation, and fecal incontinence) in women with and without
   enteroceles. Women with enteroceles were more bothered by symptoms
   caused by vaginal prolapse than women without enteroceles, but not after

   posterior vaginal prolapses than women without enteroceles, but do not
   differ from them in bowel function. (Obstet Gynecol 2000;96:599-603. (C)

Abstract = {{A reciprocating extrusion process was developed to consolidate
   6061-Al2O3p composites from mixed powders. The 6061 alloy powder was
   first dehydrated in a vacuum chamber at 450 degrees C and then mixed
   with 12.5 mu m Al2O3 powder in various volume fractions: 0, 5, 10, 20,
   and 30 pet. The mixed powders were hot pressed at 300 degrees C under a
   pressure of 300 MPa and finally extruded reciprocatingly 14 times at 460
   degrees C. The results show that the composites were fully densified,
   with no sign of pores or oxide layers observable in the optical
   microscope. The Al2O3 particles were distributed uniformly in the
   matrix. As compared with 6061 alloys, the composites demonstrated a
   smaller precipitation hardening and elongation, but exhibited a higher
   Young's modulus and a larger work hardening capacity. The degradation of
   precipitation hardening was due to the loss of Mg, which reacts with
   Al2O3 to form MgAl2O4. The large work-hardening capacity is attributable
   to the incompatibility between Al2O3 and the matrix, which possibly
   generates more dislocations to harden the matrix. The composites had
   much higher friction coefficients and greater wear resistances than the
   6061 alloy against steel disc surface. The friction coefficient of the
   6061-30 vol pet Al2O3p composite was double that of the 6061 alloy and
   the wear resistance was 100-fold. As compared with similar composites
   reported previously, these composites possessed much higher elongation
   at the same strength level. A 30 vol pet Al2O3p Still displayed an
   elongation of 9.8 pet in the T6 condition. All of these improvements are
   attributed to the merits, including full densification of the bulk,
   uniform dispersion of the Al2O3 particles in the matrix, and strong
   binding between the Al2O3 particles and the matrix resulting from
   reciprocating extrusion.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine whether mitomycin-C can inhibit posterior capsule
   opacification (PCO) without causing ocular toxicity.
   Setting: Yonsei Institute of Vision Research, Department of
   Ophthalmology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.
   Methods: Mitomycin-C dissolved in sodium hyaluronate (0.2 cc of 0.2
   mg/mL) was injected into the empty capsular bag for 3 minutes after
   endocapsular phacoemulsification in rabbit eyes. Three months after
   surgery, the obstruction rate of visible light caused by PCO was
   measured using an optical power meter.
   Results: The mean obstruction rate of visible light was 81.0\% +/- 8.3\%
   (SD) in the control group in which sodium hyaluronate without
   mitomycin-C was used, 30.5\% +/- 10.1\% in the group in which
   mitomycin-C was dissolved in sodium hyaluronate, and 71.9\% +/- 6.8\% in
   the group in which mitomycin-C was dissolved in a balanced salt
   solution. Statistically significant differences were found among all 3
   groups.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that the application of mitomycin-C
   dissolved in sodium hyaluronate effectively reduces PCO in rabbit eyes.

Abstract = {{Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a hormone produced primarily by the
   cardiac ventricle, is thought to be involved in a variety of homeostatic
   processes through its cognate receptor, guanylyl cyclase A (GC-A). We
   previously created transgenic mice overexpressing BNP under the control
   of the liver-specific human serum amyloid P component promoter
   (BNP-transgenic mice) and demonstrated that they exhibit reduced blood
   pressure and cardiac weight accompanied by an elevation of plasma cGMP
   concentrations and marked skeletal overgrowth through the activation of
   endochondral ossification. To address whether BNP exerts its biological
   effects solely through GC-A, we produced BNP-transgenic mice lacking
   GC-A (BNP-Tg/GC-A(-/-) mice) and examined their cardiovascular and
   skeletal phenotypes. The GC-A(-/-) mice are hypertensive with cardiac
   hypertrophy relative to wild-type littermates, which is not alleviated
   by overexpression of BNP in BNP-Tg/GC-A(-/-) mice; The BNP-Tg/GC-A(-/-)
   mice, however, continue to exhibit marked longitudinal growth of
   vertebrae and long bones comparably to BNP-Tg mice. This study provides
   genetic evidence that BNP reduces blood pressure and cardiac weight
   through GC-A, whereas it dramatically alters endochondral ossification
   in the absence of this receptor. Therefore, the BNP-Tg/GC-A(-/-) mice
   provide the first experimental model demonstrating that this natriuretic
   peptide can signal in a tissue-specific manner through a receptor other
   than GC-A.}},

   Ettringite was the dominant crystalline phase after hydration in 3.0 M
   solution, regardless of temperature. Gypsum was the only other
   crystalline phase observed after hydration in 3.0 M solutions. Hydration
   rates are faster than those observed in previous studies using similar

Abstract = {{The French government is reassessing the whole basis on which it trains
   and equips its diplomats for their calling, driven by a growing
   perception that French diplomacy has not been performing well. The
   `Heisbourg Report' on the state of French diplomacy pulled no punches
   and accused French diplomats of being closed to international
   influences, untrained for modern diplomacy and stifled by a
   state-centrist view of modern international relations. On the face of it
   this can all be interpreted as a milestone in an underlying convergence
   between Francophone and Anglophone approaches to modern diplomacy and
   security. In very important respects, however, Britain and France are
   mirror images of each other. What is defined here as mirror imaging can
   be seen to exist at three different levels which are self-reinforcing,
   though not in obvious ways: in the pros and cons of each others'
   policy-making style; in their inextricable fate to develop the European
   Security and Defence Policy project; and even at the most abstract
   levels in the predicaments they face in the light of globalization. Seen
   in this context, it is evident that it is not merely the skills and
   techniques of French and British policy-makers that need to be
   re-examined, but rather their way of thinking about their own state and
   about the nature of the international system around them in an era when
   globalization is symptomatic of deep structural change.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of a palaeomagnetic study of four mid-Cretaceous

   weakly magnetized and exhibit two- to three-component magnetizations.
   These magnetization components appear to be carried by both a sulphide

   carries a reverse polarity overprint that often makes it difficult to
   isolate definitively the higher-unblocking-temperature component. The
   high-unblocking-temperature component is well defined in the upper
   portion of the Santa Rosa Canyon section and in the Cienega del Toro
   section and passes the fold test, The characteristic remanent
   magnetization (ChRM) inclinations agree well with predicted
   mid-Cretaceous inclinations for these sites, although the declinations
   differ by more than 100 degrees. The relative rotation between these two
   sites probably occurred as the thrust sheets were emplaced during
   Laramide deformation. At two of the sections, namely Cienega del Toro
   and the overturned Los Chorros sections, only normal polarity directions
   are observed, The La Boca Canyon and Santa Rosa Canyon sections exhibit
   zones of both normal and reverse polarity magnetization, Correlation of
   these polarity zones with the geomagnetic polarity timescale provides a
   time framework for lithostratigraphic and palaeoceanographic studies of
   these sections.}},

Abstract = {{The phase behavior of Myverol 18-99K, a food emulsifier rich in
   monoacylglycerols, in combination with water has been determined. X-ray
   diffraction and polarized light microscopy (PLM) were used for phase
   identification and structure characterization. Phase behavior was
   established in the temperature range from - 15 to 50 degreesC and in the
   composition range from dry to full hydration. Phases identified include
   the solid lamellar crystal (Lc) phase, the liquid fluid isotropic phase
   and three liquid crystal phases, the lamellar liquid crystal, the
   cubic-Ia3d and the cubic-Pn3m phase. Phase information is reported in
   the form of temperature-composition phase diagrams. It was collected
   under equilibrium conditions where measurements were made in the heating
   direction beginning with the Lc phase at - 15 degreesC. Phase
   metastability was also examined in which the natural tendency of the
   liquid crystal phases to undercool was facilitated. Under this
   condition, both cubic phases were found to remain free of the solid Lc
   phase over a relatively wide range of hydration values down to 0
   degreesC. The microstructure of the different phases and its dependence
   on temperature and hydration has been determined. Compositional analysis
   using thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
   shows that Myverol 18-99K consists of 82\% monoacylglycerols (86.6\%
   monoolein, 7.0\% monostearin, 3.5\% monopalmitin, 0.9\% monoarachidin,
   2.0\% unidentified). The equilibrium and metastable phase diagrams of
   the Myverol 18-99K/water system show remarkable similarity to those
   reported for the monoolein/water system (Qiu, H., Caffrey, M., 2000. The

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{569-586}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The selectivity filter of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is in part
   composed of four Glu residues, termed the EEEE locus. Ion selectivity in
   Ca2+ channels is based on interactions between permeant ions and the
   EEEE locus: in a mixture of ions, all of which can pass through the pore
   when present alone, those ions that bind weakly are impermeant, those
   that bind more strongly are permeant, and those that bind more strongly
   yet act as pore blockers as a consequence of their low rate of unbinding
   from the EEEE locus. Thus, competition among ion species is a
   determining feature of selectivity filter function in Ca2+ channels.
   Previous work has shown that Asp and Ala substitutions in the EEEE locus
   reduce ion selectivity by weakening ion binding affinity. Here we
   describe for wild-type and EEEE locus mutants an analysis at the single
   channel level of competition between Cd2+, which binds very tightly
   within the EEEE locus, and Ba2+ or Li+, which bind less tightly and
   hence exhibit high flux rates: Cd2+ binds to the EEEE locus similar to
   10(4)X more tightly than does Ba2+, and similar to 10(8)X more tightly
   than does Li+. For wild-type channels, Cd2+ entry into the EEEE locus
   was 400X faster when Li+ rather than Ba2+ was the current carrier,
   reflecting the large difference between Ba2+ and Li+ in affinity for the
   EEEE locus. For the substitution mutants, analysis of Cd2+ block
   kinetics shows that their weakened ion binding affinity can result from
   either a reduction in blocker on rate or an enhancement of blocker off
   rate. Which of these rate effects underlay weakened binding was not
   specified by the nature of the mutation (Asp vs. Ala), but was instead
   determined by the valence and affinity of the current-carrying ion (Ba2+
   vs. Li+). The dependence of Cd2+ block kinetics upon properties of the
   current-carrying ion can be understood by considering the number of EEEE
   locus oxygen atoms available to interact with the different ion pairs.}},

   Different E. coli serotypes were tested with the optimized protocol.
   Fifty three artificially contaminated samples and sixty naturally
   contaminated samples were processed with the multiplex-PCR. All the
   artificially contaminated samples gave positive results independently of
   the number of cells inoculated. On the contrary, the naturally
   contaminated samples were ail negative. The results obtained from this

Abstract = {{Intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produces somatic hyperalgesia,
   releases interleukin (IL)-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
   (TNF-alpha), and activates vagal afferents. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the effect of peripheral LPS on rectal sensitivity and to
   specify the mechanisms involved. Abdominal muscle contractions were
   recorded in conscious rats equipped with intramuscular electrodes.
   Rectal distension (RD) was performed at various times after LPS or
   experimental treatments. In controls, RD significantly increased the
   number of abdominal contractions from a threshold volume of distension
   of 0.8 ml. At the lowest volume (0.4 ml), this number was increased
   after administration of LPS (3, 9, and 12 h later), recombinant human
   IL-1 beta (from 3 to 9 h), recombinant bovine TNF-alpha (from 6 to 9 h),
   and BrX-537A (from 6 to 12 h), a mast cell degranulator. The effect of
   LPS was reduced by doxantrazole, Lys-D-Pro-Thr, and soluble recombinant
   TNF receptor. Vagotomy selectively amplified the response to LPS. We
   conclude that, in vivo, intraperitoneal LPS lowers visceral pain
   threshold (allodynia) through a mechanism involving mast cell
   degranulation and IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha release and that the vagus
   nerve may exert a tonic protective role against LPS-induced rectal
   allodynia.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To assess the effectiveness of open and minimally invasive
   techniques in the debridement of osteoarthritis of the elbow, we
   compared the Outerbridge-Kashiwagi (O-K) procedure with an arthroscopic
   modification in which arthroscopic debridement and fenestration of the
   olecranon fossa was performed. Type of Study: The study took the form of
   a nonrandomized control trial in which subjects were allocated to a
   treatment depending on the hospital of presentation. Materials and
   Methods: Assessment using the Mayo Clinic elbow function chart enabled
   comparison of the outcome in 18 cases treated by the O-K procedure and
   26 patients treated by arthroscopic debridement and fenestration of the
   olecranon fossa. Mean follow-up was 35.3 months (minimum 12 months). Of
   the patients treated by the O-K procedure, 14 were men and 4 were women
   with a mean age of 55 years. In 83\% of patients, the diagnosis was
   primary osteoarthritis, with the remainder post-traumatic arthritis. The
   patients treated by arthroscopic debridement and fenestration of the
   olecranon fossa included 24 men and 2 women with a mean age of 46 years,
   and a diagnosis of primary osteoarthritis in 91\% and post-traumatic
   arthritis in the remainder. No patients were excluded from the study or
   refused to be included. Results: Both procedures were shown to be
   effective, with no major complications. Patients treated by arthroscopic
   debridement and fenestration of the olecranon fossa achieved better
   relief of pain (P <.10), whereas those patients undergoing the O-K
   procedure achieved significantly greater improvement in range of flexion
   (P <.05). No difference between the procedures in terms of
   patient-perceived overall effectiveness of the surgery was found.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the
   elbow, arthroscopic debridement and fenestration of the olecranon fossa
   may be a more suitable procedure when painful symptoms predominate. In
   contrast, the O-K procedure is a significantly better procedure for
   improving the range of flexion where this is a particular problem.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: To test the sensitivity and specificity of the crochetage
   pattern (a notch near the apex of the R wave in electrocardiographic
   inferior limb leads) in the pediatric electrocardiogram for detecting
   patients with a secundum atrial septal defect.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Electrocardiograms from 82 consecutive
   preoperative pediatric patients with a secundum atrial septal defect
   confirmed by two-dimensional echocardiography were reviewed for evidence
   of right ventricular hypertrophy and the crochetage pattern. These
   electrocardiograms were compared with 244 consecutive preoperative
   controls consisting of patients with echocardiographically proven patent
   foramen ovale, ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, tetralogy
   of Fallot and patients with normal echocardiogram studies.
   RESULTS: The electrocardiographic crochetage pattern was observed in
   31.7\% of preoperative patients with a secundum atrial septal defect in
   at least one inferior limb lead. The specificity of the crochetage
   pattern for the detection of a secundum atrial septal defect was high
   when present in all three inferior limb leads (greater than 92\%). The
   crochetage pattern in at least one lead in secundum atrial septal
   defects shows no association with incomplete right bundle branch block
   (chi (2)(1)=0.80, not significant), and thus these two findings together
   do not improve the detection of an atrial septal defect.
   CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity and specificity of the electrocardiographic
   crochetage patterns in at least one inferior limb lead in
   echocardiographically proven secundum atrial septal defects are 31.7\%
   and 86.1\%, respectively. The electrocardiographic crochetage or
   notching pattern in inferior limb leads has a high specificity for
   atrial septal defects in the pediatric population.}},

Abstract = {{We studied larval dispersal behavior of two rice stem borers,
   Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker) and Chilo suppressalis (Walker), to
   evaluate the potential of seed mixtures for resistance management in B.
   thuringiensis (Bt) rice. Both species showed extensive movement among
   plants (or ``hills{''}) in plots of transplanted rice, during the course
   of larval development. On rice plants at the vegetative stage, almost
   all S. incertulas larvae dispersed on the day of eclosion. On plants at
   Looting stage, most S. incertulas bored into hills on which egg masses
   were placed (referred to as the ``release hill{''}). Almost all neonate
   C. suppressalis also bored into the release hill, at both vegetative and
   booting stages. At both rice grow th stages, most lan ne of both species
   dispersed to new hills between 7 and 18 d after eclosion. Both S.
   incertulas and C. suppressalis moved among tillers within the release
   hill, as indicated by an increase in dispersion among tillers over time.
   The distance and direction of dispersal of ballooning S. incertulas
   larvae was influenced by wind speed and direction. Larval recovery
   within plots generally declined rapidly over the first 5 d after egg
   hatch and then more slowly thereafter. Because many S. incertulas and C.
   suppressalis larvae move among tillers within hills and among hills
   within plots, many larvae in plots planted to seed mixtures will consume
   tissue from both Bt and non-Bt plants. This behavior will reduce the
   cumulative dose of toxin ingested and can accelerate the evolution of
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously shown that the presence of a consumer in an ecosystem
   model at ecologically stable equilibrium (ECSE) results in smaller
   energy and nutrient flows through the system compared to one without a
   consumer. Here we extend this analysis to examine energy and nutrient
   flows, and the density and number of species in ecosystems at
   evolutionarily stable equilibrium (EVSE). To implement the analysis, we
   first clarify the difference between ECSE and EVSE, and extend the idea
   of evolutionarily stable strategies as implemented to biological
   communities to include the non-animated parts of the ecosystem. In a
   game theoretic sense, this is equivalent to adding external inputs to
   the game. EVSE solutions of our model ecosystem resulted in frequently
   observed trends. For example, of two competing producers, one has
   smaller density, grows faster, is more nutritious to the consumer, and
   cycles nutrients faster than the other. In both kinds of ecosystem
   conditions (ECSE and EVSE), adding producer species to a system with a
   consumer and producer increases the flow through the ecosystem. We also
   show that a consumer with a high ratio of return of nutrients to the
   decomposer compartment compared to the losses to the ecosystem from the
   consumer compartment cannot co-exist with producers at EVSE. At EVSE,
   the presence of a consumer increases energy flows compared to systems
   without a consumer, in contrast to a system at ECSE, where the presence
   of a consumer decreases rates of energy flow. Finally, we interpret the
   dynamics of the strategies in the context of periodic input to the
   ecosystem. We show that strategies can be out of phase, thus enabling,
   for example, species to exploit a resource more (or less) efficiently at
   different times.}},

Abstract = {{Two field experiments were conducted to study the effect of overhead
   sprinkling irrigation on oospore formation by the late blight fungus
   Phytophthora infestans in potato. Total rain (natural + sprinkling)
   accumulated in treatments of experiment 1 (winter 1997 to 1998) were
   765, 287, and 219 mm and treatments of experiment 2 (winter 1999 to
   2000) were 641, 193, and 129 mm. Sporangia from 11 isolates of P.
   infestans were combined in eight pairs, seven of A1 and A2 and one of A2
   and A2 mating type, and were sprayed on field-grown potato crops (42
   plants per plot at 7 m(2) each) and examined for their ability to form
   oospores in the host tissues. In experiment 1, oospores were recorded in
   a total of 132 of 1,680 leaflets (7.9\%), 24 of 105 stems, and 2 of 90
   tubers. In experiment 2, oospores were recorded in 40 of 519 leaflets
   (7.7\%), but not in any of the 90 stems or the 45 tubers examined. Both
   the proportion of leaflets containing oospores and the number of
   oospores per leaflet increased with time after inoculation and were
   dependent on the rain regime, the position of leaves on the plant, and
   the isolate pair combination. In both field trials, increasing the
   rainfall significantly enhanced oospore production in leaves. Leaf
   samples collected from the soil surface had significantly more oospores
   than those collected from the midcanopy. Two pairs in experiment 1 were
   more fertile than the others, whereas the pair used in experiment 2 was
   the least fertile. The total number of oospores per leaflet usually
   ranged from 10 to 100 in experiment 1, but only from 2 to 10 in
   experiment 2. Maximal oospore counts in the field were 200 and 50 in
   experiments 1 and 2, respectively, but ranged from approximate to 2,000
   to 12,000 oospores per leaflet in detached leaves in the laboratory. We
   concluded that P. infestans can produce oospores in the foliage of
   field-grown potato crops, especially when kept wet by regular overhead
   sprinkling irrigation, but production was far below that in the
   laboratory.}},

Abstract = {{Laser surface melting (LSM) were carried out in three types of stainless

   passivity stage and lower passive current density than the substrate.
   These improvements are achieved by means of a modified surface layer,
   more homogeneous with a fine cellular dendritic structure free of large
   precipitates. Nevertheless, the corrosion resistance depends critically
   on the laser processing parameters, particularly for the cases of
   ferritic and martensitic stainless steels. Therefore, care must be taken

   shared the ferrous pathway but had no effect on cellular uptake of

   via beta(3)-integrin and mobilferrin (IMP), whereas ferrous iron uptake
   was facilitated by divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT-1; Nramp-2). These
   conclusions were documented by competitive inhibition studies,
   utilization of a beta(3)-integrin antibody that blocked uptake of ferric
   but not ferrous iron, development of an anti-DMT-1 antibody that blocked
   ferrous iron and manganese uptake but not ferric iron, transfection of
   DMT-1 DNA into tissue culture cells that showed enhanced uptake of
   ferrous iron and manganese but neither ferric iron nor zinc, hepatic
   metal concentrations in mk mice showing decreased iron and manganese but
   not zinc or copper, and data showing that the addition of reducing
   agents to tissue culture media altered iron binding to proteins of the

   ferrous iron can enter cells via different pathways, they do not

Abstract = {{Plasma insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentrations were related
   to hepatic levels of IGF-I mRNA measured by competitive reverse
   transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (RT-PCR) in neonatal (8 d
   old) calves, veal calves, fattened castrated bulls and mature intact
   bulls. Furthermore, the presence of mRNAs of IGF-II and of receptors for
   IGF-I (ICF-IR), growth hormone (GHR) and insulin (IR), as well as mRNAs
   of IGF binding proteins (IGFBP-1, -2 and -3) were assessed by RT-PCR.
   Hepatic ICF-I mRNA levels and plasma IGF-I concentrations in veal
   calves, fattened castrated bulls and in intact bulls were 4 to 8 times
   higher than in 8-d old calves and were 2 to 3 times higher in calves fed
   colostrum than in calves fed only milk replacer. Hepatic IGF-I mRNA
   concentrations were closely correlated (r = 0.92) with plasma IGF-I
   concentrations, suggesting that hepatic IGF-I production largely
   determines plasma IGF-I levels. The presence of ICF II, IGF-IR, GHR, IR
   and IGFBP-1, -2 and -3 mRNA was confirmed in the liver of 8-d old calves
   and older cattle as well, and among newborn calves their presence was
   independent of differences in nutrition. In conclusion, the major
   hepatic components of the GH-IGF axis were present in neonatal calves,
   but the IGF-I expression and therefore also plasma IGF-I levels were
   relatively low. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rotavirus is the major cause of diarrhea among young infants in both
   humans and animals, Immune protection of newborns by vaccination is
   difficult to achieve since there is not enough time to mount an immune
   response before exposure to the virus. We have designed a vaccination
   strategy mediating transfer of neutralizing antibodies from the mother
   to the offspring during pregnancy and/or lactation. Adult female mice
   were nasally immunized with virus-like particles (VLPs) made of viral
   proteins VP2 and 6 (VLP2/6) or VP 2, 6, and 7 (VLP2/6/7) derived from
   the RF rotavirus strain in the presence or absence of cholera toxin.
   Both vaccines elicited serum and milk antibodies against the respective
   VPs. Four days after parturition, suckling pups were challenged orally
   with RF rotavirus. Pups from mothers immunized with VLP2/6/7 but not
   VLP2/6 were protected against rotavirus diarrhea, indicating that VP7
   plays a key role in protection, Protection was mediated by milk rather
   than serum antibodies, and mucosal adjuvants were not required, In
   conclusion, VLPs containing VP7 administered nasally to mothers
   represent a promising vaccine candidate for the protection of suckling
   newborns against rotavirus-induced diarrhea, even in the absence of a
   mucosal adjuvant.}},

Title = {{Vascular repair after balloon overstretch injury in porcine model
   effects of intracoronary radiation}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of IR on
   thrombus formation and dissection repair following overstretch balloon
   injury in porcine coronary arteries.
   BACKGROUND Exposure of blood to the injured arterial wall after
   percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) induces thrombus
   formation and inflammation in the dissection plane. Neointima formation
   is related to smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration into
   the preformed thrombus. Intracoronary radiation (IR) with doses of 10 to
   25 Gy using either beta or gamma emitters can prevent neointima
   accumulation by reducing SMC proliferation. However, there are some
   indications that IR may delay the process of dissection repair after
   PTCA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of IR on
   thrombus formation and dissection repair after overstretch balloon
   injury in porcine coronary arteries.
   METHODS Forty porcine coronaries were injured by balloon overstretch
   followed by either 0 or 18 Gy of Y-90 prescribed to 1.2 mm from the
   balloon center. The animals were euthanized 14 days after treatment, and
   intimal area (IA) and IA corrected for medial fracture length (IA/FL)
   were quantified by digital image analysis. Dissections were quantified
   by tracing the length, thickness and area behind the dissection flap.
   The rate of dissections was calculated for each group. Thrombi were
   identified and designated as intraluminal thrombus or thrombus within
   dissection planes (mural thrombus), and area measurements were obtained.
   RESULTS The irradiated group showed a significant reduction of IA/FL
   (0.55 +/- 0.29 vs. 0.05 +/- 0.09; p < 0.001). No difference was observed
   in the rare of dissection between control and irradiated arteries (77\%
   vs. 88\%, respectively). The control group showed a smaller dissection
   area (0.19 +/- 0.28 mm(2) vs. 0.32 +/- 0.29 mm;p < 0.05) with smaller
   mural thrombi (0.03 +/- 0.01 mm(2) vs. 0.29 +/- 0.30 mm2; p < 0.001). A
   strong correlation between dissection area and neointima area was
   observed only in the control group (R-2 = 0.474; p < 0.003; alpha(0.05)
   = 0.862). A positive correlation between mural thrombus and dissection
   area was observed only in the irradiated group (R-2 = 0.889; p < 0.001;
   alpha(0.05) = 1.00).
   CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the dissection area may be a
   useful parameter by which to quantify the extent of injury and repair
   after IR and may indicate an incomplete healing process after IR at this
   time point. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2000;36:1389-95) (C) 2000 by the American

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{651-659}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids (GCs) with or
   without chronically administered oral GCs are often used in children
   with severe persistent asthma, the adverse effects associated with their
   use have not been well-described in this patient population. Objective:
   We sought to determine the CC-induced adverse effects profile of older
   children with severe persistent asthma,
   Methods: A chart review of 163 consecutive children 9 years of age or
   older admitted to National Jewish for difficult to control asthma was
   done.
   Results: The population studied consisted mostly of adolescents (mean
   +/- SD age, 14.4 +/- 2.1 years) with severe asthma receiving high-dose
   inhaled GC therapy (1675 +/- 94 mug/d) and averaging 6 systemic GC
   bursts per year. 50\% required chronic oral GC therapy. CC-associated
   adverse effects were common and included hypertension (88\%), cushingoid
   features (66\%), adrenal suppression (56\%), myopathy (50\%), osteopenia
   (46\%), growth suppression (39\%), obesity and hypercholesterolemia
   (30\%), and cataracts (14\%), Height standard deviation scores of -0.44,
   -1.22, and -0.93 for those receiving intermittent, alternate day, and
   daily oral GCs, respectively, were smaller (less suppressed) than
   published values from the same institution before inhaled GC therapy
   (standard deviation scores of -1.26, -1.91, and -1.95, respectively).
   Osteopenia was strongly associated with growth suppression (odds ratio,
   5.6; confidence interval, 2.7-11.8; P <.0001) and was found to be more
   common in female than male subjects, even after correcting for short
   stature (42\% vs 18\%, P <.006),
   Conclusions: CC-associated adverse effects are still unacceptably common
   among children with severe asthma, even in those not receiving
   chronically administered oral GC therapy yet receiving high-dose Inhaled
   GCs. Therefore close monitoring and proper intervention are warranted,
   especially in female subjects, who appear to be at greater risk for
   osteopenia. There is clearly a need to consider alternative therapy or
   earlier intervention. The magnitude of growth suppression, while still a
   problem, appeared to be less severe with the addition of inhaled GC
   therapy. This observation suggests that high-dose inhaled GC therapy, by
   affording better asthma control and allowing less use of systemic
   therapy, has attenuated the growth-suppressive effects of poorly
   controlled asthma.}},

Abstract = {{This note re-examines the survey data gathered by the Members of
   Parliament Project (MPP) on the attitudes of British parliamentarians
   towards European integration. Central to the analysis of the MPP is the
   idea that within the parties there is at work a dramatic cohort effect:
   long-serving Labour MPs are Eurosceptic, but the more recently elected
   Labour MPs are pro-European; whilst long-serving Conservative MPs are
   pro-European, but the more recently elected are Eurosceptic. The MPP
   have argued that this cohort effect began at different times in each
   party: in 1979 for the Conservatives and in 1987 for Labour. This note
   finds that whilst this is (largely) true for the Conservatives, it is
   not true for Labour. According to the MPP's own data, pro-European
   Labour MPs began entering the House of Commons in 1979, 8 years - and
   two elections - before the MPP have argued.}},

Title = {{The perception of available social support is related to reduced
   cardiovascular reactivity in phase II cardiac rehabilitation patients}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Objective Numerous studies have observed a relationship between social
   support (SS) and post coronary event survival. Laboratory research
   suggests one mechanism regulating this relationship may be exaggerated
   cardiovascular reactivity (CVR). What has not been as well explored is
   (1) whether the SS-CVR relationship holds up for a heart diseased
   sample, and (2) whether this relationship is evidenced only in
   supportive environments or can be found as a function of generalized
   perception of being socially supported. Thus, the purpose of this study
   was to examine the relationship of perceived SS and a locally supportive
   presence to CVR to a speech-induced stressor in post coronary event
   patients.
   Method Forty-one Phase II cardiac rehabilitation patients participated
   in a research protocol that consisted of BP and HR measurement during
   two identical affective stress interviews where local support was
   systematically varied by presence or absence of a friendly small pet
   dog. Perception of SS was assessed by completion of psychosocial
   questionnaire packet that included measures of SS, anger expression and
   pet attachment.
   Results Repeated measures ANCOVAs revealed that patients who believed
   they had greater SS available to them during difficult times exhibited
   significantly less CVR for MAP (p<.007) and DBP (p<.024). No significant
   main effects for local support (pet presence) and no interactions
   between local and perceived support were found.
   Conclusions These findings are of interest as they: (a) demonstrate an
   association between reduced CVR and higher (amounts of) SS in a clinical
   sample; (b) demonstrate this effect in a sample medicated to dampen CV
   levels and surges; (c) suggest that perceived amount of SS provides an
   ameliorative influence on CVR independent of situational support; (d)
   suggest that for certain conditions pet-models of support may be
   ineffective at establishing an local support presence.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Adipogenesis contributes to the pathogenesis of thyroid eye
   disease (TED). Thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) transcripts are present in
   orbital fat. This study was conducted to determine whether they are
   expressed as functional protein, and if so, whether this is restricted
   to TED orbits or to a particular stage in adipocyte differentiation.
   METHODS. Samples of fat were obtained from 18 TED-affected orbits and 4
   normal orbits, and 9 were obtained from nonorbital locations. Frozen
   sections were examined by immunocytochemistry using monoclonal
   antibodies specific for the human TSHR. Samples were disaggregated and
   the preadipocytes separated from the mature by differential
   centrifugation and cultured in serum-free or DM and examined for
   morphologic changes, oil red O and TSHR staining, and TSH-induced cyclic
   adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production.
   RESULTS. Marked immunoreactivity was observed in frozen sections from
   all three TED samples and faint staining in both normal orbital fat
   samples. in vitro, 1\% to 5\% of preadipocytes displayed TSHR
   immunoreactivity in five of six TED and two of three normal orbital
   samples and in three of five nonorbital samples. Differentiation, was
   induced in all 14 orbital samples. Three of four nonorbital samples
   contained occasional differentiated cells. Fifty percent to 70\% of
   differentiating cells demonstrated receptor immunoreactivity. Two of
   three TED and four of four nonorbital preadipocytes in DM and/or mature
   adipocytes displayed a TSH-mediated increase in cAMP.
   CONCLUSIONS. The results indicate that orbital fat TSHR transcripts are
   expressed as protein, which can be functional. This is not aberrant in
   TED orbits, although expression may be upregulated. The majority of
   preadipocytes undergoing differentiation express the receptor,
   indicating a key role for this population in one mechanism for
   increasing orbital volume.}},

Abstract = {{A simple rapid procedure for preparation of large quantities of highly

   competition between proteins for resin sites was created. Owing to its
   high negative charge density, ovalbumin drives other egg white proteins
   from the column progressively. Two hundred and fifty milliliters of
   Q-Sepharose FF gel eluted isocratically with 0.5 M NaCl extracted 9.55 g
   of ovalbumin with a purity rate of 83\%. A 6.75 g amount of ovalbumin,

Abstract = {{Aim: To investigate the accumulation of highly phosphorylated guanosine
   nucleotides in Staphylococcus aureus 8325-4 following nutrient
   deprivation.
   Methods and Results: Nutrient shiftdown of Staph. aureus HPLC of
   nucleotides and Western blotting of cell-free extracts, ppGpp rapidly
   accumulated when cells were deprived of isoleucine following addition of
   mupirocin, or after carbon deprivation. In contrast, total amino acid
   starvation led to delayed production of ppGp, which suggests that Staph.
   aureus exhibits a unique response to total amino acid deprivation
   compared with other eubacteria. Intracellular ppGp was observed at high
   levels under all starvation conditions, which suggests that this
   nucleotide is linked to nutrient limitation and may therefore be
   involved in regulating the stringent response in Staph. aureus. pppGpp
   was not observed under any nutrient-limiting condition. Western blot
   analysis of whole-cell extracts from Staph. aureus 8325-4, showed that
   antibodies to RelA and SpoT cross-reacted under conditions that detected
   these proteins in Escherichia coli.
   Conclusions: Staph. aureus produces ppGpp and ppGp following nutrient
   limitation. Immunological analysis indicates that Staph. aureus contains
   RelA and SpoT proteins, similar to those produced by E. coli.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This study provides a new example

   adjacency matrix of Gamma, and where E-i{*} denotes the projection onto
   the ith subconstituent of Gamma with respect to x. Let W denote an
   irreducible T-module. W is said to be thin whenever dim E-i{*} less than
   or equal to 1 (0 less than or equal to i less than or equal to d). The
   endpoint of W is min(i\textbackslash{} E-i{*}W not equal 0). It is known
   that a thin irreducible T-module of endpoint 2 has dimension d - 3, d -
   2, or d - i.
   Gamma is said to be 2-homogeneous whenever for all i (1 less than or

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the causes of changes in
   acoustic emission (AE) signals corresponding to changes in grain
   orientation in routing. Both the AE signals and the state of cutting
   process were recorded on high-speed video cameras in an attempt to
   clarify the relationships between them. Based on the results, it
   appeared that generated AE was closely related to the state of cutting,
   as well as the surface finish. The greater the AE, the more severe the
   cutting performance for inclination angles. The greatest AE was
   generated when machining failures - fuzzy grains - were produced.
   Concerning the annual ring angle, the AE count rate, lowest at 0
   degrees, slightly increased until 75 degrees, and then rapidly reached
   its maximum at 90 degrees. Changes in the slope angle had also an effect
   on the AE signal. The AE count rate, highest at the 0 degrees, gradually
   decreased until 75-105 degrees, and then increased to reach its maximum
   at 180 degrees. Moreover, there were correlations between the AE count
   rate and surface roughness. Therefore, acoustic emission has shown
   promise for the monitoring of the surface roughness including various

   and the responses were qualitatively analyzed and classified into
   themes. For the whole sample, the main themes mentioned were: the
   function of alcohol and drugs in their lives (50\%), the etiology of
   dependence (32\%) and reasons for initial use (21\%). Patients dependent
   on alcohol associated their use with coping, while patients dependent on
   other drugs reported pleasure seeking. In regard to etiology, most
   patients classified their dependence as a habit. Patients dependent on
   alcohol tended to attribute an organic etiology to their problem, while
   those dependent on other drugs most frequently considered moral aspects
   as important, This study suggests that there are differences between
   these three groups in the appraisal of their problem. Professionals
   interested in treatment matching need to take these findings into
   account, as they may influence compliance and treatment outcome.}},

Abstract = {{After the ostentation of the pre-war period ceremonies, the First World
   War raised the question of the meaning of the slaughters and of their
   memory. As early as 1915, the regime organized its own commemoration to
   comfort the morale of the people at the back and justify the sacrifice
   of tis children. The celebration of the `Marne Victory' was a forerunner
   of the post-war celebrations and of `11 November.' Organized around a
   sacralized space, it was at the origin of a `war memory' compounded of
   religiosity and power stakes. By turning the `Marne miracle' and Peguy's
   death into an instrument, the Republic turned the celebration into the
   vessel of the passions of the time. It became the tilt-yard of the
   opposition between the leagues and the regime, watched by a French
   population haunted by memory and troubled by the communists' and
   leagues' novelties. The management of the war inheritance, the
   omnipresence of the leagues, the scenography and the incidents that took
   place during these ceremonies announced the 1940 collapse, the
   `brutalization' of the war memory and the blurring of the collective
   landmarks of the thirties.}},

Abstract = {{Fifty-two Targhee twin-bearing ewes were used in a factorial arrangement
   of treatments to investigate the role of supplemental vitamin E (vit E);
   0 (NE) vs 400 IU of vit E.ewe.(-1)d(-1) (E) and parainfluenza type 3
   (PI3) vaccination; none (NP) vs PI3 vaccination (P) in immune function.
   Parainifluenza type 3 vaccination was used to evoke an immune response.
   Ewes receiving PI3 were vaccinated at 49 and 21 d before the expected
   lambing date. Ewes receiving vit E were orally dosed daily, 32 to 0 d
   before lambing. Blood was collected from ewes at the time of the initial
   PI3 vaccination and 4 h postpartum. Blood was collected from lambs (n =
   104) at 3 d postpartum. Ewe and lamb sera were analyzed for anti-PI3
   antibody titers, immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers, and vit E
   concentrations. Colostrum was collected 4 h postpartum and analyzed for
   IgG. The model for ewe and lamb analysis included the main effects of
   vit E and PI3, sex (lambs model only), and their interactions. No
   interactions were detected (P > 0.20) for any ewe or lamb variables.
   Serum anti-PI3 titers were greater (P < 0.01) in P ewes and their lambs
   than NP ewes and their lambs. Serum vit E concentrations were greater (P
   < 0.01) in E ewes and their lambs than NE: ewes and their lambs.
   Colostral IgG titers and serum anti-PI3 titers did not differ (P > 0.20)
   between E and NE ewes. Serum IgG titers in E ewes and their lambs did
   not differ (P > 0.15) from IgG titers in NE ewes and their lambs. Lamb
   anti-PI3 titers did not differ (P = 0.76) between lambs reared by E and
   NE ewes. These results indicate that, although supplemental vit E to the
   ewe increased lamb serum vit E concentration, it had no effect on
   measures used in this study to assess humoral immunity in the ewe or
   passive immunity to the lamb.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: In this study, we examined the effects of greater than ad
   libitum rates of fluid intake on 2-h running performances. Methods:
   Eight male distance runners performed three runs on a treadmill at 65\%
   of peak oxygen uptake ((V) over dot O-2 peak) for 90 min and then ran
   ``as far as possible{''} in 30 min in an air temperature of 25 degrees
   C, a relative humidity of 55\% and a wind speed of 13-15 km.h(-1).
   During the runs, the subjects drank a 6.9\% carbohydrate
   (CHO)-electrolyre solution either ad libitum or in set volumes of 150 or
   350 mL.70 kg(-1) body mass (similar to 130 or 300 mL) every 15-20 min.
   Results: Higher (similar to 0.9 vs 0.4 L.h(-1)) rates of fluid intake in
   the 350 mL.70 kg(-1) trial than in the other trials had minimal effects
   on the subjects' urine production (similar to 0.1 L.h(-1)), sweat rates
   (similar to 1.2 L.h(-1)), declines in plasma volume (similar to 8\%),
   and rises in serum osmolality (similar to 5 mosmol.L-1) and Na+
   concentrations (similar to 7 mEq.L-1). A greater (similar to 1.0 vs 0.5
   g.min(-1)) rate of CHO ingestion in the 350 mL.70 kg(-1) trial than in
   the other trials also did not affect plasma concentrations of glucose
   (similar to 5 mmol.L-1) and lactate (similar to 3 mmol.L-1) during the
   performance runs. In all three performance runs, increases in running
   speeds from similar to 14 to 15-16 km.h(-1) and rises in exercise
   intensities from similar to 65\% to 75\% of (V) over dot O-2 (peak)
   elevated plasma lactate concentrations from similar to 1.5 to 3 mmol.L-1
   and accelerated CHO oxidation from similar to 13 to 15 mmol.min(-1). The
   only effect of the additional intake of similar to 1.0 L of fluid in the
   350 mL.70 kg(-1) trial was to produce such severe gastrointestinal
   discomfort that two of the eight subjects failed to complete their
   performance runs. Conclusion: Greater rates of fluid ingestion had no
   measurable effects on plasma volume and osmolality and did not improve
   2-h running performances in a 25 degrees C environment.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether regional differences in early neonatal
   morbidity in a national cohort of very low-birthweight (VLBW) infants
   persisted at 7-8 years of age.
   Methods: Perinatal data collected prospectively from birth on all VLBW
   infants born in New Zealand in 1986 and admitted to a neonatal unit
   included the hospital principally caring for the infant: hospitals A-D
   being level III hospitals and `Other' including the smallest level III
   and all level II hospitals. At 7-8 years of age, 298 surviving children
   (96\% survivors living in New Zealand) were assessed at a home visit.
   Parents were given a comprehensive questionnaire to complete, the
   children underwent a visual examination and were tested with the Revised
   Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and the child's teacher was
   sent a questionnaire to complete.
   Results: Neonatal survival was significantly greater in the two largest
   hospitals (A and B) and this difference in survival remained at 7-8
   years of age after adjustment for perinatal factors (P < 0.05). There
   were no differences between hospitals in risks of long-term
   sensorineural disability and behavioural or educational outcomes. There
   were interhospital differences in rates of visual problems and, after
   adjustment for confounding factors, there remained a marginally
   significant (P = 0.06) increased risk of myopia in hospital D.
   Conclusions: Despite differences in early morbidity favouring larger
   hospitals, there were no substantive differences in long-term (7-8
   years) outcomes across a range of measures in this national cohort of
   VLBW infants.}},

Abstract = {{Several agents, such as (ReO4)-Re-188 -, Re-188-MAG(3) and Re-188-DTPA
   are currently under investigation as radiation sources in Liquid-filled
   balloons for prevention of restenosis following coronary angioplasty.
   Bearing in mind the risk factor associated with leakage of radioactivity
   in the event of balloon rupture, the criteria sought in selecting
   suitable agents for endovascular radiation therapy (EVRT) are rapid
   clearance and low dose to vital organs. Since Tc-99(m) labelled ethylene
   dicysteine (EC) is a well established agent for renal tubular function
   imaging, the use of Re-186-ethylene dicysteine as a potential agent for
   prevention of restenosis after angioplasty has been evaluated
   previously. Therefore, it was of interest to evaluate the applicability
   of the more potential isotope of rhenium, Re-188, a high energy beta
   -emitter (E-beta max = 2.12 MeV) with a suitable T-1/2 = 16.9 h,
   Obtainable carrier-free from the W-188-Re-188 generator, as an
   attractive and alternative radionuclide for labelling with L,L-EC. in
   this paper, the preparation and pharmacological behaviour of the Re-188
   complex of ethylene dicysteine are reported. The complex can be prepared
   in high yields (99.5\%) under optimized conditions of pH 2-3, at a
   ligand concentration of 15 mM, 50 mug (0.18 mM) carrier rhenium and
   using 2 mg.mL(-1) stannous chloride. On storage at 4 degreesC, the RC
   purity was more than 97\% after 48 h when prepared under optimum
   conditions. Biodistribution studies in Wistar rats showed the desired
   characteristics of fast blood clearance and low retention of activity in
   the vital organs (<2\% in intestine, <1\% in stomach, <0.5\% in Liver)
   with a high renal excretion (90.65 +/- 0.6\%) at 3 h post-injection.
   These results confirm the advantages of using the Re-188-EC complex
   compared with perrhenate and other rhenium radiopharmaceuticals
   currently being used in balloons for EVRT. ((C) 2000 Lippincott Williams

Abstract = {{The benefits of coronary reperfusion and antiplatelet therapy for
   patients with Q-wave acute myocardial infarction (Q-AMI) ore well
   established in the context of randomized, controlled trials. The use and
   recent impact of these and other therapies on the broader, communitywide
   population of patients with Q-AMI is less well established. Residents of
   the Worcester, Massachusetts, metropolitan area (1990 census population
   437,000) hospitalized with confirmed Q-AMI in all metropolitan
   Worcester, Massachusetts, hospitals in 4 1-year periods between 1986 and
   1997 comprised the sample of interest. We examined the rates of
   occurrence, use of reperfusion strategies, and hospital mortality in a
   cohort of 711 patients with Q-AMI treated early in the reperfusion era
   (1986 and 1988) in comparison to 669 patients with Q-AMI treated a
   decode later (1995 and 1997). The percentage of Q-AMI among all
   hospitalized patients with AMI decreased over the decade of reperfusion
   therapy: 52\% in 1986 and 1988 versus 35\% in 1995 and 1997 (p < 0.001).
   Use of reperfusion therapy for patients with Q-AMI increased from 22\%
   to 57\%, with a marked increase in the use of primary angioplasty over
   time (1\% vs 16\%). The profile of patients receiving reperfusion
   therapy also changed significantly over the study period. Marked
   increases in use of antiplatelet therapy, p blockers,
   angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and decreased use of calcium
   channel blockers, were observed over time. The crude in-hospital case
   fatality rate declined from 19\% (1986 and 1988) to 14\% (1995 and 1997)
   in patients with Q-AMI. Results of a multivariable regression analysis
   showed lack of reperfusion therapy, older age, anterior wall AMI, and
   cardiogenic shock to be independent predictors of in-hospital mortality
   in patients with Q-AMI. Thus, the percentage of all AMI's presenting as
   Q-AMI, and hospital mortality after Q-AMI, has decreased significantly
   in the past 10 years. The decrease in mortality occurs in the setting of
   broader use of reperfusion and adjunctive therapy (including primary
   angioplasty). (C) 2000 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Standard two-step freezing protocols are unsatisfactory for Euglena
   gracilis and many other microalgae, particularly those with larger cell
   sizes, complex morphologies and/or those susceptible to environmental
   stress. Using techniques that allow mechanisms of injury and sites of
   damage to be identified (e.g. monitoring oxygen evolving capacity,
   detection of (OH)-O-., microscopic visualisation of intracellular ice
   and structural/ultrastructural damage), it is possible to improve
   conventional cryopreservation methodologies. In E. gracilis this has
   resulted in the development of protocols which increased post-thaw
   viability levels from 0 to 20\%. Alternative cryoprotection strategies
   tested included vitrification and encapsulation/dehydration.
   Vitrification was unsuccessful due to the high toxicity of the
   solutions. Encapsulation/dehydration, with or without two-step cooling
   were suitable for cryopreservation of E. gracilis, the latter resulted
   in the highest levels of post-thaw viability (40\%) and viability was
   maintained after 12 months storage.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To investigate variations in speed, duration and acceleration
   rate of the Cytospin 3 cytocentrifuge (Shannon, scientific Ltd.,
   Astmoor, England) on the differential cell count of bronchoalveolar
   lavage (BAL)fluid samples.
   STUDY DESIGN: BAL fluid samples (n=51) were cytocentrifuged at various
   combinations of speed (500, 1,200 and 2,000 rpm), acceleration rate
   (low, medium and high) and duration (5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes). The
   preparations were May-Grunwald-Giemsa stained and differentiated on 500
   cells. Data were analyzed try mixed model repeated measurements ANOVA.
   RESULTS: The mean lymphocyte count was significantly higher at 1,200 rpm
   than at 500 rpm, whereas the macrophage count decreased. Between 1,200
   and 2,000 rpm, the number of both cell types stabilized. Significantly
   higher numbers of lymphocytes were recorded at 20 and 15 minutes of
   cytocentrifugation than at 5 minutes. The acceleration rate did not
   influence the differential cell count. Seventeen BAL fluid samples were
   selected to test the diagnostic impact of cell damage using a validated
   computer program. bz 1 of 17 samples the predicted diagnosis did not
   correspond between two different speeds (500 and 2,000 rpm).
   CONCLUSION: Variations in cytocentrifugation speed and duration affected
   the mean lymphocyte and macrophage counts of BAL fluid samples.}},

   LDL(-), isolated by anion-exchange chromatography, differed from
   nonelectronegative LDL {[}LDL(+)] in its higher triglyceride,
   nonesterified fatty acid, apoprotein E and apoprotein C-III, and sialic
   acid contents. No evidence of extensive oxidation was found in LDL(-);
   its antioxidant and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances contents
   were similar to those of LDL(+) However, conjugated dienes were
   increased in LDL(-), which suggests that mild oxidation might affect
   these particles. LDL(-) increased, in a concentration-dependent manner,
   the release of IL-8 and MCP-1 by ECs and was a stronger inductor of both
   chemokines than oxidized LDL (oxLDL) or LDL(+), PAI-1 release increased
   slightly in ECs incubated with both LDL(-) and oxLDL but not with
   LDL(+). However, no cytotoxic effects of LDL(-) were observed on ECs,
   Actinomycin D inhibited the release of IL-8 and MCP-1 induced by LDL(-)
   and oxLDL by up to 80\%, indicating that their production is mediated by
   protein synthesis. Incubation of ECs with N-acetyl cysteine inhibited
   production of IL-8 and MCP-1 induced by LDL(-) and oxLDL by >50\%. The
   free radical scavenger butylated hydroxytoluene slightly inhibited the
   effect of oxLDL but did not modify the effect of LDL(-). An antagonist
   (BN-50730) of the platelet-activating factor receptor inhibited
   production of both chemokines by LDL(-) and oxLDL in a
   concentration-dependent manner. Our results indicate that LDL(-) shows
   proinflammatory activity on ECs and may contribute to early
   atherosclerotic events.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with suspected pulmonary embolism often receive heparin therapy
   for hours to days before ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy is
   completed. We assessed to what extent the lung scan classification and
   pulmonary vascular perfusion changed over a period of 2-4 days of full
   anticoagulant therapy. In 312 consecutive patients with at least one
   segmental perfusion defect on the initial perfusion scan, classification
   of both the initial and the final lung scan allowed us to study
   alteration in scan classification. Changes in pulmonary perfusion were
   assessed scintigraphically in a subgroup of 64 patients with proven
   pulmonary embolism. Among 79 patients with an initial high-probability
   lung scan, the final scan remained high probability in 77 whereas it
   became non-diagnostic and normal in one patient each. The lung scan
   classification did not change in any of the 233 patients who initially
   had a non-diagnostic scan. Thus, a different lung scan category was
   observed in only 2 out of 312 patients (0.6\%; 95\% CI 0.1\%-2.3\%). The
   mean pulmonary perfusion at baseline in the subgroup of 64 patients with
   pulmonary embolism was 62\% (SD +/-17\%; range 26\%-89\%). A mean
   absolute improvement in pulmonary perfusion of only 4\%+/-11\% (NS) was
   observed in the 2-4 days of observation. It is concluded that
   intravenous heparin therapy for a period of 2-4 days has only a minimal
   influence on the diagnostic lung scan classification and induces only
   minor changes in pulmonary vascular obstruction in the majority of
   patients.}},

   from cases of enteric disease, bacteremia and pneumonic illness. In the
   biliary tract, the presence of Helicobacter bills, Helicobacter pullorum

Abstract = {{Objectives: Second-generation triptans are believed to have fewer
   cardiovascular effects than sumatriptan. This was investigated in vivo
   by comparing the vascular effects of equipotent therapeutic dosages of
   selective 5-HT1B/1D-receptor agonists.
   Methods: Sixteen patients with migraine headaches completed a
   double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way crossover study. With
   ultrasonography and applanation tonometry used 1.5 hours after the oral
   intake of sumatriptan (50 mg), rizatriptan (10 mg), zolmitriptan (2.5
   mg), or placebo arterial vessel wall properties, blood flow and pressure
   waveforms were measured in common carotid, brachial, and temporal
   arteries. At the brachial artery flow-induced vasodilation (an
   endothelium-dependent process) was evaluated, and blood pressures were
   recorded.
   Results: Mean arterial pressure, 91 +/- 2 mm Hg after placebo, increased
   (P < .05) by 4\% to 6\% after administration of each triptan. Each
   active treatment decreased (P < .001) both brachial and carotid artery
   diameter. Isobaric compliance of the brachial artery, 0.077 +/- 0.010
   mm(2)/kPa after placebo, decreased (P < .01) by 11\% +/- 8\%, 11\% +/-
   11\%, and 23\% +/- 7\% after administration of sumatriptan, rizatriptan,
   and zolmitriptan, respectively. Isobaric compliance of the carotid
   artery was 1.31 +/- 0.10 mm(2)/kPa after placebo (no change).
   Zolmitriptan was the only triptan that decreased temporal artery
   diameter significantly (by 12\% +/- 3\%, P < .001). The resistance of
   the temporal artery vascular bed increased after administration of
   sumatriptan (by 26\% +/- 11\%, P < .05) and zolmitriptan (by 40\% +/-
   9\%, P = .001). Flow-induced vasodilation was unaffected.
   Conclusions: Selective 5-HT1B/1D-receptor agonists induce
   vasoconstriction and decrease compliance of conduit arteries. These
   effects are more pronounced at muscular (temporal, brachial) compared
   with elastic (carotid) arteries. Resistance is only increased at the
   temporal artery vascular bed, suggesting cranioselectivity for
   resistance vessels. Endothelial function is not differently affected by
   any of the triptans tested.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous polymer two-phase partitioning was used to obtain a plasma
   membrane-enriched fraction from coats of developing pea (Pisum sativum
   L.) seeds in the filling stage. Uptake of amino acids and sucrose by
   vesicles from this fraction was determined after imposition of gradients
   of proton concentration (Delta pH, inside alkaline) and electrical
   potential (Delta psi, inside negative) across the vesicle membrane. The
   uptake of sucrose and the amino acids L-valine, L-lysine, and L-glutamic
   acid was stimulated by the imposition of Delta pH. The imposition of
   Delta psi, either in the presence or in the absence of Delta pH,
   stimulated the uptake of L-valine and L-lysine, but had no detectable
   effect on the uptake of sucrose and L-glutamic acid. The
   proton-motive-force-driven uptake of all four substrates was abolished
   by the protonophore carbonyl-cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP).
   The results demonstrate the presence of H(+)-symporters for sucrose and
   amino acids in pea seed coats. This is running counter to the previously
   reported finding that their uptake by isolated pea seed coats was
   insensitive to CCCP, and that the uptake of sucrose, L-valine, and
   L-glutamic acid displayed linear kinetics. Possible causes of this
   discrepancy will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple sclerosis (MS) typically presents with a relapsing-remitting
   onset. This can be distinguished from primary progressive MS. Typical MS
   is characterized by a profound inflammatory reaction in which
   anti-inflammatory cycokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) and pro-inflammatory
   cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) may play a pivotal role. We tested
   the hypothesis that patients with MS have a distinct innate cytokine
   production that contributes to the susceptibility for and outcome of MS.
   The innate cytokine production of patients was estimated as the average
   production of cytokines in lipopolysaccharide -stimulated whole-blood
   cultures of 2 to 5 first-degree heathy family members. A total of 126
   family members of 50 patients with typical MS, 61 family members of 25
   patients with primary progressive MS, and 129 control subjects of 54
   families were enrolled in this study. We found that members of families
   with low IL-10 and high TNF production had a fourfold increased risk of
   developing typical MS compared with members of families with high IL-10
   and low TNF production. Patients with MS were eightfold more likely to
   develop typical MS than primary progressive MS when they belonged to
   families with low IL-10 and high TNF production. The presence of human
   leukocyte antigen-DR2 was associated with MS but not with TNF
   production. This study shows that typical MS is associated with an
   innate pro-inflammatory cytokine profile in contrast to primary
   progressive MS.}},

Volume = {{52}},

Pages = {{95-106}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated the in vitro conversion reaction in calcium
   phosphate cements (CPCs) containing octacalcium phosphate (OCP) as one
   of the reagents. OCP is known to be a precursor for apatite formation in
   vivo. The reaction products were characterized using infrared
   spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Although the conversion of OCP into
   hydroxyapatite is thermodynamically favorable, OCP only yields apatite
   formation in CPC provided it is combined with a highly soluble Ca2+ and
   OH releasing reaction partner. In this respect, tetracalcium phosphate
   is a promising compound. Adding small amounts of monocalcium phosphate
   monohydrate can stimulate the setting through intermediate brushite
   formation. The preparation method of OCP might drastically affect the
   performance of the cement. The reaction path of the setting of these CPC
   probably does not conform to the singular point principle described in
   the literature, and an in situ hydrolysis of OCP to apatite is
   conceivable. Simulation of apatite formation using OCP as the precursor
   and/or seed in CPC might be beneficial for some biomedical applications.

Abstract = {{An isophotal atlas of 75 star cluster pairs and multiplets in the Small

   concentrated in the SMC main body. The isophotal contours were made from
   Digitized Sky Survey{*} images and showed relevant structural features
   possibly related to interactions in about 25\% of the sample. Previous
   N-body simulations indicate that such shapes could be due to tidal
   tails, bridges or common envelopes. The diameter ratio between the
   members of a pair is preferentially in the range 1 - 2, with a peak at
   1, The projected separation is in the range approximate to 3 - 22 pc
   with a pronounced peak at approximate to 13 pc. For 91 objects ii mas
   possible to derive ages from Colour-Magnitude Diagrams using the OGLE-II
   photometric survey. The cluster multiplets in general occur in OB
   stellar associations and/or HII region complexes, This indicates a
   common origin and suggests that multiplets coalesce into pairs or single
   clusters in a short time scale. Pairs in the SMC appear to be mostly
   coeval and consequently captures are a rare phenomenon. We find evidence
   that star. cluster pairs and multiplets may have had an important role

Abstract = {{The problem of constructing a quantum theory of gravity has been tackled
   with very different strategies, most of which rely on the interplay

   mathematical side, a central role is played by combinatorial topology,
   often used to recover the space-time manifold from the other structures
   involved. An extremely attractive possibility is that of encoding all
   possible space-times as specific Feynman diagrams of a suitable field

   the intellectual currents dominant in the global discourse concerning
   social policy and social development. In particular the article argues
   that a combination of the World Bank's preference for a safety net and
   privatising strategy for welfare, the self interest of International
   NGOs in being providers of associated basic education, health and
   livelihood services, and the World Trade Organisation's gush for a
   global market in health, education and insurance services, is generating
   a set of global conditions which undermine the prospects for any
   alternative scenario of equitable public social provision. This
   disturbing trend is taking place within the context of an apparent shift

Abstract = {{A series of benzimidazo{[}2,1-a]isoquinolines with carboxamide side
   chains at the 1-, 6-, 9- and 11-positions were prepared, in order to
   study the biological effects of varying the position of the side chain
   in this tetracyclic series. The 6-, 9- and 11-analogues were obtained by
   modifications to published chemistry. The 1-carboxamide analogue was
   obtained via a one-pot isocoumarin/ isoquinolone conversion of
   3-methylisocoumarin-8-carboxylic acid with o-phenylenediamine in
   buffered aqueous acid, which gave the required 1-acid. The compounds
   were evaluated in a panel of cell lines in culture. The 6-carboxamides,
   where the side chain is attached to one of the central rings, were not
   active, but the 1- and 11-carboxamides, where the side chain is attached
   to one of the terminal rings off the chromophore short axis, were
   reasonably cytotoxic (IC(50)s < 1 muM). Overall, the structure-activity
   relationships are broadly in line with those seen with other tri- and
   tetracyclic carboxamides, and are consistent with recent crystal
   structure studies of acridine-4-carboxamides bound to DNA. The most
   potent 1-carboxamide was highly active in vivo against s,c, colon 38
   tumours in mice, providing a growth delay of 12 days.}},

Abstract = {{Five black Aspergillus strains (A. aculeatus, A. foetidus, A. japonicus,
   A. niger, and A. tubingensis) were cultivated on crude wheat
   arabinoxylan as the carbon source under defined pH, temperature, and

   remarkably within the obtained culture filtrates, of which eleven beta
   -glucosidases were isolated. Seven beta -glucosidases were purified to
   apparent electrophoretic homogeneity using anion-exchange and
   gel-permeation chromatography. They were found to be acidic proteins and
   most of them appeared to be glycoproteins with a molecular mass between
   93 and 142 kDa. Classification of the beta -glucosidases into four
   groups (I-A, I-B, II, and III) is suggested according to their
   physicochemical and biocatalytic properties. The major beta

   This is the first report on a T-cell signaling abnormality associated

Abstract = {{Objectives: To develop the first Spanish Pediatric Trauma Registry to
   collect and evaluate information concerning aspects of injuries in our
   pediatric population. Methods: From January 1995 to August 1998, 35,946
   children younger than 16 years were treated in our hospital for acute
   injury: 1500 were admitted and included in our database. Our file
   registry consists of 108 data points including: patient identification,
   type, place and mechanism of injury, pre-hospital care, transport,
   assessment on admission, severity scores, diagnostic studies, injuries,
   treatment morbidity and mortality. Results: Accidents were more frequent
   in males (68\%) than in females. The predominant age group was 12-15
   years of age (34\%). Accidents were more frequent in the street (35.1\%)
   than at home (18.9\%) or school (13\%). Falls and traffic-related
   accidents were the leading cause of injury (39\% and 21.2\%,
   respectively). Two hundred and thirty-five (15.7\%) had a Pediatric
   Trauma Score less than or equal to8. Fifty of these sustained multiple
   trauma (33\%) (Injury Severity Score greater than or equal to 15).
   Musculoskeletal and head trauma were the most frequent injuries (48.5\%
   and 42.0\%, respectively). Surgical or orthopedic procedures were
   performed in 906 patients (56.5\%). The average length of stay was 4.5
   days (range 1-93 days). Functional impairment in children older than 4
   years of age was found in 413 children (33.3\%). We encountered 7 deaths
   in the 1500 patients, or an overall mortality of 0.5\%. These 7 deaths
   were only seen in the I.S.S. greater than or equal to 15 group (50
   patients) with 14\% mortality. Conclusions: The goals of this Registry
   are to establish the epidemiology of our injured pediatric population,
   to review patient care, to develop prevention programs and to compare
   results with other centers so that potential deficiencies can be
   corrected.}},

Abstract = {{Burch colposuspension, which is the present gold standard for treatment
   of stress urinary incontinence, may be performed laparoscopically.
   Study aim: The aim of this retrospective study was to report the results
   of laparoscopic Burch colposuspension with a 30-month follow-up and to
   assess the reason for the unsuccessful results.
   Patients and method: From 1990 to 1999, 118 patients (mean age: 46
   years) were operated on for stress urinary incontinence with
   laparoscopic colposuspension. Urinary incontinence was classified grade
   1 (6\%), 2 (67\%) and 3 (27\%). The Burch colposuspension was performed
   through extraperitoneal approach in 51\% and transperitoneal in 49\%. A
   genital prolapse was associated in 31\% of the patients and treated with
   sacropexy. A subtotal hysterectomy was performed in 25\% of the patients
   and a vaginal hysterectomy in 46\%.
   Results: Global morbidity rate was 19\%, including four cases of bladder
   injury. With a 30-month follow-up, 76/118 (64.4\%) had no more urinary
   incontinence. Parity, age, previous pelvic surgery, detrusor instability
   and low urethral closure pressure were not predictive of recurrent
   stress urinary incontinence after treatment. Associated sacropexy was
   only correlated with a high risk of failure (P = 0.04). Patients with
   hysterectomy had significantly better results (72\% vs 41.9\%) (P =
   0.05). Trans- and extraperitoneal techniques had similar results (P =
   0.7).
   Conclusion: With a 30-month follow-up, 64.4\% of the patients had
   satisfactory results with strictly no more stress urinary incontinence.
   There was no significant difference between the trans- and the
   extraperitoneal approach. Sacropexy was only associated with a higher
   rate of failure. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier

Abstract = {{Strategic discourse and the use of force in the twentieth century have
   become increasingly virtual. Leading the way, as the dominant actor in
   global politics, is the United States, whose diplomatic and military
   policies are now based on technological and representational forms of
   discipline, deterrence, and compellence that could best be described as
   virtuous war. At the cyborg heart of virtuous war is the technical
   capability and ethical imperative to threaten and, if necessary,
   actualize violence from a distance-with no or minimal casualties. Using
   networked information and virtual technologies to bring `there' here in
   real time and with near-verisimilitude, virtuous war exercized a
   comparative as well as a strategic advantage for the digitally advanced.
   It has already become the `fifth dimension' of US global hegemony, with
   a very real gap opening between technological capability and strategic
   value on the one side, and theoretical understanding and ethical
   awareness on the other. There is a clear and present need to develop a
   virtual theory that can assess the perils and promises of this intimate

Abstract = {{We present the spatio-temporal distribution of more than 2000
   earthquakes that occurred during the Umbria-Marche seismic crisis,
   between September 26 and November 3, 1997. This distribution was
   obtained from recordings of a temporary network that was installed after
   the occurrence of the first two largest shocks (Mw =, 5.7, Mw = 6.0) of
   September 26. This network was composed of 27 digital 3-components
   stations densely distributed in the epicentral area. The aftershock
   distribution covers a region of about 40 km long and about 2 km wide
   along the NW-SE central Apennines chain. The activity is shallow, mostly
   located at less than 9 km depth. We distinguished three main zones of
   different seismic activity from NW to SE. The central zone, that
   contains the hypocenter of four earthquakes of magnitude larger than 5,
   was the more active and the more complex one. Sections at depth identify
   40-50 degrees dipping structures that agree well with the moment tensor
   focal mechanisms results. The clustering and the migration of seismicity
   from NW to SE and the general features are imaged by aftershock
   distribution both horizontally and at depth.}},

   derived with soil horizons as separate similarity classes. Their
   estimated empirical distributions are different, and the spatial
   statistics show a comparable integral scale only in the horizontal
   direction (similar to 0.15 m). In the vertical direction, nonlinear
   scaling factors exhibit an integral scale of similar to 0.2 m, and
   linear scaling factors exhibit a pure nugget effect. On a small sample
   subset, other soil material properties (e.g., texture) were also
   analyzed. In a multiple linear regression between those material
   properties and scaling factors the organic carbon content is a

Abstract = {{For 12 low-order lakes in the Western Boreal Forest of Canada, lake
   position in the groundwater flow system and surface hydrologic
   connection to wetlands accounted for 57\% of the variation in the change
   in postharvest (1997) relative to preharvest (1996) open-water median
   total phosphorous concentration ({[}TP]). Changes in {[}TP] decreased
   with calcium and magnesium concentrations, indicating that the largest
   increases in {[}TP] are likely to occur in lakes located in areas of
   groundwater recharge or shallow local discharge. Changes in {[}TP]
   increased with the area of wetland connected to the lake, a measure of
   near-surface hydrologic flushing of TP to the lake. However, the
   remaining variation (43\%) in the TP response of lakes to harvest was
   not explained by landscape-based criteria. This study illustrates that
   in landscapes with complex hydrogeology, factors controlling the
   chemical responses of lakes to disturbance are complex, remain poorly
   understood, and require further study.}},

Abstract = {{A single novel word among several familiarized words may be localized
   more effectively than the familiarized words (novel popout). Early
   demonstrations of novel popout attributed the effect to the capture of
   attentional resources by novel stimuli. Christie and Klein (1995, 1996)
   argued that differential recollection of novel versus familiar words
   could alternatively account for the popout effect. At the present
   experiments, participants judged which of four locations contained a
   physically brighter word. A bright novel word was localized
   significantly better than a bright familiar word in
   one-novel/three-familiar arrays, inconsistent with a retrievability
   account of novel popout. However, a bright familiar word was also
   localized better than a bright novel word in three-novel/one-familiar
   arrays, inconsistent with the mismatch theory proposed by Johnston and
   Hawley (1994). The results suggest that familiarity and novelty provide
   a perceptual segregation of the odd item; superior brightness
   discrimination at that location may be due either to attentional capture
   or to locational ambiguity within the larger group.}},

Abstract = {{In his landmark 1989 paper, R.R. Hofmann classified ruminants into three
   categories based upon digestive anatomy and preferred forages, and
   proposed that divergence of feeding strategies among ruminants is a
   result of morphological evolution of the digestive tract. Because of the
   hypothetical nature of these views and the ingrained beliefs that they
   challenged, several papers were published that reported tests of
   Hofmann's predictions. The consensus among these papers was that
   Hofmann's predictions were inadequate. I describe the experimental
   evidence that has been put forth in opposition to the ruminant
   diversification hypothesis and contend that we have failed to adequately
   test Hofmann's predictions.}},

Abstract = {{The object of this study was to compare the accuracy and validity of
   stereology as a method for determining whole temporal lobe volume with
   the more established technique of semi-automated thresholding acid
   tracing. Ten, fixed, post-mortem human brains, were imaged using a three
   dimensional (3D) acquisition protocol. The volume of the left temporal
   lobe, dissected from each brain, was determined by fluid displacement.
   Each volume was compared to measurements obtained from magnetic
   resonance images (MRI) of the post-mortem brain using each of the two
   segmentation methods. Post-acquisition processing was performed using
   MEASURE software. Three investigators performed each measurement three
   times using each method, yielding a total of 180 measurements.
   Stereology took, on average, half the time of thresholding/tracing.
   Using a clinically acceptable variation for 95\% of repeat measures;
   both intra-observer and inter-observer variation were acceptable for
   each technique. However, validity, as demonstrated by graphs of
   agreement against water displacement showed that the ``limits of
   agreement{''} using stereology were within the acceptable range, while
   those using the thresholding/tracing technique were not. Quantitative
   estimates of variation and a graphical representation of the limits of
   agreement show that stereology is at least as precise as the
   thresholding/tracing method but is superior in terms of speed and
   validity. This has broad implications for published estimates of brain
   region volumes in human diseases such as epilepsy, dementia and other
   neurodegenerative disorders. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{We investigate the possibility that radio halos of clusters of galaxies
   are caused by synchrotron emission of cosmic ray electrons (CRe), which
   were produced by cosmic ray protons (CRp) interacting hadronically with
   the intra-cluster medium (ICM) protons. We perform cosmological
   magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations to obtain a sample of ten
   magnetized galaxy clusters. They provide realistic models of the gas and
   magnetic field distribution, needed to predict the CRe production rates,
   their cooling, and their synchrotron emissivity. We assume a CRp
   population within the ICM with an energy density which has a constant
   ratio to thermal energy density. This ratio is adjusted in such a way
   that one of the simulated clusters reproduces the radio luminosity of
   the radio halo of the Coma cluster of galaxies. Our model exhibits the
   observed low degree of radio polarization and has a similar radial
   emission profile as the Coma cluster. We provide estimates for the
   expected gamma ray and neutrino flux. The necessary CRp/thermal energy
   ratio is 4... 14\% (E(p,min)/GeV)(-0.375) (for the range of magnetic
   field strengths suggested by Faraday measurements), where E(p,min) is
   the lower kinetic energy cutoff of the CRp with spectral index alpha (p)
   approximate to 2.375. Assuming this ratio to be the same in the whole
   set of simulated clusters a T(x) - L(nu) relation is predicted which
   follows the observed relation well.}},

Abstract = {{A series of visual search experiments explored whether early visual

   (Wolfe \& Bennett, 1997) has suggested that information concerning

   demonstrate that these previous findings are explicable in terms of
   non-target heterogeneity rather than an absence of shape information in
   early vision. In Experiments 2 and 3, we demonstrate that shape
   similarity, rather than individual contour similarity, can determine
   search efficiency. In Experiments 4 and 5, we show that manipulating the
   contrast polarity of contours and defining shape using texture
   significantly impeded search for an odd-one-out shape. The implications
   of these results for shape processing in early vision are discussed.}},

   diacylglycerol (DAG). RasGRP, a Ras activator with a DAG-binding Cl
   domain, is expressed inT cells and thymocytes. Here we show that thymi
   of RasGRP-null mutant mice have approximately normal numbers of immature
   thymocytes but a marked deficiency of mature, single-positive
   (CD4(+)CD8(-) and CD4(-)CD8(+)) thymocytes. In Ras signaling and
   proliferation assays, mutant thymocytes showed a complete lack of
   response to DAG analogs or T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation by
   antibodies. Thus, TCR and DAG are linked through RasGRP to Ras
   signaling.}},

Abstract = {{In a closed economic system, money is conserved. Thus, by analogy with
   energy, the equilibrium probability distribution of money must follow
   the exponential Boltzmann-Gibbu law characterized by an effective
   temperature equal to the average amount of money per economic agent. We
   demonstrate how the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution emerges in computer
   simulations of economic models. Then we consider a thermal machine, in
   which the difference of temperatures allows one to extract a monetary
   profit. We also discuss the role of debt, and models with broken
   time-reversal symmetry for which the Boltzmann-Gibbs law does not hold.
   The instantaneous distribution of money among the agents of a system
   should not be confused with the distribution of wealth. The latter also
   includes material wealth, which is not conserved, and thus may have a
   different (e.g. power-law) distribution.}},

Abstract = {{The bladder receives an extensive nerve supply that is predominantly
   cholinergic, but several putative transmitters are present, some of
   which are colocalized. Previous studies have shown increased levels of
   sensory nerves, reduced inhibitory transmitters, and structural and
   functional changes in the excitatory input in unstable bladder
   conditions. The present study compared the end-organ nerve supply to the
   bladder in spinal cord injury (SCI) with uninjured controls.
   Acetylcholinesterase histochemistry and double-label immunofluorescence
   were used to investigate neurotransmitter content, with confocal laser
   scanning microscopy to assess colocalization. Organ bath studies
   provided functional correlates for the structural changes in the
   excitatory innervation. Control samples had dense innervation of the
   detrusor containing a diverse range of transmitters. Hyperreflexic SCI
   samples showed patchy denervation, and areflexic SCI samples were
   diffusely denervated. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-, neuropeptide
   Y-, neuronal nitric oxide synthase-, and galanin-immunoreactive nerve
   fibers were reduced from frequent or moderately frequent to infrequent
   or very infrequent in SCI. Calcitonin gene-related
   peptide-immunoreactive fibers were infrequent in controls and SCI
   samples. Patterns of colocalization were unchanged, but significantly
   fewer fibers expressed more than one transmitter. The subepithelial
   plexus was markedly reduced and several of the smaller coarse nerve
   trunks showed no immunoreactivity to the transmitters assessed. There
   was no reduction in sensitivity to electrical field stimulation of
   intrinsic nerves in SCI, but the maximum force generated by each
   milligram of bladder tissue and the peak force as a proportion of the
   maximum carbachol contraction were significantly reduced and the
   responses were protracted. There was no significant functional
   atropine-resistant neuromuscular transmission in controls or SCI. The
   reported findings have clinical implications in the management of
   chronic SCI and development of new treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Two challenges in electrochemical plating analysis are taken up in this
   paper: (i) numerical simulation of depositing thickness on industrial
   parts to cover; and (ii) numerical identification of experimental
   polarisation laws for the electrodes submerged in electrolyte and used
   for electroplating.
   Consideration of the first one leads to a formulation based on the
   Boundary element Method (BEM) in a three-dimensional space to solve the
   ionic migration problem in the electrolyte. The electroplating system
   convergence is monitored by an algorithm to satisfy experimentally the
   global and dual quantities between the two electrodes (anode and
   cathode). Our model has been validated by electrolyser outfits
   modelisations. Numerical simulation of these industrial applications
   shows numerical results and deposit measurements are in good
   correlation.
   Additionally, in order to confirm or to improve the experimental
   polarisation laws we have developed a numerical identification model.
   The numerical model is adjusted at the geometric point of measurement,
   to respect the experimental measurements realised with accuracy away
   from the disturbed point, and after that the real polarisation law on
   electrode is determined. This new development allows us to access to not
   really measurable quantities needed to simulate electrolytic deposits.

Abstract = {{In order to study the influence of the maturation type on the behavior
   of concrete containing fly ash, specimens of mixtures and mortars have
   been made with a water/binder ratio of 0.40. In all cases, the
   proportion of fly ash has been constant and equal to 20\%. Different
   maturation types have been studied: the confinement in an aluminum foil,
   the immersion in a lime saturated solution and the immersion in an NaOH
   and KOH solution simulating the interstitial solution that is found in
   concrete. At different times, the composition of the interstitial
   solution, the resistance to compression, the content of chemically bound
   water as well as the quantity of portlandite have been measured in order
   to evaluate the maturation effect. The results show that the maturation
   type has an influence on the fly ash hydration rate. The data also
   indicate that it is essential that the specimens have enough water to
   hydrate themselves. In the case of the confinement of samples,
   evaporation must absolutely be avoided. In order to qualify mineral
   additions representatively, and to measure their properties on
   representative specimens of the conditions usually found in the concrete
   structure mass, the alkalinity of the interstitial solution must be
   preserved. Immersion of samples in an NaOH and KOH solution at a
   concentration simulating that of the interstitial solution is suggested.
   The maturation in lime water provides enough water for hydration but
   pulls down the alkalinity of the interstitial solution too rapidly,
   which reduces the fly ash hydration rate.}},

Title = {{Interlibrary loan in primary access libraries: challenging the
   traditional view}},
Journal = {{BULLETIN OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{303-313}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Primary access libraries serve as the foundation of the
   National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) interlibrary loan
   (ILL) hierarchy, yet few published reports directly address the
   important role these libraries play in the ILL system. This may reflect
   the traditional view that small, primary access libraries are largely
   users of ILL, rather than important contributors to the effectiveness
   and efficiency of the national ILL system.
   Objective: This study was undertaken to test several commonly held
   beliefs regarding ILL system use by primary access libraries.
   Hypotheses: Three hypotheses were developed. H1: Colorado and Wyoming
   primary access libraries comply with the recommended ILL guideline of
   adhering to a hierarchical structure, emphasizing local borrowing. H2:
   The closures of two Colorado Council of Medical Librarians (CCML)
   primary access libraries in 1996 resulted in twenty-three Colorado
   primary access libraries' borrowing more from their state resource
   library in 1997. H3: The number of subscriptions held by Colorado and
   Wyoming primary access libraries is positively correlated with the
   number of items they loan and negatively correlated with the number of
   items they borrow.
   Methods: The hypotheses were tested using the 1992 and 1997 DOCLINE and
   OCLC data of fifty-four health sciences libraries, including fifty
   primary access libraries, two state resource libraries, and two general
   academic libraries in Colorado and Wyoming. The ILL data were obtained
   electronically and analyzed using Microsoft Word 98, Microsoft Excel 98,
   and JMP 3.2.2.
   Results: CCML primary access libraries comply with the recommended
   guideline to emphasize local borrowing by supplying each other with the
   majority of their ILLs, instead of overburdening libraries located at
   higher levels in the ILL hierarchy (H1). The closures of two CCML
   primary access libraries appear to have affected the entire ILL system,
   resulting in a greater volume of ILL activity for the state resource
   library and other DOCLINE libraries higher up in the ILL hierarchy and 1
   highlighting the contribution made by CCM-L primary access libraries
   (H2). CCML primary access libraries borrow and lend in amounts that a-re
   proportional to their collection size, rather than overtaxing libraries
   at higher levels in the ILL hierarchy with large numbers of requests
   (H3).
   Limitations: The main limitations of this study were the small sample
   size and the use of data collected for another purpose, the CCML ILL
   survey.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that there is little evidence to
   support several commonly held beliefs regarding ILL system use by
   primary access libraries. In addition to validating the important
   contributions made by primary access libraries to the national ILL
   system, baseline data that can be used to benchmark current practice
   performance are provided.}},

Abstract = {{The use of bacteriocins from food-grade lactic acid bacteria to fight
   against the food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes has been gaining
   interest. However, the emergence of resistant cells is frequently
   reported when Listeria is exposed to such antibacterials, A
   two-dimensional electrophoresis study of whole-cell protein expression
   of Listeria monocytogenes variants sensitive or resistant to the action
   of a bacteriocin produced by Carnobacterium divergens V41, divercin V41,
   is reported in this paper. The resistant variant obtained from the
   sensitive strain of L, monocytogenes P was also resistant to piscicocins
   V1 and SF668, but remained sensitive to nisin, Its growth rate was 50\%
   less than the sensitive strain, and the MIC for it was 10(4) times
   higher, No reversion of the resistance was observed after 20 successive
   cultures in the absence of divercin V41. Comparison of the protein
   patterns by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis showed clear
   differences. In the resistant variant pattern, at least nine spots had
   disappeared and eight new ones were observed. One of the newly
   synthesized proteins was identified as a flagellin oft. monocytogenes.
   Direct interaction between flagellin and divercin V41 was not evidenced.
   Intracellular synthesis of flagellin is probably an indirect effect of a
   modification in transcriptional regulation with widespread effects
   through a sigma factor. An intense protein, only present in the
   sensitive strain, was identified as a non-heme iron-binding ferritin
   displaying strong similarities to Dps proteins. Common modifications in
   the transcriptional regulation for these two proteins are discussed.}},

   expressing porcine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor

   induced a primary T cell-mediated response characterized by low rates of
   IFN-gamma, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and IL-4 mRNA in peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells (PBMC). Very low rates of PRV-specific IgG1 and the

   response. After a high virulent challenge, high levels of cytokine mRNA,
   mainly IFN-gamma, and high secondary antibody (Ab) response were induced
   in all DNA-vaccinated pigs. Codelivery of GM-CSF gene significantly
   increased both Th immune response (i.e., IFN-gamma and IL-4 mRNA

Abstract = {{Individual differences in the way ewes behave towards their lambs may
   help to identify the sources of variation in maternal care. In this
   study we investigated how the pattern of maternal behaviour shown by an
   individual animal changed across parities in domestic sheep. The
   maternal behaviour of individual animals (Scottish Blackface and Suffolk
   sheep), in the first 2 hours after lambing, was compared when lambing as
   primiparous and multiparous ewes. More rejecting behaviours (e.g.
   withdrawal, aggression, lack of co-operation with lamb sucking attempts)
   were expressed by ewes in their first parity than in subsequent
   parities. Behaviours associated with affiliation and bonding (e.g.
   grooming attention) were not, however, significantly influenced by
   parity within individual ewes. Principal Components Analysis of maternal
   behaviours was carried out on behavioural data from primiparous and
   multiparous ewes. In common with studies in primates, behaviours in both
   primiparous and multiparous ewes were clustered on two main axes or
   Factors, labelled `maternal rejection' and `maternal care/warmth'.
   However, in multiparous ewes, a third Factor, labelled `aggression', was
   found whereas in primiparous ewes aggressive behaviours loaded on the
   same dimension as `maternal rejection'. Behavioural consistency was
   investigated by correlating the behavioural data from primiparous and
   multiparous individuals. There was a significant correlation between the
   scores received by primiparous and multiparous ewes for both the
   `care/warmth' and the `rejection' dimensions of maternal behaviour. Our
   data suggest that, in sheep, maternal behaviours are segregated along
   the twin axes of `rejection' and `care/warmth'. Although the frequency
   of rejection behaviours declined with maternal experience, individual
   ewes were consistent in their expression of maternal care across
   parities, suggesting that the maternal behaviour of a primiparous ewe is
   reasonably predictive of her behaviour in subsequent pregnancies.}},

Abstract = {{Sixty-five subjects, ages 8 to 12, participated in a visual
   electrophysiological study. Twenty-two of the subjects had received a
   diagnosis of nonorganic failure-to-thrive (FTT) before the age of three.
   The remaining 43 subjects had no history of FTT and served as Controls.
   IQs were obtained with the abbreviated WISC-III, and the Controls were
   split into two groups, LO IQ and HI IQ, to provide a LO IQ Control group
   with an average IQ equivalent to the FTT group. Event-related brain
   potentials (ERPs) were recorded from five scalp locations during a cued
   continuous performance task (CPT). Subjects had to press a button every
   time they saw the letter ``X{''} following the letter ``A{''} (50
   targets out of 400 stimuli).
   During the CPT, the FIT subjects made marginally more errors of omission
   to targets than the LO IQ Control group and significantly more errors of
   omission than the HI IQ Control subjects. The groups did not differ
   significantly on errors of commission (false alarms) or reaction times
   to targets. ERP averages revealed a group difference in amplitude in a
   late slow wave for the 50 non-X stimuli (false targets) that followed
   the letter A. This difference was greatest over frontal sites, where the
   FTT group had a more negative going slow wave than each control group.
   Late frontal negativity to No Go stimuli has been linked with
   post-decisional processing, notably in young children. Thus, the FTT
   subjects may have less efficient inhibitory processes, reflected by
   additional late frontal activation.}},

Abstract = {{Contradicting data exist as to whether interindividual patterns in
   glucocorticoid (GC) sensitivity vary between different target tissues in
   humans. This study therefore measured GC sensitivity in 36 healthy
   subjects in three target tissues: the immune system; the cardiovascular
   system, and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. For this purpose,
   dexamethasone inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-6 and
   tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in peripheral leukocytes,
   beclomethasone dipropionate-induced skin blanching, and suppression of
   cortisol levels after low-dose (0.5 mg) dexamethasone suppression test
   were determined in each subject.
   The results showed the expected glucocorticoid-induced suppression of
   interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production (both P <
   0.001), dose-dependent skin blanching (P < 0.001), and suppression of
   salivary cortisol response to awakening (P < 0.001). However, neither
   simple correlations nor cluster analysis revealed a significant
   association among the three bioassays for GC sensitivity. In contrast to
   the idea that interindividual variation in GC sensitivity is an
   intrinsic trait affecting all tissues, these results suggest that this
   variability is target tissue Specific in healthy subjects.}},

Abstract = {{The competitiveness of the European process industry depends on its
   ability to achieve the required production, in terms of purity,
   quantity, conditions, etc., at minimum operational cost. The key factor
   in the minimization of the operational costs, is energy, which
   translates to lower operational costs for the process. To that
   perspective, technologies for the intensification of energy saving
   (Intensified Energy Saving Technologies-IESTs) have been in the focus of
   European research in the process industry sector, especially since the
   beginning of the 90s. The main advantage of the IESTs is that after
   proper sizing, they can be integrated in existing plants, offering high
   energy savings (estimated at 10-17\% for the entire process) and also
   result in a more compact process. The results of the research performed
   on IESTs are very promising, and the potential of applying IESTs in new
   or existing plants is continuously being proved. However, a remaining
   problem, is the optimal insertion of IESTs in a given process. In this
   paper, a review of the IESTs developed in EU-funded research programs
   (such as JOULE, THERMIE and BRITE-EURAM) that is partly supported by the
   European Commission in the project EXSYS II, is presented. Moreover, a
   Genetic-Algorithm based optimization tool applied in the cogeneration
   system of a refinery is also presented, showing that the problem of
   optimal insertion of IESTs in a process can be addressed successfully.

Abstract = {{Phagocytosis of periodontopathogenic bacteria by crevicular
   polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (PMNs) plays a key role in the
   aetiology of periodontitis. Antimicrobials such as clindamycin have been
   proven to be effective in treating progressive forms of this disease.
   Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of
   clindamycin on the phagocytosing properties of gingival crevicular PMNs
   obtained from 16 patients with rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP),
   eight with localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP), 12 with adult
   periodontitis (AP) and 13 periodontally healthy controls. The
   phagocytosis assay was performed with the two strains Porphyromonas
   gingivalis ATCC 33277 and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Tanner
   FDC 44 on a slide. Phagocytosis and intracellular killing were assessed
   by fluorescence microscopy after staining with acridine orange. The
   addition of clindamycin elevated the percentage of phagocytosing PMNs in
   periodontitis patients and controls regardless of whether P. gingivalis
   or A. actinomycetemcomitans was used as test strain. In granulocytes of
   healthy controls an enhancement of the intracellular killing of both
   strains was observed if clindamycin was added. Besides the antimicrobial
   effect, the enhancement of the phagocytosis might be an additional
   indication for treatment of periodontitis patients with clindamycin.}},

Abstract = {{Whole-genome association studies will be a powerful tool to identify
   genes responsible for common human diseases. A crucial task for
   association-mapping studies is the evaluation of the relationship
   between linkage disequilibrium (LD) and physical distance for the
   genomic region under study. Since it is known that the extent of LD is
   nonuniformly distributed throughout the human genome, the required
   marker density has to be determined specifically for the region under
   study. These regions may be related to isochores and chromosomal bands,
   as indicated by earlier cytogenetic findings concerning chiasma
   distribution in meiosis. Therefore we analyzed the neurofibromatosis
   type 1 (NF1) gene region on chromosome 17q11.2, which is characterized
   by a nonuniform LD pattern and an L1-to-H2 isochore transition.
   Long-range LD within the NF1 gene was found to extend over 200 kb (D' =
   0.937) in the L1 isochore, whereas, in the neighboring H2 isochore, no
   LD is apparent between markers spaced by 26 kb (D' = 0.144).
   Recombination frequencies derived from the LD are at .00019 thigh LD)
   and .01659 (low LD) per megabase, the latter identical to the average
   value from segregation analysis. The boundary between these regions
   coincides precisely with a transition in the GC content of the
   sequences, with low values (37.2\%) in the region with long-range LD and
   high values (51\%) in the other. Our results suggest a correlation
   between the LD pattern and the isochores, at least in the NF1 region. If
   this correlation can be generalized, the marker densities required for
   association studies have to be adjusted to the regional GC content and
   may be chosen according to the isochores.}},

Abstract = {{Several crystalline and amorphous silica dusts (two quartz of natural
   origin, one cristobalite of natural and two of biogenic origin, three
   amorphous diatomite earths and one pyrogenic amorphous silica) were
   studied in the SHE cell transformation assay, in order to compare their
   cytotoxic and transforming potencies and examine the role of the
   structure and of the state of the surface on these effects. Some samples
   were modified by grinding, etching and heating with the aim of
   establishing relationships between single surface properties and
   biological responses. The results showed that some quartz and
   cristobalite dusts (crystalline) as well as the diatomaceous earths
   (amorphous), but not the pyrogenic amorphous silica, were cytotoxic and
   induced morphological transformation of SHE cells in a
   concentration-dependent manner. The ranking in cytotoxicity was
   different from that in transforming potency, suggesting two separate
   molecular mechanisms for the two effects. The cytotoxic and transforming
   potencies were different from one dust to another. even among the same
   structural silicas, The type of crystalline structure (quartz vs
   cristobalite) and the crystalline vs biogenic amorphous form did not
   correlate with cytotoxic or transforming potency of silica dusts,
   Comparison of cellular effects induced by original and surface modified
   samples revealed that several surface functionalities modulate cytotoxic
   and transforming potencies. The cytotoxic effects appeared to be related
   to the distribution and abundance of silanol groups and to the presence
   of trace amounts of iron on the silica surface, Silica particles with
   fractured surfaces and/or iron-active sites, able to generate reactive
   oxygen species, induced SHE cell transformation. The results show that
   the activity of silica at the cellular level is sensitive to the
   composition and structure of surface functionalities and confirm that
   the biological response to silica is a surface originated phenomenon.

Abstract = {{Epidemiological studies indicate that the prevalence of ``wheeze{''} is
   very high in early childhood. However, it is clear that parents and
   clinicians frequently use the term ``wheeze{''} for a range of audible
   respiratory noises. The commonest audible sounds originating from the
   lower airways in infancy are ruttles, which differ from classical wheeze
   in that the sound is much lower in pitch,,vith a continuous rattling
   quality and lacking any musical features. The aim of this study was to
   clearly differentiate wheeze and ruttles objectively using acoustic
   analysis.
   Lung sounds were recorded in 15 infants, seven with wheeze and eight
   with ruttles, using a small sensitive piezoelectric accelerometer, and
   information relating to the respiratory cycle was obtained using
   inductive plethysmography. The acoustic signals were analysed using a
   fast fourier transformation technique (Respiratory Acoustics Laboratory
   Environment programme).
   The acoustic properties of the two noises were shown to be quite
   distinct, the classical wheeze being characterized by a sinusoidal
   waveform with one or more distinct peaks in the power spectrum display;
   the ruttle is represented by an irregular nonsinusoidal waveform,vith
   diffuse peaks in the power spectrum and with increased sound intensity
   at a frequency of <600 Hz.
   It is important for clinicians and epidemiologists to recognize that
   there are distinct types of audible respiratory noise in early life with
   characteristic acoustic properties.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, we proposed the hypothesis that a vicious cycle exists in
   human hibernating myocardium (HM) between the progression of myocyte
   degeneration and the development of fibrosis {[}1]. We now investigated
   the pathomechanism of this cycle in more detail and established a
   correlation between the severity of the morphological changes and the
   degree of postoperative functional recovery of HM.
   HM was diagnosed by dobutamine echocardiography, thallium-201
   scintigraphy and radionuclide ventriculography. Functional recovery was
   present at 3 months after coronary bypass surgery but remained unchanged
   at 15 months. Forty patients were subdivided into 2 groups: A with
   complete and B with incomplete recovery. Biopsies taken during surgery
   and studied by electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry, rt-PCR, and
   morphometry revealed myocyte degeneration and inflammatory and
   fibrinogenic changes in a widened interstitial space. We report here for
   the first time an upregulation of TGF-beta (1) evident by a 5-fold
   increase of fibroblasts and macrophages exhibiting a TGF-beta (1)
   content 3-fold larger than in control, and a > 3-fold increase in
   TGF-beta (1) mRNA by rt-PCR. The number of angiotensin converting enzyme
   (ACE) containing structures was increased (n/mm(2): control - 11.4, A -
   17.6, B - 19.2, control vs. A and B, p < 0.05). Fibrosis was more severe
   in group B than A or control (\%: C - 10.1; A - 21.2; B - 40.6; p <
   0.05). Capillary density was significantly reduced (n/mm(2): C - 1152; A
   - 782; B - 579, p < 0.05) and intercapillary distance was widened (mum:
   C - 29.5, A - 36.1, B - 43.3, p < 0.05). The number of CD 3 (n/mm(2): C
   - 5.0; A - 9.6; B - 9.4, ns) and CD 68 positive cells (n/mm(2): C -
   37.2; A - 80.7; B - 55.0, C vs. A p < 0.05) was elevated in HM as
   compared to control indicating an inflammatory reaction. Cut-off points
   for functional recovery are fibrosis > 32\%, capillary density <
   660/mm(2) and intercapillary distance > 39.0 mum.
   In HM a self-perpetuating vicious cycle of tissue alterations leads to
   progressive replacement fibrosis and continuous intracellular
   degeneration which should be interrupted by early revascularization.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a model in which two competing fiat currencies may
   coexist as media of exchange. Domestic currency has lower transactions
   costs but a higher growth rate than foreign currency, it is used in
   everyday transactions and has a higher velocity of circulation in
   equilibrium. In contrast, foreign currency is hoarded for occasional
   high consumption shocks. A precautionary transactions demand for foreign
   currency arises because it is a better store of value. The different
   endogenous roles for the currencies provide an explanation for the
   nondisappearance of the hyperinflating domestic currency in the presence
   of a stable foreign currency. Though the presence of foreign currency
   lowers the value of the domestic currency, it may increase welfare when
   large amounts of seigniorage must be generated. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We herein demonstrate that mast cells express all known members of the
   group II subfamily of secretory phospholipase A, (sPLA(2)) isozymes, and
   those having heparin affinity markedly enhance the exocytotic response.
   Rat mastocytoma RBL-2H3 cells transfected with heparin-binding
   (sPLA(2)-IIA, -V, and -IID), but not heparin-nonbinding (sPLA(2)-IIC),
   enzymes released more granule-associated markers (beta-hexosaminidase
   and histamine) than mock- or cytosolic PLA(2)alpha
   (cPLA(2)alpha)-transfected cells after stimulation with IgE and Ag.
   Site-directed mutagenesis of sPLA(2)-IIA and -V revealed that both the
   catalytic and heparin-binding domains are essential for this function.
   Confocal laser and electron microscopic analyses revealed that
   sPLA(2)-IIA, which was stored in secretory granules in unstimulated
   cells, accumulated on the membranous sites where fusion between the
   plasma membrane and granule membranes occurred in activated cells. These
   results suggest that the heparin-binding sPLA(2)s bind to the
   perigranular membranes through their heparin-binding domain, and
   lysophospholipids produced in situ by their enzymatic action may
   facilitate the ongoing membrane fusion, In contrast to the redundant
   role of sPLA(2)-IIA, -IID, and -V in the regulation of degranulation,
   only sPLA(2)-V had the ability to markedly augment IgE/Ag-stimulated
   immediate PGD(2) production, which reached a level comparable to that
   elicited by cPLA(2)alpha. The latter observation reveals an unexplored
   functional segregation among the three related isozymes expressed in the
   same cell population.}},

Abstract = {{The 1995 apparition of Mars was monitored with the Pic-du-Midi 1-m
   telescope from October 1994 to March 1995. Several thousand images were
   acquired with a CCD camera through various filters ranging from 0.4 to
   1.05 mum. These images complete HST observations of the same apparition
   with a spatial resolution reduced by a factor of similar to4, but with a
   better time resolution. Low-resolution spectra were also acquired
   through a set of interferential filters at opposition, providing
   indications of mineralogical composition of surface materials. The only
   significant surface variations during the period are observed in the
   Cerberus area, which brightened at the end of winter. The whole
   apparition was very cloudy. The north Polar Hood dissipated in early
   December (L(s)similar to 250). Migration of polar clouds to the equator
   is observed between January 31 and February 6 (L(s)similar to 50-55
   degrees). Then an Encircling Cloud Belt obscured most of the surface
   from February 22 to 24 at least (L(s)similar to 62). The north polar cap
   regression is similar to that observed by Mariner 9, although several
   internal rifts developed during early spring, in particular the dark
   Lowell band and Rima Tenuis. A standstill is observed in the polar cap
   regression curve from L-s = 55 to 70 degrees at latitude similar to 70
   degrees, at least in the 135-300 degrees longitude range. The very
   strong spectral feature at 0.95 mum reported from HST observations of
   Olympia Planitia in July 1995 is not observed in the Pic-du-Midi images.

   features consistent with high concentrations of crystalline hematite or
   other dark ferric materials. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The tribological properties of highly disordered graphitic carbon layers
   formed on silicon carbide (SiC) substrates by reaction with chlorine and

   selectively removed from the near surface of SiC by chlorine gas,
   leaving behind a layer of carbon having high structural density and
   strong bonding characteristics. Tribological tests showed that the
   carbon films were highly adherent and able to reduce friction
   coefficients of the base SiC by factors of up to seven. There was little
   or no change in the frictional behavior of carbon layers when sliding
   velocity and load were increased. Low friction coefficients (similar to
   0.1) could be obtained under wet, dry,polished, and rough conditions.
   The initially rough carbon surface underwent plastic flow producing a
   smooth, self-adjusting carbon layer. Structural morphology and the
   amount of disorder in the carbon layers were correlated with the
   friction and wear performance of the resultant films.}},

   different equilibrium processes can be readily integrated to the

   simulation of isopleths and cloud-point lines to compare experimental to
   simulation data and to test molecular force fields. Applications of this
   approach include the study of retrograde phenomena in a model
   natural-gas mixture through simulation of dewlines and coexistence lines

Abstract = {{The assessment of cerebral functions has long been the domain of
   positron-emission tomography and single photon emission computed
   tomography. The use of rapid imaging sequences and contrast agents
   enables physiological and pathophysiological cerebral processes to be
   assessed and monitored by magnetic resonance imaging. Both T1- and
   T2{*}-weighted contrast-enhanced fast imaging sequences can be used to
   assess tissue perfusion, vascularity, and microcirculation by applying
   models developed in nuclear medicine. The diffusion of water molecules
   and hemodynamic aspects of the macrovasculature can also be monitored.
   Functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging enables the visualization of
   neuronal function and activity, and MR spectroscopy makes possible the
   metabolic mapping of lesions and surrounding tissue. The advantages of
   MR techniques includes their low invasiveness, multiplanar imaging
   ability, and lack of radiation. This contribution discusses the clinical
   use of functional MR imaging methods and their role in neuroradiological
   diseases. Measuring perfusion and diffusion allows detailed insight into
   the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia and is already being used
   routinely in acute ischemic stroke. Dynamic MR angiography enables the
   hemodynamic assessment of vascular malformations. In CNS neoplasms these
   imaging techniques can improve lesion characterization and the
   selecting, planning, and monitoring of therapy. Functional MR imaging
   techniques have also revolutionized the study of psychiatric illness;
   however,their clinical utility here is still limited. Initial results in
   patients with dementia and schizophrenia have provided insight into the
   pathophysiological changes of these diseases.}},

   uptake significantly for all samples. The reduction in oil uptake ranged
   from 5-40\% according to the CMC type and concentration. The most
   effective CMC type was high viscosity, which caused a 40\% reduction in
   oil content for 30 s frying time of baked samples. The addition of CMC
   also reduced the initial moisture content of raw chips. The highest
   moisture content reduction was for samples prepared with low-viscosity
   CMC. Frying time was an important factor on oil uptake and moisture
   content. When frying time increased, oil content increased while

   in New Zealand, and 9 in Japan, bringing the total of sequences to 28,
   and the totals of related events (allowing for clustering) to 56
   precursory swarms and 42 mainshock events. The results add strength to
   the hypothesis that swarms ore long-range predictors of mainshock
   events. A close similarity between the swarm and aftershock magnitudes
   in a given sequence is also confirmed in Greece, supporting the proposal
   that swarms are an integral part of the seismogenic process in
   subduction regions. Further, the modelling, of swarms as part of an
   overall increase in seismicity, the onset of which marks: the onset of
   seismogenesis, is well illustrated from past sequences in Greece. Formal
   tests are being carried out in Greece, in parallel with Nevi Zealand and
   Japan, to ascertain the performance of the hypothesis as a basis for
   long-range synoptic forecasting.}},

   constructed with available Type II genetic markers and seven candidate
   genes to establish the comparative interval between BTA21 and HSA14. We
   developed polymorphic microsatellite and SNP markers associated with
   five candidate genes and placed them on the ovine and/or bovine genetic

   by virtue of their physical linkage to genetically mapped makers.
   Development of integrated linkage and physical maps facilitates the
   selection of positional candidate genes from the gene rich human map.
   The physically linked candidate genes PREF-1 and MEG3 map to the
   interval containing the clpg locus. Comparative biology suggests
   imprinting of MEG3 and/or the influences of PREF-1 on cellular

Title = {{Findings for case studies of state and local immunization programs}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3, S}},
Pages = {{54-77}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: As part of its examination of federal support for
   immunization services during the past decade, the Institute of Medicine
   (IOM) Committee on Immunization Finance Policies and Practices (IFPP)
   commissioned eight case studies of the states of Alabama, Maine,
   Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington; and a
   two-county study of Los Angeles and San Diego in California.
   Specifically, the IOM Committee and these studies reviewed the use of
   Section 317 grants by the states. Section 317 is a discretionary grant
   program that supports vaccine purchase and other immunization-related
   program activities. These studies afforded the Committee an in-depth
   look at local policy choices, the performance of immunization programs,
   and federal and state spending for immunization during the past decade.
   Methods: The case-study reports were developed through interviews with
   state and local health department officials, including immunization
   program directors, Medicaid agency staff, budget analysts, and Centers
   for Disease Control and Prevention public health advisors to the
   jurisdiction. Other sources included state and federal administrative
   records and secondary sources on background factors and state-level
   trends. The case studies were supplemented by site visits to Detroit,
   Houston, Los Angeles, Newark, and San Diego.
   Observations: The nature of immunization ``infrastructure{''} supported
   by the Section 317 program is shifting from primarily service delivery
   to a broader set of roles that puts the public effort at the head of a
   broad immunization partnership among public health, health financing,
   and other entities in both the public and private sectors. The rate and
   intensity of transition vary across the case-study areas. In the
   emerging pattern, service delivery increasingly takes place in the
   private sector and is related to managed care. ``Infrastructure{''} is
   moving beyond supporting a core state staff and local health department
   service delivery to include such activities as immunization registries,
   quality improvement, and coordination with programs outside public
   health agencies. At the same time, the recent decline in federal Section
   317 support is forcing difficult choices between old and new activities
   at the state and local levels.
   Conclusions: Immunization programs function as an organic component of
   the local health care financing and delivery systems of which they are a
   part. Immunization efforts are organized and conducted within
   distinctive state and local fiscal, economic, and health care contexts.
   Section 317 Financial Assistance grants, while playing a vital role in
   supporting immunization ``infrastructure,{''} have been too unstable and
   unpredictable to elicit the strategic planning, programming, and
   own-source spending that would be optimal for state and local programs.
   The predominant immunization function of state and local public health
   agencies is becoming assurance of age-appropriate immunization
   throughout the lifespan. To be successful in this emerging role, the
   health agencies must be supported with appropriate staffing, interagency
   collaboration, and clearly articulated authority.}},

Volume = {{80}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted across Canada to compare the herbage productivity
   of fodder galega (Galega orientalis Lam.) to that of traditional forage
   legumes, in order to assess its agricultural potential. Trials were
   established at latitudes ranging from 45 to 56 degreesN with longitudes
   from 52 degreesW (St. John's, Newfoundland) to 120 degreesW (Dawson
   Creek, British Columbia). Herbage productivity was monitored for a
   maximum of 3 production years. The establishment characteristics of Gale
   fodder galega were comparable to those of Apica and Beaver alfalfa
   (Medicago sativa L.) and Altaswede red clover (Trifolium pratense L.),
   and somewhat superior to those of Dawn Alsike clover (T. hybridum L.)
   and Leo trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.). Anik alfalfa (M. falcata L.)
   was far less uniform and vigorous in its establishment than any of the
   other species. The average annual dry matter yield of fodder galega
   ranked third among the seven legumes when averaged over the nine sites;
   it produced 5545 (SE 95) kg ha(-1) compared to 3931 (SE 72) kg ha(-1)
   for Dawn alsike clover, the lowest-yielding crop, and 6673 (SE 114) kg
   ha(-1) for Apica alfalfa, the highest-yielding. The cumulative dry
   matter yields indicated that Gale galega is at least as well adapted
   across Canada as the other legumes, except possibly at Saskatoon where
   the M. sativa alfalfas were far superior to all the other legumes in
   their ability to establish and thrive. The performance characteristics
   of Gale fodder galega indicate that it has considerable agricultural
   potential as an additional, perennial, herbage legume for many regions
   of Canada, except in the semi-arid continental climate of the central
   Prairies where its growth may be Limited by high air temperature and/or
   insufficient soil moisture.}},

Abstract = {{The records of adult patients with pneumococcal bacteremia who were seen
   over an 8-year-period at an 1100-bed university teaching hospital were
   reviewed in order to revise the clinical and laboratory findings and to
   identify the risk factors associated with mortality. A total of 156
   patients were studied, 101 men and 55 women. The mean age of the
   patients was 65 years. Eighty-seven percent of the patients had
   community-acquired bacteremia and 13\% had nosocomial pneumococcal
   bacteremia. The overall mortality was 33.9\% and the related mortality
   was 20.5\%. The following factors were associated with an increased risk
   of adverse outcome in the univariate analysis: mechanical ventilation
   (risk ratio {[}RR] = 3.40; 95\% confidence interval {[}95\% CI] =
   1.44-8.05), administration of parenteral nutrition (RR = 3.40; 95\% CI =
   1.44-8.05), and the presence of an intravenous catheter (RR = 2.33; 95\%
   CI = 1.27-4.24). In the multivariate analysis, the independent
   prognostic factors for mortality were as follows: development of
   clinical complications during the episode of bacteremia, rapidly fatal
   illness, advanced age and administration of parenteral nutrition. The
   results suggest that the overall mortality due to pneumococcal
   bacteremia continues to be high. Four independent risk factors
   associated with increased mortality were identified. Prevention and
   immunization with polyvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should
   be practiced more widely.}},

   Methods. A retrospective analysis was conducted of 328 patients
   diagnosed with endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus between January
   1990 and December 1997. Patients were followed for 3 to 96 months with a
   mean of 43 months. The impact of age on survival was assessed using Col
   proportional hazard regression and multivariate analysis for age, stage,
   and grade. Stage and grade were analyzed using log-rank tests, and
   survival curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier method.
   Results. A total of 328 patients were evaluated. Multivariate analysis
   revealed age, stage, and grade were all significant independent
   predictors of survival (P < 0.0001). Age-specific survival varied from a
   high of 90\% at age 40 to a low of 55\% at age 80. interval age-specific
   survival decreased below 86\% at age 50. Subset analysis of patients
   younger than 50 compared with older patients revealed no difference in
   surgical stage or grade of tumors among these patients. Patients older
   than 50, however, were 41\% more likely to receive adjuvant radiation
   therapy.
   Conclusion. Age is a specific, significant predictor of outcome in
   endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus. Survival decreases
   significantly in patients older than 50. This decreased survival
   associated with age is unrelated to surgical stage or grade of
   adenocarcinoma, Decreased survival could involve molecular differences
   in the developing endometrial cancer or an increased risk of death from
   other non-cancer-related factors, (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{We find an increased likelihood of outside director turnover following

   more likely to acquire new directorships than those that remain on the
   board of a matched-sample firm. Overall, the results suggest that
   outside directors who are not aligned with the CEO and own relatively
   large equity stakes are rewarded when they remove a poorly performing
   CEO and replace him or her with a CEO that improves firm performance.}},

Abstract = {{1 The role of alpha (2)-adrenoceptors in the response of aorta smooth
   muscle rings to the alpha (2)- adrenoceptors agonists UK 14,304 and
   clonidine was studied.
   2 Stimulation by 1-10 nM UK 14,304 caused dose-dependent relaxant
   responses in BaCl2-contracted endothelium-denuded aorta rings, and
   hyperpolarization in rings with or without endothelium. which were
   inhibited by yohimbine and glibenclamide, but not affected by prazosin,
   propranolol, apamin or iberiotoxin. At higher concentrations (10 nM- 10
   muM) UK 14,304 also induced a depolarizing effect which was potentiated
   by yohimbine and inhibited by prazosin. These results indicate that UK
   14,304 acts on alpha (2)-adrenoceptors at lower concentrations and on
   both alpha (1)- and alpha (2)-adrenoceptors above 10 nM.
   3 In rings, with or without endothelium, noradrenaline had a
   depolarizing effect which was inhibited by prazosin. Adrenaline did not
   affect the membrane potential but in the presence of prazosin caused
   hyperpolarization, which was inhibited by yohimbine and glibenclamide.
   These results indicate that noradrenaline is more selective for alpha
   (1)-, whereas adrenaline has similar affinities for alpha (1)- acid
   alpha (2)-adrenoceptors.
   4 In aortae with endothelium, L-NNA caused a small depolarization but
   did not affect the hyperpolarization induced by UK 14,304, indicating
   that NO is not involved in that response.
   5 Glibenclamide induced a small depolarization in aortae, with or
   without endothelium, indicating that ATP-sensitive K+ channels may play
   a role in maintaining the smooth muscle's membrane potential.
   6 Our results indicate that, in rat aorta, alpha (2)-adrenoceptors are
   also present in the smooth muscle, and that these receptors act through
   small-conductance ATP-sensitive K+ channels.}},

   that is genetically associated with Type 1 diabetes. As a start to
   defining the normal function of LRP5 and to generate testable hypotheses
   of its potential role in Type 1 diabetes pathogenesis, we carried out an
   extensive expression analysis of this gene at the mRNA and protein
   levels in normal human, monkey, and mouse, as well as in non-obese
   diabetic (NOD) mice at several stages of diabetes development. In all
   species, expression of LRP5 was found in four functionally important
   cell types: the distributed mononuclear phagocyte system, the islets of

   critical role of macrophages in the onset and progression of islet cell
   destruction in Type 1 diabetes and the hypothesized role of retinoids as
   modifiers of diabetes progression, these findings suggest that LRP5 may
   confer Type 1 diabetes risk by altering the normal functioning of one or
   more of these regulatory systems. Specifically, given that the LRP5
   polymorphisms associated with diabetes are in the promoter region of the
   gene, alterations in LRP5 expression may be responsible for diabetes

Abstract = {{The paper presents the design and evaluation of an adaptive signal
   processing procedure based on human skill. The focus is on interpreting
   probe signals detected in gas-liquid flow in the presence of noise where
   existing signal interpretation techniques may encounter difficulties.
   Interpretation of a probe signal requires construction of a
   corresponding two-state signal that denotes the presence of the phases,
   i.e. gas and liquid, at the probe tip. To develop a computer procedure
   that would imitate a skilled operator in probe signal interpretation,
   manual knowledge acquisition and evolutionary optimization were
   employed. First, a prototype signal interpretation procedure based on
   operator skill was designed, and the procedure parameters were then
   optimized with a genetic algorithm. In the optimization process, a
   two-state signal reconstructed from the probe signal by an operator was
   used as a reference. The robustness of the approach was tested in a
   series of numerical experiments. They included local evaluation on
   training and test signals, calculation of global void fraction values,
   and an assessment of variability among different experts. The results
   showed that the developed technique is highly consistent with the
   operator way of signal interpretation and represents a reliable
   prerequisite for gas-liquid how measurements. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

   Emericella nidulans, Paecilomyces variotii, Penicillium brevicompactum,
   P. clavigerum, P. crustosum, and P. polonicum, a wide range of
   metabolites partly of toxicological relevance was identified. Several
   unknown metabolites were found for the less frequent species, which were
   primarily investigated for chemotaxonomic delimitation from closely
   related species. The spectra of metabolites in conidial extracts and
   culture extracts (containing also mycelium and medium) were compared for
   a limited number of relevant fungi. Some mycotoxins, such as
   sterigmatocystin in Emericella nidulans, were not present in the
   conidial extracts, though produced by most strains. Fumigaclavine C,
   tryptoquivaline, and trypacidin, characteristic for A. fumigatus, were

   and fumitremorgens were not present. Finally, compounds such as
   cyclopenol, cyclopenin, and penitrem A being characteristic for certain
   penicillia, were found in conidial extracts and are therefore assumed to

   we have carried out a detailed temporal analysis of AP-1 activity in

   AP-1 activity in progenitor cells depended on the application of growth
   factors. Treatment of cells with B104-conditioned medium induced high
   AP-1 activity, increased process length, and improved growth. The role
   of AP-1 in proliferation and process extension was emphasized when
   progenitor cells overexpressing a c-Jun dominant-negative mutant had
   impaired growth and shortened processes. AP-1 DNA-binding activity
   during O-2A differentiation in vitro showed an initial down-regulation
   followed by up-regulation after 2 days. Increased AP-1 levels in
   oligodendrocytes were inhibited by overexpression of bcl-2, indicating
   that AP-1 in mature oligodendrocytes is involved in the regulation of
   apoptosis. Prevention of cell death by bcl-2 in oligodendrocytes was

Abstract = {{We treated 153 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with
   two induction courses of conventional-dose cytosine arabinoside (ara-C)
   and idarubicin (AIDA) followed by either a third course of AIDA,
   high-dose ara-C or bone-marrow transplantation. The complete remission
   (CR) rate for all patients was 63.4\%, with a higher CR rate for
   patients with a normal (versus unfavorable) karyotype (73.2\% vs 52.5\%;
   P=0.038). The probability of overall survival (OS) was 30.7\% after 5
   years (26.3\% after 7 years). Improved OS at 5 years could be observed
   for patients up to 50 years old versus patients older than 50 years of
   age (37.6\% vs 19.9\%; P=0.001) and patients with a normal (versus
   unfavorable) karyotype (42.9\% vs 14.1\%; P=0.0016). Disease-free
   survival (DFS) after 5 years was 33.2\% for all 97 CR patients and was
   significantly better for patients with a normal (versus unfavorable)
   karyotype (44.3\% vs 12.3\%; P=0.003). Multivariate analysis revealed
   that the age for OS (P<0.02) and the karyotype for both OS (P<0.03) and
   DFS (P< 0.05) were independent prognostic factors. In conclusion, AIDA
   is an effective and well-tolerated induction regimen (even in elderly
   patients) with a 5-year survival of more than 30\% when combined with
   ara-C-containing postremission therapy. The karyotype is the most
   powerful prognostic factor for predicting the outcome of patients
   treated with this protocol.}},

Abstract = {{Food-deprived Wistar rats were exposed to a fixed-time (FT) 60-s food
   delivery schedule until they developed schedule-induced drinking. Rats
   were matched in pairs according to their licking rates and were
   designated master or yoked at random. Every fifth lick by master rats
   was followed by an electric shock during two signalled 5-min periods,
   which ran concurrently with the food delivery schedule. For the master
   rats, shock intensities were adjusted to reduce licking to 5-30\% (low
   suppression) or 50-75\% (high suppression) of the unpunished licking
   rates. Yoked rats received the same shocks as master rats, but
   independently of their own licking. The drinking by yoked animals was
   not decreased by the presentation of these lick-independent shocks.
   Diazepam (0.3-10.0 mg/kg) was studied for its effects on punished and
   nonpunished schedule-induced drinking. Intermediate doses of the drug
   increased the punished behavior of master rats, but only when schedule-
   induced drinking was highly suppressed. Diazepam dose dependently
   decreased licking rates in all other conditions. The antipunishment
   effects of benzodiazepines may depend on the level of suppression of
   schedule-induced drinking, and this is in keeping with the results of
   other experimental preparations where behavior was under aversive
   control. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To identify and test the predictive power of demographic,
   obstetric, and psychosocial risk factors of postpartum depression.
   Design Community-based, prospective follow up study based on
   questionnaires on past history of psychiatric disease, psychological
   distress and social support during pregnancy and depression at four
   months after delivery. Obstetric files were collected at time of birth.
   Setting Antenatal care clinic and delivery ward, Aarhus University
   Hospital, Denmark.
   Population 6790 women giving birth between 1 January 1994 and 31
   December 1995, who attended the antenatal clinic during pregnancy; 5252
   (78\%) completed all questionnaires. The validation population comprised
   528 women enrolled immediately prior to and after the study period.
   Main outcome measure Postpartum depression four months after giving
   birth assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.
   Results 5.5\% of the women suffered from postpartum depression,
   corresponding to a score of 13 or higher on the Edinburgh Postnatal
   Depression Scale. Risk factors identified by multivariate logistic
   regression analysis included psychological distress in late pregnancy
   (OR 6.3 {[}95\% CT 4.4-9.1]), perceived social isolation during
   pregnancy (OR 3.6 {[}95\% CI 1.9-7.0]); high parity (OR 3.8 {[}95\% CI
   1.8-8.0]); and a positive history of prepregnant psychiatric disease (OR
   2.1 {[}95\% CI 1.4-3.2]). No association was found between pregnancy or
   delivery complications, and postpartum depression. The maximum
   predictive power of the identified risk factors was 0.3. According to
   these results, one out of three women who suffers from psychological
   distress in late pregnancy with perceived social isolation will develop
   postpartum depression.
   Conclusion Antenatal focus on psychosocial wellbeing may help to
   identify women at risk of postpartum depression.}},

Abstract = {{This study compared locally available adhesive tapes and dressings in a
   block randomized, blinded study to determine the force required to
   dislodge a cannula. In the first stage of the study, various tapes and
   taping methods were used to secure a cannula to a polyvinylchloride
   (PVC) pipe. The cannula was attached to a section of a giving set which
   in turn was attached to a dynamic force transducer The force required to
   dislodge the cannula, together with the methods of dislodgement were
   recorded. In stage two the best taping technique for each type of tape
   was tested by attaching a cannula to the surface of the forearm of an
   adult male volunteer Of the tapes tested we found Leukoplast(R) to be
   the most effective tape for securing the cannula to the PVC model. On
   the adult forearm Sleek(TM) was as effective as Leukoplast(R).
   Orientating the tape parallel to the long axis of the cannula and taping
   the cannula hub-giving set connection both improved the adherence of the
   cannula. Under the conditions tested, sterile adhesive dressings and
   tapes were relatively ineffective in securing the cannulae.}},

Abstract = {{The enteropathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a model system used to
   study the molecular mechanisms by which Gram-negative pathogens
   translocate effector proteins into target eukaryotic cells by a common
   type III secretion machine. Of the numerous proteins produced by Y.
   pseudotuberculosis that act in concert to establish an infection, YopD
   (Yersinia outer protein D) is a crucial component essential for yop
   regulation and Yop effector translocation. In this study, we describe
   the mechanisms by which YopD functions to control these processes. With
   the aid of the yeast two-hybrid system, we investigated the interaction
   between YopD and the cognate chaperone LcrH, We confirmed that
   non-secreted LcrH is necessary for YopD stabilization before secretion,
   presumably by forming a complex with YopD in the bacterial cytoplasm. At
   least in yeast, this complex depends upon the N-terminal domain and a
   C-terminal amphipathic alpha-helical domain of YopD, Introduction of
   amino acid substitutions within the hydrophobic side of the amphipathic
   alpha-helix abolished the YopD-LcrH interaction, indicating that
   hydrophobic, as opposed to electrostatic, forces of attraction are
   important for this process. Suppressor mutations isolated within LcrH
   could compensate for defects in the amphipathic domain of YopD to
   restore binding. Isolation of LcrH mutants unable to interact with
   wild-type YopD revealed no single domain responsible for YopD binding.
   The YopD and LcrH mutants generated in this study will be relevant tools
   for understanding YopD function during a Yersinia infection.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1979 and 1996 303 men with stage I testicular germ cell rumours
   (120 seminoma and 183 non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCT)) were
   enrolled onto a programme of surveillance. In our institutions the
   frequency of computed tomography (CT) scans is reduced compared with
   other centres. For all 303 men, the median follow-up is 5.1 years
   (range: 0.1-21.7 years) and there have only been 3 deaths (1 from
   disease, 1 from neutropenic sepsis and 1 from secondary leukaemia).
   52/183 (28\%) patients with NSGCT and 18/120 (15\%) patients with
   seminoma have relapsed. The relapse-free survival at 5 years is 82\% for
   seminoma and 69\% for NSGCT (Logrank P = 0.004). All men who relapsed,
   except 1 man with NSGCT, were in the International Cen Cell Cancer
   Collaborative Group good or intermediate prognosis group at relapse.
   Half of the seminoma relapses presented with symptoms and 31\% of the
   NSGCT relapses. The remaining relapses were detected serologically or
   radiologically by the surveillance programme. 5 men (2\%) on
   surveillance, 3 with initial diagnosis of seminoma and 2 with NSGCT,
   have developed second contralateral testis tumours (all stage I
   seminomas). In a well motivated centre a policy of surveillance for
   stage I testicular germ cell tumours (both NSGCT and seminoma) is
   associated with a low mortality rate (3/303, 1\%) and may have the
   advantage of sparing overtreatment with potentially toxic therapies in
   this group of young men. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Human gene therapy approaches involving transcription factors often rely
   on artificial activation domains for transcriptional activation. These
   domains are often large (e.g., 80 amino acids for VP16), recruit
   multiple cc-activation complexes at once, and offer no fine control over
   the level of transcription. In an attempt to understand the sequence and
   structural requirements of a minimal mammalian activator, we employed a
   molecular diversity approach with a peptide phage display library
   composed of random eight-amino acid peptides. Using the KIX domain of
   the mammalian co-activators p300 and CBP as target, we discovered a
   family of synthetic binding peptides. These peptides share significant
   homology with natural KIX domain ligands, and are shown to bind an
   overlapping, yet distinct, surface of p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP).
   When fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain, these synthetic
   peptides function as titratable, modular, and potent transcriptional
   activators in living cells through specific recruitment of p300/CBP,
   with the level of transcriptional activation proportional to the
   affinity of the synthetic peptide for the KIX domain. Taken together,
   our data demonstrate that a molecular diversity approach can be used to
   discover minimal, cc-activator domain-specific synthetic activators, and
   that transcriptional activation can be modulated as desired at the level
   of co-activator recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibody 17-1A (mAb 17-1A) has
   been shown effective as an adjuvant treatment in UICC stage III colon
   carcinoma. Usually, severe side effects are infrequent with mAb 17-1A
   treatment. Case Report: A 64-year-old man had a 18-month history of
   recurring arthralgia, sinusitis, and conjunctivits. After curative
   resection of UICC stage Il colon cancer adjuvant treatment with mAb
   17-1A was initiated. After the first administration (500 mg) the patient
   experienced an aggravation of the above-mentioned symptoms which led to
   the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis with multiorgan involvement.
   Under immunosuppressive therapy with cyclophosphamide and prednisone,
   clinical stabilization could be achieved. Conclusion:The exacerbation of
   Wegener's granulomatosis occurred immediately after the first
   administration of mAb 17-1A. This suggests that mAb 17-1A should be
   applied cautiously in autoimmune disease.}},

Abstract = {{Although the early identification of patients with suboptimal
   nutritional status can allow the implementation of nutritional
   intervention to enhance the ability of the body to fight infection and
   disease, currently no definitive test of nutritional status exists,
   Therefore, this study was conducted to identify possible functional
   indicators of acute nutritional deprivation. The effects of total
   nutritional deprivation and subsequent refeeding on lymphocyte functions
   and subpopulations were examined in 23 healthy cats. Peripheral blood
   samples were analyzed at various times during food deprivation and
   refeeding periods. During the food deprivation period, decreases were
   observed in leukocyte number (P < 0.05), lymphocyte number (P < 0.05),
   percentage of CD4(+) cells {[}before stimulation with concanavalin-A
   (Con-A); P < 0.05] and the CD4/CD8 ratio (before stimulation with Con-A;
   P < 0.01) compared with d 0. Increases were observed in the percentage
   of CD8(+) cells {[}before (P < 0.05) and after (P < 0.01) stimulation
   with Con-A] and in intracellular calcium (P < 0.01) during acute
   starvation. During the refeeding period, increases were observed in the
   percentage of CD4+ cells (before and after stimulation with Con-A; P <
   0.01), the percentage of CD8(+) cells (before stimulation with Con-A; P
   < 0.05) and lymphocyte number (P < 0.05) compared with d 7. Lymphocyte
   proliferative capacity tended to decrease (P = 0.07) during starvation
   and increased (P < 0.01) during the refeeding period. These findings
   suggest that a 7-d starvation period had immunosuppressive effects on
   cats and that these effects were not completely normalized during 7 d of
   refeeding. CD4(+)/CD8(+) subset alterations and CD4/CD8 ratio in
   conjunction with lymphocyte proliferation may be useful as indices of
   nutritional status.}},

Abstract = {{Timely placement of a reliable permanent Vascular access is essential
   for hemodialysis care quality; National Kidney Foundation Dialysis
   Outcomes Quality Improvement (NKF-DOQI) guidelines emphasize native
   arterio-venous (AV) fistulae as preferred access for incident patients.
   As part of Network One's Vascular Access Quality Improvement Project
   (QIP) we investigated whether patients' course to end-stage renal
   disease (ESRD) influenced vascular access selection.
   Baseline information was obtained for incident (1998) dialysis patients
   from 6 centers participating in the Network QIP. Patients were
   subdivided into 3 predefined clinical groups: KNOWN (known chronic renal
   disease, seen by a nephrologist, with predictable progression to ESRD),
   CRISIS (KNOWN but with unanticipated medical crisis precipitating ESRD),
   and UNKNOWN (not known to have chronic renal insufficiency or never seen
   by a nephrologist before developing ESRD).
   Two hundred forty patients were identified (median age 69.9, 42\%
   diabetic). Only 43\% of the entire population experienced an orderly
   progression to renal insufficiency. The most frequent initial access was
   a catheter (54\%), followed by a fistula (29\%) and a graft (16\%), but
   selection of initial access differed significantly by patient group,
   with 46\% of KNOWN patients receiving a fistula (P < .001). After 2
   months of dialysis, the initial access supported dialysis in only 53.7\%
   of the KNOWN patients, and in 59.4\% and 45.7\% of the CRISIS and
   UNKNOWN patients, respectively.
   We conclude that unpredicted, new ESRD patients are common and are less
   likely to receive a fistula as initial hemodialysis access. Studies
   should define optimum access management when dialysis requirement is
   unforeseen. (C) 2000 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite a long history of use in the treatment of paroxysmal
   atrial fibrillation (AF), the efficacy of cardiac glycosides has not
   been established. If such drugs are beneficial in this condition, the
   general view is that the benefit must be related to their inotropic
   actions,
   Methods and results: To assess the effects of die rapid-acting cardiac
   glycoside, acetylstrophanthidin (AS), on AF and AF-induced right atrial
   (RA) ``stunning,{''} RA wall motion (with ultrasonic crystals), RA
   pressure, and peak first derivative of pressure (dp/dt) (with. microtip
   transducers) were measured before and after 5 min of high-intensity
   rapid atrial stimulation (10 Hz; 10 mA; 1 ms) and after the cessation of
   poststimulation AF, Measurements were made in neurally intact and
   autonomically blockaded dogs both before and after the administration of
   AS (0.01 mg/kg IV bolus and 0.015 mg/kg/h PV infusion). AS prevented the
   post-AF reduction ill RA peak dp/dt under neurally intact and
   autonomically blockaded conditions, and it prevented the post-AF
   increase in the RA end-systolic dimension and the decrease in the
   percentage of RA systolic shortening with autonomic blockade, AS was
   beneficial whether or not baseline inotropy was enhanced by AS. The
   duration of AF following atrial stimulation was the same before and
   after AS, but when compared to controls, AS treatment appeared to
   prolong AF,
   Conclusions: Cardiac glycosides exert a favorable effect on AF-induced
   RA stunning, hilt this action is unrelated to its effects on the

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing appreciation of the importance of nonlinearities in
   evoked responses in fMRI, particularly with the advent of event-related
   fMRI. These nonlinearities are commonly expressed as interactions among
   stimuli that can lead to the suppression and increased latency of
   responses to a stimulus that are incurred by a preceding stimulus, me
   have presented previously a model-free characterization of these effects
   using generic techniques from nonlinear system identification, namely a
   Volterra series formulation. At the same time Burton ct al. (1998)
   described a plausible and compelling dynamical model of hemodynamic
   signal transduction in fMRI. Subsequent work by Mandeville et al. (1999)
   provided important theoretical and empirical constraints on the form of
   the dynamic relationship between blood flow and volume that underpins
   the evolution of the fMRI signal. In this paper we combine these system
   identification and model-based approaches and ask whether the Balloon
   model is sufficient to account for the nonlinear behaviors observed in
   real time series. We conclude that it can, and furthermore the model
   parameters that ensue are biologically plausible. This conclusion is
   based on the observation that the Balloon model can produce Volterra
   kernels that emulate empirical kernels. To enable this evaluation we had
   to embed the Balloon model in a hemodynamic input-state-output model
   that included the dynamics of perfusion changes that are contingent on
   underlying synaptic activation. This paper presents (i) the full

Title = {{Diagnosing sarcoidosis using endosonography-guided fine-needle
   aspiration}},

Abstract = {{Study objectives: The ability to diagnose sarcoidosis cytologically has
   been reported previously, but the method is rarely used. Endoscopic
   ultrasonography (EUS) is a sensitive technique for detecting mediastinal
   lymph nodes, which in addition provides an opportunity to carry out
   guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology. We report herein on the
   use of EUS-FNA in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
   Patients and methods: Nineteen patients with suspected sarcoidosis were
   investigated using EUS-FNA with a linear echoendoscope and a 22-gauge
   Hancke-Vilman needle.
   Measurements and results: In all 19 patients, EUS revealed enlarged
   mediastinal lymph nodes (mean size, 2.4 cm), located subcarinally (n =
   15), in the aortopulmonary window (n = 12), or in the lower posterior
   mediastinum (n = 5). The nodes had an isoechoic or hypoechoic
   appearance, with atypical vessels in five cases. The amount of aspirate
   obtained using EUS-FNA was adequate in all patients, and contained blood
   in excess of normal in some, indicating a high degree of vascularity.
   Cytology demonstrated epithelioid cell granuloma formation, suggesting
   sarcoidosis. Mycobacterial cultures were negative in all of the patients
   except one, in whom the final diagnosis was tuberculosis. The
   specificity and sensitivity of EUS-FNA in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis
   were 94\% and 100\%, respectively.
   Conclusions: EUS of mediastinal lymph nodes in sarcoidosis reveals
   certain characteristic features, However, it is not capable of
   differentiating the lesions from tuberculosis or malignancy. EUS-FNA is
   a safe and sensitive method of aspirating material for cytology and
   mycobacterial cultures. We believe it will provide a useful alternative
   in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.}},

Abstract = {{Fosfomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic which is established as
   therapy for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections. In addition,
   preliminary data indicate that fosfomycin has a potential role in the
   treatment of soft tissue infections. However, the use of fosfomycin has
   not been established for this condition, and it is unclear whether the
   level of fosfomycin penetration into human soft tissues is high enough
   to eradicate relevant pathogens. To better characterize the antibiotic
   potential of fosfomycin, we applied a combined in vivo
   pharmacokinetic-in vitro pharmacodynamic model to human volunteers. For
   this purpose fosfomycin concentrations in vivo in the fluid of the
   interstitial space of human soft tissues were measured by microdialysis
   following intravenous infusion of 4 or 8 g of fosfomycin (n = 6).
   Subsequently, bacterial isolates with relevance for soft tissue
   infections were exposed to concentrations according to the in vivo
   pharmacokinetic profile in the interstitial spare fluid obtained by
   microdialysis. Our experiments indicated a high degree of soft tissue
   penetration for fosfomycin, with ratios of the area under the
   concentration-time curve from 0 to 8 h for muscle
   (AUC(0-8muscle))/AUC(0-8serum) of 0.48 +/- 0.08 and 0.53 +/- 0.04 and
   ratios of AUC(0-8adipose tissue)/AUC(0-8serum) of 0.74 +/- 0.12 and 0.71
   +/- 0.11 following administration of 4 and 8 g, respectively. In
   corresponding in vitro simulation experiments with selected isolates of
   Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens for
   which MICs were 16 mu g/ml, organisms n;ere undetectable after a single
   dosing interval. Fosfomycin exhibits a strong ability to penetrate into
   the fluid of the interstitial space of soft tissues and reaches levels
   sufficient to substantially inhibit the growth of relevant bacteria at
   the target site. We therefore conclude that fosfomycin might qualify as
   an alternative candidate for the therapy of soft tissue infections.}},

Abstract = {{Taking Mo-Si compounds as model systems, we show that the coefficients
   of thermal expansion (CTEs) of complex structures can be calculated
   precisely from first principles by incorporating the Debye model for
   acoustic response. Specifically, we obtain a nearly isotropic CTE in
   MoSi2 but a highly anisotropic CTE in Mo5Si3. The CTE anisotropy in
   Mo5Si3 is due to an elastically more rigid basal plane and a higher
   anharmonicity along the c axis. As the structure of 5-3 compounds is
   modified from D8(m) to D8(l) by boron substitutions (Mo5SiB2), we
   predict a significant decrease in the CTE anisotropy, which is confirmed
   by experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Ultraviolet A ( UVA) radiation produces serious damage to skin,
   especially to dermis, but its damage to epidermis and responsible
   mechanisms are not fully understood. Studies were thus undertaken to
   investigate the effects of UVA or reactive oxygen species (ROS) on lipid
   peroxidation, cell cycle, and apoptosis in primary cultured rat
   keratinocytes and to determine the possible protect ive effects of tea
   polyphenols (TPP). UVA or ROS increased the release of plasma enzyme
   lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and increased lipid peroxidation production
   (malondialdehyde, MDA), but decreased the activity of glutathione
   peroxidase (GSH-Px), indicating that UVA or ROS were cytostatic and
   peroxidizing to keratinocytes. TPP stabilized and protected cell
   membranes from ROS or UVA by inhibiting the release of LDH, lowering MDA
   levels, and increasing GSH-Px activity. Flow cytometry ( FCM) analysis
   revealed that UVA or ROS decreased the proliferative index (PI); hence
   the cell growth was blocked in the S/G2 phase, with an increase in the
   percentage of apoptosis in primary keratinocytes. TPP modified the UVA
   or ROS-induced changes in PI and apoptosis. TPP may be useful to protect
   keratinocytes from UVA irradiation. In summary, these data demonstrated
   that UVA damage to skin keratinocytes in vitro was similar to that for
   ROS and that TPP protects against UVA-induced cytotoxicity by inhibiting
   lipid peroxidation and apoptosis.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study set out to determine to what extent recalled
   parental rearing styles (authoritarian, authoritativeness,
   permissiveness), personality (extraversion, neuroticism, psychoticism,
   lie), and self-esteem predicted self-rated happiness in a normal,
   nonclinical, population of young people in their late teens and early
   20s. Methods: Each participant completed a few questionnaires: the
   Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (revised), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem
   Scale, the Parental Authority Questionnaire and the Oxford Happiness
   Inventory. It was predicted that sex, extraversion, neuroticism,
   self-esteem and both maternal and paternal authoritativeness would be
   significant predictors of happiness. Results: Regressional and path
   analysis showed self-esteem to be the most dominant and powerful
   predictor of happiness. The effect of sex on happiness was moderated by
   neuroticism, which related to self-esteem, which directly influenced
   happiness. Stability, extraversion and maternal authoritativeness were
   significant predictors of self-esteem accounting for one-third of the
   variance. Conclusion: The results are considered in terms of the
   distinct literature on the relation between personality and happiness
   and on the relation between parental styles and self-esteem Self-esteem
   was both a direct and a moderator variable for young people's
   self-reported happiness. Extraversion had both direct and indirect
   predictive power of happiness, whereas neuroticism predicted happiness
   mediating through self-esteem. Maternal authoritativeness was the only
   direct predictor of happiness when paternal and maternal rearing styles
   were examined together, suggesting that a reasonable discipline
   exercised by mothers towards their children was particularly beneficial
   in enhancing the offsprings' self-esteem.}},

Abstract = {{The seasonal organization patterns of demersal assemblages (fish and
   cephalopods) in the Gulf of Lions were investigated on the basis of a
   set of bottom trawl surveys. The use of Partial Triadic Analysis (PTA)
   provided a detailed representation of: (1) the common part of the
   spatial organization of demersal assemblages at seasonal scale; and (2)
   the seasonal variability of each species around this common structure.
   During the course of the study, demersal assemblages exhibited a strong
   seasonal stability in their organization patterns and only few species
   showed a strong seasonal variation in their spatial distribution.
   Demersal assemblages of the Gulf of Lions were structured primarily on
   the basis of a non depth coast-open sea gradient, which occurred from
   the coast to the midshelf region. The influence of depth on the
   structure of fish assemblages appeared to be only of limited importance
   and mainly restricted to the continental slope area. The PTA combined
   with contouring technics could be used to improve our knowledge of
   community structuring factors, and offers a theoretical framework to
   assess the reproducibility of multispecies structures.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular genetics was used to devise the first reliable diagnostic tool
   for differentiating morphologically indistinguishable dorsal-spined,
   first-stage larvae (L1's) and other stages of the nematode
   protostrongylid subfamily Elaphostrongylinae. A polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) assay employing specifically designed primers was
   developed to selectively amplify DNA of the ITS-2 region of the
   ribosomal gene. Amplification of the entire ITS-2 region differentiated
   between larvae of the genera Elaphostrongylus and Parelaphostrongylus,
   based on the lengths of fragments produced. Three sets of primers were
   designed and used successfully to distinguish larvae at the species
   level. Although it was demonstrated that one primer set in a single PCR
   assay was capable of distinguishing each of the three
   Parelaphostrongylus spp., a second primer set would be required for
   confirmation in routine diagnostic use. Two of the three primer sets
   were capable of amplifying DNA from all six elaphostrongyline species
   and of identifying Elaphostrongylus alces and Parelaphostrongylus
   odocoilei. Although two separate fragments were produced from each
   Elaphostrongylus cervi and Elaphostrongylus rangiferi, it was not
   possible to distinguish these two parasites from each other based on the
   fragment size. The use of various nematodes, hosts, and fecal controls
   demonstrated the reliability of the primers for all developmental stages
   including L1's, third-stage larvae, and adult worms. These primers also
   have potential for identifying other lungworms as was shown by the
   amplification of Umingmakstrongylus pallikuukensis, the muskox
   protostrongylid, and Dictyocaulus sp, from white-tailed deer. Although
   this assay may benefit from further refinement, its present design
   provides researchers, wildlife managers, clinicians, and animal health
   regulators with a practical tool for the control, management, and study
   of meningeal and tissue worms and their close relatives.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the role of cystathionine gamma -synthase (CGS) in the
   regulation of methionine synthesis Arabidopsis plants were transformed
   with a full-length antisense CGS cDNA and transformants analysed. Plants
   that were heterozygous for the transgene showed a 20-fold reduction of
   CCS activity that was accompanied by severe growth retardation and
   morphological abnormalities, from germination to flowering. Application
   of exogenous methionine to the transgenic lines restored normal growth.
   Surprisingly, transformed Arabidopsis plants exhibited a modest decrease
   in methionine content (35\% reduction of the wild-type level) but a
   seven-fold decrease in the soluble pool of S-methylmethionine (SMM), a
   compound that plays a major role in storage and transport of reduced
   sulphur and labile methyl moieties. Several mechanisms can account for
   the maintenance of the soluble pool of methionine. First, the observed
   20-fold increase in O-phosphohomoserine, a substrate of CGS, could
   compensate for the depressed level of CGS polypeptide by increasing the
   net rate of catalysis supported by the remaining enzyme. Second, the
   transgenic plants exhibited a two-fold increased level of cystathionine
   beta -lyase, the second enzyme in the methionine biosynthetic pathway.
   This indicates that enzymes other than CGS are subjected to a regulatory
   control by methionine or one of its metabolites. In addition to these
   mechanisms affecting de novo methionine synthesis, the recruitment of
   SMM to produce methionine may account for the small change of methionine
   levels in transgenic lines. (C) 2000 Academie des sciences/Editions

Abstract = {{This report describes the first successful genetic engineering of
   tolerance to salt in an agriculturally important species of woody plants
   by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with the codA gene of
   Arthrobacter globiformis. This gene encodes choline oxidase, which
   catalyzes the oxidation of choline to glycinebetaine. The binary plasmid
   vector pGC95.091, containing a kanamycin-resistance gene (nptII), a gene
   for beta -glucuronidase (gusA) and the codA gene in its T-DNA region,
   was used with a disarmed strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, EHA101, to
   transform Japanese persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb. `Jiro') by the leaf
   disk transformation method. The pRS95.101 plasmid that included only
   nptII and gusA in the T-DNA region was used as a control. We selected
   eight transgenic lines with one or two copies of the T-DNA after
   transformation with pGC95.091 (PC lines) and three lines after
   transformation with pRS95.101 (PR lines). The eight PC lines produced
   choline oxidase and glycinebetaine whereas neither was found in
   untransformed `Jiro' and in the control PR lines. Transgenic plants grew
   normally, resembling wild-type plants both in vitro and ex vitro. The
   activity of photosystem II in leaves of the transgenic Japanese
   persimmon plants under NaCl stress was determined in terms of the ratio
   of the variable (F-v) to the maximum (F-m) fluorescence of chlorophyll
   (F-v/F-m). The rate of decline in (F-v/F-m under NaCl stress was lower
   in the PC lines than in the control PR lines. These results demonstrated
   that genetic engineering of Japanese persimmon, which allowed it to
   accumulate glycinebetaine, enhanced the tolerance to salt stress of this
   plant.}},

Abstract = {{The first data on the ecology of rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus)
   introduced to the Iberian peninsula are presented. The habitat and diet
   variation of rudd were studied in Lake Banyoles (Spain), an oligotrophic
   karstic lake dominated by exotic fish species. Rudd were strictly
   littoral and the diet was based on detritus and plant material. The most
   important animal prey were the cladocerans Daphnia longispina and
   Scapholeberis rammneri, amphipods and several late stages of nematoceran
   dipterans. Rudd were more zooplanktivorous in spring and autumn and less
   in summer. There was also a size-dependent diet shift, from
   microcrustaceans to macroinvertebrates. The diet of rudd was also
   distinguished by the importance of plant material and various small
   neustonic invertebrates, particularly S. rammneri and late stages of
   nematocerans, showing a strong resource partitioning with other fish
   species. The degree of herbivory in Lake Banyoles was lower than usual.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to compare the performance of
   thyristor-controlled reactors (TCR) and shunt-connected PWR I voltage
   source inverters (PWM-VSI) for compensation of flicker caused by are
   furnaces, First of all, are-furnace principles are presented in order to
   explain the main characteristics of the problem. Secondly, traditional
   TCR control are analyzed. An improved measuring procedure is suggested
   to enhance TCR performance showing that it achieves faster compensation
   than more traditional methods. Thirdly, PWM-VSI control for flicker
   compensation is described in detail using Park's transformation. The
   analysis shows how real and reactive power control can be decoupled,
   Continuous-time and discrete-time models are considered, Finally, a TCR
   control and a PWM-VSI control are compared by simulation using data and
   measurements from a real are-furnace installation, The analysis
   considers three different periods of the production cycle: a) bore-down,
   b) fusion, and c) refining, It is clear from the results obtained that a
   shunt-connected PWM-VSI is better than a TCR for flicker compensation.
   This can be easily justified noting that the bandwidth of the PWM-VSI
   control system is far better than that of the TCR control, However, the
   control system for a PWM-VSI inverter is more complicated than that of a
   TCR, Besides, the latter uses a better-established technology than the
   former.}},

Abstract = {{The microarchitecture of bone is regulated by complex interactions
   between the bone-forming and resorbing cells, and several compounds
   regulate both actions. For example, vitamin D, which is required for
   bone mineralization, also stimulates bone resorption. Transgenic mice
   overexpressing the vitamin D receptor solely in mature cells of the
   osteoblastic bone-forming lineage were generated to test the potential
   therapeutic value of shifting the balance of vitamin D activity in favor
   of bone formation. Cortical bone was 5\% wider and 15\% stronger in
   these mice due to a doubling of periosteal mineral apposition rate
   without altered body weight or calcium homeostatic hormone levels. A
   20\% increase in trabecular bone volume in transgenic vertebrae was also
   observed, unexpectedly associated with a 30\% reduction in resorption
   surface rather than greater bone formation. These findings indicate
   anabolic vitamin D activity in bone and identify a previously unknown
   pathway from mature osteoblastic cells to inhibit osteoclastic bone
   resorption, counterbalancing the known stimulatory action through
   immature osteoblastic cells. A therapeutic approach that both stimulates
   cortical anabolic and inhibits trabecular resorptive pathways would be
   ideal for treatment of osteoporosis and other osteopenic disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Psychosocial problems cause much of the morbidity among
   children, and their frequency of presentation in primary care is
   growing. How is primary care treatment of children's psychosocial
   problems affected by child symptoms, physician training, practice
   structure, insurance, physician/patient relationship, and family
   demographics?
   Design. Questionnaire study of treatment of psychosocial problems during
   office visits by children.
   Settings. At total of 401 primary care offices from 44 US states, Puerto
   Rico, and Canada.
   Patients. From 21 150 children seen in office visits, we selected
   children with an identified psychosocial problem but who were not
   already receiving specialty mental health services (n = 2618 children).
   Outcome Measures. Clinicians' decisions to counsel families, to refer
   children to mental health specialists, or to prescribe medication.
   Results. The treatment choices of primary care clinicians (PCCs) were
   generally independent of patients' demographics or insurance status.
   Clinicians' training, beliefs about mental health, and practice
   structure had no effect on treatment choices. However, clinicians seeing
   their own patients were more likely to prescribe medications for
   attention problems. The clinician's perception about whether the parent
   agreed with the treatment choice was important for every treatment
   modality. Counseling and referral were more common and medication was
   less common when a problem was newly recognized at the visit.
   Conclusions. Structural factors such as practice type, insurance
   coverage, and physician training were less important for treatment than
   were process factors, such as whether the visit was a psychosocial
   problem visit, whether the problem was newly or previously recognized,
   and whether the family and clinician were familiar with each other and
   in accord about treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Geological map data are often underused in mineral-exploration programs,
   which rely increasingly on regolith geochemistry and geophysical and
   other remotely sensed data to generate exploration targets. However,
   solid geology maps, which are progressively being upgraded due to
   improved interpretations of superior, remotely sensed images and
   airborne geophysical data, can be useful in targeting specific types of
   mineral deposits, which formed late in the evolutionary history of the
   host terrane. In such terranes, the present map geometry is essentially
   the same as that at the time of deposit formation. This is the case for
   orogenic lode-gold deposits, which commonly show predictable structural
   controls and/or structural geometry. Thus, the shape of a rock body, or
   combinations of structures and rock bodies, may provide an important
   guide to the exploration potential for orogenic lode-gold deposits.
   However, until recently, there has been a dearth of techniques to
   quantify the various properties of shape, and hence test the potential
   of the two-dimensional shape of geological bodies in map view as an
   exploration tool. Integrating techniques from the field of pattern
   recognition with a modern Geographical Information System (GIS) can
   provide the shape-analysis tools required to investigate the geometries
   of geological shapes. Two-dimensional shape analysis is now possible
   through the calculation of several shape metrics including, but not
   restricted to, aspect ratio, blockiness, elongation, compactness,
   complexity, roundness, spreadness and squareness. Methods are developed
   for describing the geometries of rock units about mineral deposits, or
   any geological features, at any scale, which for the first time makes it
   possible to compare shapes. These shape-analysis techniques are tested
   using orogenic lode-gold deposits, particularly those in the Kalgoorlie
   Terrane of the highly auriferous Late Archaean Norseman-Wiluna Belt of
   Western Australia. On a global scale, shape analysis indicates that
   those greenstone belts whose volcanic rock sequences have high
   elongation and relative low roundness, complexity and aspect ratio (e.g.
   Kalgoorlie Terrane) are likely to be the most richly endowed in gold. On
   a more local scale, characteristics of the shape of geological features
   around the Golden Mile deposit are calculated and used to test the
   likelihood of occurrence of gold deposits with similar geometry
   elsewhere in the Kalgoorlie Terrane. The area with the most closely
   matching shape, on the basis of a 2 km clipping-circle radius, chosen on
   the basis of available proximity-analysis data, corresponds to the
   recently discovered Ghost Crab deposit, illustrating the potential of
   the shape analysis methodology in mineral exploration. Shape analysis
   is, at least in part, scale dependent, due to the inherent problem of
   being able to define rock boundaries more precisely in units that have
   strong geophysical signatures than those with weak signatures in poorly
   exposed terranes. Overcoming this problem is a challenge to the
   application of this methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Using theories by Pierre Bourdieu and the Frankfurt School that causally
   link art to class interests, this article examines the differential
   development of modern architecture in the United States and central
   Europe during the early 20th century. Modern architecture was the
   aesthetic expression of technocracy, a movement of the new class of
   professionals, managers and engineers to place itself at the center of
   rationalized capitalism. The aesthetic of modernism. which glorified
   technology and instrumental reason, was weak and undeveloped in the US,
   because this class defined by its cultural capital was quickly
   integrated into modernizing corporations, where it was compelled to
   cater to the emerging mass market and drop its distinctive aesthetic.
   Modern architecture emerged mainly in interwar central Europe, because
   here industrial modernization was blocked, forcing the new class to
   pursue an alliance with state managers pushing modernization. Thus
   unencumbered by the demands of the mass market, modem architects were
   free to express their machine aesthetic in state-financed housing

Abstract = {{The mammalian neocortex is a highly complex structure that consists of a
   large number of distinct cell types and connections unparalleled
   throughout the rest of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). The
   neocortex is responsible for high-level functions including sensorimotor
   integration, associative behavior, and cognition. Although many studies
   demonstrate that embryonic tissue or precursor cells transplanted into
   the embryonic or neonatal cortex can integrate and connect with a wide
   variety of targets, such connectivity in most studies using adult
   recipients has been quite limited (1, 2). In contrast, relatively recent
   advances in transplantation paradigms from our laboratory and other
   laboratories have made apparent the possibility of successful
   reconstruction of complex cortical circuitry in the adult mammalian
   brain by transplantation or by manipulation of endogenous precursors in
   situ. These advances include the ability to isolate increasingly
   specific populations of immature neurons and precursors from donor
   animals, and the establishment of a highly selective model of targeted
   degeneration in the neocortex (3-10, Leavitt, unpublished observations).
   Such advances now allow both the transplantation of more defined and
   specific populations of immature neocortical neuroblasts and precursors,
   and also make it possible to study the cellular, anatomic, and
   functional efficacy of both transplantation and manipulation of
   endogenous precursors in situ (9, 11) in increasingly refined models of
   neocortical degeneration. The neocortex has become a model system for
   studying circuitry formation, regional specification, cell
   specification, and cell autonomous versus environmental influences on
   neuronal development and function in the CNS. Although neocortical
   transplantation paradigms have proven very useful for elucidating how
   complex circuits and CNS cytoarchitecture evolve in the mammalian brain,
   more recent work using cell transplantation has made apparent the
   possibility of cell replacement and complex circuit repair in the
   neocortex. Our most recent results (9, 11) suggest that neuronal
   replacement therapies for neurodegenerative disease and other CNS injury
   may even some day be possible via molecular manipulation of endogenous
   neural precursors in situ, without transplantation. Although only
   fanciful just several years ago, it now appears that studies of cellular
   repopulation and circuitry reconstruction in the neocortex may provide a
   foundation toward developing cellular therapies for degenerative or
   acquired disease in neocortex and other regions of the CNS.}},

Abstract = {{Circulating anticoagulants are endogenously produced substances that
   interfere with in vitro tests of coagulation like activated partial
   thromboplastin time (APTT), and cause prolongation of the clotting
   limes. Evaluation of the abnormal APTT involving various factor assays
   and mixing studies may provide inconclusive and ambiguous results.
   Tissue thromboplastin inhibition test (TTIT) is one of the screening
   assays for detection of circulating anticoagulants. However, this test
   is influenced by the presence of unfractionated heparin (UFH) from
   concentrations 0.2 U/mL and higher. Since low-molecular-weight heparins
   (LMWHs) are increasingly used for the prevention of thrombotic disorders
   and may replace UFH in the future, in this study the authors studied the
   influence of LMWHs on the performance of TTIT and compared the results
   with UFH. UFH and LMWHs showed a prolongation of TTIT in the
   concentration range of 0.25-1.0 U/mL. The marked prolongation of the
   TTIT with UFH and different LMWHs is in decreasing order of UFN >
   ardeparin > tinzaparin > dalteparin > enoxaparin. Patients with
   circulating anticoagulants who are given LMWHs may have false-positive
   results of TTIT and this influence should be kept in mind during patient

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To assess if the learning process associated with computed
   tomography fluoroscopy (CTF) technology influences procedure and
   fluoroscopy times for percutaneous biopsy procedures.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective analysis of the initial 250
   consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous biopsy with use of a CT
   scanner equipped with rapid image reconstruction and fluoroscopic
   capabilities in a 24-month period, All procedures were performed with
   both continuous and spot fluoroscopic technique, with typical radiation
   parameters of 50 mA, 120 kV, and a 10-mm-slice thickness. The procedures
   were all performed by a single experienced interventional radiologist to
   limit the variables of physician expertise, interventional materials
   used, and biopsy approach, The subject group was divided into five equal
   consecutive groups of 50 patients. In each subgroup, the authors
   recorded mean lesion size, success, and complication rates, as well as
   mean procedure and fluoroscopy times,
   RESULTS: The five subgroups were similar patient populations as
   documented by the absence of statistically significant differences when
   comparing mean lesion size, procedure success, and complication rates (P
   >.05; ANOVA test). A statistically significant decrease in mean
   fluoroscopy (groups 1-5: 50.26 vs 45.24 vs 33.86 vs 32.68 vs 25.8
   sec/patient) and mean procedure times (groups 1-5: 30.08 vs 27.9 vs
   26.34 vs 25.6 vs 21.6 min/patient) was recorded between the patient
   subgroups (P <.0001; ANOVA test).
   CONCLUSION: The learning process associated with CTF technology impacts
   procedure parameters by decreasing both mean procedure and fluoroscopy
   times, thereby increasing patient turnover and decreasing radiation
   exposure to the patient and the operator.}},

Abstract = {{Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) exerts a negative feedback effect
   on GH secretion via either direct actions at the pituitary level or
   indirect ones at the hypothalamic level, through stimulation of
   somatostatin (SS) and/or inhibition of GHRH release. In fact,
   recombinant human IGF-I (rhIGF-I) in humans inhibits spontaneous GH
   secretion as well as the GH response to GHRH and even more to
   GH/GH-releasing peptides, whose main action is on the hypothalamus,
   antagonizing SS and enhancing GHRH activity. The aim of the present
   study was to further clarify in humans the mechanisms underlying
   IGF-I-induced inhibition of somatotroph secretion. In six normal young
   volunteers (all women; mean +/- SEM: age, 28.3 +/- 1.2 yr; body mass
   index, 21.3 +/- 1.2 kg/m(2)) we studied the GH response to GHRH (1 mu
   g/kg, iv, at 0 min), both alone and combined with arginine (ARG; 0.5
   g/kg, iv, from 0-30 min), which probably acts via inhibition of
   hypothalamic SS release, after pretreatment with rhIGF-I (20 mu g/kg,
   se, at -180 min) or placebo. rhIGF-I increased circulating IGF-I levels
   (peak at -60 us. -180 min: 54.9 +/- 3.9 vs. 35.9 +/- 3.3 mmol/L; Pt
   0.05) to a reproducible extent, and these levels remained stable and
   within the normal range until 90 min. The mean GH concentration over 3 h
   (from -180 to 0 min) before ARG and/or GHRH was not modified by placebo
   or rhIGF-I. After placebo, the GH response to GHRH (peak, 23.6 + 2.9 mu
   g/L) was strikingly enhanced (P < 0.05) by ARG coadministration (69.6
   +/- 9.9 mu g/L). rhIGF-I blunted the GH response to GHRH (13.1 +/- 4.5
   mu g/gL; P < 0.05), whereas that to GHRH plus ARG was not modified (59.5
   +/- 8.9 mu g/L), although it occurred with some delay. Mean glucose and
   insulin concentrations were not modified by either placebo or rhIGF-I.
   In conclusion, ARG counteracts the inhibitory effect of rhIGF-I on
   somatotroph responsiveness to GHRH in humans. These findings suggest
   that the acute inhibitory effect of rhIGF-I on the GH response to GHRH
   takes place on the hypothalamus, possibly via enhancement of SS release,
   and that ARG overrides this action.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses least-squares estimation of parameters in digital
   input/output models of linear time-invariant distributed systems in the

   infinite-dimensional input/output models are considered. The paper
   derives a number of new results for recursive least-squares estimation

   which parameter estimates converge with increasing amounts of data. The
   most important result is an equivalence between least-squares parameter
   estimation on an infinite interval (i.e., with infinitely long data

Abstract = {{The blue mussels Mytilus edulis L. and M. galloprovincialis Lmk.
   hybridize in western Europe. Within hybrid populations nuclear alleles
   specific to M. galloprovincialis increase in frequency with age and
   size. This relationship changes with tidal height, alleles from M.
   galloprovincialis occur more frequently high in the intertidal zone,
   while M. edulis alleles predominate in the low intertidal zone. We
   tested the hypotheses that larvae with nl, galloprovincialis alleles
   tend to settle higher in the intertidal zone, or that mussels
   redistribute themselves with respect to tidal height after initial
   larval settlement. We sampled recently metamorphosed mussels every 2
   weeks in a hybrid mussel population at Whitsand Bay in southwest England
   throughout the summer of 1996. We observed four cohorts of newly settled
   mussels. There was no evidence of differential settlement of mussels
   with different genotypes in connection with tidal height, or into shaded
   versus unshaded microsites. Therefore, we rejected the preferential
   settlement hypothesis. There was substantial movement of juvenile
   mussels in the first 4 weeks following initial settlement, but this
   ``secondary settlement{''} did not result in genetic differentiation
   with respect to tidal height. Further, significant differences in allele
   frequencies were found between primary and secondary spat. This allele
   frequency change was in the opposite direction of that seen in the adult
   population, suggesting newly settled larvae may be experiencing
   different selective pressures than adults. We propose that the genetic
   structure of hybrid mussel populations with respect to tidal height is
   the consequence of differences in selection intensity.}},

Abstract = {{The literature on the narrowing of the gender wage gap during the 1980s
   considers, among other factors, the closing of the male-female
   differential in post-secondary education. This paper looks specifically
   at the role played by the dramatic relative increase in women's
   enrollment in two-year colleges. With independent cross-sections
   developed using NLSY data, the authors find that the gender wage gap
   narrowed by 0.0469 log points between 1985 and 1990 and by 0.0932 log
   points between 1989 and 1994. The more pronounced decrease observed for
   1989-94 is largely explained by erosion of male-female differences in
   weeks worked, job tenure, and full-time employment. A more novel finding
   is evidence that while change in the quantity of education provides
   essentially no explanatory power, disaggregating education by two-year
   and four-year providers and by major field of study accounts for
   8.5-11\% of the closing of the wage gap over the 1989-94 period.}},

Abstract = {{The predictive values of tumour markers Carcinoma-Associated Antigen CA
   15-3, Tissue Polypeptide Specific Antigen (TPS) and Carcinoembryonic
   Antigen (CEA) in recurrence of breast cancer are unclear. The aim of
   this study was to examine the predictive value of these markers in our
   population of 1448 patients with diagnosed breast cancer. Data and mean
   follow-up of 4.4 years were available on 1082 women of whom 277 had
   documented recurrence (mean follow up 5.7 years). The recurrence free
   patients had a mean follow up of 3.9 years. The sensitivity,
   specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive
   value (NPV) of CA 15-3, TPS and CEA for visceral, bony and locoregional
   recurrence were calculated. CA 15-3 was the most sensitive marker, 68\%
   for visceral and 69\% for bony recurrence. This compared with TPS, 64\%
   and 51\% and CEA, 27\% and 46\% for visceral and bony recurrence
   respectively. The positive predictive value of CA 15-3 at 47\% for
   visceral and 54\% for bony recurrence was greater than that for TPS
   (visceral 25\%, bony 21\%) or CEA (visceral 18\%, bony 26\%). The
   sensitivity of CA 15-3 and TPS for locoregional recurrence was low at
   23\% and 17\% respectively. A combination of CA 15-3, TPS and CEA failed
   to increase the sensitivity of CA 15-3 for visceral recurrence. However,
   a marginally increased sensitivity was recorded for combined CA 15-3 and
   TPS (70\%) and for combined CA 15-3, TPS and CEA (71\%) in bony
   recurrence. The mean lead time effect in visceral recurrence for TPS and
   CA 15-3 were 8 and 10 months respectively. In patients with bony
   recurrence the mean lead time effect for TPS and CA 15-3 were 7.5 and
   8.25 months. Mean lead time effect was increased to 9 and 11 months for
   bony and visceral recurrance respectively when CA 15-3 and TPS were
   combined.
   CA 15-3 remains the most sensitive tumour marker in breast cancer follow
   up with a significanlty greater positive predictive value when compared
   to TPS or CEA. Both TPS and CEA failed to complement the sensitivity of
   CA 15-3 when measured in combination. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the impact of case mix variation on the
   performance of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation
   (APACHE) II using measures of calibration and discrimination,
   Design: APACHE II data were collected prospectively at the surgical
   intensive care unit of the University of Vermont on all adult admissions
   over an 8-yr period (excluding cardiac surgical patients, burn patients,
   and patients <16 yrs of age), The original case mix was systematically
   varied to create 2,000 different case mixes ranging in mortality between
   5\% and 18\% using a computer-intensive resampling algorithm. The area
   under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the
   Hosmer-Lemeshow C statistic were derived for each of the simulated case
   mixes with bootstrapping.
   Setting. The surgical intensive care unit at a 450-bed teaching
   hospital.
   Patients: A group of 6,806 adult surgical patients excluding cardiac
   surgical patients and burn patients.
   Measurements and Results: Simulated data sets were created from a
   database of patients treated at a single institution to test the
   hypothesis that the performance of APACHE II is stable across a
   clinically reasonable range of mortality rates, The discrimination and
   calibration of APACHE II varied with case mix,
   Conclusion:The discrimination of APACHE II is not independent of case
   mix. However, the variability of the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic as a
   function of the case mix may simply reflect the limitations of this
   goodness of fit statistic to assess model calibration, Because the
   discrimination of APACHE II is a function of case mix, caution should be
   exercised when using APACHE II-based adjusted mortality rates to compare
   intensive care units with widely divergent case mixes.}},

Abstract = {{Signal transduction pathways that mediate neuronal commitment to
   apoptosis involve the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) transcription
   factor. Bcl-X-L is a potent regulator of apoptosis in the CNS and is
   highly expressed in the developing and adult brain. We identified three
   putative NF-kappa B DNA binding sequences clustered upstream of the
   brain-specific transcription start site in the upstream promoter region.
   Recombinant p50/p50 and NF-kappa B proteins from nuclear extracts bound
   to these sites as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and
   biotin-oligonucleotide/streptavidin affinity assays. NF-kappa B
   overexpression, coupled with bcl-x promoter/reporter assays using a
   series of murine bcl-x promoter and deletion mutants, has identified the
   downstream 1.1 kb of the bcl-x promoter as necessary for basal promoter
   activity and induction by NF-kappa B. The mutagenic removal of NF-kappa
   B binding sites individually or in combination revealed altered response
   patterns to p49/p65 and p50/p65 overexpression. These results support
   the hypothesis that NF-kappa B can act to enhance Bcl-X-L expression via
   highly selective interactions, where NF-kappa B binding and bcl-x
   promoter activation are dependent on both DNA binding site sequence and
   NF-kappa B subunit composition. Our data suggest that molecular events
   associated with NF-kappa B promote regulation of neuronal apoptosis in

Abstract = {{Background-The value of diving medicals in preventing incidents is
   uncertain and there has been only limited evaluation of the fitness to
   dive guidelines in a sport diving population.
   Objective-To examine the need for routine diving medical examinations in
   the Scottish Sub-Aqua Club (SSAC) between 1991 and 1998.
   Methods-A medical examination of all SSAC divers is performed at entry
   and then every one to five years based on their age and medical
   condition This information was analysed in terms of questionnaire
   findings and examination abnormalities.
   Results-There were 2962 medical forms available for analysis.
   Examination abnormalities were found in 174 subjects (5.9\% of the
   population), with obesity affecting 75 subjects (2.5\%). There was a
   linear increase in mean body mass index (r(2) 0.92), and a significant
   difference between 1991 and 1998 (mean (SD) of 24.1 (3.07) and 25.02
   (3.4) respectively, p = 0.002) which was not related to age or sex
   distribution. There was also a significant increase in the prevalence of
   smokers (chi(2) = 4.02, p = 0.045). The most common specialist referral
   was for evaluation of asthma, with hypertension and obesity as the next
   most common reasons. Most subjects were allowed to dive, with only 43
   (25\%) being failed outright. Overall, no examination abnormality alone
   caused a subject to be classified unfit to dive, and referrals were
   prompted by the answers in the questionnaire.
   Conclusions-No significant unexpected abnormalities were found on
   clinical examination in this population of sport divers. Conditions that
   prevented subjects from diving were detected by the questionnaire, and
   this prompted referral for further assessment by the medical advisors.
   Routine medical examinations were of little value.}},

Abstract = {{An object encoding translates a language with object primitives to one
   without. Similarly, a class encoding translates classes into other
   primitives. Both are important theoretically for comparing the
   expressive power of languages and for transferring results from
   traditional languages to those with objects and classes. Both are also
   important foundations for the implementation of object-oriented
   languages as compilers typically include a phase that performs these
   translations.
   This paper describes a language with a primitive notion of classes and
   objects and presents an encoding of this language into one with records
   and functions. The encoding uses two techniques often used in compilers
   for single-inheritance class-based object-oriented languages: the
   self-application semantics and the method-table technique. To type the
   output of the encoding, the encoding uses a new formulation of self
   quantifiers that is more powerful than previous approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to study the
   effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on endotoxin
   (lipopolysaccharide)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in Fischer
   rats. We found that rats treated with 50 mug/kg TCDD had increased
   sensitivity to endotoxin, resulting in an approximately 2-fold increase
   in the level of NO production detected as nitrosylhemoglobin (HbNO) in
   venous blood. At lower concentrations (less than or equal to5 mug/kg),
   TCDD did not affect the endotoxin-induced NO production. The TNF-alpha
   serum concentration was found to parallel that of NO. TCDD alone did not
   induce the production of detectable HbNO or TNF-alpha. We found that
   TCDD induced a dose-dependent increase in the EPR signal intensity of
   (Fe3+) low-spin methemoprotein complexes found in the liver and kidney.
   These species with EPR resonance at g = 2.43, 2.26, and 1.92 are
   attributed to low-spin Fe3+ in cytochromes P450 and P420. Our data
   confirm previous studies that have shown that TCDD induces a
   dose-dependent increase in the production of some cytochrome P450
   enzymes. However, in rats that were subsequently challenged with
   endotoxin, a smaller increase in the EPR intensity of these species was
   observed. The decrease in the low-spin Fe3+ cytochrome P450 EPR signal
   in endotoxin-challenged rats could be due to one or more of the
   following occurring: (1) cytochrome destruction, (2) reduction of the
   ferric to the ESR-silent ferrous oxidation state of cytochromes by
   nitric oxide, and/or (3) formation of ferrous nitrosyl cytochrome
   complexes that contribute, in part, to the characteristic
   five-coordinate nitrosyl hemoprotein triplet also observed in these
   tissues. Since low concentrations of endotoxin can leak from the gut
   lumen into the systemic circulation, this investigation explores the
   possibility that endotoxin interaction with TCDD may be, in part,
   responsible for the effects of TCDD observed in these tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Human pancreatic cells with a typical ductal phenotype and potential to
   proliferate can be obtained in vitro, but the differentiation capacity
   of these putative human pancreatic stem cells remains to be documented.
   We investigated the protein and mRNA expression of insulin promoter
   factor 1 (IPF-1) (or pancreas/duodenal homeobox 1), a transcription
   factor critical for pancreatic development and endocrine cell
   neogenesis, in human pancreatic ductal cells derived from cultured
   exocrine tissue. In vitro, exocrine cells rapidly adhered (within 12 h)
   and were de-/transdifferentiated to ductal cells after 3 days with a
   dramatic loss of amylase protein (n = 4, 92 +/- 3,3\%, P < 0.05 vs. day
   1) and a simultaneous increase of ductal cytokeratin 19 protein (n = 4,
   3.4-fold on day 3 and 7-fold on day 9, P 4 0.05 vs, day 1), IPF-1
   protein and mRNA levels were low to undetectable in exocrine
   preparations before culture. After 2 days of culture, a 3.2-fold
   increase in IPF-1 protein was observed, corresponding to the
   characteristic 46kDa protein in Western blots. Reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmed a 10.5-fold increase
   in IPF-1 mRNA levels after 3 days of culture (n = 5, P < 0.001 vs. day
   1), Double immunocytochemistry showed direct evidence that IPF-1
   appeared during culture in these exocrine-derived ductal cells
   (cytokeratin 7-positive) and was not merely in contaminating endocrine
   cells (chromogranin A-positive). In conclusion, we describe herein the
   first converging evidence on both the molecular and protein level that
   human cells with a typical ductal phenotype derived ex vivo from
   pancreatic exocrine tissue (obtained from healthy donors) can reexpress
   IPF-1 in culture, suggesting their pancreatic precursor/stem cell
   potential.}},

   4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (4-CPA), but no 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic
   acid (2,4,D) or beta-naphtoxyacetic acid (BNOA) residues. Seasonal
   variations in the mean 4-CPA residues of greenhouse tomatoes were

   0.363+/-0.150 mg kg(-1), respectively. The difference was not
   statistically significant (p>0.05). The average 4-CPA residue in
   abnormally shaped fruit is greater than 0.3 mg kg(-1). While misshapen

   to recover the unknown input sequence from a given segment of the output
   sequence, provided that the filter function is known. Unlike the
   inversion attack, which requires that the filter function be linear in
   the first or the last input variable. this attack can be applied for any

   Experimental results for extended conducting objects show pronounced
   deviations from the quasistatic model due to excitation of the surface

   imaging, namely: (i) strong collimation of the fields away from the

Abstract = {{Big crystals (mm-sized) with anomalous tubular morphology were
   synthesised in the Bi-Nb-S system. Their structural study by electron
   microscopy and related techniques revealed that they can be described as
   misfit layer structures, a type of composite modulated structures. The
   misfit monolayer;approximate to BiNbS3 and bilayer approximate to
   BiNb2S5 phases appear as well in the preparation but with lamellar
   morphology as it is typical for these kind of compounds. They consist of
   periodical intergrowth of pseudotetragonal layers BiS (Q) with
   pseudohexagonal layers NbS2 (H). approximate to BiNbS3 has a stacking
   sequence ...Q,H,Q,H,... and approximate to BiNb2S5 has a stacking
   sequence...Q,H,H,Q,H,H,... Backscattered electron imaging, wavelength
   dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy of
   transversal cross-sections of single tubular crystals showed that these
   crystals present a strong compositional and inter-laminar stacking
   disorder along the tube radius. This disorder is suggested to be the
   cause for the original wrapping of the layers that gives rise to the
   tubes. Besides the disordered areas, some ordered slabs have been found
   with stacking sequences corresponding to binary 3R-NbS2 (approximate to
   6 Angstrom) approximate to BiNb2S5 (approximate to 17.4 Angstrom) (which
   dominate in the crystal) and to a new related phase approximate to
   BiNb4S9 with a stacking sequence...Q,H,H,H,H,Q,H,H,H,H,... and a
   periodicity of approximate to 29.2 Angstrom. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE, We compared the soft-copy images produced by a digital chest
   radiograph system that uses a flat-panel X-ray detector based on
   amorphous selenium with images produced by a storage phosphor
   radiography system for the visualization of anatomic regions of the
   chest.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. Two chest radiologists and two residents analyzed
   46 pairs of posteroanterior chest radiographs on high-resolution video
   monitors (2560 x 2048 x 8 bits). In each pair, one radiograph was
   obtained with a storage phosphor radiography system, and the other
   radiograph was obtained with a selenium-based flat-panel detector
   radiography system. Each pair of radiographs was obtained at the same
   exposure settings. The interpreter rated the visibility and radiographic
   quality of 11 different anatomic regions. Each pair of images was ranked
   on a five-point scale (1 = prefer image A, 3 = no preference, 5 = prefer
   image B) for preference of technique. Statistical significance of
   preference was determined using the Wilcoxon's signed rank test.
   RESULTS. The interpreters had a statistically significant preference for
   the selenium-based radiography system in six (unobscured lung, hilum,
   rib, minor fissure, heart border and overall appearance) of 11 anatomic
   regions (p < 0.001) and for the storage phosphor system in two regions
   (proximal airway and thoracic spine) (p < 0.05), Chest radiologists
   strongly preferred selmium-based images in eight regions, and they did
   not prefer storage phosphor images in any region.
   CONCLUSION. The soft-copy images produced by the selenium-based
   radiography system were perceived as equal or superior to those produced
   by the storage phosphor system in most but not all anatomic regions.}},

Abstract = {{We postulate that metabolic conditions that develop systemically during
   exercise (high blood lactate and high nonesterified fatty acids) are
   favorable for energy homeostasis of the heart during contractile
   stimulation. We used working rat hearts perfused at physiological
   workload and levels of the major energy substrates and compared the
   metabolic and contractile responses to an acute low-to-high work
   transition under resting versus exercising systemic metabolic conditions
   (low vs. high lactate and nonesterified fatty acids in the perfusate).
   Glycogen preservation, resulting from better maintenance of high-energy
   phosphates, was a consequence of improved energy homeostasis with high
   fat and lactate. We explained the result by tighter coupling between
   workload and total beta-oxidation. Total fatty acid oxidation with high
   fat and lactate reflected increased availability of exogenous and
   endogenous fats for respiration, as evidenced by increased long-chain
   fatty acyl-CoA esters (LCFA-CoAs) and by an increased contribution of
   triglycerides to total beta-oxidation. Triglyceride turnover (synthesis
   and degradation) also appeared to increase. Elevated LCFA-CoAs caused
   high total beta-oxidation despite increased malonyl-CoA. The resulting
   bottleneck at mitochondrial uptake of LCFA-CoAs stimulated triglyceride
   synthesis. Our results suggest the following. First, both malonyl-CoA
   and LCFA-CoAs determine total fatty acid oxidation in heart. Second,
   concomitant stimulation of peripheral glycolysis and lipolysis should
   improve cardiac energy homeostasis during exercise. We speculate that
   high lactate contributes to the salutary effect by bypassing the
   glycolytic block imposed by fatty acids, acting as an anaplerotic
   substrate necessary for high tricarbocylic acid cycle flux from fatty
   acid-derived acetyl-CoA.}},

Abstract = {{Non-uniformity of fascicle parameters (fascicle lengths and orientation)
   within one skeletal muscle is well known. These parameters have an
   effect on the physiological cross-sectional area and lengthening rate of
   the skeletal muscle. Using a binocular microscope with a table driver
   (q- and p-axes) and vertical drive (Y-axis) as a tool for reconstruction
   of the spatial orientation of single muscle fascicles, we developed an
   approach for three-dimensional analysis of the arrangement and length
   distribution in the skeletal muscle of small mammals. Two subunits of
   the triceps brachii muscle of the Galea musteloides forelimb, triceps
   longum and triceps laterale, were quantified and compared. Our data show
   that in the triceps laterale the fascicles are significantly longer
   (10.23 mm, SD=1.19, n=41) than those in the triceps longum (6.58 mm,
   SD=2.88, n=39). In the triceps laterale, the fascicle orientation is
   more or less uniform, whereas, in the triceps longum, there are two
   areas with different orientation of fascicles: anterior and posterior
   ones. Different inner architecture of the subunits can be interpreted as
   an adaptation to the main locomotory function of the triceps muscle,
   namely production of propulsive force during limb transfer phase and
   keeping dynamic stability during stance phase. Comparison of our data on
   the fascicle length and geometry with our previous histochemical results
   on G. musteloides, shows that the anterior region of the triceps longum,
   which differs in the fascicle orientation, also contains a significantly
   larger percent of slow muscle fibres. It is hypothesised here that this
   small region is involved in keeping posture.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To investigate the association between outdoor air pollution
   and mortality in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   Design-Time series study
   Methods-All causes, respiratory and cardiovascular mortality were
   analysed and the role of age and socioeconomic status in modifying
   associations between mortality and air pollution were investigated.
   Models used Poisson regression and included terms for temporal patterns,
   meteorology, and autocorrelation.
   Main results-All causes all ages mortality showed much smaller
   associations with air pollution than mortality for specific causes and
   age groups. In the elderly, a 3-4\% increase in daily deaths for all
   causes and for cardiovascular diseases was associated with an increase
   in fine particulate matter and in sulphur dioxide from the 10th to the
   90th percentile. For respiratory deaths the increase in mortality was
   higher (6\%). Cardiovascular deaths were additionally associated with
   levels of carbon monoxide (4\% increase in daily deaths). The
   associations between air pollutants and mortality in children under 5
   years of age were not statistically significant. There was a significant
   trend of increasing risk of death according to age with effects most
   evident for subjects over 65 years old. The effect of air pollution was
   also larger in areas of higher socioeconomic level.
   Conclusions-These results show further evidence of an association
   between air pollution and mortality but of smaller magnitude than found
   in other similar studies. In addition, it seems that older age groups
   are at a higher risk of mortality associated with air pollution. Such
   complexity should be taken into account in health risk assessment based
   on time series studies.}},

Abstract = {{This article aims to assess, selectively rather than exhaustively, the
   contribution to Catholic literature in the Victorian period, of the poet
   and essayist Coventry Patmore(1823-1896), who stands out as perhaps the
   leading Catholic literary figure of his time. An account is given of his
   guiding theme, that is, his nuptial philosophy, and a view is put
   forward of the controversy over his Sponsa Dei and its destruction. His
   position in relation to certain other contemporary Catholic writers is
   discussed, and his merits in our day underrated strengths as a poet and
   prose writer are highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Leaf rust of barley, caused by Puccinia hordei Otth, is an important
   foliar disease in most temperate regions of the world. Sixteen major
   leaf rust resistance (Rph) genes have been described from barley, but
   only a few have been mapped. The leaf rust resistance gene Rph7 was
   first described from the cultivar `Cebada Capa' and has proven effective
   in Europe. Previously mapped restriction fragment length polymorphism
   (RFLP) markers have been used to determine the precise location of this
   gene in the barley genome. From the genetic analysis of a
   `Bowman'/'Cebada Caps' cross, Rph7 was mapped to the end of chromosome
   3HS, 1.3 recombination units distal to the RFLP marker cMWG691. A
   codominant cleaved amplified polymorphic site (CAPS) marker was
   developed by exploiting allele-specific sequence information of the
   cMWG691 site and adjacent fragments of genomic DNA. Based on the large
   amount of polymorphism present in this region, the CAPS marker may be
   useful for the marker-assisted selection of Rph7 in most diverse genetic
   backgrounds.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: The current study was designed to extend our knowledge of the
   GABA, receptor system in mediating discriminative stimulus effects of
   ethanol in non-human primates. Objectives: To characterize the
   discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol, pentobarbital, midazolam,
   muscimol and morphine in male and female monkeys under different ethanol
   training conditions. Methods: Adult male (n=8) and female (n=10) Macaca
   fascicularis monkeys were divided into four groups and trained to
   discriminate 1.0 g/kg ethanol (n=8) versus water or 2.0 g/kg ethanol
   (n=10) versus water in a 2x2 design with training dose and sex as main
   group factors. Solutions were administered intragastrically (20\%
   ethanol w/v) and responding was maintained under a fixed-ratio schedule
   of food reinforcement. Dose-response determinations of ethanol,
   pentobarbital, midazolam, muscimol and morphine were made under the
   training condition of 30 min pretreatment interval. The ethanol
   pretreatment interval in training sessions was then increased to 60 min
   and the effects of ethanol, pentobarbital and midazolam were
   redetermined. Results: Training dose influenced the ED50 Of ethanol to
   produce substitution under both pretreatment intervals and pentobarbital
   to produce substitution under the 30-min pretreatment training interval.
   There were no group differences in sensitivity to midazolam. The potency
   of the ligands to produce ethanol substitution was consistent across
   groups with midazolam>pentobarbital>ethanol. There were no sex
   differences in substitution of the ligands for ethanol. Blood ethanol
   concentrations at the onset of ethanol training sessions were higher in
   the 2.0 g/kg groups and under longer pretreatment times, but were not
   different on the basis of sex. Conclusions: Pentobarbital and midazolam
   produce ethanol-like discriminative stimulus effects in male and female
   cynomolgus monkeys suggesting a significant GABA(A) component mediating
   the behavioral effects of ethanol. There was limited evidence that
   training dose of ethanol influenced substitution pattern of the GABA(A)
   ligands in cynomolgus monkeys, unlike previous findings in rats.
   Finally, there appear to be no sex differences in the profile of GABA(A)
   mechanisms involved in the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY AND THERAPEUTICS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Background: In this pilot study, we have investigated the frequency of
   adverse drug reaction (ADR)-related admissions to an acute medical
   assessment unit. Although ADRs are thought to be responsible for 5\% of
   hospital admissions, there have been no recent studies in the U.K.
   Objective: To pilot such a study for estimating the incidence of
   ADR-related admissions to an acute medical assessment unit.
   Method: Data were collected for 200 patients including details of
   concurrent illness, drug usage and reasons for admission. ADRs were
   assessed for causality using two previously published classification
   systems.
   Results: ADRs were responsible for admission in 15 (7.5\%) patients,
   were present in an additional three (1.5\%) patients and may have
   contributed to the deaths of two (1\%) patients. Of the 15 ADRs
   suspected of causing an admission, three were considered to be
   `possible' or `unlikely', with the remaining 12 considered to be
   `probable' or `certain'. The proportion of patients identified in this
   study with ADR-related admissions is either similar to or larger than
   that found in comparable studies carried out in other hospitals. Nearly
   all ADRs were Type A reactions in that they were predictable and
   therefore potentially preventable.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that the proportion of ADR-related
   admissions has not decreased in the last decade and, given the
   increasing numbers of acute medical admissions, the absolute numbers may
   have actually increased. Furthermore, the nature of drugs causing
   admissions has not changed substantially over the last 20 years.
   Strategies to reduce the burden of ADR-related admissions are urgently
   needed.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. TO learn more about a possible functional role of
   alpha-atnino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxasole-propionate (AMPA) receptors
   in retinal development, the spatial distribution and temporal regulation
   of all AMPA receptor subunit proteins was studied in rats.
   METHODS. Immunohistochemistry was performed on retinal sections between
   embryonic days (E)20 and E21 and the adult stage by using specific
   antibodies against AMPA subunits GluR1 to 4.
   RESULTS. All AMPA subunits were expressed in the ganglion cell layer
   from E21 on. In the inner plexiform layer (IPL), discernible bands of
   labeling appeared at distinct retinal ages for the different subunits.
   GluR1 immunoreactivity (IR) was concentrated in two broad bands by
   postnatal day (P)3, whereas three bands were visible beginning on P9.
   Two bands were located in a region of the IPL where off-cells terminate,
   and one band was found in the innermost part of the IPL where on-cells
   terminate. In contrast, two bands of GluR2/3- and GluR4-IR in the IPL
   were only discernible beginning on P14 and seemed to be located between
   the bands of GluR1-IR. GluR2/3 and GluR4 were observed both in
   horizontal cells and in the outer plexiform layer from early
   developmental stages on. GluR1 was not found in the outer retina,
   indicating that horizontal and bipolar cell processes in the rat express
   AMPA receptors composed of subunits GluR2 to 4. Double-labeling
   experiments with cell-specific markers revealed the expression of
   subunits GluR1 to 4 in cholinergic and An amacrine cells.
   CONCLUSIONS. AMPA receptors are expressed before synapse formation,
   indicating a role not only in fast signal transmission but also in the
   establishment of inner retinal circuits. The differences in spatial and
   temporal subunit expression suggest that different retinal cell types
   selectively express distinct types of AMPA receptors during development
   of the rat retina.}},

Abstract = {{Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of macaques is remarkably
   similar to that of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in
   humans, and the SIV-macaque system is a good model for AIDS research. We
   have constructed an SIV proviral DNA clone that is deleted of 97
   nucleotides (nt), i.e., construct SDI at positions (+322 to +418)
   immediately downstream of the primer binding site (PBS) of SIVmac239.
   When this construct was transfected into COS-7 cells, the resultant
   viral progeny were severely impaired with regard to their ability to
   replicate in C8166 cells. Further deletion analysis showed that a virus
   termed SD1, containing a deletion of 23 nt (+322 to +344), was able to
   replicate with wild-type kinetics, while viruses containing deletions of
   21 nt (+398 to +418) (construct SD2) or 53 nt (+345 to +397) (construct
   SD3) displayed diminished capacity in this regard. Both the SD2 and SD3
   viruses were also impaired with regard to ability to package viral RNA,
   while SD1 viruses were not, The SD and SD3 constructs did not revert to
   increased replication ability in C8166 cells over 6 months in culture.
   In contrast, long-term passage of the SD2 mutated virus resulted in a
   restoration of replication capacity, due to the appearance of four
   separate point mutations. Two of these substitutions were located in
   leader sequences of viral RNA within the PBS and the dimerization
   initiation site (DIS), while the other two were located within two
   distinct Gag proteins, i.e., CA and p6, The biological relevance of
   three of these point mutations was confirmed by site directed
   mutagenesis studies that shelved that SD2 viruses containing each of
   these substitutions had regained a significant degree of viral
   replication capacity, Thus, leader sequences downstream of the PBS,
   especially the U5-lender stem and the DIS stem-loop, are important for
   SIV replication and for packaging of the viral genome.}},

Title = {{Long-term influence of associated arthrodesis on adjacent segments in
   the treatment of lumbar stenosis: a series of 127 cases with 9-year

Abstract = {{Purpose of the study
   Little is known about the impact of posterolateral arthrodesis on
   adjacent levels. In order to examine this question, we analyzed the
   radiological evolution of the lumbar spine in patients treated for
   lumbar stenosis, comparing cases where posterolateral arthrodesis was
   used with the other cases. Our aim was to determine whether the
   long-term radiographical modifications were affected by the arthrodesis.
   Material and methods
   Among our series of patients presenting with lumbar stenosis between
   1984 and 1992, we retained two groups: patients in group 1 (n = 46) who
   underwent single-level decompressions at L4-L5 or L4-L5 and L5-S1 level;
   and patients in group II (n = 81) who underwent decompressions on the
   same levels associated with posterolateral arthrodesis extending from L4
   to the sacrum with or without instrumentation. We compared the course of
   the two levels above the decompression (L2-L3 and L3-L4) between the two
   groups. We compared three radiological parameters: disc height,
   intervertabral slipping, and intersegmental mobility. We also examined
   the correlations between radiological modifications and functional
   outcome. Mean follow-up for these 127 patients was 9 years.
   Results
   The two groups were comparable for age, gender, follow-up, and
   presurgical functional score, disc height and intervertebral slipping at
   equivalent levels. At last follow-up, disc narrowing was observed at
   L2-L3 and L3-L4; it was significantly greater in the group with
   complementary arthrodesis. At L3-L4, intervertebral slipping also
   worsened more in the arthrodesis patients. Use of osteosynthesis
   significantly increased the risk of developing such radiological
   lesions. These lesions were associated, solely in the arthrodesis group,
   with poorer functional outcome.
   Conclusion
   Our findings allow the conclusion that, despite the effect of
   physiological aging, the observed long-term degenerative lesions in
   patients undergoing treatment of lumbar stenosis are related to the
   associated arthrodesis which increases their frequency and severity,
   deteriorating the functional outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Because of indications of recruitment failures and a historic low
   spawning stook, the Northeast Arctic Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius
   hippoglossoides Walbaum) stock has been strongly regulated in the 1990s.
   Fecundity is a link between the spawning stock and the following
   recruitment. This paper describes relationships between fecundity and
   total length for Northeast Arctic Greenland halibut for 1997 and 1998,
   based on samples taken in autumn on the continental slope west of the
   Barents Sea. A previous study describes a similar relationship for 1996.
   Individual fecundity is raised to a population level using stock data
   from XSA, and sex composition data, maturity oogives, and mean length at
   age from surveys covering the area of distribution. Total egg production
   (TEP) varied slightly around 1.0 x 10(11), during 1996-1998, with the
   highest TEP in 1998. A back-calculating exercise estimated annual TEP
   during 1980-1998 in the range 0.9-3.4 x 10(11), and revealed that age
   groups 9-12 were the main contributors to TEP. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{In the proximal tubule of the kidney, Na+ and HCO3- reabsorption vary
   proportionally with changes in axial flow rate. This feature is a
   critical component of glomerulotubular balance, but the basic mechanism
   by which the tubule epithelial cells sense axial flow remains
   unexplained. We propose that the microvilli, which constitute the brush
   border, are physically suitable to act as a mechanosensor of fluid flow.
   To examine this hypothesis quantitatively, we have developed an
   elastohydrodynamic model to predict the forces and torques along each
   microvillus and its resulting elastic bending deformation. This model
   indicates that: 1) the spacing of the microvilli is so dense that there
   is virtually no axial velocity within the brush border and that drag
   forces on the microvilli are at least 200 times greater than the shear
   force on the cell's apical membrane at the base of the microvilli; 2) of
   the total drag on a 2.5-mu m microvillus, 74\% appears within 0.2 mu m
   from the tip; and 3) assuming that the structural strength of the
   microvillus derives from its axial actin filaments, then a luminal fluid
   flow of 30 nl/min produces a deflection of the microvillus tip which
   varies from about 1 to 5\% of its 90-nm diameter, depending on the
   microvilli length. The microvilli thus appear as a set of stiff
   bristles, in a configuration in which changes in drag will produce
   maximal torque.}},

   compound GaxSe1-x (x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4), which was prepared by the
   melt-quenching method. X-ray diffraction shows the crystalline nature of
   the compound. This behaviour is anomalous and contrary to the normal
   practice because amorphous materials are obtained by the melt-quenching
   technique; but in the case of GaSe it has been proved that one can
   obtain the crystalline material by using the melt-quenching technique
   (which of course is a quicker process). Such behaviour may be attributed
   to the very low equilibrium time of the GaSe compound. (C) 2000 Elsevier

   marker of arrhythmia risk, is not well established. We studied 10
   healthy young adult volunteer men during quiet and deep breathing, the
   Valsalva maneuver, sustained handgrip, hyperventilation, the cold
   presser test, and mental stress. An automated method was used for
   measurement of QT-peak and QT-end intervals, and QT dispersion was
   defined as maximum-minimum of the measured intervals. QT-peak dispersion
   was greater on deep expiration than deep inspiration (49 +/- 20 ms vs 37
   +/- 14 ms, P < .05). QT-end dispersion decreased in the tachycardia
   phase of the Valsalva maneuver (45 +/- 23 ms vs 35 +/- 21 ms, P <.05),
   but QT dispersion did not change during the other interventions. Rapid
   cardiovascular autonomic reflex adjustment does not change QT dispersion
   in healthy young adult men. However, large intrathoracic volume and
   intrathoracic pressure changes during forced respiratory movements might
   confound QT dispersion measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Little is known about the effects of different levels of
   long-term physical activity on total body and regional fat and whether
   hormone replacement therapy interacts with physical activity level to
   affect body composition in postmenopausal women.
   Methods. We determined the associations between different levels of
   habitual physical activity, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and total
   and regional body composition in postmenopausal women. Twenty sedentary,
   20 active nonathletic, and 23 endurance-trained women (approximately
   half on HRT) had total and regional body composition assessed by
   dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The athletes and active nonathletic
   women had been active for the same number of years and the same number
   of hours per week.
   Results, The athletes and sedentary women weighed the same, but the
   active nonathletic groups on and not on HRT weighed 3-12 kg more (p <
   .05). Athletes had less trunk, arm, leg, and total body fat than
   sedentary and active nonathletic women (p < .05). Women on HRT tended to
   have lower total body (p = .07), but not regional, fat values. Linear
   regression analyses indicated that (V) over dot O-2 max in ml/kg/min was
   the major independent determinant of total and regional; body fat
   accounting for 52\% to 70\% of their variances. Athletes had greater
   caloric and carbohydrate intake than their less active peers, but all
   groups had similar protein, fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and
   polyunsaturated fat intakes.
   Conclusions. Intense training, but not low- to moderate-intensity
   physical activity, is associated with markedly lower levels of total and
   regional body fat in postmenopausal women. HRT has less of an effect on
   body composition than intense exercise training in postmenopausal women.}},

Abstract = {{Direct numerical simulations have been conducted with many cluster
   models of beads and connecting springs in a turbulent channel flow in
   order to investigate how the low-speed streaks and the small-scale how
   related to the streaks are affected by the cluster models. The cluster
   model represents highly entangled polymers observed in the quiescent and
   flowing aqueous solution. The cluster models were introduced in the
   buffer region to simulate the experiments of Tiederman et al.
   (Tiederman, W.G., Luchik, T.S,, Bogard, D.G., 1985. Wall-layer structure
   and drag reduction. J. Fluid Mech. 156, 419-437) in which the polymer
   solution was injected from a slot in the channel wall. An experiment has
   been carried out for Visual observation of highly entangled polymers in
   a turbulent channel flow of the same Reynolds number in order to
   determine a parameter of the cluster model. The computational results
   show that the minor streaks and the small-scale eruptive flows
   associated with the streamwise vortices are attenuated selectively by
   the cluster models. The length scale and time scale of these structures
   are comparable to those of the cluster model. On the other hand, the
   dynamics of large-scale streaks are found to be basically unchanged.
   These results are consistent with the measurement of a suppression of
   low threshold Reynolds-stress producing motion by Harder and Tiederman

Abstract = {{Ln the autumn of 1999, a major UK garment retailer joined the Ethical
   Trading Initiative (ETI) just as the media were announcing the loss of
   thousands of jobs in its UK factories. Joining the ETI means a
   commitment to the promotion of labour standards as embodied in ILO
   Conventions. Yet British workers' jobs are rapidly being lost to
   countries in Asia and Eastern Europe, where companies know that people
   are employed in conditions far below these standards. Companies overcome
   this apparent contradiction between pronouncement and practice by
   expressing their commitment in terms of the progressive implementation
   of a code of conduct rather than an immediate guarantee of acceptable
   standards. However, in the case of the garment industry, the
   implications of global restructuring are such that the hope of achieving
   this objective seems increasingly remote.}},

   dialysis. Pregnancies were prolonged by a mean (median) number of 11
   days (9) before delivery, with more time being gained at earlier
   gestations. The postpartum inpatient stay (89\% less than or equal to 7
   days, bearing in mind that 82\% of women were delivered by caesarean
   section) was not extended.
   Conclusion Careful noninvasive management of early onset, severe
   pre-eclampsia in a tertiary centre can diminish and limit the impact of
   serious maternal complications. Valuable time to prolong the pregnancy
   and improve neonatal outcome is thereby gained.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Several studies have indicated a connection between
   handwashing and illness-related absenteeism in school settings. The
   difficulty of ensuring consistent and effective handwashing among
   student populations has also been noted. The purpose of this study was
   to assess the effectiveness of the use of an alcohol gel hand sanitizer
   in the classroom to help decrease the illness-related absentee rate for
   elementary school students.
   Methods: This study involved 5 individual school districts, 16
   individual schools, and more than 6000 students in Delaware, Ohio,
   Tennessee, and California. Individual schools in each district were
   paired into product and control groups. In the product group schools, an
   alcohol gel hand sanitizer was used by the students and staff when
   entering and leaving the classroom. Absenteeism due to infection was
   recorded, and the data were statistically analyzed.
   Results: The overall reduction in absenteeism due to infection in the
   schools included in this study was 19.8\% for schools that used an
   alcohol gel hand sanitizer compared with the control schools (P<.05).
   Data from the school system with the largest teacher population (n=246)
   showed that teacher absenteeism decreased 10.1\% (trend) in the schools
   where sanitizer was used.
   Conclusion: Elementary school absenteeism due to infection is
   significantly reduced when an alcohol gel hand sanitizer is used in the
   classroom as part of a hand hygiene program.}},

Title = {{Survival and recurrence after hepatic resection of 386 consecutive
   patients with hepatocellular carcinoma}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{191}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although hepatic resection is one of the most effective
   treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the longterm results of
   hepatic resection of this malignancy are far from satisfactory. The
   potential benefits of hepatectomy for patients with HCC have not been
   fully delineated. This study aimed to identify surgical outcomes of 386
   consecutive patients with HCC undergoing hepatic resection.
   Study Design: The retrospective study looked at records of 293 men and
   93 women. The mean age was 63.2 years. Preoperative transarterial
   chemoembolizaton and portal vein embolization were performed in 138
   patients (35.8\%) and 8 patients (2.1\%), respectively. Sixty-two
   patients (16.1\%) had major hepatectomy and the other 324 (83.9\%) had
   minor hepatectomy. Thirty-seven of 386 patients (9.6\%) had a
   noncurative operation.
   Results: The 30-day (operative) mortality rate was 4.1\%, and there were
   11 additional late deaths (2.9\%). Two hundred fourteen of 327 patients
   (65.4\%) had recurrence after curative resection. Unfavorable factors
   for survival and recurrence were resection between 1983 and 1990, Child
   class B or C, cirrhosis, a high value of indocyanine green retention-15,
   a large amount of intraoperative blood loss, stage ni disease, positive
   surgical margin, vascular invasion, and postoperative complications.
   Preoperative transarterial chemoembolization increased the recurrence
   rate and showed no contribution to prognosis. Currently, 106 patients
   (27.5\%) are alive: 7 (1.8\%) after more than 10 years and 43 (11.1\%)
   after more than 5 years. Mean and median overall survivals after
   operation were 38 months and 29 months, respectively. The 5-year and
   10-year overall or disease-free survival rates after hepatic resection
   were 34.4\% and 10.5\% or 23.3\% and 7.8\%, respectively.
   Conclusions: The longterm survival rate after operation remains
   unsatisfactory mainly because of the high recurrence rate. Preoperative
   transarterial chemoembolization should be avoided because of a high risk
   of postoperative recurrence. Treatment strategies for recurrent HCC may
   play an important role in achieving better prognosis after operation,
   especially in patients with more than Child class B, cirrhosis, high
   values of indocyanine green retention-15, massive intraoperative blood
   loss, stage IV disease, positive surgical margin, vascular invasion, and
   postoperative complications. (J Am Coll Surg 2000;191:381-388. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{We investigated sorption and permeation of emedastine with 11 different
   vehicles, composed of single or binary solvents, in excised rat skin, In
   the sorption study partition parameters of the drug with each vehicle
   were obtained by dividing the drug amount in skin at equilibrium by its
   donor concentration. When the logarithm of the partition parameters for
   the stratum corneum/vehicle partitioning (K-s') was plotted against the
   dielectric constants of the vehicles, a bi-linear relationship was
   obtained, The skin But of emedastine largely differ among the vehicles.
   A quasi-steady-state flux of emedastine exhibited a good linear
   relationship with K-s', except for ethanol (EtOH)/isopropyl myristate
   (IPM) systems, indicating that the partitioning process is critical in
   determining the permeation rate. Delineation of the EtOH/IPM systems
   would be due to an increase in the diffusivity of the drug in the
   stratum corneum, as indicated by the analysis using a two-layer
   diffusion model. Thus, differential evaluation of partitioning and
   diffusion processes by both sorption and permeation studies would give
   further insights into the effects of vehicles on skin permeation of

Abstract = {{Examples of apparent exsolution lamellae and lenticular blebs of
   chalcopyrite in pyrrhotite are described in orthopyroxene-bearing
   granulite facies rocks from two, oxidized (log(10)/f(O2) = -14 to -11),
   widely separated, well characterized high grade terranes: the Bamble
   Sector, SE Norway (795 degrees C, 7.5 kbar) and the Shevaroy Hills
   Massif, Tamil Nadu, S India (750 degrees C, 7.5 kbar). These exsolution
   features only occur in isolated pyrrhotite grains and not in integral
   pyrrohotite-pyrite-chalcopyrite-magnetite grain clusters which
   essentially represent an oxidation equilibrium. Reintegration of these
   chalcopyrite exsolution features back into the pyrrhotite host indicate
   Cu contents ranging from 1 to 5 wt.\% in good agreement with
   experimental observations which indicate that pyrrhotite can take up to
   7 wt.\% Cu at temperatures above 800 degrees C at pressures of similar
   to 1 bar. This suggests that under high grade conditions these
   chalcopyrite exsolution features were in solid solution with pyrrhotite.
   Whether Cu stabilizes pyrrhotite at higher oxygen fugacities or these
   chalcopyrite-pyrrhotite grains represent a metastable phase is
   uncertain. One possibility is that the isolated pyrrhotite grains with
   chalcopyrite lamellae could represent grains that were preferentially
   not exposed to infiltrating fluids, which oxidized the pyrrhotites in
   other areas of the sample. A second possibility is that either these
   grains had enough Gu to stabilize them during pervasive infiltration of
   oxidizing fluids or that they represent a metastable phase with respect
   to the overall oxygen fugacity of the sample. The two conclusions that
   can be drawn from these observations are, firstly, that it is possible
   for pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite to form a limited solid solution at
   granulite facies temperatures and pressures under relatively high
   oxidizing conditions, i.e. 1.5 log units above
   fayalite-magnetite-quartz, at 800 degrees C and 8 kbar. Secondly, this
   limited solid solution should have some bearing on the stability of
   pyrrhotite with respect to co-existing magnetite and pyrite as a
   function of the oxidation state of the rock, be it inherited or fluid
   induced.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purposes of this article are to describe the overall
   protocol for the Identification of Neonatal Hearing Impairment (INHI)
   project and to describe the management of the data collected as part of
   this project. A well-defined protocol and database management techniques
   were needed to ensure that data were 1) collected accurately and in the
   same way across sites; 2) maintained in a database that could be used to
   provide feedback to individual sites regarding enrollment and the extent
   to which the protocol was complete on individual subjects; and 3)
   available to answer project questions. This article describes techniques
   that were used to meet these needs.
   Design: This study was a prospective, randomized study that was designed
   to evaluate auditory brain stem responses, transient evoked otoacoustic
   emissions, and distortion product otoacoustic emissions as
   hearing-screening tools, and to relate neonatal test findings to hearing
   status, defined by visual reinforcement audiometry at 8 to 12 mo of age,
   Measures of middle-ear function also were obtained at some sites as part
   of the neonatal test battery, In addition, other clinical and
   demographic data were gathered to determine the extent to which factors,
   other than auditory status, influenced test behavior. Three groups were
   evaluated: neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) infants (those who spent
   3 or more days in a NICU), well babies with risk factors for hearing
   loss, and well babies without risk factors. Six centers participated in
   the trial. The testers for the project included audiologists,
   technicians, audiology graduate students, and medical research staff.
   The same computerized neonatal test program was applied at each center.
   This program generated the neonatal test database automatically.
   Clinical and demographic data were collected by means of concise data
   collection forms and were entered into a database at each site. After
   the neonatal test, subjects from the NICU and at-risk, well babies were
   evaluated with visual reinforcement audiometry starting at 8 to 12 mo of
   age. All data were electronically transmitted to the core site where
   they were merged into one overall database, This database was exercised
   to provide feedback and to identify discrepancies throughout the course
   of the study. In its final form, it served as the database on which all
   analyses were performed.
   Results and Conclusion: The protocol was a departure from typical
   hearing screening procedures in terms of 1) its regimented application
   of three screening measures; 2) the detailed information that was
   obtained regarding subject clinical and demographic factors; and 3) its
   application of the same procedures across six centers having diverse
   geographic location and subject demographics. A learning curve for
   successfully executing the study protocols was observed. Throughout the
   study, monthly reports were generated to monitor subject enrollment,
   check for data completeness, and to perform data integrity checks. In
   combination with monthly data reports and checks that occurred
   throughout the progression of the study, miscellaneous data audits were
   performed to check, accuracy of neonatal testing programs and to
   crosscheck information entered in the clinical and demographic database.
   The data management techniques used in this project helped to ensure the
   quality of the data collection process and also allowed for detailed
   analyses once data were collected, This was particularly important
   because it enabled us to evaluate not only the performance of individual
   measures as screening tools, but also permitted an evaluation of the
   influence of other variables on screening test results.}},

Abstract = {{Hereditary Gingival Fibromatosis (HGF) is the most common genetic form
   of gingival fibromatosis. The condition is most frequently reported to
   be transmitted as an autosomal-dominant trait, but autosomal-recessive
   inheritance has also been reported. The clinical presentation of HGF is
   variable, both in the distribution (number of teeth involved) and in the
   degree (severity) of expression. It is unknown if the variable clinical
   expression of HGF in different families is due to variable expression of
   a common gene mutation, allelic mutations, or nonallelic mutations. The
   apparently different modes of Mendelian inheritance of HGF suggest
   genetic heterogeneity. A gene locus for HGF has been localized to a
   37-cM genetic interval on chromosome 2p21-p22 (D2S1352, Z(max), = 5.10,
   theta = 0.00) flanked by D2S1788 and D2S441. To evaluate the generality
   of this linkage, we tested linkage with 9 markers from this candidate
   region in another large family, segregating for an autosomal-dominant
   form of generalized HGF, and found no support for linkage with any of
   these markers. Furthermore, statistical tests of this apparent
   heterogeneity were highly significant. Analysis of these data provides
   direct evidence that at least two genetically distinct loci are
   responsible for autosomal-dominant hereditary gingival fibromatosis.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{The electrospray mass spectra and collision-induced fragmentation of
   neutral N-linked glycans obtained from glycoproteins were examined with
   a Q-TOF mass spectrometer, The glycans were ionized most effectively as
   adducts of alkali metals, with lithium providing the most abundant
   signal and caesium the least. Singly charged ions generally gave higher
   ion currents than doubly charged ions. Addition of formic acid could be
   used to produce {[}M + H](+) ions, but these ions were always
   accompanied by abundant tone-voltage fragments. The energy required for
   collision-induced fragmentation was found to increase in a linear manner
   as a function of mass with the {[}M + Na](+) ions requiring about four
   times as much energy as the {[}M + H](+) ions for complete fragmentation
   of the molecular ions. Fragmentation of the {[}M + H](+) ions gave
   predominantly B- and Y-type glycosidic fragments whereas the {[}M +
   Na](+) and {[}M + Li](+) ions produced a number of additional fragments
   including those derived from cross-ring cleavages. Little fragmentation
   was observed from the {[}M + K](+) and {[}M + Rb](+) ions and the only
   fragment to be observed from the {[}M + Cs](+) ion was Cs+. The {[}M +
   Na](+) and {[}M + Li](+) ions from all the N-linked glycans gave
   abundant fragments resulting from loss of the terminal GlcNAc moiety and
   prominent, though weaker, ions as the result of (0,2)A and (2,4)A
   cross-ring cleavages of this residue, Most other ions were the result of
   successive additional losses of residues from the non-reducing terminus.
   This pattern was particularly prominent with glycans containing several
   non-reducing GlcNAc residues where successive losses of 203 u were
   observed. Many of the ions in the low-mass range were products of
   several different fragmentation routes but still provided structural
   information. Possibly of most diagnostic importance was an ion formed by
   loss of 221 u (GlcNAc molecule) from an ion that had lost the 3-antenna
   and the chitobiose core. This latter ion, although coincident in mass
   with some other `Internal' fragments, often provided additional
   information on the composition of the antennae. Other ions defining
   antenna composition were weak cross-ring fragments produced from the
   core branching mannose residue. Glycans containing GalGlcNAc residues
   showed successive losses of this moiety, particularly from the B-type
   fragments resulting from loss of the reducing-terminal GlcNAc residue.
   The {[}M + Na](+) and {[}M + Li](+) ions from high-mannose and hybrid
   glycans gave a series of ions of composition (Man)(n)Na/Li+ where n = 1
   to the total number of glycans in the molecule, allowing these sugars to
   be distinguished from the more highly processed complex glycans, Other
   ions in the spectra of the high-mannose glycans were diagnostic of chain
   branching but insufficient information was available to determine their
   mode of formation. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Field experiments were conducted to study the competition effect of

   planted randomly on biomass yields of both species, ryegrass seed yield,

   density up to 800 plants/m(2) reduced ryegrass seed yield by 87\% but
   increased its harvest index up to 42\% compared to its monoculture
   yield. Species densities and their interactions accounted for 66 to 73\%
   of the total variation in per-unit area biomass of species, and their
   association was more favorable to ryegrass biomass than wheat. Seeds of
   each species had three times greater nitrogen percentage than did
   shoots. Intra- and interspecific competition increased nitrogen
   percentage in wheat seeds. In Italian ryegrass, only interspecific
   competition increased N percentage in seeds. Although total nitrogen
   uptake by winter wheat was three times greater than in Italian ryegrass,
   Italian ryegrass was two times more efficient than wheat at producing
   biomass per unit of N taken up and specific leaf area at heading stage
   in mixture. Germination percentages of progeny seeds of both species in
   mixtures were greater in presence of high densities of the companion

Abstract = {{Consensus methods such as the Delphi survey technique are being employed

Abstract = {{The ratio of the number of observed taxa to that expected to occur in
   the absence of human-caused stress (O/E) is an intuitive and
   ecologically meaningful measure of biological integrity. We examined how
   O/E ratios derived from stream invertebrate data varied among 234
   unimpaired reference sites and 254 test sites potentially impaired by
   past logging. Data were collected from streams in three montane
   ecoregions in California. Two sets of River invertebrate Prediction and
   Classification System (RIVPACS) predictive models were built: one set of
   models was based on near-species taxonomic resolution; the other was
   based on family identifications. Two models were built For each level of
   taxonomic resolution: one calculated O and E based on all taxa with
   probabilities of capture (P-c) > 0; the other calculated O and E based
   on only those taxa with P-c greater than or equal to 0.5. Evaluations of
   the performance of each model were based on three criteria: (1) how well
   models predicted the taxa found at unimpaired sites, (2) the degree to
   which O/E values differed among unimpaired reference sites and
   potentially impaired test sites, and (3) the degree to which test site
   O/E values were correlated with independent measures of watershed
   alteration. Predictions of species models were more accurate than those
   of family models, and predictions of the P-c greater than or equal to
   0.5 species model were more robust than predictions of the P-c greater
   than or equal to 0 model. O/E values derived from both species models
   were related to land use variables, but only assessments based on the
   P-c greater than or equal to 0.5 model were insensitive to naturally

Abstract = {{Two experiments are described, which investigated 71/2- to 13-month-old
   infants' abilities to categorise syllables according to their ending
   sounds, or rimes. Using the Conditioned Headturn (CHT) Procedure,
   infants were conditioned to turn their head when one set of rhyming CVCs
   changed to another set of rhyming CVCs. Even the 71/2-month-old infants
   demonstrated an ability to categorise according to rhyme. The infants
   could be separated into three different groups: those who conditioned
   but did not succeed in a rhyming task; those who succeeded at one
   rhyming task but not a second; and those infants who succeeded on two
   rhyming tasks. The infants in the second group were showing an early
   sensitivity to rhyme. However, they appeared to be learning a very
   specific rule, listening only for one category of rhyme. The third group
   of infants was able to extend the initial rule they learned to include
   new rhymes. This group learned not only to highlight one particular
   rhyme, but were also able to abstract the previously learned rule to new
   rhymes, thereby demonstrating a higher level of sophistication in their
   categorisation of rhymes. These results are discussed in relation to the
   ontogeny of language learning, and work demonstrating a relationship
   between rhyming ability and competence in reading and writing. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Off-site storage hers become increasingly common as academic libraries
   run out of space and the political and financial costs of central campus
   construction soar out of reach. As it splits collections and denies
   browsability, storage is commonly regarded as a necessary evil for which
   there are no obvious alternatives. How we select what we store is
   therefore central in ensuring results that disrupt students, scholars,
   and collections as little as possible. After reviewing the purposes of
   off-site storage, I consider the conditions necessary for viable storage
   arrangements and suggest how these basic conditions have evolved over
   time. I then explore criteria that can be employed in selecting
   materials for storage as well as the interplay between these criteria,
   the mechanics of storage operations, and the pressures associated with
   storage goals. I close by suggesting some of the larger challenges whose
   solutions may be informed by our struggles with storage.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to determine the synergistic effects
   of DL111-IT in combination with mifepristone (RU486) on termination of
   early pregnancy in rhesus monkeys. Pregnancy was confirmed by tactile
   sensation of pregnant uterus via anus with finger and ultrasound
   examination. Pregnancy termination was obtained with vaginal bleeding
   and abortion materials including fetuses and placentae after treatment.
   With multiple doses of DL111-IT or RU486 given alone between d24 and d50
   of gestation, pregnancy arrests were obtained in 40\% (2/5) of monkeys
   treated with DL111-IT intramuscularly (im) (25 mg . kg(-1) d(-1) x 3
   days), in 20\% (1/5) of monkeys treated with 9 mg . kg(-1) d(-1) X 2
   days, and 4.5 mg . kg(-1) on day 3 with RU486 intragastrically (ig).
   DL111-IT (25 mg . kg(-1) on day 1, im) in combination with RU486 (the
   same treatment as above) resulted in 100\% (101/10) termination of
   pregnancy and uterine bleeding lasted 6.6 +/- 1.3 days. RU486 las above
   treatment) in combination with misoprostal (Miso, 109 mug . kg(-1) on
   day 3, ig) showed 71.4\% (5/7) termination of pregnancy, and uterine
   bleeding lasted 12.9 +/- 9.6 days. The synergistic effect of DL111-IT
   plus RU486 enhances termination of early pregnancy and significantly
   shortens the bleeding time than RU486 plus Mise does in rhesus monkeys.

   consumption tax. Both analytical expressions and simple diagrams are
   used to analyze the impact, transition, and long-run effects of tax
   policy changes. It is shown that a part of the long-run incidence of
   capital and consumption taxes falls on capital when households' horizons
   are finite whereas labour would fully bear the burden of these taxes in

Abstract = {{Normal herpesvirus assembly and egress depend on the correct
   intracellular localization of viral glycoproteins. While several
   post-Golgi transport motifs have been characterized within the
   cytoplasmic domains of various viral glycoproteins, few specific
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi transport signals have been
   described. We report the identification of two regions within the
   125-amino-acid cytoplasmic domain of Varicella-Zoster virus gB that are
   required for its ER-to-Golgi transport. Native gB or gB containing
   deletions and specific point mutations in its cytoplasmic domain was
   expressed in mammalian cells. ER-to-Golgi transport of gB was assessed
   by indirect immunofluorescence and by the acquisition of Golgi-dependent
   posttranslational modifications. These studies revealed that the
   ER-to-Golgi transport of gB requires a nine-amino-acid region
   (YMTLVSAAE) within its cytoplasmic domain. Mutations of individual amino
   acids within this region markedly impaired the transport of gB from the
   ER to the Golgi, indicating that this domain functions by a
   sequence-dependent mechanism. Deletion of the C-terminal 17 amino acids
   of the gB cytoplasmic domain was also shown to impair the transport of
   gB from the ER to the Golgi. However, internal mutations within this
   region did not disrupt the transport of gB, indicating that its function
   during gB transport is not sequence dependent. Native gB is also
   transported to the nuclear membrane of transfected cells. gB lacking as
   many as 67 amino acids from the C terminus of its cytoplasmic domain
   continued to be transported to the nuclear membrane at apparently normal
   levels, indicating that the cytoplasmic domain of gB is not required for
   nuclear membrane localization.}},

Abstract = {{This article provides a conceptual model that explains how the

   long time spans can result in competitive advantage through innovation
   and strategic linkage of products at a point in time and over time. At
   the heart of the model are sequences of products within and across
   markets, supported by an underlying system of knowledge and systems of
   learning. This dynamic model brings the importance of the products
   themselves, supported by vertical chains of activities, into the
   analysis of resource and knowledge-based competitive advantage. The
   model also suggests that we can think about the evolution of firms, and
   by implication the evolution of industries, not only in terms of
   knowledge and capabilities, but also in terms of vertical chains and
   products. Short company histories illustrate the workings of the model.

Abstract = {{Rainer Maria Rilkes two volume series the Neue Gedichte are usually
   regarded as examples of Rilkes artistic attempt at creating poetry as an
   autonomous art form referred to as a Dinggedicht, or ``object poem{''}.
   Although the majority of his poems in the series might be placed into
   such a thematic arrangement, this article posits that Rilkes biblical
   poetry, in particular ``Klage um Jonathan{''} and `` Trostung des
   Elia{''} in the Neue Gedichte, anderer Teil are not object poems, but
   contain elements of the authors personal expression displaced within
   these texts.
   By comparing poem titles and themes between Volumes 1 and 2 of the Neue
   Gedichte it is evident that Rilke is more concerned with prophetic
   biblical models and the themes of death and loss in his poetry written
   in the summer of 1908. A closer textual analysis of ``Klage um
   Jonathan{''} and ``Trostung des Elia{''}, both written during that time
   period, reveals further evidence of personal expression especially in
   connection with biographical evidence from letters to Auguste Rodin, to
   publisher Anton Kippenberg, and to his close friend Sidonie Nadherny.
   Additionally a textual comparison with Rilkes ``Requiem fur eine
   Freundin{''} written in October 1908 and with the Luther and Kautzsch
   translations of the Old Testament, which Rilke used as his model for the
   two poems, provides insight into Rilkes subjective involvement with his
   biblical poetry.}},

Abstract = {{The development of genital grooming (GG) and spontaneous penile
   erections (SPE) was evaluated in socially housed male rats from 25 to 47
   days of age, and their sexual behavior was tested from 42 to 74 days of
   age. GG was the first behavior that appeared (27 days of age) prior to
   SPE (44 days of age). The values of frequency and duration of GG and SPE
   showed a gradual increase as puberty was reached. The mean age in which
   copulatory responses were first observed were: 54.5 days of age for
   mounts, 55 days of age for intromission and 59 days of age for
   ejaculation. The proportion of GG bouts that were followed by SPE showed
   a gradual increase throughout the recording days. A high correlation was
   found between the early onset and higher frequency of CG and an early
   onset of sexual behavior. Similarly, higher frequency and/or longer
   duration of SPE were correlated with an early onset and a better
   performance of sexual behavior. These results are consistent with
   previous studies, which suggest an important role of GG on the
   manifestation of sexual behavior; moreover, considering the high
   correlation between the occurrence of SPE and sexual behavior, it is
   possible that, as GG, SPE play an important role in the readiness of
   adult male rats for reproduction. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to evaluate how the addition of mucoadhesive
   polymers to aqueous solutions affects the ocular response of tropicamide
   (0.2\%; w/v). The polymer solutions tested were carboxymethylcellulose
   sodium salt(CMC-Na; 1\%; w/v), hyaluronic acid sodium salt (HA-Na;
   0.1\%; w/v) and polyacrylic acid (PAA; 0.2\%; w/v). Polymeric solutions
   were compared to a nonviscous formulation(AS). In vitro mucoadhesion
   measurements were expressed as a percentage of the adhesion force
   mucin-mucin, considering this one as 100\% mucoadhesion. The values of
   mucoadhesion obtained were 172\%, 127\%, 103\% and 87.6\% for
   formulations with CMC, PAA, HA and AS, respectively.
   The mydriatic response of tropicamide was determined in adult male New
   Zealand rabbits, weighing 1.7-2 Kg, by pupil diameter measurements at
   different times after instillation. The area under the mydriatic
   response-time curve (AUC(0-6hr)) was interpreted as an indication of the
   bioavailability of tropicamide in each vehicle. The AUC(0-6hr) was
   related to the in vitro mucoadhesion for each formulation. Tropicamide
   solutions with CMC-Na and PAA resulted in mucoadhesion and AUC(0-6hr)
   values approximately 1.9 and 1.4 times higher than AS. Although the
   solution with HA-Na was less mucoadhesive than PAA, the hyaluronic acid
   solution resulted in a higher AUC mydriasis/time value.
   Formulations with HA-Na and PAA presented values of surface tension
   close to that observed in the lacrimal fluid, with the I-max (maximum
   pupil diameter) being higher than for CMC-Na and AS. Greater than 90\%
   of the mydriatic effect disappeared 4.5 hr after instillation for PAA
   and AS. Nevertheless, the mydriatic effect remained up to 5.5 hr for
   HA-Na and CMC-Na.
   HA-Na solution enhanced the bioavailability of tropicamide, presenting a
   value of mucoadhesion similar to the reference mucin-mucin.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: The choice of probes is an important feature of
   hybridisation experiments. In this paper we present an algorithm that
   optimises probes with respect to a training set of sequences based on
   Shannon entropy as a quality criterion. The practical motivation for our
   algorithm is oligonucleotide fingerprinting, a method for the
   simultaneous identification of sequences (cDNA or genomic DNA) by their
   hybridisation tags according to a set of shot? probes such as octamers,
   although the algorithm is of course not restricted to that application.
   Results: We can show that our method is superior to the selection of
   probes according to their frequencies, which is a widely, used strategy,
   and to randomly chosen probe sets. The quality of probe sets is assessed
   by a simulation pipeline that entails the set of probes as a simulation
   parameter: The performance of probe sets trained on sequences from
   different organisms shows additionally that probes should be chosen with
   regard to the organism under analysis. Case studies are presented on how
   constraints (G + C-content, complexity of the individual probes)
   influence the selection process.}},

Abstract = {{The fungicidal substance pentachlorophenol (PCP) had been used commonly
   for wood protection and leather impregnation in Germany until 1989, when
   this substance was prohibited by law. Hence, the body burden in the
   general population in Germany has been steadily declining. The reference
   values (95th percentiles) in blood plasma decreased from 20 mug PCP/l in
   1991 to 12 mug/l in 1996. In 1998 the current exposure in a large
   residential population was investigated.
   623 persons with an average age of 34.6 years (0-62 years) were
   investigated. For all of them there was neither evidence of occupational
   contact with PCP nor of the presence of PCP in the residential indoor
   environment. The mean PCP concentration in the plasma samples was 2.4
   +/- 3.9 mug/l, the median 1.7 mug/l, and the 95th percentile 6.1 mug/l,
   the maximum Value was 59.3 mug/l. In children and adolescents higher
   median and 95th percentiles were obtained than in adults (median 2.5 vs.
   1.5 mug/l and 95th percentile 7.7 vs. 5.9 mug/l). All values above 20
   mug/l were checked again individually: relationships with the level of
   PCP in household dust could not be detected. In one family leather
   clothing containing PCP, however, was found to be the cause of unusually
   high PCP values in the blood.
   Our investigations confirm a trend observed in recent years: exposure to
   PCP in the population in Germany decreases steadily and leads to an
   actualized reference value of 6.1 mug PCP/l plasma. In individual cases,
   however, greatly increased PCP levels in blood can still occur today,
   for example due to leather clothing treated with PCP.}},

Abstract = {{Visualization of the vessel wall after transluminal angioplasty is
   important to monitor the restenosis progress. Intravascular ultrasound
   proved its capabilities as an invasive procedure in many studies. The
   aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of high-resolution MRI
   as a non-invasive tool for follow-up after PTA. High-resolution magnetic
   resonance images (pixel size: 0.49 {*} 0.49 mm(2)) were acquired on a
   1.0 T clinical scanner. Morphometry was conducted after conversion of
   DICOM images into TIFF format using ScionImage on a PC. In-vitro studies
   using a polyvinylchloride tube were evaluated by two independent
   investigators. Goldstandard was a caliper rule and direct radiography.
   Five patients were monitored before and 24 h, six weeks, three months
   and six months after PTA. In vivo measurements promised a good
   concordance for both investigators for area as well as for diameter
   measurements. Area measurements showed correlations up to r = 0.86 (p <
   0.001) whereas the correlations of diameters were slightly inferior (r
   between 0.58 and 0.84; p < 0.005). Relocation of the same slice position
   in the follow up studies could be guaranteed using anatomic landmarks in
   the images. As a non-invasive tool to assess restenosis after PTA
   high-resolution MRI promises to be a reproducible technique. It is easy
   to identify the same vascular region in different studies due to
   neighboring anatomic landmarks. Progression of disease as well as
   success of pharmacologic treatment to prevent restenosis may be
   monitored. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Functional outcome of semiconstrained total elbow arthroplasty}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME}},
Year = {{2000}},

Abstract = {{Background: The objective of the present study was to review the results
   of primary total elbow arthroplasty with use of the Coonrad-Morrey
   prosthesis. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) the results in patients with
   inflammatory arthritis would be superior to those in patients with a
   traumatic or posttraumatic condition, and (2) the isometric extensor
   torque after total elbow arthroplasty would be significantly less than
   that of the contralateral elbow.
   Methods: Forty-seven consecutive patients (fifty-one elbows) had the
   operation performed by one of three surgeons between November 1, 1989,
   and June 30, 1996. Thirty-six surviving patients (thirty-nine elbows)
   were available for follow-up. The mean duration (and standard deviation)
   of follow-up was 50 +/- 11 months (range, twenty-four to ninety-seven
   months). The mean age at the time of the operation was 64 +/- 11 years
   (range, twenty-seven to eighty-seven years). Eighteen patients
   (twenty-one elbows) had inflammatory arthritis. Eighteen patients
   (eighteen elbows) had an acute fracture or posttranmatic condition
   (posttraumatic osteoarthritis in eight, an acute fracture of the humerus
   in seven, nonunion of the distal aspect of the humerus in two, and
   primary osteoarthritis in one). The patients were evaluated with use of
   questionnaires (the Mayo elbow performance index, the Short Form-36
   {[}SF-3S], and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand {[}DASH]
   Questionnaire); clinical examination by an orthopaedic surgeon who was
   not involved with the preoperative, operative, postoperative, or
   follow-up care; radiographs; and elbow strength-testing with an
   isokinetic dynamometer.
   Results: The mean score (and standard deviation) on the Mayo elbow
   performance index for the group that had inflammatory arthritis (90 +/-
   11 points) was significantly higher than that for the group with a
   traumatic or posttraumatic condition (78 +/- 18 points) at the time of
   the latest follow-up (p < 0.05). In both groups, the mean extensor
   torque of the involved elbow was significantly less than that of the
   contralateral elbow (p < 0.05). No significant difference between the
   groups was found with respect to the flexion-extension are of motion.
   Ten elbows (26 percent) had ulnar nerve dysfunction (a transient deficit
   in six and a permanent deficit in four); nine (23 percent), an
   intraoperative fracture (of the humeral diaphysis in four, of the ulnar
   diaphysis in four, and of the olecranon in one); three (8 percent), a
   periprosthetic infection; three, a triceps disruption; and one (3
   percent), a revision because of a fracture of the ulnar component. There
   were no other revisions. Of the thirty-four elbows with complete
   radiographic followup, twenty-three had no change in the bone-cement
   interface. Progressive radiolucency was noted around the ulnar
   prosthesis in eight elbows, around the humeral prosthesis in one elbow,
   and around both components in two elbows.
   Conclusions: Patients who had a total elbow arthroplasty with use of a
   semiconstrained Coonrad-Morrey prosthesis were generally satisfied; the
   mean level of patient satisfaction was 9.2 of a possible 10 points for
   those who had inflammatory arthritis and 8.6 points for those who had a
   fracture or posttraumatic condition. The rates of complications
   involving the ulnar nerve, intraoperative fracture, triceps disruption,
   deep infection, and periprosthetic radiolucency are of concern.}},

Abstract = {{CCD vby Stromgren photometry of a statistically complete sample of red
   giants and stars in the main sequence turn-off region in omega Centauri
   has been used to analyse the apparently complex star formation history
   of this cluster. From the location of stars in the (b - y),m(1) diagram
   metallicities have been determined. These have been used to estimate
   ages of different sub-populations in the color-magnitude diagram and to
   investigate their spatial distributions. We can confirm several earlier
   findings. The dominating metal-poor population around -1.7 dex is the
   oldest population found. More metal-rich stars between {[}Fe/H]=-1.5 and
   -1.0 dex tend to be 1-3 Gyr younger. These stars are more concentrated
   towards the cluster center than the metal-poor ones. The most-metal rich
   stars around -0.7 dex might be up to 6 Gyr younger than the oldest
   population. They are asymmetrically distributed around the center with
   an excess of stars towards the South.
   We argue that the Stromgren metallicity in terms of element abundances
   has another meaning than in other globular clusters. From a comparison
   with spectroscopic element abundances, we find the best correlation with
   the sum C+N. The high Stromgren metallicities, if interpreted by strong
   CN-bands, result from progressively higher N and perhaps C abundances in
   comparison to iron. The large scatter of Stromgren abundances may come
   from a variety of evolutionary effects, including C-depletion and
   N-enrichment. We see an enrichment already among the metal-poor
   population, which is difficult to explain by self-enrichment alone.
   An attractive speculation (done before) is that omega Cen was the
   nucleus of a dwarf galaxy. We propose a scenario in which omega Cen
   experienced mass inflow over a long period of time, until the gas
   content of its host galaxy was so low that star formation in omega Cen
   stopped, or alternatively the gas was stripped off during its infall in
   the Milky Way potential. This mass inflow could have occurred in a
   clumpy and discontinuous manner, explaining the second peak of
   metallicities, the abundance pattern, and the asymmetric spatial
   distribution of the most metal-rich population. Moreover, it explains
   the kinematic differences found between metal-poor and metal-rich stars.}},

Abstract = {{During urban storms, the overloading of a sewer system or a riverbank
   overflow produces flows that are routed by the road infrastructure and
   causes flooding of adjacent built-up areas. The evaluation of the damage
   inflicted in these built-up areas requires the determination of
   important hydraulic parameters of the inundation, such as the maximum
   water depth or the inundation duration. For each independent hydraulic
   urban cell, these parameters depend upon its intrinsic hydraulic
   properties (perviousness and storage capacity) and on the
   characteristics of the flood outside the cell. This paper proposes a
   quantitative formulation of the concept of cell hydraulic vulnerability
   based on the cell's hydraulic properties and on the basic
   characteristics of the flood (peak flow and time to peak). This study is
   based on observations made in three districts of Ouagadougou, Burkina
   Faso, and on a 23-year record of rainfall events in this region. The
   hydraulic vulnerability is discussed according to the district hydraulic
   properties and to the flood event characteristics. The developed
   methodology could be used in principle in every city where built-up
   areas are highly subpartitioned into walled properties.}},

Abstract = {{We studied behavioral responses of the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus, to
   mechanical stimulation of rhp hindwing tin using three different kinds
   of stimuli: touching, bending and pinching. The most characteristic was
   a sequence of initial jump-like movements and subsequent running steps,
   that is referred to as escape behavior in this study. Touching stimulus
   elicited the escape behavior in 52\% of resting animals tethered on a
   treadmill, whereas bending elicited the same behavior in 94\% or 98\%
   depending on the bend direction. Pinching was effective in all tested
   animals. The effectiveness of pinching stimulus in eliciting the escape
   behavior depends on the ongoing activity in the animal. Video and
   electromyographic recordings have revealed that, in the initial
   jump-like movements, forelegs and hindlegs move simultaneously on both
   sides while midlegs remain on the ground, followed by simultaneous
   movements of bilateral midlegs. The subsequent stepping was
   characterized by out-of-phase rhythmical activities of the leg muscles.
   Touching stimulus evoked tonic afferent responses of small amplitude in
   the second nerve root of the metathoracic ganglion. Bending stimulus
   evoked tonic responses of large units that showed rapid habituation and
   medium units that persisted during repeated stimulation. Pinching
   stimulus elicited only phasic responses of large and medium amplitude in
   the R2 afferents. The result suggest that touching, bending and pinching
   stimuli are transmitted to the metathoracic ganglion via different
   sensory systems having different effectiveness in activating the escape
   motor system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, we developed a maternal-fetal macaque model using a highly
   pathogenic HIV-2 strain, HIV-2(287), to study the time course of HIV
   transmission in utero. Most pregnant macaques (Macaca nemestrina)
   infected with HIV-2(287) (10-10(3) infective doses) transmitted HIV to
   their fetuses. as verified by positive identification of virus-infected
   mononuclear cells and free viral RNA in fetal blood. To determine
   whether an antiretroviral drug combination therapy composed of two
   dideoxynucleosides, azidothymidine (15 mg/kg) and dideoxyinosine (15
   mg/kg), and a protease inhibitor, indinavir (25 mg/kg), could completely
   inhibit mother-to-fetus HIV transmission, we administered these drugs
   orally through gastric catheters to five pregnant macaques infected with
   10 infective doses of HIV-2(287). Beginning 30 minutes after HIV
   inoculation, the dams were given the combination antiviral therapy three
   times daily until delivery by cesarean section. Drug treatment reduced
   the maternal virus load to a minimally detectable level but did not
   prevent primary HIV-2(287) infection. All fetal and infant blood samples
   were virus negative by internally controlled RNA polymerase chain
   reaction (QC-RNA-PCR) and virus coculture assays. Fetal and infant
   CD4(+) T-cell levels remained normal throughout the experiment. These
   findings strongly suggest that combination chemotherapy with
   azidothymidine, dideoxyinosine, and indinavir can suppress maternal
   viral load enough to prevent mother-to-fetus transmission of HIV.}},

   maximum-use time of 14 days and exposed per manufacturer's requirements
   (10 hours at 25 degrees C). The RSS sterilized 100\% of the carriers of

   Similarly, Mycobacteria bovis and selected fungal and viral agents were
   exposed to stressed solution for 5 minutes or less at 20 degrees C. In
   each case, the resulting log decrease in viable microorganisms
   significantly supported a claim For rapid high-level disinfection. Based

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the potential of retrieving information about the
   soil moisture profile from measurements of the surface soil moisture
   content through active microwave observations of the Earth. Recently,
   Mancini et al. {[}1999] have shown through laboratory experiments that
   the volumetric moisture content of the first few centimeters of a bare
   soil can be determined within 5\% vol accuracy by means of C and L band
   active microwave observations and inverse modeling. Here we use active
   microwave observations of the surface soil moisture content in a data
   assimilation framework to show that this allows the retrieval of the
   root zone soil moisture profile. The data assimilation procedure
   developed is based on the Kalman filter technique. Kalman filtering
   allows reconstruction of the state vector of a system when this system
   is represented by a dynamic model and when at least part of the state
   Variables are observed regularly. The dynamic model of the system used
   here is based on the one-dimensional Richards equation. The observation
   equation is based on the Integral Equation Model {[}Fung ef al., 1992;
   Fung, 1994] and is used to link the radar observations to surface soil
   moisture content. It is shown that even in the presence of model and
   observation noise and infrequent observations, accurate retrieval of the
   entire moisture profile is possible for a bare soil.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: The prognosis for patients with intramural
   metastasis (IMM) of esophageal cancer is poor. We examined the role of
   preoperative chemotherapy in the management of patients with this
   disease.
   Methods: Fifteen patients with IMM of esophageal carcinoma received
   preoperative chemotherapy cisplatin on day 1 and 5-fluorouracil on days
   1 to 5. This regimen was repeated after a 3-week interval, except in
   patients with progressive disease or severe toxicity who received only
   one cycle of chemotherapy. Patients underwent surgery around 3 weeks
   after completion of chemotherapy. Clinical response was evaluated and
   survival was compared with that of patients who did not receive
   preoperative chemotherapy.
   Results: Toxicity was manageable except in one patient who experienced
   severe neurological adverse effect. The clinical response rate of the
   IMM was 66.7\% (10/15) and the complete response rate was 6.7\% (1/15);
   for the primary lesion, response rates were 86.7\% and 6.7\%,
   respectively. All 15 patients underwent surgery. Seven of the 15
   patients (46.7\%) experienced non-fatal operative complications. The
   5-year survival rate after surgery was 20\%.
   Conclusions: Preoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil
   is feasible in patients with IMM of esophageal carcinoma. This regimen,
   however, does not improve survival and more effective treatment
   strategies are required. J. Surg. Oncol. 2000:75:117-121. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Hannah More (1745-1833) made an important contribution to the developing
   art of propaganda in the period 1788-99. She first learned the
   techniques of the propaganda of agitation from her involvement in the
   movement for the abolition of the slave trade, though she devoted most
   of the 1790s to the propaganda of integration. In a large number of
   popular tracts she used fictional narratives to urge to poor to
   deference and the rising middle class to contentment. As an independent
   woman writer, much of her work was directed to the female sex, but her
   desire to see women play a more constructive role in society came to
   conflict with her fear of revolutionary ideas. Consciously aware of the
   techniques of propaganda, she saw these being used in radical
   literature, especially in German Romantic drama and in the works of Mary
   Wollstonecraft. One of the major purposes of her Strictures on... Female
   Education (1799) was to alert British women to the serious social and
   political dangers inherent in those forms of radical propaganda.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple and efficient time-integration method for
   non-symmetric and non-linear equations of motion occurring in the
   analysis of rotating machines. The algorithm is based on a semi-analytic
   formulation combining powerful methods of linear structural dynamics
   applied to non-linear dynamic problems. To that purpose, the total
   solution is separated into a linear and a non-linear part, and a further
   partitioning into quasi-static and dynamic parts is performed. Modal
   analysis is applied to the undamped equations of the dynamic parts. The
   quasi-static parts contain all degrees of freedom, while a cost-saving
   modal reduction may be easily performed for the dynamic parts. Duhamel's
   integral is utilized for the modal equations. The time-evolution of the
   unknown modal excitations due to the dissipative, non-conservative,
   gyroscopic and non-linear effects entering Duhamel's integral is
   approximated during each time-step. The resulting time-stepping
   procedure is performed in an implicit manner, and the method is examined
   in some detail, in view of stability and accuracy characteristics. A
   rotordynamic system serves as a benchmark problem in order to
   demonstrate the computational advantages of the present method with
   respect to various other time-integration algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Amphioxus, as the closest living invertebrate relative of the
   vertebrates, can give insights into the evolutionary origin of the
   vertebrate body plan. Therefore, to investigate the evolution of genetic
   mechanisms for establishing and patterning the neuroectoderm, we cloned
   and determined the embryonic expression of two amphioxus transcription
   factors, AmphiSox1/2/3 and AmphiNeurogenin. These genes are the earliest
   known markers for presumptive neuroectoderm in amphioxus. By the early
   neurula stage, AmphiNeurogenin expression becomes restricted to two
   bilateral columns of segmentally arranged neural plate cells, which
   probably include precursors of motor neurons. This is the earliest
   indication of segmentation in the amphioxus nerve cord, Later,
   expression extends to dorsal cells in the nerve cord, which may include
   precursors of sensory neurons. By the midneurula, AmphiSox1/2/3
   expression becomes limited to the dorsal part of the forming neural
   tube. These patterns resemble those of their vertebrate and Drosophila
   homologs. Taken together with the evolutionarily conserved expression of
   the dorsoventral patterning genes, BLP2/4 and chordin, in nonneural and
   neural ectoderm, respectively, of chordates and Drosophila, our results
   are consistent with the evolution of the chordate dorsal nerve cord and
   the insect ventral nerve cord from a longitudinal nerve cord in a common
   bilaterian ancestor. However, AmphiSox1/2/3 differs from its vertebrate
   homologs in not being expressed outside the CNS, suggesting that
   additional roles for this gene have evolved in connection with gene
   duplication in the vertebrate lineage. In contrast, expression in the
   midgut of AmphiNeurogenin together with the gene encoding the
   insulin-like peptide suggests that amphioxus may have homologs of
   vertebrate pancreatic islet cells, which express neurogenin3. In
   addition, AmphiNeurogenin, like its vertebrate and Drosophila homologs,
   is expressed in apparent precursors of epidermal chemosensory and
   possibly mechanosensory cells, suggesting a common origin for protostome
   and deuterostome epidermal sensory cells in the ancestral bilaterian.

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. Overlying intestinal gas often impairs transabdominal
   sonographic assessment of the lower sigmoid colon. The aim of this study
   was to investigate the usefulness of transrectal sonography in addition
   to transabdominal sonography for the evaluation of sigmoid
   diverticulitis.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Eighty-six consecutive patients with clinically
   suspected acute sigmoid diverticulitis were referred for transabdominal
   sonography as the initial imagine, method. In 46 patients, transrectal
   sonography was performed in addition to transabdominal sonography if
   pain was localized to the mid lower abdomen and if a disease process
   could not be visualized or could be only partially visualized on
   transabdominal examination. An end-firing 5-9-MHz endocavitary probe was
   used for transrectal sonography.
   RESULTS, Thirty-four of 50 patients with a final diagnosis of sigmoid
   diverticulitis underwent both transabdominal and transrectal sonography.
   In 20 patients, transrectal sonography showed relevant additional
   information: six diagnoses of diverticulitis were established on
   transrectal sonography alone. Transrectal sonography revealed one
   perforation, five abscesses, and three fistulous complications that were
   not shown on transabdominal sonography. In the remaining five patients,
   correct diagnoses were supported on transabdominal examinations, but
   only transrectal sonography could show an inflamed diverticulum. In 10
   patients, transrectal sonography revealed signs of diverticulitis but no
   relevant information in addition to the results from transabdominal
   sonography. Four false-negative and two false-positive results were
   revealed with transrectal sonography.
   CONCLUSION, Transrectal sonography is accurate for confirming clinically
   suspected acute colonic diverticulitis when the lower sigmoid colon is
   affected. It helps avoid false-negative results and defines the severity
   of disease in the lower sigmoid colon better than transabdominal
   sonography alone. Transrectal sonography can increase the sensitivity of
   sonography for diagnosing sigmoid diverticulitis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental investigation and numerical
   modelling of the behaviour of a porous chalk by taking into account
   effects of saturating fluid. Two representative fluids, oil and water
   are considered. The laboratory testing programme includes two topics.
   First, conventional hydrostatic and triaxial compression tests are
   carried out on samples which are saturated with water and oil,
   respectively. The sensitivity of chalk behaviour to saturating fluid is
   clearly shown. Secondly, specific water injection tests are conducted in
   which water is injected into chalk samples initially saturated by oil,
   under different hydrostatic and deviatoric stress states. Additional
   plastic deformation induced by water flooding is determined. In the
   second part of paper, an elastoplastic model with two yield surfaces is
   proposed. The water-induced plastic deformation is described by
   introducing an additional plastic mechanism related to the behaviour
   jump between two material states of chalk. An overall good correlation
   is obtained between numerical simulations and experimental data not only
   for conventional tests, but also for water injection tests. Copyright

Abstract = {{A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with
   fluorescence detection after precolumn fluorescamine derivation was
   developed to detect residues of two aminopenicillins, amoxicillin (AMPC)
   and ampicillin (ABPC), in bovine serum. Proteins in serum samples spiked
   with each of these penicillins were precipitated with sodium tungstate
   and sulfuric acid, centrifuged, and removed by passage through a Cis
   solid-phase extraction cartridge. After precolumn treatment of the
   extraction products of AMPC and ABPC with fluorescamine solution, HPLC
   analysis with fluorescence spectrophotometric detection at an excitation
   wavelength of 390 nm and an emission wavelength of 485 nm was performed
   to identify these products. Two mobile phases were used for residual
   analysis by the isocratic HPLC system. An ODP column (polyvinyl alcohol,
   bonded with an octadecyl functional group) that can be used with
   strongly alkaline mobile phases (pH 2.0 to 13) was selected, and the
   column temperature was set at 40 degrees C. A mobile phase comprising
   100-mM K2HPO4 solution and acetonitrile (72:28, vol/vol), which yielded
   AMPC and ABPC retention times of 4.1 and 7.9 min, respectively, was
   suitable for detection of residual ABPC but not for residual AMPC
   because interference was caused by peaks of other extracted substances.
   When a mobile phase comprising a different ratio of 100-mM K2HPO4
   solution and acetonitrile (78:22, vol/vol) was used, the retention times
   of AMPC and ABPC were 7.3 and 26.3 min, respectively, and both
   penicillins could be analyzed using this system. The calculated standard
   curves of the reaction products with both mobile phases were linear, and
   the correlation coefficients were greater than 0.999. The lower limit of
   detection was 10 ng/ml for both penicillins. Analysis of extracts from
   bovine serum spiked with AMPC and ABPC at a concentration of 1 mu g/ml
   yielded recovery rates of 102.2 +/- 5.5\% and 79.0 +/- 5.2\%,
   respectively. This detection method may be useful for routine laboratory
   testing of AMPC and ABPC.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. To determine whether topoisomerase II alpha (topoIIa) expression is
   an additional prognostic marker for less advanced stage laryngeal
   cancers first treated without surgery. Ki-67 and p53 protein levels were
   also assessed for comparison. Experimental design. Formalin-fixed,
   paraffin-embedded tumor material from 63 cases of squamous cell
   carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx (glottis, stages 0,1,2) was
   immunohistochemically stained for topoIIa, Ki-67 (MIB-1) and p53 (DO-7)
   and the results were compared with clinicopathologic findings. Results.
   There were 7 stage 0 (TisN0M0), 33 stage I (T1N0M0), and 23 stage II
   (T2N0M0) SCCs with the TNM classification. Significant differences
   between carcinomas and normal mucosa were found for the topoIIa-LI,
   Ki-67-LI, and topoIIa-to-Ki-67 ratio. Regarding histologic grade, a
   significant difference in topoIIa-to-Ki-67 ratio was evident between
   well or moderately and poorly differentiated lesions. There were 19
   cases of recurrence and 44 cases of nonrecurrence, but no significant
   differences were found for either of the indices or their ratio. No
   significant variation with p53 positivity was evident with reference to
   histologic differentiation, T-factor, clinical course, or proliferation.
   Conclusions. The results demonstrate that the topoIIa-to-Ki-67 ratio is
   a more sensitive parameter reflecting proliferation, for histologic
   grading of less advanced laryngeal SCCs, than topoIIa- or Ki-67-LIs.}},

Abstract = {{Based on a simple, but fairly successful, model of the chemical
   evolution of the Milky Way disk, we study the evolution of the
   abundances of the elements He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar and Fe. We
   use metallicity dependent yields for massive stars with and without mass
   loss. We find that most observed abundance profiles are correctly
   reproduced by massive star yields, but C and N require supplementary
   sources. We argue that massive, mass losing stars can totally account
   for the abundance profile of C, while intermediate mass stars are the
   main source of N; in both cases, some conflict with corresponding data
   on extragalactic HII regions arises, at least if current observations in
   the Galaxy are taken at face value. The observed behaviour of Al is
   marginally compatible with current massive star yields, which probably
   overestimate the ``odd-even{''} effect. We also find that the adopted
   ``inside-out{''} formation scheme for the Milky Way disk produces
   abundance profiles steeper in the past. The corresponding abundance
   scatter is smaller in the inner disk than in the outer regions for a
   given interval of Galactic age.}},

   within the membrane. Predictions of the fraction of product water
   leaving the anode side of the fuel cell are compared to recent
   experimental studies in the literature. The present model correctly
   predicts the dependence of product water leaving the anode on hydrogen
   stoichiometry, oxygen stoichiometry, current density, and cell
   temperature. The multidimensional nature of transport within such a fuel

Abstract = {{We present in this paper an approach to extract human parametric 2-D
   model for the purpose of estimating human posture and recognizing human
   activity. This task is done in two steps. In the first step, human
   silhouette is extracted from complex background under a fixed camera
   through a statistical method. By this method, we can reconstruct the
   background dynamically and obtain the moving silhouette. In the second
   step, genetic algorithm is used to match the silhouette of human body to
   a model in parametric shape space. In order to reduce the searching
   dimension, a layer method is proposed to take the advantage of human
   model. Additionally we apply structure-oriented Kalman filter to
   estimate the motion of body parts. Therefore initial population and
   value in GA can be well constrained. Experiments on real video sequences
   show that our method can extract human model robustly and accurately.}},

Abstract = {{Food availability, energetic ceilings, and life-history trade-offs have
   been proposed as potential determinants of offspring number in many
   animals. We investigated the role of these factors in determining litter
   size in a free-ranging population of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus
   hudsonicus). Long-term observational data were used to assess the
   influence of food availability, while experimental manipulations of
   litter size permitted evaluation of the importance of energetic ceilings
   and life-history trade-offs. Among unmanipulated litters, juvenile
   growth rate and survival, but not litter size, were significantly
   related to annual food supply. Experimental increases in offspring
   number were successfully sustained in a high- and a low-food year, but
   in both years increases in litter sizes were associated with pronounced
   declines in juvenile growth rates. However, the reduced size of
   offspring in augmented litters did not fully compensate for the increase
   in offspring number, so that the total litter mass supported by
   augmented females was much higher than that of control females. During
   late lactation, augmented females were characterized by increased daily
   energy expenditure, but not by significant changes in time budgets,
   relative to control females. Increases in litter size did not appear to
   reduce maternal survival, but were associated with declines in offspring
   survival. Together, these results indicate that food availability and
   energetic ceilings do not limit litter size in red squirrels directly,
   but that tradeoffs between offspring number and offspring survival may
   eliminate any advantage of weaning larger-than-normal litters.}},

   1897-1907, Stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange during ischemia-reperfusion
   results in cardiac damage. However, it is unclear whether the Na+/H+
   exchanger is active during the ischemic period or during reperfusion.
   Adult beating cardiomyocytes were exposed to an ischemia mimetic
   solution for 90 min and then reperfused with a normal solution for 30
   min, 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA), a blocker of the Na+/H+
   exchanger, was administered during ischemia and the first 3 min of
   reperfusion or only during the first 3 min of reperfusion.
   Administration of DMA only upon reperfusion resulted in increased cell
   survival (81 +/- 1\%, P < 0.05) compared to using the drug during
   ischemia and reperfusion (63 +/- 3\%) and in the absence of drug (60 +/-
   1\%). During ischemia, pH, was lower when DMA was present in the
   ischemic solution, The inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchanger retarded the
   recovery of pH during reperfusion. The highest recovery of active cell
   shortening was observed when DMA was used at the beginning of
   reperfusion. The use of DMA also reduced the level of passive cell
   shortening during reperfusion, and when used at the beginning of
   reperfusion significantly increased the recovery of Ca2+ transients. Our
   results demonstrate that the exchanger is primarily active during
   reperfusion and that inhibition of the exchanger solely at this time has
   a strong cardioprotective effect. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The promoter of the Paracoccus denitrificans nitric oxide reductase
   operon (norCBQDEF) has been characterized by primer extension and
   deletion analysis. A major transcript that is detectable only in
   anaerobically grown cells initiates 43.5 bp downstream of the centre of
   a putative binding site for the transcription factor NNR (nitrite and
   nitric oxide reductase regulator, which is known to regulate nor
   expression). A minor transcript initiates 121 bp upstream of the major
   transcript and is detectable in cells grown aerobically or
   anaerobically. Deletion derivatives of the nor promoter region wore
   constructed and analysed in vivo using transcriptional fusions to the
   reporter gene lacZ. Expression patterns from promoter deletions in a
   wild-type strain and an nnr mutant confirmed that the minor transcript
   is NNR independent, and makes a small contribution to nor expression
   under both aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions. A deletion
   derivative truncated to within 7 bp of the putative NNR-binding site
   showed a near wild-type response to anaerobic growth, showing that no
   upstream DNA sequences are required for activation of the major
   promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis of the putative NNR-binding site
   confirmed that this is the major cis-acting sequence mediating the
   anaerobic inducibility of nor expression.}},

Abstract = {{Ninety-two total laryngectomy cases were investigated with reference to
   post-laryngectomy fistula formation. Fistula was observed in eight cases
   (8.69 per cent). There were no statistically significant differences
   between the fistula group and the non-fistula group with regard to
   pre-operative tracheotomy, tumour differentiation, positive surgical
   margins, concurrent neck dissection, previous radiotherapy, T stage of
   the tumour, presence of extended hypopharyngeal mucosal excision, and
   placement of nasogastric tube. The only statistically significant
   positive association was found with primary pharyngeal myotomy. Myotomy
   was performed in six of the fistula patients and in two cases a
   technical error was observed. In these cases myotomy was performed
   adjacent to the edge of hypopharyngeal mucosa resulting in a weakened
   area of pharyngeal closure, possibly contributing to the fistula. This
   should be kept in mind and avoided at all costs during the performance
   of myotomy. Since it was not possible to find out any specific causal
   relationship with myotomy in four other cases, further studies are
   needed to establish the association of myotomy with pharyngocutaneous
   fistula.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the regulatory mechanisms involved in the
   cooperation between IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha to promote transcription
   from IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), A transient transfection analysis
   revealed that the region between -218 and -144, where +1 is the
   transcription start site, as well as previously reported downstream
   elements, pp kappa B and IFN-gamma activation site/kappa B, were
   required for the optimal response to the two cytokines, A subsequent
   DNase I footprint analysis showed that the region between -171 and -144
   was inducibly protected with stimulation by TNF-alpha, and this
   protection was significantly enhanced with the combination of IFN-gamma
   and TNF-alpha, In an EMSA with the protected region as a probe, a
   TNF-alpha-inducible complex (C1) and an IFN-gamma-inducible complex
   (C2), but no synergy-specific DNA-protein complexes, were recognized.
   The C1 complex consisted of a pre-existing factor (p65/p50), whereas
   time C2 complex consisted of a newly synthesized IRF-1-related factor. A
   methylation interference assay revealed the critical G residues (from
   -167 to -151) for the DNA-protein complex formation specific to the
   cytokine response, and within this region the novel kappa B sequence,
   the promoter distal kappa B (pd kappa B) element (5'-GGGGAAG TAC3'), was
   identified. Because the base substitutions over the pd kappa B region
   (from -171 to -144) affected not only the TNF-alpha-response but also
   that of IFN-gamma this region might contribute to the cooperative action
   of the NF-kappa B subunits with the IRF-1-related factor. Finally, we
   demonstrated that none of the cf-acting elements, pp kappa B, pd kappa
   B, or IFN-gamma activation site/kappa B, is dispensable for the optimal
   synergism in response to IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha.}},

Abstract = {{European-level government presents new opportunities and constraints for
   domestic social actors. But barriers remain to contentious action in the
   transnational realm. Most individuals have difficulty ascribing the
   sources of their grievances to the EU, transaction costs impede their
   efforts to coordinate collective action across national boundaries, and
   traditional routines of collective action attach citizens to their
   national systems. Nevertheless, some actors are able to mobilise at the
   European level. Using reports from Reuters, the study finds that most
   protests are made by occupational groups, such as farmers or workers,
   with little mobilisation of non-occupational groups (such as
   environmental or women's NGOs). Also, rather than a direct displacement
   of contentious politics to the supranational Level, one sees a range of
   mobilising styles: transnational co-operation against domestic actors,
   collective European protests, and the domestication of European issues
   within national politics. The authors speculate that these outcomes will
   allow the EU Commission to keep such protests at a distance, and that
   activists whose careers are in Brussels-based NGOs will be deprived of
   the weapons they need to back up their claims.}},

Abstract = {{PPP1R3 (protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 3) is a candidate
   tumor suppressor gene at chromosome 7q31, since nonsense and missense
   mutations of the PPP1R3 gene have been detected in a variety of human
   cancers. Loss of chromosome 7q is a recurrent abnormality in
   hematological malignancies, especially of myeloid lineage, and a common
   region of 7q deletions has been mapped to 7q31. Thus, it has been
   suggested that 7q31 harbors a tumor suppressor gene whose functional
   loss contributes to leukemogenesis. To evaluate the possible involvement
   of the PPP1R3 gene in the development of hematological malignancies, we
   examined 72 leukemia and lymphoma cell lines for alterations of the
   PPP1R3 gene by PCR-SSCP and direct sequence analyses. Mutations were
   detected in 1 (2.8\%) of 36 myeloid cell lines, 4 (20.0\%) of 20
   B-lineage lymphoid cell lines and none of 16 T-lineage lymphoid cell
   lines. All the mutations were heterozygous, and they consisted of two
   missense mutations and three silent mutations. The PPP1R3 gene was
   expressed in cell lines of various cell lineages. These results indicate
   that PPP1R3 is not a major target of 7q deletions in myeloid leukemia,
   however, alterations of the PPP1R3 gene may contribute to the
   development of a subset of hematological malignancies.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was designed to examine the retention of relative
   force in the scaling of a serial force pattern in finger-tapping
   sequences. On practice trials, 11 male college students tapped a force
   plate connected to strain gauges which provided feedback. On test
   trials, subjects recalled both the force pattern (100 g-100 g-100 g-300
   g) and intertap interval (400 msec.) acquired during practice without
   feedback (recalled task) and then produced a halved (halved task) or
   doubled-force (doubled task) at the fixed intertap interval. Analysis
   showed that, although there was no difference for absolute forces
   between the recalled task and the halved task, the forces at the doubled
   task were three times as great as those at the recalled task. For
   relative forces, on the other hand, although there was no difference
   among the three tasks, the force ratios were closer to 1:1:1:2 than
   1:1:1:3. This indicated that the scaling of force pattern was a more
   difficult adaptive task than that of the intertap interval in the
   previous study (Inui, Ishida, gr Yamanishi, 1999).}},

Abstract = {{Objective. This report presents the strategies used to eradicate rubella
   in the Caribbean region and the challenges faced by that effort.
   Methods. Using the surveillance system fur measles cases that was
   instituted in all countries in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), 12
   countries confirmed cases of rubella between 1992 and 1996. Rubella
   infections occurred in epidemic proportions in 6 countries during that
   period.
   Results. On the basis of the rubella prevalence data, rubella-congenital
   rubella syndrome (CRS) cost-benefit analysis, and cost-effectiveness of
   the mass campaign, the Council for Human and Social Development of
   CARICOM resolved, on April 21, 1998, that every effort would be made to
   eradicate rubella, as well as to prevent the occurrence of new cases of
   CRS by the end of 2000. Using the Pan American Health Organization's
   template for measles eradication, CARICOM proposed and implemented the
   main strategies for rubella and CRS eradication, and rubella mass
   campaigns were conducted in 18 countries. The target population, which
   included males and females (aged 20-40 years), was approximately 2.2
   million.
   Conclusion. The major challenges for rubella eradication are attaining
   high vaccine coverage in the adult population and maintaining an
   effective surveillance system able to detect rubella activity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analytical optimization of a remote power system
   for a hypothetical Alaskan village. The analysis considers the potential
   of generating renewable energy (e.g., wind and solar), along with the
   possibility of using energy storage to take full advantage of the
   intermittent renewable sources available to these villages. Storage in
   the form of either compressed hydrogen or zinc pellets can then provide
   electricity from hydrogen or zinc-air fuel cells whenever wind or
   sunlight are low. The renewable system is added on to the existing
   generation system, which is based on diesel engines. Results indicate
   that significant reductions in fossil fuel consumption in these remote
   communities are cost effective using renewable energy combined with
   advanced energy storage devices. A hybrid energy system for the
   hypothetical village can reduce consumption of diesel fuel by about 50\%
   with annual cost savings of about 30\% by adding wind turbines to the
   existing diesel generators. Adding energy storage devices can further
   reduce fuel use, and depending on the economic conditions potentially
   reduce life-cycle costs. With optimized energy storage, use of the
   diesel gensets can be reduced to almost zero, with the existing
   equipment only maintained for added reliability. However, about one
   quarter of the original fuel is still used for heating purposes.

Abstract = {{Molecular cloning of the gene and the crystal structure of the prolyl
   aminopeptidase {[}EC 3.4.11.5] from Serratia marcescens have been
   studied by us {[}J. Biochem. 122, 601-605 (1997); ibid. 126, 559-565
   (1999)]. Through these studies, Phe139, Tyr149, Glu204, and Arg136 were
   estimated to be concerned with substrate recognition. To elucidate the
   details of the mechanism for the substrate specificity, the
   site-directed mutagenesis method was applied. The F139A mutant showed an
   80-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K-m) but the Y149A
   mutant did not show a significant change in catalytic efficiency. The
   catalytic efficiency of the E204Q mutant was about 4\% of that of the
   wild type. The peptidase activity of the mutant (R136A) was markedly
   decreased, however, arylamidase activity with Pyr-PNA was retained as in
   the wild-enzyme. From these results, it was clarified that the
   pyrrolidine ring and the amino group of proline at the S1 site were
   recognized by Phe139 and Glu204, respectively. P1' of a substrate was
   recognized by Arg136. On the other hand, the enzyme had two cysteine
   residues. Mutants C74A and C271A were inhibited by PCMB, but the double
   mutated enzyme (C74/271A) was resistant to it.}},

Abstract = {{The role of dopamine D1 and D2 receptor subtypes in the regulation, in
   vivo, of the somatostatin (SRIF) receptor-effector system in rat
   frontoparietal cortex was investigated. The D1-receptor agonist SKF
   38393 (4 mg/kg) or the D2-receptor agonist bromocriptine (2 mg/kg),
   administered intraperitoneally to rats, increased the number of SRIF
   receptors without altering the affinity constant, an effect antagonized
   by both SCH 23390 (0.25 mg/kg) and raclopride (5 mg/kg), D1 and D2
   receptor antagonists, respectively. These antagonists alone had no
   effect on {[}I-125]Tyr(3) octreotide binding to its receptors. No change
   in binding was detected when the dopamine agonists were added in vitro.
   Basal adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity was increased by SKF 38393
   treatment and decreased by bromocriptine. Octreotide (SMS
   201-995)-mediated inhibition of basal and forskolin-stimulated AC was
   increased by SKF 38393 or bromocriptine treatment. In frontoparietal
   cortical slices, basal inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP,) levels were
   decreased by bromocriptine treatment but were unaffected by SKF 38393.
   SMS 201-995 increased the IF, accumulation in control, SKF 38393-, and
   bromocriptine-treated rats. Insofar as SRIF and dopamine appear to be
   involved in motor regulation and could well modulate somatosensory
   functions in frontal and parietal cortex, respectively, heterologous
   receptor regulation may have important repercussions regarding the
   control exerted by these neurotransmitters on frontal and parietal
   cortical function in the intact animal. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical experience with episcleritis and
   scleritis at a tertiary care eye center.
   METHODS: Retrospective chart review.
   RESULTS: One hundred thirty-four patients with scleral inflammation were
   seen over a 12-year period, Thirty-seven patients had episcleritis, and
   97 patients had scleritis, Ocular complications occurred in only 13.5\%
   of patients with episcleritis but in 58.8\% of patients with scleritis
   (P < .0001), No patient with episcleritis had a decrease in visual
   acuity, whereas 15.9\% of patients with scleritis did. Only 16.7\% of
   patients with episcleritis required more than topical corticosteroids
   for treatment, and these patients required oral nonsteroidal
   anti-inflammatory drugs, Conversely, 30.4\% of patients with scleritis
   required nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 31.9\% oral prednisone,
   and 26.1\% systemic immunosuppressive drugs (P < .0001), Necrotizing
   scleritis and posterior scleritis more often were associated with ocular
   complications, occurring in 91.7\% and 85.7\%, respectively, than were
   diffuse anterior scleritis and nodular anterior scleritis (P = .020),
   Patients with necrotizing scleritis and posterior scleritis were more
   likely to be treated with oral corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
   drugs (90\% and 100\%, respectively) than were patients with diffuse
   anterior scleritis and nodular anterior scleritis (56.4\% and 21.4\%,
   respectively, P = .002),
   CONCLUSIONS: Scleritis is a severe ocular inflammation, often associated
   with ocular complications, and nearly always treated with systemic
   medications. Nearly 60\% of these patients will need oral
   corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs to control the disease. (C)

Abstract = {{The parallax method and the use of 2 radiographs taken at right angles
   to each other are the 2 methods generally used to accurately localize
   teeth. For the parallax method, the combination of a rotational
   panoramic radiograph with an occlusal radiograph is recommended. This
   combination involves a vertical x-ray tube shift. Three case reports are
   presented that illustrate: (1) how this combination can accurately
   localize unerupted mandibular anterior teeth, (2) how a deceptive
   appearance of the labiolingual position of the unerupted tooth can be
   produced in an occlusal radiograph, (3) how increasing the vertical
   angle of the tube for the occlusal radiograph makes the tube shift
   easier to discern, (4) why occlusal radiographs are preferable to
   periapical radiographs for tube shifts, and (5) how localization can
   also be carried out with 2 radiographs at right angles to each other,
   one of which is an occlusal radiograph taken with the x-ray tube
   directed along the long axis of the reference tooth.}},

Abstract = {{A majority of work on Congressional voting behavior finds that members
   of Congress establish ideological positions and maintain them throughout
   the entirety of their careers, regardless of how their career
   aspirations, political positions, or underlying constituencies change.
   Based on this evidence, Poole (1998) concludes that members of Congress
   ``die in their ideological boots.{''} I examine the robustness of the
   ``ideological-boots thesis{''} more closely, using vote-scaling
   techniques and roll-call voting data from a different American
   legislative system: the Congress of the Confederate States of America.
   Initial results run contrary to the ideological-boots thesis, as I
   uncover low levels of cross-system stability among members who moved
   from the U.S. House to the Confederate House. Examining further, I argue
   that high levels of ideological stability follow from a strong party
   system being in place to structure voting, which has traditionally been
   the case in the two-party U.S. House but was not the case in the
   partyless Confederate House. This result aside, I do find a moderate but
   increasing level of ideological stability among members of the
   Confederate House in a session-by-session analysis, which is robust to a
   serious ``shock{''} (Federal invasion) to the
   constituency-representative linkage underlying the electoral connection.
   This latter finding suggests that as long as there are electoral
   incentives associated with ideological labels, then ideologies will
   develop, regardless of party structure.}},

Abstract = {{The L(2, 1)-labeling of a graph is an abstraction of the problem of
   assigning (integer) frequencies to radio transmitters, such that
   transmitters that are ``close{''}, receive different frequencies, and
   those that are ``very close{''} receive frequencies that are further
   apart. The least span of frequencies in such a labeling is referred to
   as the lambda -number of the graph, Let n be odd greater than or equal
   to5, k = (n-3)/2 and let m(o,...,) m(k-1), m(k) each be a multiple of n.
   It is shown that lambda (C(m0)square...squareC(mk-1)) is equal to the
   theoretical minimum df n - 1, where C-r denotes a cycle of length r and
   ``square{''} denotes the Cartesian product of graphs. The scheme works
   for a vertex partition of C-m0 square...squareC(mk-1) squareC(k) into
   smallest (independent) dominating sets.}},

Abstract = {{Part I of this paper set sets forth theory and algorithms for adaptive
   fault detection/location technique,which is based on Phasor Measurement
   Unit (PMU). This paper is Part II of this paper set. A new timing device
   named ``Global Synchronism Clock Generator, GSCG'' including its
   hardware and software design is described in this paper, Experimental
   results show that the synchronized error of rising edge between the two
   GSCGs clock is well within 1 ps when the clock frequency is below 2.499
   MHz. The measurement results between Chung-Jeng and Chang-Te 161 kV
   substations of Taiwan Power company by PMU equipped with GSCG is
   presented and the accuracy for estimating parameters of line is
   verified. The new developed DFT based method (termed as Smart Discrete
   Fourier Transform, SDFT) and line parameter estimation algorithm are
   combined with PR-IU configuration to form the adaptive fault
   detector/locator system. Simulation results hare shown that SDFT method
   can extract exact phasors in the presence of frequency deviation and
   harmonics. The parameter estimation algorithm can also trace exact
   parameters very well, The SDFT method and parameter estimation algorithm
   can achieve accuracies of up to 99.999\% and 99.99\%, respectively, The
   EMTP is used to simulate a 345 kV transmission line of Taipower System.
   Results have shown that the proposed technique yields correct results
   independent of fault types and is insensitive to the variation of source
   impedance, fault impedance, and line loading. The accuracy of fault
   location estimation achieved can be up to 99.9\% for many simulated
   cases, The proposed technique will be very suitable for implementation
   in an integrated digital protection and control system for transmission
   substations.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between glutathione (GSH) and copper ions was
   investigated in vitro to determine whether such interaction could affect
   the free-radical scavenging properties of the tripeptide. To this end,
   the bleaching (decrease in OD734 nm) of a coloured solution containing
   the stable free-radical cation ABTS(.+), (which results from the
   addition of thiols to such a solution) was employed as an in vitro
   indication of the ability of the tripeptide to scavenge free radicals.
   While GSH bleached concentration-dependently (1.0-7.5 muM) the
   ABTS(.+)-containing solution, its prior incubation (5 muM) in the
   presence of Cu+1 or Cu+2 ions (1-7.5 M) led to a metal
   concentration-dependent decrease of the bleaching capacity. At a ratio
   equal to one (5 muM each), the bleaching capacity of the copper plus GSH
   mixture was 50\% of that seen for GSH alone. Further additions of copper
   (reaching ratios up to 2) did not result in greater decreases in the
   GSH-bleaching capacity. Noteworthy at the ratio of one was that the
   copper plus GSH solutions maintained their bleaching capacity despite
   the lack of any DTNB-reactivity, i.e., the complete absence of thiols in
   the mixture. Mixtures of increasing concentrations of a fixed ratio
   (equal to 2) of copper plus GSH, which were found not to exhibit any
   DTNB-reactivity, showed a linear and concentration-dependent increase in
   bleaching capacity. The bleaching capacity remained unaltered when
   TRIEN, EDTA or histidine were added to pre-incubated (1:1) mixtures of
   copper plus GSH. However, the incubation of copper with TRIEN or EDTA
   (but not histidine) prior to GSH addition, totally prevented the loss of
   the original GSH-bleaching capacity. The present data supports the
   formation of a copper-glutathione complex which is stable to the
   presence of some copper-chelators, lacks all thiol reactivity, but fully
   conserves the free-radical scavenging properties of GSH.}},

Abstract = {{Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with congestive heart failure (CHF)
   resulting from severe congenital aortic stenosis (AS) is a
   well-described condition in infancy, but it is rarely found in older
   children and adolescents. Aortic valve surgery in such cases may be
   associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Aortic valve
   balloon dilatation (AVBD) is a viable alternative, but its effect on LV
   function has not been evaluated. We describe follow-up results of AVBD
   in 10 cases of severe congenital AS in older children and adolescents
   with CHF and LV dysfunction. The ages of these patients ranged from 5 to
   18 yr (mean +/- SD: 10.8 +/- 4 yr), and nine were males. The follow-up
   period after AVBD ranged from 3 mo to 7 yr (mean +/- SD: 2.93 +/- 2.1
   yr). Success was achieved in all cases, with no immediate complications.
   After valvuloplasty, the peak-to-peak systolic gradient declined from
   74.7 +/- 30.8 to 33.9 +/- 18.2 mm Hg (P < 0.0001). The cardiac index
   increased slightly but significantly, from 1.9 +/- 0.27 to 2.2 +/- 0.5
   L/min/m(2) (P < 0.015). Hemodynamic improvement was also confirmed by a
   significant decrease in mean pulmonary artery and pulmonary artery wedge
   pressures from 41.9 +/- 9 to 32.6 +/- 6.6 and from 25.5 +/- 2.9 to 19.3
   +/- 3.4 mm Hg, respectively. The echocardiographically derived left
   ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improved from 21.6 +/- 5.37\% to 31
   +/- 6.5\% within 24 hr after AVBD, and it further improved in all cases
   on follow-up. Mean LVEF at last follow-up was 59.4 +/- 11.4\%. The
   Doppler instantaneous peak systolic gradient (IPSG) increased from 37.3
   +/- 18.8 to 64.8 +/- 30.7 mm Hg at late follow-up. Significant aortic
   regurgitation (AR) developed in 20\% of patients. The Doppler IPSG
   across the aortic valve was > 60 mm Hg in five cases on follow-up. Two
   of these patients underwent another AVBD successfully 4 and 16 mo later,
   respectively. Aortic valve replacement was done in two patients, one for
   severe restenosis with mild AR 12 mo after AVBD and another for severe
   re-restenosis with moderate AR 21 mo after a second AVBD. Severe
   congenital AS can be associated with LV dysfunction and CHF in late
   childhood and adolescence. AVBD results in good palliation with
   improvement in LV function on follow-up. Cathet. Cardiovasc. Intervent.

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Focusing primarily on questions of methodology, this article argues that
   mediation in international affairs has yet to be properly analysed using
   the theoretical tools provided by the post-positivist turn in
   international relations theory. Recognizing the familiar distinction
   between power-political and facilitative approaches, the article makes
   the case for a third approach based on the political theory of Jurgen
   Habermas. The debate between neorealist forms of analysis and critical
   theory is well known. More contentious, however, is the argument that
   facilitative forms of third party intervention, such as the Norwegian
   mediation of the Oslo Accords, cannot operate without a more formal and
   abstract notion of the `right' in politics. Facilitation's gently
   working of the lifeworld has much in common with the hermeneutic
   approach to social science. Like hermeneutics, therefore, facilitation
   may suffer as it fails to root out relations of power and domination.
   Even `interim stages' in conflict resolution need a sense of `final
   status' to gather a sense of pace and direction. The Oslo Accords, for
   example, demonstrate the need to create a strong vision of final status'
   during the interim stage. The article leaves the practical political
   questions to one side. However, a `methodological space' for critical
   theory opens up once the defects of the tradition are highlighted, a
   space which may be filled by distinct forms of mediation practice.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on one of the major ideological shifts associated
   with the territorialization of power experienced within Medieval
   European society, namely the growing exploitation of land. Using
   empirical evidence from the kingdom of Gwynedd in Wales, it explores the
   difficulties faced by Medieval societal rulers in translating their new
   ideologies of state rule into administrative practice. Their inability
   to create a consistent administrative structure to match their
   ideological ambitions meant that there was often a geography inherent in
   the territorialization of power in the Middle Ages, ranging from a close
   relationship between ideology and practice near the political core of
   the state to one of increasing discontinuity between the two near its
   periphery. The author suggests that the English conquest of Gwynedd in
   the late thirteenth century-one which was characterized by a far greater
   infrastructural co-ordination led, to a large extent, to the dissolution
   of the spatial variations in the administrative realities of the Gwynedd
   state. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Thirty women presenting for major gynaecological oncology surgery under
   a standardized, combined epidural/general anaesthetic technique received
   either placebo or tenoxicam 20 mg intravenously, in a randomized
   double-blinded manner prior to surgery. Plasma and urinary electrolytes
   creatinine, prostaglandins PgE(2) and PgF1 alpha and thromboxane (TxB2)
   were collected 12 hours preoperatively and then for foul days
   postoperatively.
   There were no significant differences in any of the measured parameters
   between the groups, at any of the measurement times. Mean (SD)
   creatinine clearance at baseline, 24h and 48h was 100.4 (29.7) and 86.9
   (27.5), 128.1 (45.9) and 115.0 (40.3), 137.5 (50.7) and 121.6 (38.6) in
   the placebo and tenoxicam groups respectively (P=0.28), Both groups
   required similar amounts of intraoperative ephedrine and intravenous
   fluids to maintain blood pressure. The minimal changes in plasma and
   renal parameters reflect predictable responses to major surgery and
   rehydration rather than any response to cyclooxygenase inhibition. This
   may underscore the importance of maintenance of blood pressure during
   the course of surgery and postoperative care, and perhaps the usefulness
   of a fluid loading regimen to preserve renal function during surgery.
   The predicted attenuation of renal prostaglandin-mediated protective
   mechanisms and enhancement of the catecholamine-mediated renal
   vasoconstriction by the use of a single 20 mg dose of tenoxicam in this
   study were not seen. Modulation of renal concentrating mechanisms or
   excretion of sodium and potassium by tenoxicam was not apparent and a
   large increase in study size would be required to detect a significant
   difference in these parameters as a consequence of the drug over and
   above any changes in response to surgery and epidural anaesthesia.}},

Abstract = {{Gene amplification is one of the mechanisms for oncogene activation in
   solid tumors. The size of the amplified regions may vary considerably
   among individual tumors, and more than one gene may be affected within
   the same amplicon. The main objective in analyzing genomic
   amplifications has therefore been to map the shortest region involved
   and to identify genes with increased expression as a result of the
   increased gene copy number. To facilitate such an analysis, we have
   developed simple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedures using the
   internal standards beta-actin (ACTB) and LI Hs for gene expression and
   gene copy number analyses, respectively. We used cDNA derived from
   pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, and genomic DNA extracted from the same
   cell lines, as templates in the gene expression and in the gene copy
   number analyses, respectively. To determine the optimal number of PCR
   cycles, dilution series of the templates were made. Furthermore,
   competing primers were used to adjust for differences in target sequence
   levels. We show that by these simple means it is possible to determine
   optimal conditions for expression analyses. in addition, the procedure
   was adapted for the analysis of gene copy number changes at the genomic
   level using LIHs as the internal standard. This PCR method makes it
   possible to produce detailed gene copy number profiles of amplified
   genomic regions. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{An outstanding problem in gravitation theory and relativistic
   astrophysics today is to understand the final outcome of an endless
   gravitational collapse. Such a continual collapse would take place when
   stars more massive than few times the mass of the sun collapse under
   their own gravity on exhausting their nuclear fuel. According to the
   general theory of relativity, this results either in a black hole, or a
   naked singularity - which can communicate with far away observers in the
   universe. While black holes are (almost) being detected and are
   increasingly used to model high energy astrophysical phenomena, naked
   singularities have turned into a topic of active discussion, aimed at
   understanding their structure and implications. Recent developments here

Abstract = {{It is estimated that 1600 women die world-wide each day as a result of
   problems during pregnancy ol childbirth. A large proportion of these
   deaths is preventable. This article examines the economic case for
   investing in safe motherhood interventions, and reviews key evidence of
   the cost effectiveness of safe motherhood interventions. According to
   one study, antenatal and maternal services comprise two of the six most
   cost effective sets of health interventions in low-income countries.
   However, little detailed evidence exists regarding the relative cost
   effectiveness of antenatal care, post-abortion care and essential
   obstetric care. Despite this there is clear evidence that interventions
   such as substituting manual vacuum aspiration for dilatation and
   curettage can result in significant savings both for health facilities
   and patients. The paper estimates first that 26\% of maternal deaths are
   avoidable through antenatal/community-based interventions, costing
   around 30\% of the WHO Mother Baby Package; and secondly that access to
   quality essential obstetric care call prevent a further 48\% of maternal
   deaths, consuming 24\% of total Mother Baby Package costs. Further work
   on the cost effectiveness of safe motherhood interventions would provide
   useful information for policy makers concerned with reducing maternal
   mortality in the most efficient manner possible. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Cruciferous vegetable extracts from freeze-dried cabbage (FDC),
   freeze-dried fermented cabbage (FDS), and acidified Brussels spl outs
   (ABS) were prepared by exhaustive extraction with ethyl acetate.
   Estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects of these extracts were analyzed.
   To identify whether the extracts are potential estrogen receptor (ER)
   ligands that can act as agonists or antagonists, the binding affinity of
   extracts for the ER was measured using a competitive radiometric binding
   assay. The extracts bound with low affinity to the ER, and the relative
   binding affinity is estradiol > FDS > FDC > ABS. These extracts were
   evaluated for their estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities in
   estrogen-dependent human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells using as endpoints
   proliferation and induction of estrogen-responsive pS2 gene expression,
   which was analyzed using Northern blot assay. At low concentrations
   (5-25 ng/mL) all of the extracts reduced 1 nM estradiol-induced MCF-7
   cell proliferation. Extracts at 25 ng/mL also inhibited
   estradiol-induced pS2 mRNA expression. At higher extract concentrations
   (50 ng/mL-25 mug/mL), however, increased proliferation in MCF-7 cells
   was observed. Similarly, expression of the pS2 gene was induced by
   higher extract concentrations (0.25-25 mug/mL). The pure estrogen
   antagonist, ICI 182,780, suppressed the cell proliferation induced by
   the extracts as well as by estradiol and also the induction of pS2
   expression by the extracts. The ER subtype-selective activities of FDC
   and FDS were analyzed using a transfection assay in human endometrial
   adenocarcinoma (HEC-1) cells. FDS acted as an ER alpha -selective
   agonist while FDC fully activated both ER-alpha and ER-beta. Growth of
   the ER-negative MDA-231 cells was not affected by the extracts or by
   estradiol. This study demonstrates that cruciferous vegetable extracts
   act bifunctionally, like an antiestrogen at low concentrations and an
   estrogen agonist at high concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is the second of a set of two papers that address the issue
   of earthquake-induced Liquefaction potential. lo the present study, a
   probabilistic approach is taken to analyse field Liquefaction
   performance records. The CPT-based limit state function for liquefaction
   resistance assessment presented in the first paper forms the basis for
   this probabilistic analysis. At the limit state, the liquefaction
   resistance of a soil, expressed as cyclic resistance ratio (CRR), is
   equal to the critical cyclic stress ratio (CSR), known as the seismic
   load. A reliability technique is used to analyse the 225 case records
   using the established limit state function and considering uncertainties
   in the input parameters. The probabilities of liquefaction are inferred
   from the calculated reliability indices based on Bayes' theorem. A
   mapping function between the factor of safety and the actual probability
   of liquefaction based on held case records is developed. The factor of
   safety, calibrated to the actual probability of liquefaction, can thus
   form the basis for rational design decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) instruments are increasingly
   important in evaluating health care, especially in cancer trials. When
   planning a trial, one essential step is the calculation of a sample
   size, which will allow a reasonable chance (power) of detecting a
   pre-specified difference (effect size) at a given level of statistical
   significance. It is almost mandatory to include this calculation in
   research protocols. Many researchers quote means and standard deviations
   to determine effect sizes, and assume the data will have a Normal
   distribution to calculate their required sample size. We have
   investigated the distribution of scores for two commonly used HRQoL
   instruments completed by lung cancer patients, and have established that
   scores do not have the Normal distribution form. We demonstrate that an
   assumption of Normality can lead to unrealistically sized studies. Our
   recommendation is to use a technique that is based on the fact that the
   HRQoL data are ordinal and makes minimal but realistic assumptions. (C)

Abstract = {{In order to plan the daily routine of a surgical day care unit optimally
   and effectively, it is indispensable to know the causes of unanticipated
   admission of outpatients. The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate
   the influences and predictors of unanticipated admission of patients in
   our day care unit for ambulatory surgery. The data sets of 3152 surgical
   outpatients were evaluated. The duration of slay had been entered online
   by computers.
   Method. From January 1997 until June 1999, all clinically relevant
   parameters from any out patient were entered into an anesthesia
   information management system (NarkoData(R), Imeso GmbH,
   Huttenberg-Rechtenbach, Germany). The correlation of potential nominal
   and ordinal scaled predictors of unanticipated admission was tested
   using the chi-squared test. Univariate analysis was used in determining
   predictors for the occurrence of unanticipated admission. Pearson's
   contingency coefficient (CC) was used as a standard for the correlation
   rigidity in nominal and ordinal scaled parameters. The correlation
   standard eta was used for metrical parameters.
   Results. Unanticipated admission occurred in 169 (5.4\%) of the 3152
   outpatients. The following parameters significantly influenced
   unanticipated admission: age, ASA status, diagnosis (ICD-9),time of
   admission, different anesthesia procedures and anesthetics (opioids and
   nondepolarizing muscle relaxants),surgical department, type of surgery
   (ICPM), duration of operation, blood loss, intraoperative hemoglobin
   values, and the administration of colloid and crystalloid solutions. The
   parameters blood loss, intraoperative hemoglobin values, and
   administration of colloid solutions were evaluated as being good
   predictors.
   Conclusion. The causes of unanticipated admission of patients in our day
   care unit for ambulatory surgery are manifold. Some relate to the
   patient,the anesthesia, and the organization of the day care unit,
   whereas lengthy operative trauma leading to intraoperative blood loss
   also plays a major role.}},

   100, 200 and 300 kg/ha/year N, and the PK levels were 0, 500, 1000 and
   1500 kg/ha/10 years P2O5 and K2O, applied in the form of calcium
   ammonium nitrate, superphosphate and 50\% potassium chloride.
   Replenishment fertilisation with P and K was carried out when the
   experiment was set up in autumn 1973. The plot size was 6 x 6 = 36 m(2)
   and the forecrop was 2 years of maize. The groundwater depth was 15 m.
   The main conclusions were as follows:
   1. On this relatively humus-rich loamy soil, satisfactory N levels for
   potato can be characterised by values of 4.5-5.0\% N at the beginning of
   flowering, 3.5-4.0\% at the end of flowering and 1.5-2.0\% prior to
   harvesting in air-dry leaves, or 1.7-1.8\% N in the tubers. Satisfactory
   values of P are 0.40-0.50\% at the beginning of flowering, 0.25-0.30\%
   at the end of flowering and 0.1-0.15\% at harvest in the dry leaves, or
   0.25-0.30\% in the dry tubers. Satisfactory K supplies were reflected by
   K concentrations of 3.0-4.0\% at the beginning of flowering, 2.0-3.0\%
   at the end of flowering and 1.0-1.5 \% at harvest in dry leaves, or
   1.5-2.0\% in the tubers. These data can be used as guidelines by the
   extension service.
   2. The ratio of the major elements also gives a good reflection of the
   nutritional status of the plant and can thus be used for diagnostic
   purposes. The data suggest that the satisfactory or ``normal{''} N/P
   ratio in the dry leaves is 10-12 at the beginning of flowering, and
   12-15 at the end of flowering and at harvest. The K/P ratio of the
   foliage at flowering should be between 5 and 10.
   3. The tuber yield ranged from 13.4-32.6 t/ha in the N0P0K0-N3P3K3
   treatments. The quantity of elements taken up by the tubers + foliage
   were as follows (kg/ha): N 66-180, P2O5 25-69 K2O 55-192, CaO 46-84, MgO
   27-42, Fe and Na 2-3, Mn 0.2-0.3, Zn 0.1-0.2, Cu 0.03-0.06. The specific
   element requirements for 1 t tubers + foliage averaged 5.5 kg N, 5.3 kg
   K2O, 1.9 kg P2O5, 2.5 kg CaO and 1.4 kg MgO, and were in good agreement
   with the parameters used by the Hungarian extension service (with the
   exception of K2O, where a parameter of 9 kg/t is applied).
   4. If the foliage remains in the field, the Ca and Mg requirements
   become negligible, while the specific K requirement drops to 5-6 kg/t
   K2O, which is half that given in the literature. The specific
   requirement of 9 kg/t K2O reflects luxury K uptake, which is frequent on
   the colloid-poor, intensively fertilised soils of North-West Europe. On
   average sites in Hungary this value may lead to over-fertilisation with
   K.}},

Abstract = {{ATP synthase (FoF1) consists of F-1 (ATP-driven motor) and F-o
   (H+-driven motor). Fl is a complex of alpha (3)beta (3)gamma delta
   epsilon subunits, and gamma is the rotating cam in alpha (3)beta (3)
   Thermophilic F-1 (TF1) is exceptional in that it can be crystallized as
   a beta monomer and an alpha (3)beta (3) oligomer, and it is sufficiently
   stable to allow alpha beta refolding and reassembly of hybrid complexes
   containing 1, 2, and 3 modified ct or beta. The nucleotide dependent
   open-close conversion of conformation is an inherent property of an
   isolated beta and energy and signals are transferred through alpha/beta
   interfaces. The catalytic and noncatalytic interfaces of both
   mitochondrial F-1 (MFI) and TF1 were analyzed by an atom search within
   the limits of 0.40 nm across the alpha beta interfaces. Seven (plus
   thermophilic loop in TF1) contact areas are located at both the
   catalytic and noncatalytic interfaces on the open beta form. The number
   of contact areas on closed beta increased to 11 and 9, respectively, in
   the catalytic and noncatalytic interfaces. The interfaces in the barrel
   domain are immobile. The torsional elastic strain applied through the
   mobile areas is concentrated in hinge residues and the P-loop in beta.
   The notion of elastic energy in FoF1 has been revised. X-ray
   crystallography of F-1 is a static snap shot of one state and the
   elastic hypotheses are still inconsistent with the structure, dyamics,
   and kinetics of FoF1, The domain motion and elastic energy in FoF1 will
   be elucidated by time-resolved crystallography.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine the prevalence of identified STIs and
   recognised symptoms of STIs and their association with health status,
   substance use, and sexual risk behaviour in a sample of HIV seropositive
   men and women.
   Methods: 233 men, 112 women, and five transsexual people living with HIV
   infection completed confidential surveys. Participants were recruited
   through community based services, community health clinics, and snowball
   (chain) recruitment techniques in Atlanta, GA, USA in December 1999.
   Results: We found that (263) 78\% of participants had been sexually
   active in the previous 3 months. For the entire sample, 42 (12\%)
   participants reported an STI in the past 3 months and 40 (11\%)
   experienced symptoms of an STI without indicating a specific diagnosis
   in that time. Gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis, and newly diagnosed
   herpes simplex virus (HSV) were identified at similar rates among men,
   whereas trichomonas, gonorrhoea, and newly diagnosed HSV occurred most
   often in women. STIs were associated with substance use in men and
   women, with ``crack{''} cocaine users having the greatest likelihood of
   an STI relative to non-crack users. STIs were also associated with
   continued practice of sexual risk behaviours,
   Conclusions: This sample of people living with HIV-AIDS reported high
   rates of diagnoses and symptoms of STIs. There were significant
   associations between STIs, substance use, and continued high risk sexual
   practices in men and women. These findings support the need for studies
   that confirm prevalence of STIs using clinical laboratory tests.}},

Abstract = {{A model was developed to study the effects of a rigid debris bn
   elastohydrodynamic lubrication of rolling/sliding contacts. In order to
   achieve the objectives the time dependent Reynolds equation was modified
   to include the effects of an ellipsoidal shaped debris. The modified
   time dependent Reynolds and elasticity equations were simultaneously
   solved to determine the pressure and film thickness in EHL contacts. The
   debris force balance equation was solved to determine the debris
   velocity. The model was then used to obtain results for a variety of
   loads, speeds, and debris sizes. The results indicate that the debris
   has a significant effect on the pressure distribution and causes a dent
   on the rolling/sliding bounding surfaces. Depending on the size and
   location of the debris the pressure generated within the contact can be
   high enough to plastically deform the bounding surfaces. Debris smaller
   than the minimum film thickness do not enter the contact and only large
   and more spherical debris move toward the contact.

Abstract = {{In the wake of the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Employment
   Division v. Smith, which overturned served principles of free exercise
   jurisprudence, confusion abounds in the lower courts as to the reach and
   limitations of the Court's new test for determining the validity of free
   exercise claims. lit this Note, Carol Kaplan examines the doctrinal
   reasoning and the substantive outcomes of lower court cases. She finds
   that while some of the inconsistencies are attributable to an absence of
   details in Smith, which sketched the bare contours of a new test without
   stepping through its application, other decisions resist the
   implications of Smith, and carve out such wide exceptions from its rule
   as to render it almost redundant. To address this problem, Kaplan first
   discusses the policy and jurisprudential goals that underlie the Smith
   decision. She then proposes a doctrinal model for the Smith test that
   furthers those goals by articulating the steps of the neutral, generally
   applicable analysis and delineating the boundaries of the exceptions to
   Smith. Kaplan concludes that Smith serves a bifurcated function that, on
   the one hand, seeks to ensure parity in the civil obligations of
   religious and secular citizens, while on the other, offers a tool for
   rooting out instances of legislative discrimination against religion and
   mandates that judges apply strict scrutiny to decisions by unselected
   administrative officials that impact upon the daily lives of all
   citizens.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Lymphangiomatous polyps are uncommon benign tumors of the
   tonsils. Methods: Twenty-six cases of lymphangiomatous polyps diagnosed
   between 1980 and 1999 were retrieved from the files of the
   Otorhinolaryngic-Head and Neck Tumor Registry of the Armed Forces
   Institute of Pathology. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides were
   reviewed to characterize the histologic features of these tumors.
   Immunohistochemical stains were performed on 15 cases. Clinical
   follow-up data were obtained. Results: The patients included 13 males
   and 13 females, ages 3 to 63 years (mean, 25.2 years). Patients
   experienced dysphagia, sore throat, and the sensation of a mass in the
   throat. Symptoms were present from a few weeks to years. The tonsillar
   masses were unilateral in all cases. Clinically, the lesions were
   frequently mistaken for a neoplasm (n = 18 patients). Grossly, all of
   the lesions were polypoid and measured 0.5 to 3.8 cm (mean, 1.6 cm),
   Histologically, the polyps were covered by squamous epithelium showing
   variable epithelial hyperplasia, dyskeratosis, and lymphocytic epithelio
   tropism. The masses showed a characteristic submucosal proliferation of
   small to medium-sized, endothelial-lined, lymph-vascular channels
   lacking features of malignancy. Collagen, smooth muscle, and adipose
   tissue were present in the stroma Intravascular proteinaceous fluid and
   lymphocytes were noted. Immunohistochemical findings confirmed the
   endothelial origin of the vascular proliferation and a mixed lymphoid
   population. The differential diagnosis included fibroepithelial polyp,
   lymphangioma, juvenile angiofibroma, and squamous papilloma In all
   patients with follow-up, complete surgical excision was curative (mean
   follow-up, 5.4 years; range, 1 mo to 14 years). Conclusions: We detail
   the clinical and pathologic features of tonsillar lymphangiomatous
   polyps, These tumors are uncommon and may clinically be mistaken for a
   malignant neoplasm, The characteristic histologic features should allow
   for its correct diagnosis and differentiation from similar appearing
   tonsillar lesions.}},

Abstract = {{We address the question of how a firm's current location in the space of
   technological possibilities constrain its search for technological
   improvements. We formalize a quantitative notion of distance between
   technologies - encompassing the distinction between evolutionary changes
   (small distance) versus revolutionary change (large distance)- and
   introduce a technology landscape into an otherwise standard dynamic
   programming setting where the optimal strategy is to assign a
   reservation price to each possible technology. Technological search is
   modeled as movement, constrained by the cost of search, on a technology
   landscape. Simulations are presented on a stylized technology landscape
   while analytic results are derived using landscapes that are similar to
   Markov random fields. We find that early in the search for technological
   improvements, if the initial position is poor or average, it is optimal
   to search far away on the technology landscape; but as the firm succeeds
   in finding technological improvements it is optimal to confine search to
   a local region of the landscape. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that
   primarily infects immunocompromised individuals and patients with cystic
   fibrosis. Using a tissue culture system, invasive strains of P.
   aeruginosa were discovered to induce apoptosis at high frequency in HeLa
   and other epithelial and fibroblast cell sines. This apoptotic phenotype
   in the infected cells was determined by several criteria including (i)
   visual changes in cell morphology, (ii) induction of chromatin
   condensation and nuclear marginalization, (iii) the presence of a high
   percentage of cells with subG1 DNA content, and (iv) activation of
   caspase-3 activity. Induction of the type III secretion machinery, but
   not invasion of P. aeruginosa is required for induction of apoptosis.
   The apoptosis phenotype is independent of the cytoskeletal
   rearrangements that occur in the host cell early after infection.
   Mutants in P. aeruginosa exoS fail to induce apoptosis and
   complementation with wild-type exoS restored the apoptosis-inducing
   capacity, demonstrating that ExoS is the effector molecule. Analysis of
   exoS activity mutants shows that the ADP-ribosylating capacity of ExoS
   is essential for inducing the apoptotic pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives-To examine the motor performance of the hand in a sample of
   patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
   Subjects-The patient group comprised 21 (two men, 19 women) patients
   with RA. Twenty one control subjects matched for age and sex were
   selected from a larger reference group, which had been drawn from the
   local population.
   Methods-The measured motor performance aspects were simple reaction
   time, choice reaction time, speed of movement, finger tapping speed, and
   coordination (that is, speed of movement/accuracy). Results were
   compared for age and sex matched pairs. The measurements were made with
   the Human Performance Measurement/Basic Elements of Performance system,
   which is a multifunctional system designed to measure different motor
   aspects of the hands, including reaction time, movement speed, tapping
   speed, and coordination.
   Results-A comparison of the results for the patient and control groups
   indicated that the motor functions of patients with RA were impaired in
   all the measured aspects (with the exception of the index finger tapping
   test). The difference between the groups varied between 11\% and 21\%
   for the reaction time tasks, between 12\% and 18\% for the speed of
   movement tasks, and between 15\% and 17\% for the coordination task.
   Conclusion-Based on the results of our research, it seems that RA
   decreases some motor performance functions of the hand expressed as
   simple reaction time, choice reaction time, speed of movement, and
   coordination. The changes were emphasised in movements performed with
   several joints.}},

Abstract = {{Residential electrical wiring safety practices in the US result in the
   possibility of a small voltage (up to a few tenths of a volt) on
   appliance surfaces with respect to water pipes or other grounded
   surfaces. This ``open circuit voltage{''} (V-OC) will cause ``contact
   current{''} to flow in a person who touches the appliance and completes
   an electrical circuit to ground. This paper presents data suggesting
   that contact current due to V-OC is an exposure that may explain the
   reported associations of residential magnetic fields with childhood
   leukemia. Our analysis is based on a computer model of a 40 house
   (single-unit, detached dwelling) neighborhood with electrical service
   that is representative of US grounding practices. The analysis was
   motivated by recent research suggesting that the physical location of
   power lines in the backyard, in contrast to the street, may be relevant
   to a relationship of power lines with childhood leukemia. In the model,
   the highest magnetic field levels and V(OC)s were both associated with
   backyard lines, and the highest V(OC)s were also associated with long
   ground paths in the residence. Across the entire neighborhood, magnetic
   field exposure was highly correlated with V-OC (r = 0.93). Dosimetric
   modeling indicates that, compared to a very high residential level of a
   uniform horizontal magnetic field (10 mu T) or a vertical electric field
   (100 V/m), a modest level of contact current (similar to 18 mu A) leads
   to considerably greater induced electric fields (>1 mV/m) averaged
   across tissue, such as bone marrow and heart. The correlation of V-OC
   with magnetic fields in the model, combined with the dose estimates,
   lead us to conclude that V-OC is a potentially important exposure with
   respect to childhood leukemia risks associated with residential magnetic
   fields. These findings, nonetheless, may not apply to residential
   service used in several European countries or to the Scandinavian
   studies concerned with populations exposed to magnetic fields from
   overhead transmission lines.

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: Rhinosinusitis is a common disease affecting an estimated
   14\% of the population. Although there is general agreement in the
   literature regarding acute rhinosinusitis, chronic rhinosinusitis is not
   as well studied, and no consensus has been reached regarding the
   bacterial etiology. The goal of this study was to test chronic
   rhinosinusitis mucosal specimens using the polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) for aerobic bacterial content and to compare the results with
   standard culture data.
   RESULTS: Routine culture samples grew 50\% aerobic bacteria, whereas PCR
   detected 62\% aerobic bacteria contamination.
   CONCLUSION: PCR detected more bacteria in mucosal samples than in
   standard culture, but standard culture of this mucosa reflects the
   general aerobic bacteria found in chronic rhinosinusitis, with no
   predominant species of aerobic bacteria.
   SIGNIFICANCE: The analysis of chronic rhinosinusitis mucosa with the PCR
   method should give a more accurate picture of the bacteria found in
   chronic rhinosinusitis so that proper therapy can be instituted.}},

Title = {{Identification of neonatal hearing impairment: Ear-canal measurements of

Journal = {{EAR AND HEARING}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{443-461}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: 1) To describe broad bandwidth measurements of acoustic
   admittance (Y) and energy reflectance (R) in the ear canals of neonates.
   2) To describe a means for evaluating when a YR response is valid. 3) To
   describe the relations between these YR measurements and age, gender,
   left/right ear, and selected risk factors.
   Design: YR responses were obtained at four test sites in well babies
   without risk indicators, well babies with at least one risk indicator,
   and graduates of neonatal intensive care units. YR responses were
   measured using a chirp stimulus at moderate levels over a frequency
   range from 250 to 8000 Hz. The system was calibrated based on
   measurements in a set of cylindrical tubes. The probe assembly was
   inserted in the ear canal of the neonate, and customized software was
   used for data acquisition.
   Results: YR responses were measured in over 4000 ears, and half of the
   responses were used in exploratory data analyses. The particular YR
   variables chosen for analysis were energy reflectance, equivalent volume
   and acoustic conductance. Based on the view that unduly large negative
   equivalent volumes at low frequencies were physically impossible, it was
   concluded that approximately 13\% of the YR responses showed evidence of
   improper probe seal in the ear canal. To test how these outliers
   influenced the overall pattern of YR responses, analyses were conducted
   both on the full data set (N = 2081) and the data set excluding outliers
   (N = 1825). The YR responses averaged over frequency varied with
   conceptional age (conception to date of test), gender, left/right ear,
   and selected risk factors; in all cases, significant effects were
   observed more frequently in the data set excluding outliers. After
   excluding outliers and controlling for conceptional age effects, the
   dichotomous risk factors accounting for the greatest variance in the YR
   responses were, in rank, order, cleft lip and palate, aminoglycoside
   therapy, low birth weight, history of ventilation, and low APGAR scores.
   In separate analyses, YR responses varied in the first few days after
   birth. An analysis showed that the use of a YR test criterion to assess
   the quality of probe seal may help control the false-positive rate in
   evoked otoacoustic emission testing.
   Conclusions: This is the first report of wideband YR responses in
   neonates. Data were acquired in; a few seconds, but the responses are
   highly sensitive to whether the probe is fully sealed in the ear canal.
   A real-time acoustic test of probe fit is proposed to better address the
   probe seal problem. The YR responses provide information on middle-ear
   status that varies over the neonatal age range and that is sensitive to
   the presence or absence of risk factors, ear, and gender differences.
   Thus, a YR test may have potential for use in neonatal screening tests
   for hearing loss.}},

Abstract = {{American Indians have the highest smoking rate of all major
   racial/ethnic groups in the US, despite significant variation across
   tribes and regions of the country. Yet, little research has been
   conducted on smoking initiation among American Indian adolescents. In an
   effort to identify the mechanisms through which families influence teen
   smoking, both positively and negatively, 20 focus groups were conducted
   with 144 non-reservation American Indian teens in Oklahoma. Findings
   indicated that most of the antismoking messages from family members mere
   given by parents and grandparents, and focused on the long-term health
   consequences of smoking and addiction. Parental responses to teen
   smoking varied widely; with some responses sending mixed messages to the
   teens. Many teens discussed obtaining their first cigarette in a family
   setting and the teens felt that having smokers in their families
   influenced them to try smoking. Teens were able to discuss the
   traditional role of tobacco in their culture and were aware of its
   presence at Indian events, but felt ceremonial and traditional use was
   distinct from recreational use. Additional research is necessary to
   assess whether these results are generalizable to other tribes and

Abstract = {{To increase understanding of persistent pulmonary hypertension, we
   examined chronic pulmonary effects of hypoxia at birth and their
   relationships with immunoreactive levels of the potent vasodilator,
   calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Rats were born in 10\% hypobaric
   hypoxia, where they remained for 1-2 days, or in 15\% hypoxia, where
   they remained for 21 days. All were then reared in normoxia for 3 mo
   followed by reexposure to 10\% hypoxia for 7 days (H-->H) or continued
   normoxia (H-->N); age-matched normoxic rats were hypoxic for the last 7
   days (N-->H) or normoxic throughout (N-->N). Results are as follows.
   Pulmonary arterial pressure (P-PA) in 10\% H-->N rats was normal at the
   end of the experiment (13 wk), but in rats reexposed to hypoxia (H-->H),
   pressure rose to 19\% above N-->H controls. In 15\% H-->N rats, P-PA
   remained high, similar to that of N-->H rats, and increased further by
   40\% on reexposure (H-->H). Medial thickness of small pulmonary arteries
   in 10\% H-->H rats also increased by 40\% over N-->H controls and was
   equally high in 15\% H-->N and H-->H rats. In N-->H rats from both
   experiments, right ventricular hypertrophy index (RVH) was increased
   after hypoxia at 15-16 wk. Also, in the 15\% study, RVH remained
   elevated in H-->N rats and increased in H-->H rats by 19\% above N-->H
   controls. Blood CGRP was reduced by neonate and adult hypoxia, and
   hypoxic reexposure (H-->H) further lowered blood CGRP in the 15\% but
   not 10\% study. Declining left ventricular blood CGRP correlated highly
   with logarithmically increasing P-PA in the 15\% study (r = -0.81, P =
   0.000). In conclusion, 1) short perinatal exposure to 10\% O-2
   exacerbated pulmonary hypertension with hypoxia later in life, 2) 15\%
   O-2 at birth and for 21 days caused persistent pulmonary hypertension
   and exacerbation with reexposure, and 3) P-PA correlated highly with
   declining blood CGRP levels in the 15\% study.}},

Title = {{Grammatically relevant and grammatically irrelevant features of verb

Journal = {{APHASIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{997-1020}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{According to the `grammatically relevant semantic subsystem' hypothesis
   proposed by Pinker (1989), the meanings of verbs contain two different
   types of information: (1) a restricted set of semantic features that are
   visible to grammar and that influence the syntactic argument structure
   possibilities of verbs; and (2) an open-ended set of idiosyncratic
   perceptual and conceptual features that are not visible to grammar and
   that enable verbs to encode all kinds of subtle distinctions involving
   manner of motion, change of state, and so forth. If these two components
   of verb meaning reside at different levels of mental representation, as
   the hypothesis maintains, then it is possible that they could be
   independently disrupted by brain damage. This paper reports a series of
   experiments that confirmed this prediction.
   Three brain-damaged subjects exhibited different performance profiles on
   two tests that evaluated their knowledge of grammatically relevant and
   grammatically irrelevant components of verb meaning. 1978JB and 1962RR
   performed well, but 2011SS performed poorly, on a word-picture matching
   test that required them to discriminate between verb triplets that
   differed only with respect to subtle, grammatically irrelevant
   perceptual and conceptual features-e.g., spill-pour-sprinkle. In
   contrast, 1978JB and 1962RR performed poorly, but 2011SS performed well,
   on a second test that required them to judge the grammaticality of
   sentences containing the very same verbs-e.g., Sam spilled beer on his
   pants vs. {*}Sam spilled his pants wi th beer. Linguistic analyses have
   shown that the grammaticality of these sentences depends on the
   compatibility between certain semantic features of the verbs and the
   inherent semantic content of the grammatical constructions. Finally, all
   of the subjects performed well on a third test that required them to
   judge the grammaticality of sentences that have purely syntactic
   violations. Taken together, these results suggest that 1978JB and 1962RR
   have a disorder that selectively involves the level of grammatically
   relevant semantic structure, whereas 2011SS has a disorder that
   selectively involves grammatically irrelevant aspects of verb meaning.
   This study therefore supports the hypothesis that grammatically relevant
   and grammatically irrelevant components of verb meaning are segregated
   in the mind/ brain.}},

Abstract = {{Although simulator sickness is known to increase with protracted
   exposure and to diminish with repeated sessions, limited systematic
   research has been performed in these areas. This study reviewed the few
   studies with sufficient information available to determine the
   effect-that exposure duration and repeated exposure have on motion
   sickness. This evaluation confirmed that longer exposures produce more
   symptoms and that total sickness subsides over repeated exposures.
   Additional evaluation was performed to investigate the precise form of
   this relationship and to determine whether the same form was
   generalizable across varied simulator environments. The results
   indicated that exposure duration and repeated exposures are
   significantly linearly related to sickness outcomes (duration being
   positively related and repetition negatively related to total sickness).
   This was true over diverse systems and large subject pools. This result
   verified the generalizability of-the relationships among sickness,
   exposure duration, and repeated exposures. Additional research is
   indicated to determine the optimal length of a single exposure and the
   optimal intersession interval to facilitate adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{In von Willebrand disease (VWD) type 1 and mild haemophilia A patients
   we studied the effect of an infusion of DDAVP (0.3 mu g/kg body weight)
   on thrombin generation in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-poor
   plasma (PPP). Baseline thrombin generation in PRP was diminished both in
   the haemophilia A and vWD patients. It was normal in vWD plasma when
   sufficient procoagulant phospholipids were present, tither via adding
   phospholipid vesicles to PPP or via scrambling of the platelet membrane
   with ionomycin in PRP. In haemophilia A plasma, thrombin generation did
   not normalize by providing procoagulant phospholipids. Treatment with
   DDAVP temporarily restored thrombin generation in PRP to normal in both
   diseases.
   To investigate the individual roles of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and
   factor VIII. we also studied the effect of factor VIII infusion on
   thrombin generation in a severe haemophilia patient. It appears that tit
   a fixed normal VWF concentration, <25\% factor VIII is sufficient for
   normal thrombin generation in PRP. At a sufficient factor VIII
   concentration, however, thrombin generation is still lower than normal
   in VWD patients: similar to 40\% of VWF is required for half-normal
   thrombin generation in PRP.
   It thus appears that VWF is also a clotting factor, in the sense that it
   is required for normal thrombin generation. This underlines the
   importance of the interaction between coagulation and thr platelets in
   normal haemostasis. Thrombin generation in PRP appears to be a suitable
   test to reflect the combined function.}},

Abstract = {{The magnetic field dependence of the Josephson current of a Josephson
   tunnel junction whose shape was a normal distribution is analyzed for
   superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) photon detector applications. It
   was found that the Josephson current of a normal distribution junction

   of exp(-B-2), while a conventional rectangular STJ exhibits the
   well-known Fraunhofer pattern of sin x/x. Numerical calculations show
   that the Josephson current of the normal distribution junction fan be
   suppressed by an external magnetic field that is one tenth of that
   needed for conventional rectangular junctions. Calculations of a normal
   distribution junction approximated with a 1 mum mesh also show that the
   Josephson current is sufficiently suppressed by a small magnetic field.
   The effect of the misalignment of the angle between the junction and the
   magnetic field was evaluated. It was found that for a
   normal-distribution-shaped junction, misalignment of the magnetic field
   is allowed within +/-5 degrees, suppressing the Josephson effect by two
   orders of magnitude more than that of a rectangular junction.}},

   incorporated in PVC-based membranes provide enhanced NH4+ selectivities
   over alkali metal cations, especially over Na+, compared to those of the
   nonactin-doped membranes: for example, the selectivity coefficients, log
   K-NH4+J(POT) (J = Li+, Na+, K+), for the 2-nitrophenyloctyl ether (NPOE)
   plasticized PVC membranes doped with the hexyl chain-substituted TDB18C6

Volume = {{37}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that the CD1 family of proteins present
   various glycolipid antigens to subsets of T cells. CD1d is expressed on
   human intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and exists in two biochemical
   forms: 37-kDa, beta2-microglobulin (beta 2m) independent,
   nonglycosylated, and 47-kDa, beta 2m dependent, glycosylated forms. The
   biosynthetic pathways and the mechanisms of generation of these two
   biochemically distinct forms of CD1d in human IEC are unknown. Using a
   human colonic cell line, T84, transfected with CD1d, the biosynthesis of
   CD1d was investigated. Pulse-chase metabolic labeling studies of T84
   transfected with wild type CD1d demonstrated that CD1d was a stable
   protein over a 4-day chase period. During the first 24 h of the chase, a
   novel 65-kDa glycoprotein was co-immunoprecipitated with CD1d.
   Microsequencing of this protein identified the glycoprotein as the alpha
   and beta subunits of the resident endoplasmic reticulum protein,
   prolyl-4-hydroxylase (P4H), an enzyme responsible for hydroxyl
   modification of proline residues. To study if either one or both
   biochemical forms of CD1d contained hydroxyproline residues, amino acid
   composition analysis of the 37 and 48 kDa was performed, and
   demonstrated that only the 37-kDa, but not the 48-kDa form of CD1d,
   contained hydroxyproline residues. These studies demonstrate that CD1d
   exhibits a prolonged association with P4H and that the 37-kDa form
   contains hydroxyproline residues. This suggests that P4H association
   with CD1d during its biosynthesis results in a novel post-translational
   modification of CD1d. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the diagnostic role of Tc-99m-tetrofosmin in
   the detection of primary breast cancer and axillary lymph node
   metastasis and to compare the findings with those of Tc-99m-MIBI.
   Methods: Forty-eight patients with clinically palpable masses or
   abnormal radiologic findings had Tc-99m-MIBI and Tc-99m-tetrofosmin
   scintimammographies (SMMs) after intravenous injections of 925 MBq of
   radiopharmaceuticals. The SMMs were correlated with histopathologic
   findings. Results: Thirty-three patients were diagnosed with breast
   cancer and 15 patients with benign breast diseases. The number of true
   positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative cases of
   Tc-99m-tetrofosmin SMM were 31, 10, 5, and 2, respectively. The
   sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative
   predictive value of Tc-99m-tetrofosmin SMM were 93.9, 66.7, 86.1 and
   73.3\%, respectively. The number of true positive, true negative, false
   positive, and false negative cases of Tc-99m-MIBI SMM was 29, 10, 5, and
   4, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
   value, and negative predictive value of 99mTc-MIBI SMM were 87.8, 66.7,
   85.3 and 73.3\%, respectively. In assessment of axillary lymph node
   involvement, Tc-99m-tetrofosmin SMM demonstrated 31.8, 100, 100, and
   42.3\% sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive
   values, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of Tc-99m-MIBI SMM
   was 22.7 and 100\%. Positive and negative predictive values were 100 and
   39.3\%, respectively. One patient was false negative in both Tc-99m-MIBI
   and Tc-99m-tetrofosmin SMMs with a tumor size of 0.5 cm. Conclusion:
   Tc-99m-tetrofosmin and Tc-99m-MIBI SMMs were noninvasive and useful in
   the detection of primary breast cancer and Tc-99m tetrofosmin was
   comparable to Tc-99m-MIBI in the detection of primary breast cancer.
   However, both radiopharmaceuticals had limited values in the assessment
   of axillary lymph node involvement. Copyright (C) 2001 S.Karger AG,

Abstract = {{This study investigated the influence of the high tidal range on the
   polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels and the compositional
   characteristics in the sediments of the North Incheon Harbor basin,
   Korea. The results indicated that the high tidal range could induce
   complicated effects on the distribution and the compositional
   characteristics of PCBs. Significant differences in the total PCB
   concentration were found between the tidal and subtidal zones. Higher
   total PCBs in the tidal zone established a total PCB gradient in a
   transversal direction along the harbor basin. The large tidal range
   created tidal currents strong enough to grade the sediment particles,
   establishing a gradient of total PCBs corresponding to an observed
   sediment particle size along the longitudinal direction of the basin.
   Heterogeneous congener patterns were observed in some parts of the tidal
   zone where diverse physicochemical and microbiological conditions ale to
   be expected. However. tidally driven, active sediment transport promoted
   spatial homogeneity in the congener pattern. Sedimentation rate of
   suspended solids appeared to overwhelm any induced heterogeneity in the
   PCB congener pattern. Consequently, the congener pattern within the
   harbor basin was fairly uniform and similar to that of a dominant input
   source.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study together with the preceding study (Kimura et al.,
   Biomed. Res. 21(3), 145-163, 2000) is to reveal the sequential barrier
   of host-defense factors to experimental acute pulmonary infection of
   mice with murine cytomegalovirus. Time course of virus load in lungs
   following an intratracheal inoculation with the virus was divided into 4
   phases: the inoculum-decreasing, phase I (0 h post-infection (p.i.)-18h
   p.i.), the virus-load increasing, phase II (24h p.i.-48h p.i.), the
   plateau of virus-load, phase III (2d p.i.-14d p.i.), and the slow
   virus-clearance, phase IV (14d p.i.-24d-28d p.i). The viral-antigen
   producing cells were detectable in phase III exclusively in the cavity
   side of alveoli in the histological sections of lungs. There was no
   histologically detectable inflammation both in the alveolar cavity and
   in the interstitium of the lungs. The number of T cells recoverable from
   lungs increased only to a small extent both in whole lungs and in the
   bronchoalveolar space. CD8(+) T cells isolated from whole lungs during
   the period of time spanning 5d p.i.-21d p.i. however, had a
   readily-detectable immediate ex vivo CTL activity specific to the known
   dominant epitope in the immediately early gene product of the virus and
   a fraction of 20-40\% of CD8(+) T cells were producing IFN-gamma. The
   results of in vivo cell-depletion and cytokine-depletion experiments
   suggest that each of CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells alone play a role
   in the slow but substantial reduction of virus load in the lungs and
   that IFN-gamma also plays an antiviral role in phase IV. The results of
   double depletion experiments suggest that CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T
   cells synergistically play roles in prevention of a progressive increase
   in virus load in lungs beyond the plateau caused by expansion of the
   infection sites in the alveolar cavities and by infection of the
   interstitium of the lung. Taking together with the results of the
   preceding study, we suggest the frame of the sequential barrier to the
   primary pulmonary infection with the virus as follows. Phase I, alveolar
   macrophages; phase II, alveolar macrophages; the early phase III,
   alveolar macrophages; the late phase III, alveolar macrophages, CD8(+) T
   cells alone, and CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells in combination; and
   phase IV, CB4(+) T cells alone, CD8(+) T cells alone, and CD4(+) T cells
   and CD8(+) T cells in combination. We suggest that, in defense against
   infection of the lung with a slowly-reproducing and mildly-cytotoxic
   virus like murine cytomegalovirus, a nonspecific defense factor with a
   low tissue-toxicity like macrophages plays more important role than an
   antigen-specific and clonal-expansion dependent defense factor like T
   cells, in order to avoid a life-threatening obstruction of normal
   functioning of the lung due to long-lasting inflammation.}},

   eastern Hudson Bay. A further 115-148 beluga whales were seen near the
   coast of eastern Hudson Bay during the coastal survey, but mostly away
   from traditionally used estuaries. The estimate for James Bay was nearly
   three times the previous estimate, made in 1985,; possibly because ice
   cover in James Bay was much lower in 1993 than in the 1985 survey. The
   1993 estimate for eastern Hudson Bay was close to that for 1985. No
   beluga whales were seen during aerial transects in Ungava Bay, but they
   were seen off-transect and on coastal flights, mostly in or near the
   Whale River estuary in southern Ungava Bay. The largest group sighted
   and the greatest number seen in any day consisted of 20 individuals, a
   minimum size for the summer population in Ungava Bay. An upper 90\%
   confidence limit for summer numbers is imprecisely estimated at 150.
   Neither the coastal surveys nor the land-based observations in Hudson
   Bay and Ungava Bay indicated the presence of large, dense herds that
   might have been inefficiently sampled by transect survey.}},

Abstract = {{A modified sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using
   biotin-streptavidin system (BS-ELISA) was developed to determine levels
   of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in serum samples of children
   infected with dengue virus (n = 99) and healthy controls (n = 41). The
   minimum detectable concentration of TNF-alpha by the BS-ELISA was 3.3
   pg/ml. The mean TNF-alpha level was highest in those patients with
   dengue shock syndrome (DSS) or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) grade III
   (37.44 +/- 42.0 pg/ml). Lower levels were found in DHF grade I (28.44
   +/- 42.7 pg/ml), DHF grade II (24.21 +/- 25.4 pg/ml) and dengue fever
   (DF) (14.10 +/- 24.0 pg/ml). TNF-alpha in the sera of DF and DHF
   patients could be detected on days 2-6 after the onset of fever, the
   high level occuring on day 5. TNF-alpha was detected in 41.4\% (24.01
   +/- 35.2 pg/ml) of dengue virus infected patients and 7.3\% (4.2 +/-
   15.6 pg/ml) of control subjects. The sera of patients contained
   significantly higher levels of TNF-alpha than the sera of controls,
   P-value < 0.001. DHF patients had significantly higher levels of
   TNF-alpha than DF patients (P-value = 0.020) but no difference in the
   TNF-alpha levels from sera of DHF grades I-III patients was observed
   (P-value = 0.295). The results indicate that the BS-ELISA is a very
   sensitive method for determining TNF-alpha in serum samples of DF and
   DHF patients. The TNF-alpha levels might be associated with dengue virus
   infection and related to disease severity of DHF. (C) 2000 Published by

Abstract = {{Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) provides direct depiction of coronary
   artery anatomy, including plaque and vessel area, which is important in
   quantitative studies on the progression or regression of coronary artery
   disease. Traditionally, these studies have relied on manual evaluation,
   which is laborious, time consuming, and subject to large interobserver
   and intraobserver variability. A new technique, called active surface
   segmentation, alleviates these limitations and makes strides toward
   routine analyses. However, for three-dimensional (3-D) plaque assessment
   or 3-D reconstruction to become a clinical reality, methods must be
   developed which can analyze many images quickly, Presented is a
   comparison between two active surface techniques for three-dimensional
   segmentation of luminal and medial-adventitial borders, The
   force-acceleration technique and the neighborhood-search technique
   accurately detected both borders in vivo (r(2) = 0.95 and 0.99,
   Williams' index = 0.67 and 0.65, and r(2) = 0.95 and 0.99, WI = 0.67 and
   0.70, respectively). However, the neighborhood-search technique was
   significantly faster and required less computation. Volume calculations
   for both techniques (r(2) = 0.99 and r(2) = 0.99) also agreed with a
   known-volume phantom. Active surface segmentation allows 3-D assessment
   of coronary morphology and further developments with this technology
   will provide clinical analysis tools.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to try and outline the complexity of rural
   development processes that specifically relate to the phenomenon of
   multifunctionality. `Multifunctionality schemes' are introduced as a
   means for visualizing the complex interrelationships in rural
   development processes and to `map' the functional relationships and
   specific reconfigurations in the use of resources such as land, labour,
   knowledge and nature that underlie them. In the discussion, reference is
   made to case studies from the IMPACT research programme. The Rhongold
   case is used to illustrate how ME-schemes can help to define micro-macro
   relations and facilitate their quantification. Several conceptual issues
   are addressed in relation to the translation of farm data to the
   regional level, indirect multiplier effects, substitution effects and
   the importance of synergy. Methodological complications are seen in
   problems associated with the acceptance of a paradigm shift; the
   inadequacy of available regional, national and European data sets; the
   complex nature of micro-macro relations; the difficulty of defining
   boundaries and reference systems; and the struggle with time, scale and
   space as critical modifiers of reality. The need to link the dimensions
   of agricultural and rural change demands a more multidisciplinary,
   holistic approach to analysis and conceptualization.}},

Abstract = {{Differentiation of primary villous cytotrophoblasts into syncytia is
   associated with increasing production of alpha and beta human CG
   subunits, which is predominantly governed at the level of messenger RNA
   expression. Here, we present a detailed study on the mechanisms involved
   in the differentiation-dependent regulation of the trophoblast-specific
   CG alpha gene promoter. Site-directed mutations in each of the five
   DNA-elements of the composite enhancer were performed to investigate the
   contribution of the individual regulatory sequences to the overall
   transcriptional activity of the promoter at two different stages of
   trophoblast in vitro differentiation. We show that deletion of one
   cyclic AMP response element (CRE) did not affect CG alpha promoter
   activity in cytotrophoblasts; however, it reduced transcription by 33\%
   in differentiating cultures. Removal of both CREs almost abolished
   transcription at early and later stages of in vitro differentiation.
   Upon mutation the enhancer elements alpha ACT, JRE, and CCAAT
   significantly decreased luciferase reporter transcription; however their
   contribution to the total promoter activity did not change during in
   vitro differentiation. Contrary to that, mutated TSE diminished promoter
   activity by 19\% during 12 and 48 h of cultivation but reduced
   luciferase expression by 78\% between 48 and 84 h of differentiation. In
   electrophoretic mobility shift, assay, the TSE interacted with
   activating protein (AP)-2 alpha in both primary trophoblasts and
   choriocarcinoma cells. While CRE-interacting proteins were detectable 12
   h after isolation, the TSE-binding complex did not appear before 36 h of
   in vitro differentiation. During syncytium formation increasing protein
   expression of activating transcription factor (ATF)-1, cAMP response
   element-binding protein (CREB)-1, and AP-2 alpha was observed on Western
   blots. Moreover, phosphorylated CREB-1 and ATF-1 accumulated between 24
   and 78 h of trophoblast cultivation. By fluorescence
   immunohistochemistry, we show that CREB-1 was predominantly expressed in
   syncytiotrophoblasts, whereas ATF-1 and AP-2 alpha localized to the
   syncytium and some cytototrophoblasts as well as to stromal and
   endothelial cells of the placental villus. Phosphorylated CREB-1/ATF-1
   and the coactivator protein CBP were primarily detected in syncytial
   nuclei, suggesting the presence of functional, cAMP-dependent
   transcriptional complexes in the differentiated tissue. In agreement to
   the in, vivo situation, phosphorylated CREB-1/ATF-1 were observed in
   nuclei of the differentiated trophoblast cultures. The activity of the
   CG alpha promoter as well as CREB-1/ATF-1 phosphorylation increased upon
   elevation of cAMP levels and overexpression of the catalytic subunit of
   protein kinase A. Additionally, we demonstrate that overproduction of
   the enzyme enhanced protein expression and binding of AP-2 alpha to the
   TSE. We conclude that differentiation-dependent transcription of the CG
   alpha gene in villous trophoblasts is mainly governed by increasing
   expression of AP-2a and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of CREB-1 and
   ATF-1.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To investigate the function and pathogenicity of HRG4, a

   METHODS. HRG4 was screened for mutations in patients with various

   based on a mutation found.
   RESULTS. A heterozygous premature termination codon mutation was found
   in a 57-year-old woman with late-onset cone-rod dystrophy. In some
   transgenic mice carrying the identical mutation, age-dependent fundus
   lesions developed accompanied by electroretinographic changes consistent
   with defects in photoreceptor synaptic transmission (depressed b-wave,
   normal c-wave), and retinal degeneration occurred with marked synaptic
   and possible transsynaptic degeneration.
   CONCLUSIONS. HRG4, the only synaptic protein known to be highly enriched
   in photoreceptor ribbon synapses, is now shown to be pathogenic when

Abstract = {{With a middle-sized tandem accelerator of the multipurpose facility of
   the University of Tokyo we have developed an AMS system to perform
   multi-nuclide AMS. Starting with Be-10- and Al-26-AMS
   development,C-14-AMS has been also developed modifying the gas stripper,
   the injection system, the ion source and so on. The newly designed gas
   ionization chamber lowered the background level for the detection of
   Be-10 and Al-26 by more than one order of magnitude. C-14-AMS is now
   precise enough for practical use, though the repeatability is not better
   than +/-0.7\%. However, more time is still necessary until our C-14-AMS
   will run stable with good precision of better than +/-0.5\%. A gas
   filled magnet (GFM) and a TOF system have been developed successfully
   for the detection of Cl-36 and I-129, respectively. Researches on
   Ni-59-AMS system by using the inverse PIXE technique are now underway
   and Ca-41 will be the next target for MALT-AMS. (C) 2000 Elsevier

   Arabis (Boechera) species. The genus Arabis is polyphyletic-some
   unrelated species appear within this taxonomic classification, which has
   little phylogenetic meaning. Fossil pollen data were used to compute a
   synonymous substitution rate of 1.5 X 10(-8) substitutions per site per

Abstract = {{Insecticidal effects of diflubenzuron in Dimilin 25 WP on the house fly,
   particularly on its individual developmental stages, were verified under
   laboratory conditions and in a pig delivery room and a calf house.
   Individual tests were carried out on eggs, 1(st)-, 2(nd)- and
   3(rd)-instar larvae, pupae and adult flies. The preparation was applied
   in three different ways, namely by adding to the diet for adults, to
   rearing substrate for larvae and topically to pupae. The percentage of
   live adults, hatched after the application into rearing media, is
   closely connected to the developmental stages of fly larvae and ability
   to accept the preparation through feed. The overall percentage
   hatchability ranged from 0 to 3.1. The topical application to
   3(rd)-instar larvae and pupae resulted in 3-5-fold increase in the
   hatchability of flies in dependence on the developmental stage in which
   the preparation was applied. The larvicidal effectiveness in field tests
   was in the range of 76-92\%. The results obtained in field experiments
   allow us to state that the preparation Dimilin 25 WP caused all-season
   suppression of fly populations in comparison with insect control
   preparations to which a resistance has developed in the respective
   population of flies. Its use can help to resolve to a great extent the
   problem of resistance of flies to conventional insecticides, which has
   become a crucial issue of the present day.}},

Abstract = {{The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) has
   adopted a revised set of accreditation criteria that is designed to
   ensure that graduates of accredited programs are prepared to enter the
   practice of engineering. The proposal also specifies that engineering
   programs must demonstrate that their graduates have an understanding of
   professional practice issues in addition to proficiency in specific
   subject areas that are tabulated in the civil engineering program
   criteria. The findings of this study indicate that engineering
   undergraduate and graduate students as well as practitioners perceive
   that four subject areas are of great importance for civil engineers.
   They include structural engineering, hydraulics/hydrology/water
   resources, engineering design, and mathematics through calculus and
   differential equations. In contrast, one area, chemistry, received lower
   ratings. The data suggest that the majority of subjects included in the
   civil engineering program criteria are considered by students and
   practitioners to have generally the same level of importance and should
   be included in the curriculum at an above average level. In particular,
   81\% of the subject areas included in the ABET civil engineering program
   criteria are rated by both students and practitioners with a composite
   score greater than or equal to 3.1. This may be interpreted as strong
   support for the Engineering Criteria 2000 program requirements.}},

Title = {{Dose-response and onset/offset characteristics of rapacuronium}},
Journal = {{ANESTHESIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1017-1021}},

Abstract = {{Background: A rigorous study of the dose-response relation of
   rapacuronium has, to our knowledge, yet to be performed. In addition,
   there is little information available regarding the onset or offset
   profile of rapacuronium when administered in subparalyzing doses. These
   issues necessitate further study.
   Methods: Forty-seven adult patients, American Society Anesthesiologists
   physical status I or II, were studied. Tracheal intubation was
   accomplished without muscle relaxants. Anesthesia was maintained with
   use of nitrous oxide, propofol, and alfentanil The electromyogram of the
   first dorsal interosseous muscle was measured using a monitor. Single
   stimuli at 0.10 Hz were administered. A single dose of rapacuronium was
   administered. After log-dose or logit transformation of the data, the
   best-fit line of regression was determined using the method of least
   squares. For each subject, the authors estimated the 50\% effective dose
   (ED50) and 95\% effective dose (ED95) from the Hill equation using the
   slope obtained from regression analysis. The onset times to 50 and 90\%
   of peak effect were estimated in a subset of 10 individuals in which
   peak twitch depression decreased to the range of 90-99\%.
   Results: The calculated ED50 and ED95 values for rapacuronium were 0.39
   +/- 0.08 (SD) and 0.75 +/- 0.16 mg/kg, respectively. After a single ED95
   dose, 90\% of the drug's peak effect was evident in 77 +/- 17 s. After
   this dose, rapacuronium has a clinical duration of 6.1 +/- 1.1 min.
   Conclusions: The authors found the ED95 of rapacuronium to be
   substantially less than suggested by previous estimates. Rapacuronium
   has an onset profile that is not different from that previously reported
   for succinylcholine. The rate of spontaneous recovery was faster after
   rapacuronium than the authors previously observed after mivacurium
   administration but was slower than after succinylcholine, using an
   identical protocol.}},

Abstract = {{Ligands for the estrogen receptor (ER) that have the capacity to
   selectively bind to or activate the ER subtypes ER alpha or ER beta
   would be useful in elucidating the biology of these two receptors and
   might assist in the development of estrogen pharmaceuticals with
   improved tissue selectivity. In this study, we examine three compounds
   of novel structure that act as ER subtype-selective ligands. These are a
   propyl pyrazole triol (PPT), which is a potent agonist on ER alpha but
   is inactive on ER beta, and a pair of substituted tetrahydrochrysenes
   (THC), one enantiomer of which (S,S-THC) is an agonist on both ER alpha
   and ER beta, the other (R,R-THC) being an agonist on ER alpha but an
   antagonist on ER beta. To investigate the molecular mechanisms
   underlying the ER subtype-selective actions of these compounds, we have
   determined the conformational changes induced in ER alpha and ER beta by
   these ligands using protease digestion sensitivity, and we have tested
   the ability of these ligands to promote the recruitment of
   representatives of the three SRC/p160 coactivator protein family members
   (SRC-1, GRIP-1, ACTR, respectively) to ER alpha and ER beta using yeast
   two-hybrid and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays. We find
   that the ligand-ER protease digestion pattern is distinctly different
   for stimulatory and inhibitory ligands, and that this assay, as well as
   coactivator recruitment, are excellent indicators of their
   agonist/antagonist character. Interestingly however, compared with
   estradiol, the novel agonist ligands show some quantitative differences
   in their ability to recruit SRC-1, -2, and -3. This implies that while
   generally similar to estradiol, these ligands induce ER conformations
   that differ somewhat from that induced by estradiol, differences that
   are illustrative of the nature of their biological character. The
   application of methods to characterize the conformations induced in ER
   subtypes by novel ligands, as done in this study, enables a greater
   understanding of how ligand-receptor conformations relate to estrogen
   agonist or antagonist behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Four alpha genes exist on chromosome 16, but one or more of these genes
   can be deleted in association with Hemoglobin (Hb)G-Philadelphia in cis
   to alpha-thalassemia-2 in African Americans. Therefore, the proportion
   of HbG-Philadelphia in HbG heterozygotes is trimodal at about 25\% for
   alpha(G)alpha/alpha alpha, 33\% for alpha(G)-/alpha alpha, and 50\% for
   alpha(G)-/alpha- in patients with HbA. Those who are homozygous or
   doubly heterozygous for beta chain variants (beta(X)2 or beta(X)beta(Y))
   have neither HbA nor the alpha chain variant (alpha(X)2 beta(A)2), but
   have hybrid heterodimers (alpha(X)2 beta(X)2). The proportion of hybrid
   heterodimers here should also be trimodal mirroring alpha gene status.
   Eleven patients were identified: 4 with Hb SSG, 3 with Hb SCG, and I
   each with Hb OCG, HbSSMontgomery, HbSSChicago, and HbSSBourmedes.
   Heterodimer proportions were: 43.3 +/- 1.5, 33.5 +/- 2.3, and 15.8 +/-
   1.1\% for 2, 3, and 4 respective alpha genes which had been studied in
   8/11 of the patients (r = 0.98), implying that the prime determinant of

   The present article reports on the development of the instruments and
   findings from an analysis of data on 346 clients in TC treatment;
   including scale properties and cross-sectional client differences by

   staff instruments reliably differentiate client clinical changes during
   treatment and client self-ratings are initially consistently higher than

   degradation product 5-hydroxyflorasulam (5-OH-florasulam) were
   determined as a function of temperature and moisture in three different
   soils. The half-life for degradation of florasulam ranged from 1.0 to
   8.5 days at 20-25 degreesC and from 6.4 to 85 days at 5 degreesC. The
   half-life for degradation of 5-OH-florasulam ranged from 8 to 36 days at
   20-25 degreesC and from 43 to 78 days at 5 OC. The degradation rate of
   both compounds was strongly influenced by temperature, with activation
   energies ranging from 57 to 95 kJ/mol for florasulam and from 27 to 74
   kJ/mol for 5-OH florasulam. Soil moisture content had negligible impact
   on the degradation rate. Apparent (nonequilibrium) sorption coefficients
   for florasulam and 5-OH-florasulam at 0 days after treatment (DAT) were
   0.1-0.6 L/kg and increased linearly with time for both florasulam and
   5-OH-florasulam (r(2) > 0.90) to levels as high as 12-23 L/kg. Heats of
   adsorption were calculated on one soil as a function of time. Heat of

Abstract = {{Parasites should be better at infecting hosts from sympatric populations
   than allopatric populations most of the time (parasite local
   adaptation). In a previous study of a population of snail parasites
   (Microphallus sp.) from Lake Alexandrina, New Zealand, we found that
   Microphallus was more infective to snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) in
   shallow water but not in deep water. Were, we repeated the original
   study and also monitored the development of the parasite. We found that
   parasites from shallow water were more infective to hosts from shallow
   water and developed more rapidly in these hosts. In contrast, parasites
   from deep water were not more infective to hosts from deep water and did
   not develop more rapidly in them. These results suggest clinal variation
   in the susceptibility of these snails, with shallow-water snails more
   susceptible than deep-water snails. We offer 2 possible explanations for
   these results. First, gene flow in the Microphallus population is
   primarily from shallow to deep water, leading to an asymmetric pattern
   of local adaptation. Alternatively, snails from shallow water may be
   more susceptible for reasons independent of gene flow, perhaps due to
   differences in host condition between habitats.}},

   that the information regarding the environmental impact of a firm's
   products, processes, and waste may be asymmetrically distributed between
   the firm and the community. The resultant information asymmetry may
   influence the probability of a firm acting opportunistically, and
   ultimately, a firm's ethical behavior. The paper identifies information
   asymmetry between a firm and community, as well as that within the
   community. The perceived information asymmetry across various community
   segments may perhaps be a determinant of environmental discrimination.
   The paper further contends that information asymmetry may diminish in

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Leiomyoma is a rare, benign smooth muscle tumor of the orbit. It
   occasionally shows some histologic resemblance to other common tumors of
   the orbit like neurofibroma and schwannoma. Its location at the orbital
   apex is uncommon and only one case with intracranial extension has been
   reported so far.
   CASE DESCRIPTION
   A nine-year-old boy presented to us with left orbital pain. Four years
   earlier he had undergone partial excision, elsewhere, of a tumor at the
   orbital apex, which was reported as a schwannoma. The computed
   tomography (CT) scan showed regrowth of the tumor with intracranial
   extension. The tumor was totally resected by an intracranial route. One
   year postoperatively there was no recurrence of the tumor.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Leiomyoma of the orbit, though a benign tumor, does show regrowth after
   partial excision. Total excision, including any intracranial component,
   is advised. The cases reported so far are reviewed and the
   histopathology and possible etiopathogenesis of this tumor are
   discussed. (C) 2000 by Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Background Asthma is an acute-on-chronic inflammatory disease of the
   airways characterized by recruitment of eosinophils into the epithelial
   layer, chronic inflammation in the lamina propria, as well as variable
   accumulation of mast cells in the airway wall. The role of local
   production of allergen-specific immunoglobulins in triggering mast
   cell-mediated asthmatic inflammation is unknown.
   Methods We used a chronic inhalational exposure model of asthma in
   ovalbumin-sensitized BALB/c mice to examine the phenotype of
   immunoglobulin-secreting cells and mast cells in the airway wall. In
   parallel, we assayed ovalbumin-specific IgG and total IgE in the plasma
   of these animals.
   Results In sensitized mice exposed to aerosolized ovalbumin for 6 weeks,
   aggregates of chronic inflammatory cells consisted of a majority of
   plasmacytoid cells, including numerous IgG-synthesizing cells, which
   were significantly increased in sensitized animals compared to controls.
   IgA-synthesizing cells were also present, but were not increased in the
   sensitized exposed mice. Immunoglobulins in the cytoplasm of the plasma
   cells were demonstrated to be antigen-specific. No IgM-or
   IgE-synthesizing cells were observed, although levels of total IgE in
   the plasma were significantly increased. There was no recruitment of
   mast cells of either the mucosal or the connective tissue phenotype into
   the lamina propria or the epithelium.
   Conclusion In this experimental model of chronic asthma, the pattern of
   inflammation in the airway wall is consistent with development of a
   local IgG-mediated humoral immune response. However, there is no
   evidence of local production of IgE or recruitment of mast cells.}},

Abstract = {{More than 6000 residents of Latvia were involved in recovery work in
   Chemobyl. They were healthy men exposed to substantial ionizing
   radiation (0.01-0.5 Gy). Now, these recovery workers suffer from
   ``postradiation syndrome{''}: dizziness and poor memory, headache, local
   pains, and so forth. The biochemical mechanism of ``postradiation
   syndrome{''} has not been completely established. In this Phase I study,
   we have investigated how exposure to radiation impacts antioxidative
   defense and trace element concentrations in the blood of recovery
   workers. Thirty-five patients with postradiation syndrome (men, age
   range 33-50 yr) and 15 healthy men similar in age as control subjects
   were studied for the effects on plasma chemiluminescence, the activity
   of antioxidant enzymes, and the concentration of ceruloplasmin and
   concentrations of selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) in blood.
   The results revealed that plasma chemiluminescence was significantly
   increased (3.5-fold to 5.5-fold), the activity of catalase in
   erythrocytes was significantly elevated, and the activity of glutathione
   peroxidase in plasma was significantly reduced in examined patients.
   Concentrations of Zn and Cu were significantly higher and the
   concentration of Se was lower in these patients. We conclude that the
   patients exposed to ionizing radiation have diminished blood antioxidant
   defense associated with pronounced Se deficiency and imbalance of Zn and

Abstract = {{While this Saccharomyces cerevisiae SIN4 gene product is a component of
   a mediator complex associated with RNA polymerase II, various studies
   suggest the involvement of Sin4 in the alteration of higher-order
   chromatin structure. Our previous analysis of a sin4 mutant suggested
   that the mechanisms of transcriptional repression by Sin4 (mediator) and
   the Tup1-Ssn6 complex (general repressor) are different. To elucidate
   the way in which these two repression systems are interrelated, we
   isolated mutants that exhibit enhanced transcription of a reporter gene
   harboring the upstream activation sequence (UAS), but still are subject
   to Tup1-Ssn6-mediated repression. Besides sin4 rgr1, tup1, and ssn6
   mutants, we also obtained new mutants that enhance basal transcription
   even from a core promoter without UAS, Such mutants, designated rbt for
   regulator of basal transcription, can be classified into at least six
   complementation groups, Le., four single (rbt1 to rbt4) and two
   apparently double (rbt5 rbt6 and rbt7 rbt8) mutations. The phenotype of
   rbt mutants is dependent on the TATA box and not specific to the
   integration site or kind of core promoter, No significant difference in
   micrococcal nuclease (MNase) accessibility to the core promoter of test
   genes was observed between rbt mutants and the wild-type strain,
   indicating that the higher-order chromatin structure of the core
   promoter region is not significantly altered in these mutants. The rbt1
   to rbt4 mutations are suppressed by the Delta gal11 mutation as in the
   case of the sin4 mutation, but give rise to a different profile from the
   sin4 mutation with regard to the activity of some of the promoters. From
   these observations, we suggest that RBT gene product(s) could be novel
   mediators that act with or in close association with Sin4 but have a

Abstract = {{This paper discusses oxidation of toluene and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene
   (TNT) by ozone and hydrogen peroxide mixtures (known as peroxone
   oxidation) at 25 degreesC. The overall reaction in alkaline solutions is
   first order with respect to the concentration of dissolved ozone, and is
   nearly independent of the pollutant concentrations. The oxidation of
   toluene is one-half order in hydrogen peroxide, and the rate constant
   changes in proportion to the hydroxyl ion concentration with an exponent
   of 0.67. In the pH range of 7 to 9, the TNT destruction rate increases
   with the hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl ion concentrations with
   exponents of 0.104 and 0.15 respectively. It is technically feasible to
   treat toluene and TNT contaminated waters by the peroxone oxidation
   process to achieve the residual level of a few parts per billion in
   treated waters to meet environmental requirements.}},

Abstract = {{The appearance of bottle cells at the dorsal vegetal/marginal boundary
   of Xenopus embryos marks the onset of blastopore formation. The
   conditions leading to this epithelial activity were investigated by
   inducing bottle cells ectopically in the animal region with VegT or
   different members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta family.
   Morphological studies on the ectopic bottle cells indicate their close
   similarity to the endogenous bottle cells at the dorsal blastopore lip.
   The subepithelial cells of the induced animal region express mesodermal
   genes in a pattern reminiscent to that observed on the dorsal lip.
   Relating this expression pattern to the position of the ectopic bottle
   cells leads to the conclusion that bottle cells form in regions of high
   TGF-beta signalling. The specific inhibitory effects of cerberus on
   ectopically induced bottle cells revealed that nodal related growth
   factors are the intrinsic signals that elicit bottle cell formation in
   the normal embryo. In addition, fibroblast growth factor signalling is
   an essential precondition for this epithelial response as it is for
   mesoderm Formation. We conclude that bottle cell formation in the
   epithelial layer of the gastrula is closely linked to mesodermal
   patterning in the subepithelial tissues. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

   that G alpha i2, as well as G(gust), expressed in a subset of taste bud
   cells, and the frequency of G alpha i2-expression appears to be higher
   than that of G(gust) Southern ana lyses of the amplified cDNA from

Title = {{A novel role of differentiation-inducing factor-1 in Dictyostelium
   development, assessed by the restoration of a developmental defect in a

Journal = {{DEVELOPMENT GROWTH \& DIFFERENTIATION}},
Year = {{2000}},

Abstract = {{It has been previously reported that the differentiating wild-type cells
   of Dictyostelium discoideum secrete a diffusible factor or factors that
   are able to rescue the developmental defect in the mutant lacking
   extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), encoded by the gene
   erkB. In the present study, it is demonstrated that
   differentiation-inducing factor-1 (DIF-1) for stalk cells can mimic the
   role of the factor(s) and the mechanism of the action of DIF-1 in the
   erkB null mutant is also discussed. The mutant usually never forms
   multicellular aggregates, because of its defect in cyclic adenosine
   monophosphate (cAMP) signaling. In the presence of 100 nM DIF-1,
   however, the mutant cells formed tiny slugs, which eventually developed
   into small fruiting bodies. In contrast, DIF-1 never rescued the
   developmental arrest of other Dictyostelium mutants lacking adenylyl
   cyclase A (ACA), cAMP receptors cAR1 and cAR3, heterotrimeric G-protein,
   the cytosolic regulator of ACA, or the catalytic subunit of
   cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA-C). Most importantly. it was found
   that DIF-1 did not affect the cellular cAMP level, but rather elevated
   the transcriptional level of pka during the development of erkB null
   cells. These results suggest that DIF-1 may rescue the developmental
   defect in erkB null cells via the increase in PKA activity, thus giving
   the first conclusive evidence that DIF-1 plays a crucial role in the
   early events of Dictyostelium development as well as in prestalk and
   stalk cell induction.}},

   periodic modulation of the electric field near the film-substrate
   interface is induced by the isotropic diffusion of nonequilibrium
   minority carriers that are created in the neutral volume of epitaxial

Abstract = {{Objective: This study compared the risk of ischemic heart disease among
   older vegetarian Chinese women with that of older non-vegetarian women.
   Methods: 90 vegetarian Chinese women over 70 years old in Hong Kong were
   screened for ischemic heart disease by electrocardiogram (ECG) and
   cardiovascular questionnaire. They were compared with 90 nonvegetarian
   women of similar age examined in a previous local survey. The effects of
   confounding factors were adjusted by stepwise logistic regression
   analysis.
   Results: The percentages of subjects with ischemic heart disease defined
   by symptoms and ECG or by ECG alone were significantly lower in
   vegetarian women (p <0.005 and p<0.05 respectively). Vegetarians had
   lower serum cholesterol levels; more were old age home residents and
   were less likely to perform regular exercise. On stepwise logistic
   regression, using probable ischemic heart disease defined by
   questionnaire and ECG as outcome measure, vegetarianism was the only
   significant predictor (OR 0.3, 95\%CI0.1-0.6, p<0.005).
   Conclusions: Vegetarian older Chinese women had lower risk of ischemic
   heart disease when compared with non-vegetarians. Apart from lower serum
   cholesterol levels, vegetarianism may have other protective factors
   against ischemic heart disease.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated studies based on tectonic, seismotectonic and
   geomorphological analyses indicate that Normandy (northwest France) has
   been an active area during the Quaternary. Topography and landform
   discontinuities reflect the dislocation and differential uplift of a
   late Cenozoic platform. The tectonic activity is represented by (i)
   active faults, indicated by linear scarps and seismic activity, (ii)
   offsetting of pre-existing surfaces, (iii) Plio-Pleistocene
   sedimentation restricted within narrow subsiding zones, and (iv)
   morphometric properties of drainage basins that indicate zones of
   differential uplift. The inferred strain pattern involves ii) a
   shortening direction that strikes NW-SE as expected in the European
   context of Alpine compression, and (ii) a NE-SW trending extension
   accommodated by NW-SE normal faults. The geomorphological systems
   encountered in Normandy preferentially record differential vertical
   displacements. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Histological grading of 45 patients with clinical early immunoglobulin A
   (IgA) nephropathy was correlated with disease progression over a median
   follow-up of 123 months. Clinical early IgA nephropathy was defined as a
   serum creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL or less, proteinuria of 0.4 g/d or
   less of protein, and the absence of hypertension at the time of renal
   biopsy, Disease progression was related to the occurrence of impaired
   renal function, increased proteinuria, and hypertension. We applied a
   previously described chronicity-based histological grading to the renal
   biopsy specimen and also assessed acute glomerular lesions. Disease
   progression was observed in 44.4\% of these patients. Forty patients
   (89\%) showed glomerular grade 1 (GG1) and 5 patients (11\%) showed GG2,
   but this grading did not correlate with disease progression. However,
   when GG1 was subdivided into GG1a (mean sclerosis per glomerulus <10\%)
   and GG1b (mean sclerosis per glomerulus 1(10\% to <25\%), GG1a
   correlated with nonprogressive disease. Tubulointerstitial grade also
   correlated with disease progression but was associated with a low
   sensitivity for predicting nonprogressive disease. Hyaline
   arteriolosclerosis and acute glomerular lesions did not correlate with
   disease progression. The chronicity-based histological grading is not
   only applicable to clinical early IgA nephropathy, but also more
   importantly, it characterizes GG1a in a subset of patients with a very
   low risk for disease progression, which can be regarded as genuine early
   IgA nephropathy, (C) 2000 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The growing applications of cosmogenic nuclides produced in the Earth's
   atmosphere, and in situ in a variety of terrestrial materials, as
   tracers in a wide ranging Earth science problems, has put a greater
   demand on accurate determination of the nuclide production rates in a
   variety of targets exposed in different settings on the Earth in the
   troposphere. The present state of our knowledge of cosmogenic production
   rates is reviewed briefly, in conjunction with the phenomenological and
   theoretical framework for: (i) the cosmic ray flux incident in the near
   Earth environment, (ii) the nucleonic cascade set off in the Earth's
   atmosphere by the primary cosmic radiation, and (iii) the rate for
   production of nuclides in terrestrial materials, in widely different
   settings. These considerations set the stage for the diverse questions.
   which must be taken into account for determining the source functions of
   isotopic changes in terrestrial materials. We discuss the different
   approaches which have been adopted earlier to obtain the source
   strengths of nuclear interacting particles of the cosmic radiation, and
   direct measurements of nuclide production rates made by exposing targets
   to cosmic radiation at sea level and at mountain altitudes. We show that
   rapid progress in determining nuclide source functions with sufficient
   information on temporal variability is indeed expected in the near
   future as a result of: (i) dramatic improvements in the past 2-3 decades
   in our understanding of the character of propagation of cosmic radiation
   within the heliosphere, (ii) experiments now being conducted by a few
   groups to determine the source strengths of cosmic ray slow neutrons,
   and nuclide production rates in cosmic ray exposed targets, and finally
   (iii) the emergence of better nuclear codes which deal with the
   development of nucleonic cascades in the Earth's atmosphere. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Aims To determine the FMO and P450 isoform selectivity for metabolism of
   benzydamine and caffeine, two potential in vivo probes for human FMO.
   Methods Metabolic incubations were conducted at physiological pH using
   substrate concentrations of 0.01-10 mm with either recombinant human
   FMOs, P450s or human liver microsomes serving as the enzyme source.
   Products of caffeine and benzydamine metabolism were analysed by
   reversed-phase h.p.l.c. with u.v. and fluorescence detection.
   Results CYP1A2, but none of the human FMOs, catalysed metabolism of
   caffeine. In contrast, benzydamine was a substrate for human FMO1, FMO3,
   FMO4 and FMO5. Apparent K-m values for benzydamine N-oxygenation were 60
   +/- 8 mu m, 80 +/- 8 mu m, > 3 mm and > 2 mm, for FMO1, FMO3, FMO4 and
   FMO5, respectively. The corresponding V-max values were 46 +/- 2
   min(-1), 36 +/- 2 min(-1), < 75 min(-1) and < 1 min(-1). Small
   quantities of benzydamine N-oxide were also formed by CYPs 1A1, 1A2,
   2C19, 2D6 and 3A4.
   Conclusions FMO1 and FMO3 catalyse benzydamine N-oxygenation with the
   highest efficiency. However, it is likely that the metabolic capacity of
   hepatic FMO3 is a much greater contributor to plasma levels of the
   N-oxide metabolite in vivo than is extrahepatic FMO1. Therefore,
   benzydamine, but not caffeine, is a potential in vivo probe for human
   FMO3.}},

Abstract = {{Vimentin is a class III intermediate filament protein widely expressed
   in the developing embryo and in cells of mesenchymal origin in the
   adult. Vimentin knock-out mice develop and reproduce without any obvious
   defect. This is an unexpected finding in view of the high degree of
   conservation of the vimentin gene among vertebrates. However, it does
   not exclude the possibility of a role for vimentin in pathological
   conditions, like tumorigenesis. To address this question directly, we
   have used a teratocarcinoma model involving the injection of ES cells
   into syngeneic mice. ES cells lacking vimentin were generated from
   129/Sv Vim-/- mice with high efficiency. The absence of vimentin did not
   affect ES cell morphology, viability or growth rate in vitro. Tumours
   were induced by subcutaneous injection of either Vim-/- or Vim+/+ ES
   cells into Vim+/+ and Vim-/- mice, in order to analyse the effect of the
   absence of vimentin in either the tumorigenic cells or the host mice. No
   significant differences were found in either tumour incidence, size or
   vascularization of teratocarcinomas obtained with all possible
   combinations. Vim-/- ES-derived tumours showed the same cellular
   composition typical of teratocarcinomas induced by wildtype ES cells
   together with a very similar apoptotic pattern. Taken together, these
   results demonstrate that in this model vimentin is not essential for
   efficient tumour growth and differentiation in vivo.}},

   archetypal rhetorical strategies are described, as well as a particular

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To identify current perceptions and levels of awareness of
   chiropractic among physiotherapists, osteopaths, and manual therapists
   in The Netherlands. In addition, to investigate how future communication
   and interprofessional collaboration between the four professions may be
   improved in the interests of patient care as perceived by these groups.
   Design: Four hundred and ninety-four (494) questionnaires were
   distributed to 100 manual therapists, 299 physiotherapists, and 95
   osteopaths across The Netherlands. Questionnaires were identical for
   each profession.
   Results: An overall response rate of 48\% was achieved. The majority of
   practitioners reported limited knowledge of chiropractic. However,
   chiropractic was generally perceived as a primary health care profession
   most suited to extramural care. Sixty-seven percent (67\%) of the manual
   therapists regarded it as direct competition, while 45\% of the
   osteopaths and 48\% of physiotherapists considered chiropractic
   complementary to their professions. While the majority of osteopaths
   felt that statutory self-regulation should be granted to chiropractors
   in The Netherlands, this was not supported by the manual therapists and
   physiotherapists. Moreover, there was only minimal (4\%-11\%) support
   for the availability of chiropractic treatment as part of the Dutch
   National Health Service. Although most respondents had never had contact
   with a local chiropractor, all osteopaths and 50\% of the manual
   therapists and physiotherapists considered chiropractors to be skilled
   practitioners. However, this was more likely to be so if they had had
   contact with a chiropractor in the past. Current levels of communication
   and cooperation were thought to be poor to nonexistent although the
   majority welcomed closer links, particularly in relation to the
   treatment of spinal complaints.
   Conclusion: Greater awareness appears to be associated with increased
   levels of interprofessional acceptance and respect. The professions may
   wish to pursue areas of broad agreement identified by their
   practitioners in the interests of professional development and optimal
   standards of care for individuals in need of musculoskeletal services.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background. Dust control is recommended to prevent children's exposure
   to residential lead hazards, but the long-term effect of dust control on
   children's exposure to environmental lead is unknown.
   Objective. To determine the effect of dust control on children's
   exposure to lead, as measured by blood lead concentration at 48 months
   of age.
   Design. A randomized, controlled trial.
   Setting. Rochester, New York.
   Participants. A total of 275 urban children were randomized at 6 months
   of age; 189 (69\%) were available for the 48-month follow-up blood test.
   Intervention. Children and their families were randomly assigned to an
   intervention group that received cleaning equipment and up to 8 visits
   by a trained lead hazard control advisor or to a control group. The
   intervention was terminated when the children were 24 months of age.
   Outcome Measures. Geometric mean blood lead concentration and prevalence
   of elevated blood lead concentration (ie, greater than or equal to 10 mu
   g/dL, greater than or equal to 15 mu g/dL, and greater than or equal to
   20 mu g/dL), by group assignment.
   Results. For children with 48-month blood tests, baseline geometric mean
   blood lead concentrations were 2.8 mu g/dL (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 2.6,3.0); there were no significant differences in baseline
   characteristics or lead exposure by group assignment. At 48 months of
   age, the geometric mean blood lead was 5.9 mu g/dL (95\% CI: 5.3,6.7)
   for the intervention group and 6.1 mu g/dL (95\% CI: 5.5,6.9) for the
   control group. The percentage of children with a 48-month blood lead
   greater than or equal to 10 mu g/dL, greater than or equal to 15 mu
   g/dL, and greater than or equal to 20 mu g/dL was 19\% versus 19\%, 2\%
   versus 9\%, and 1\% versus 2\% in the intervention and control groups,
   respectively.
   Conclusions. We conclude that dust control, as performed by families and
   in the absence of lead hazard controls to reduce ongoing contamination
   from lead-based paint, was not effective in preventing children's
   exposure to residential lead hazards.}},

Abstract = {{Magmatic sulfides are generally accepted as forming by segregation of an
   immiscible sulfide liquid from a host silicate melt. Immiscible sulfides
   have been observed in many types of igneous rocks; however, some types
   of plutonic and volcanic rocks lack sulfides. We have examined a suite
   of samples from Mount Pinatubo (Philippines), Volcan Popocatepetl
   (Mexico), Satsuma-Iwojima (Japan) and Mount St. Helens, Bingham Canyon,
   Tintic District, and Clear Lake (U.S.A.). The samples reflect a range of
   crystallization histories and compositions; they range from rhyolite to
   basalt to trachyandesite, with f(O-2) at the time of eruption ranging
   from below the fayalite - magnetite + quartz (FMQ) buffer to well above
   the nickel - nickel oxide (NNO) buffer. Textural and chemical evidence
   from our suite of samples indicate that sulfides initially were present,
   but were modified prior to complete cooling of the parent melt, giving
   rise to Fe-oxide globules. The globules formed through: (1) segregation
   of an immiscible Fe-S-O melt, and possibly, further separation of
   immiscible Fe-S and Fe-O liquids, and (2) undersaturation with respect
   to sulfide, causing removal of S from the immiscible sulfide melt.
   Sulfide undersaturation may have been caused by magma degassing
   (passively or during eruption), or magma mixing. The recognition of
   modified magmatic sulfides is important because, with extensive
   degassing, base and precious metals (e.g., Cu, Au) could be stripped
   from a melt by a S-rich magmatic volatile phase and entrained into a
   magmatic-hydrothermal fluid, ultimately giving rise to porphyry-type or
   related mineralization. For a melt containing 0.01 modal ro magmatic
   sulfides, efficient degassing of only 10 km(3) of magma could yield
   enough Cu to form a giant deposit.}},

Abstract = {{Single scan techniques are highly desirable for clinical trials
   involving radiotracers because they increase logistical feasibility,
   improve patient compliance, and decrease the cost associated with the
   study. However, the information derived from single scans usually are
   biased by factors unrelated to the process of interest. Therefore,
   identification of these factors and evaluation of their impact on the
   proposed outcome measure is important. In this paper, the impact of
   confounding factors on single scan measurements is illustrated by
   discussing the effect of between-subject or between-condition
   differences in radiotracer plasma clearance on normalized activity
   ratios (specific to nonspecific ratios) in the: tissue of interest.
   Computer simulation based on kinetic analyses are presented to
   demonstrate this effect. It is proposed that the presence of this and
   other confounding factors should not necessarily preclude clinical
   trials based on single scan techniques. First, knowledge of the
   distribution of plasma clearance values in a sample of the investigated
   population allows researchers to assign limits to this potential bias.
   This information can be integrated in the power analysis. Second, the
   impact of this problem will vary according to the characteristic of the
   radiotracer, and this information can be used in the development and
   selection of the radiotracer. Third, simple modification of the
   experimental design (such as administration of the radiotracer as a
   bolus, followed by constant infusion, rather than as a single bolus)
   might remove this potential confounding factor and allow appropriate
   quantification within the limits of a single scanning session. In
   conclusion, model-based kinetic characterization of radiotracer
   distribution and uptake is critical to the design and interpretation of
   clinical trials based on single scan techniques. NUCL MED BIOL

Abstract = {{Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), the most common mesenchymal
   tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, typically express the KF protein,
   Activating mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (exon 11) of the c-kit
   gene have been shown in a subset of GISTs, These mutations lead into
   ligand-independent activation of the tyrosine kinase of c-kit, and have
   a transforming effect in vitro, Several groups have studied the clinical
   implication of the c-kit mutation status of exon 11 in GISTs and a
   possible relationship between c-kit mutations and malignant behavior has
   been established. Recently, a 1530ins6 mutation in exon 9 and missense
   mutations, 1945A>G in exon 13 of the c-kit gene were reported. The
   frequency and clinical importance of these findings are unknown, In this
   study we evaluated 200 GISTs for the presence of mutations in exons 9
   and 13 of c-kit. Six cases revealed 1530ins6 mutation in exon 9 and two
   cases 1945A>G mutation in exon 13. All tumors with mutations in exon 9
   and 13 lacked mutations in exon 11 of c-kit. None of the analyzed tumors
   had more than one type of c-Lit mutation. All but one of the eight
   tumors with mutations in exon 9 or 13 of the c-kit gene were
   histologically and clinically malignant. All four of six cases with exon
   9 mutation of which location of primary tumor was known, were small
   intestinal, suggesting that this type of mutation could preferentially
   occur in small intestinal tumors. Exon 9 and 13 mutations seem to be
   rare, and they cover only a small portion (8\%) of the balance of GISTs
   that do not have mutations in exon 11 of c-kit. This finding indicates
   that other genetic alterations may activate c-kit in GISTs, or that KIT
   is not activated by mutations in all cases.}},

Abstract = {{Ambient air, soil air, and groundwater were monitored for volatile
   halogenated organic compounds in a pristine spruce forest at
   Klosterhede, Denmark. Although this location is remote from industrial
   areas and free of any point sources of either soil or groundwater
   contamination, several volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons were detected.
   The concentration profiles of chloroform indicated a formation of this
   compound in the soil. Low concentrations were found in ambient air (0.02
   ng L-1), higher concentrations in the upper soil layers (9.6 ng L-1 at
   0.75 m below the surface), and a decrease with increasing depth (down to
   1.5 ng L-1 just above the groundwater table at 7.5 m below the surface)
   For the other identified chlorinated compounds the concentration
   profiles were different from those of chloroform and exhibited less
   systematic variation between ambient air and soil air and with
   increasing depth. In the phreatic groundwater, high concentrations (up
   to 1.6 mu g L-1) of chloroform and low concentrations (<0.01 mu g L-1)
   of the other chlorinated compounds identified in air were found. Of the
   seven volatile brominated and iodinated compounds analyzed in ambient
   air, soil air, and groundwater, only bromoform was found and only in the
   upper soil layer. For chloroform a formation in the spruce forest soil
   is suggested, leading to concentrations in the groundwater in the
   micrograms per liter range.}},

Abstract = {{Several different species of Pseudomonas produce N-acylhomoserine
   lactones (AHLs), quorum-sensing signal molecules which are involved in
   the cell-density-dependent control of secondary metabolite and virulence
   gene expression. When Pseudomonas fluorescens F113 was cross-streaked
   against AHL biosensors capable of sensitively detecting either short
   (C-4-C-8) or long (C-10-C-14) acyl chain AHLs, no activity was
   detectable. However, by extracting cell-free stationary-phase culture
   supernatants with dichloromethane followed by reverse-phase HPLC, three
   distinct fractions were obtained capable of activating the AHL
   biosensors. Three AHLs were subsequently characterized using
   high-resolution MS and chemical synthesis. These were (i)
   N-(3-hydroxy-7-cis-tetradecenoyl)homoserine lactone (30H,C-14:1-HSL), a
   molecule previously known as the Rhizobium leguminosarum small
   bacteriocin as a consequence of its growth inhibitory properties, (ii)
   N-decamoylhomoserine lactone (C-10-HSL) and (iii) N-hexanoylhomoserine
   lactone (C-6-HSL). A gene (hdtS) capable of directing synthesis of all
   three P, fluorescens AHLs in Escherichia coli was cloned and sequenced.
   In vitro transcription/translation of hdtS yielded a protein of
   approximately 33 kDa capable of directing the synthesis of
   3OH,C-14:1-HSL, C-10-HSL and C-6-HSL in E. coli, HdtS does not belong to
   either of the known AHL synthase families (LuxI or LuxM) and is related
   to the lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase family. HdtS may therefore
   constitute a member of a third protein family capable of AHL
   biosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-Thrombosis superimposed on atherosclerosis causes
   approximately two thirds of all brain infarctions. We previously
   demonstrated that statins protect from cerebral ischemia by upregulation
   of endothelial type ill nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), but the downstream
   mechanisms have not been determined. Therefore, we investigated whether
   antithrombotic effects contribute to stroke protection by statins.
   Methods-129/SV wild-type and eNOS knockout mice were treated with
   atorvastatin for 14 days (0.5, 1, and 10 mg/kg). eNOS mRNA from aortas
   and platelets was measured by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
   reaction. Platelet factor 4 (PF 4) and beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) in
   the plasma were quantified by ELISA, Transient cerebral ischemia was
   induced by filamentous occlusion of the middle cerebral artery followed
   by reperfusion.
   Results-Stroke volume after 1-hour middle cerebral artery
   occlusion/23-hour reperfusion was significantly reduced by 38\% in
   atorvastatin-treated animals (10 mg/kg) compared with controls. Serum
   cholesterol levels were not affected by the treatment. eNOS mRNA was
   significantly upregulated in a dose-dependent manner in aortas and in
   thrombocytes of statin-treated mice compared with controls. Moreover,
   indices of platelet activation in vivo, ie, plasma levers of PF 4 and
   beta-TG, were dose-dependently downregulated in the treatment group.
   Surprisingly, atorvastatin-treatment did not influence PF 4 and beta-TG
   levels in eNOS knockout mice.
   Conclusions-The synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A
   reductase inhibitor atorvastatin upregulates eNOS in thrombocytes,
   decreases platelet activation in vivo, and protects from cerebral
   ischemia in normocholesterolemic mice. Antithrombotic and
   stroke-protective effects of statins an mediated in part by eNOS
   upregulation. Our results suggest that statins may provide a novel
   prophylactic treatment strategy independent of serum cholesterol levels.}},

   and nitrate uptake by roots. Variation in nitrate production in Lime and
   space, between the different organic horizons, has been related to
   temperature, moisture content, substrate availability and pH. Temporal
   variation in concentrations of nitrate and ammonium in the forest floor
   was significant during a one-year cycle, when randomly taken samples
   were pooled. Nitrogen concentrations differed between the different
   organic horizons with highest concentrations found in the litter layer,
   decreasing with increasing depth. Ammonium concentrations always
   exceeded nitrate concentrations by a factor ten, indicating that
   ammonium was not limiting nitrification. Nitrification potential, the
   nitrate production at field moisture at 25 degrees C, was highest in the
   litter layer, lower in the fragmentation layer and hardly measurable in
   the mineral soil. Uptake of nitrate by roots and changes in
   mineralization rates turned out to be unimportant to explain variation
   in time, as seasonal fluctuations seem to be less important than spatial
   variation. We found that horizontal spatial variation in potential
   nitrate production, leaching of nitrate and nitrogen concentrations from
   non-pooled field samples was higher than variation in time. All this
   reflects the actual spatial variation in the field, which is not
   explained by differences in moisture content or temperature. Overall
   neither pH nor substrate availability could explain this observed
   variation, however, local variation in microsites may be responsible for
   small-scale spatial variation. Allelopathic compounds and/or the
   composition of the microbial community are suggested as factors possibly
   affecting nitrate production. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To ascertain current faculty attitudes regarding teaching of
   vaginal breech delivery (VBD) and external cephalic version (ECV).
   STUDY DESIGN: A questionnaire was sent to obstetrics ann gynecology
   residency programs. Respondents were queried regarding demographic
   parameters, resident and practice experience, and attitudes toward
   teaching these procedures.
   RESULTS: Fifty-four (96\%:) surveys were returned. Sixteen (30\%)
   respondents were female and 38 (70\%) male. Sixteen (30\%) completed
   residency prior to 1980, 17 (32\%) during the 1980s and 21 (48\%) during
   the 1990s. Nineteen (35\%) trained locally. Forty-seven (87\%) recieved
   training in ECV. Thirty-two rcsirlency. Thirty-five (65\%) recieved
   training in ECV. Thirty-two (60\%) had performed VBDs in practice.
   However, only 18 (33\%) continued to perform this procedure. During the
   proceeding three years, they reported performing an average average of
   five VBDs per chief resident per year. Thirty-seven (69\%) performed ECV
   ill clinical practice. The 17 who did not indicated that they refered to
   others. They reported performing an average of 15 ECVs per chief
   resident per year. Fifty-two (96\%) thought residents should still be
   taught VBD. All faculty throught that residents should be taught ECV.
   None of the above parameters exerted a statistically significant effect
   on these opinions.
   CONCLUSION: There tons nearly universal faculty support for continuing
   to teach VBD to residents. However, only one-third of faculty members
   currently perform this procedure. There do not appear to be sufficient
   numbers of VBDs to teach this procedure utilizing a ``hands on{''}
   approach. There is universal support for teaching ECV. There appear to
   be both enough individuals with experience and enough procedures to
   accomplish this education.}},

Abstract = {{A technique for determining the instantaneous heat release from a
   localized region of a flame and correlating it with the fluctuating
   pressure is described. The technique is based on ultraviolet at 307 nm
   by the chemiluminescence of the OH{*} radical, which is closely
   associated with the combustion reactions in gaseous hydrocarbon flames.
   A novel feature of the approach is the use of the rms fluctuations in
   signal rather than the mean level as the indicator of mean turbulent
   heat release. Two lines-of-sight intersecting in the flame at right
   angles are used to determine the radial distribution of emission from
   the product of the signals. It is shown that this is a measure of the
   emission within an integral length scale of the point of intersection,
   provided only that the collection widths are smaller than this scale.
   Results of applying this novel technique to a premixed swirling flame
   under conditions of low acoustic self-excitation are presented. These
   results are compared with those obtained by deconvoluting the
   line-of-sight signals from a traverse across the flame radius, and good
   correspondence is obtained. However, when there is significant acoustic
   excitation, the integral scale of the flame fluctuations is the entire
   flame diameter and so the product must be restricted to frequencies
   other than those which are acoustically excited, if the background heat
   release distribution is to be obtained. The radial distribution of the
   acoustically coupled component of heat release can then only be
   determined from the deconvolution of the line-of-sight signals. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Objectives. Although rubella sero-susceptibility among women of
   reproductive age in West Africa ranges From 10\% to 30\%, congenital
   rubella syndrome has not been reported. In Ghana, rubella immunization
   and serologic testing are unavailable. Our objectives were to identify
   congenital rubella syndrome cases, ascertain rubella antibody
   seroprevalence during pregnancy, and recommend strategies for congenital
   rubella syndrome surveillance.
   Methods. Congenital rubella syndrome cases were identified through
   prospective surveillance and retrospective surveys of hospital records.
   A rubella serosurvey of pregnant urban and rural women was performed.
   Results. Eighteen infants born within a 5-month period met the
   congenital rubella syndrome case definitions, coinciding with a 9-fold
   increase in presentation of infantile congenital cataract. The
   congenital rubella syndrome rate For this otherwise unrecorded rubella
   epidemic was conservatively estimated to be 0.8 per 1000 live births. A
   postepidemic rubella immunity rate of 92.6\% was documented among 405
   pregnant women; susceptibility was significantly associated with younger
   age (P = .000) and ethnicity (northern tribes, P = .024).
   Conclusions. Congenital rubella syndrome occurs in Ghana but is not

Abstract = {{Objective: Minocycline is an antibacterial drug used in the treatment of
   acne. Concern has been expressed over the possibility of severe adverse
   reactions to minocycline, including hepatitis. This study set out to
   identify and characterise reported cases of hepatotoxicity associated
   with the use of minocycline.
   Methods: A systematic review of the literature including a search of
   computerised databases and analysis of data from the Uppsala Monitoring
   Centre (WHO Collaborating Centre for international Drug Monitoring) was
   conducted. The review involved a search for original case reports
   involving liver damage in people using minocycline. Patients taking
   minocycline for reasons other than acne or those given intravenous
   minocycline were excluded. The search strategy involved an enquiry of
   computerised databases and a search for secondary references. Cases were
   then classified appropriately.
   Results: 65 reported cases of hepatitis or liver damage in association
   with minocycline from either case reports or case series were identified
   from the literature review. 58\% of cases occurred in females and 94\%
   were aged under 40 years. For 20 case reports there was insufficient
   information to classify the type of event, but for the remaining 45, 2
   types of hepatic reaction were recognised: autoimmune hepatitis
   associated with lupus-like symptoms occurring after a median duration of
   exposure to minocycline of 365 days in females (n = 20) and 730 days in
   males (n = 9), hypersensitivity reaction associated with eosinophilia
   and exfoliative dermatitis occurring within 35 days of therapy (n = 16).
   Reports to the WHO of hepatic adverse drug reactions associated with
   minocycline accounted for 6\% (493) of all minocycline-related adverse
   drug reactions (8025). The pattern of distribution in relation to
   exposure demonstrated 2 groups, similar to that described by the case
   reports.
   Conclusions: Severe cases of minocycline-associated hepatotoxicity
   appear to be a hypersensitivity reaction and occur within a few weeks of
   commencing therapy. An autoimmune hepatitis usually presents after
   exposure to minocycline of a year or more, is more common in women and
   is sometimes associated with lupus-like symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses some fundamental methodological issues concerning
   the sensitivity analysis of chaotic geophysical systems. We show, using
   the Lorenz system as an example, that a naive approach to variational
   ({''}adjoint{''}) sensitivity analysis is of limited utility. Applied to
   trajectories which are long relative to the predictability time scales
   of the system, cumulative error growth means that adjoint results
   diverge exponentially from the ``macroscopic climate sensitivity{''}
   (that is, the sensitivity of time-averaged properties of the system to
   finite-amplitude perturbations). This problem occurs even for
   time-averaged quantities and given infinite computing resources.
   Alternatively, applied to very short trajectories, the adjoint provides
   an incorrect estimate of the sensitivity, even if averaged over large
   numbers of initial conditions, because a finite time scale is required
   for the model climate to respond fully to certain perturbations. In the
   Lorenz (1963) system, an intermediate time scale is found on which an
   ensemble of adjoint gradients can give a reasonably accurate (O(10\%))
   estimate of the macroscopic climate sensitivity. While this
   ensemble-adjoint approach is unlikely to be reliable for more complex
   systems, it may provide useful guidance in identifying important
   parameter-combinations to be explored further through direct
   finite-amplitude perturbations.}},

Abstract = {{In the early 1970's, two similar genera, Labyrinthuloides and
   Aplanochytrium, were described within months of one another. Ironically,
   these two genera were originally associated with entirely different
   groups of fungi. Labyrinthuloides was recognized as having morphological
   similarities to the labyrinthulids (or marine slime nets), and
   Aplanochytrium was associated with the thraustochytrid fungi. However,
   contemporary researchers were beginning to recognize that the
   thraustochytrids and labyrinthulids were closely related. By the mid
   1980's, biochemical and morphological evidence linking Labyrinthuloides
   and Aplanochytrium was mounting, and suggestions were made that these
   genera were identical. In 1999, Honda et al. published a molecular
   phylogeny of the Labyrinthulomycota, including ssurDNA sequence data
   from Aplanochytrium kerguelensis. Leander and Porter (submitted) also
   reported a molecular phylogeny of the group, including Labyrinthuloides
   yorkensis and Labyrinthuloides minuta. We have compared this sequence
   data from A. kerguelensis, L. minuta, and L. yorkensis, and together
   with the morphological similarities, we conclude that Aplanochytrium and
   Labyrinthuloides are synonymous. Following the IBC rules of
   nomenclature, Aplanochytrium is recognized as the correct name for this
   genus by means of precedence. Additionally, the five species of
   labyrinthuloides are transferred to Aplanochytrium. We also transfer one
   species of labyrinthula, L. thaisi, to Aplanochytrium based on
   morphological similarities.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of physical
   activity levels to blood pressure (BP) variability, and to assess the
   effect age, gender, body mass index, and use of antihypertensive
   medications on this relationship. We simultaneously monitored 24-h
   ambulatory BP by automated recorder and activity by actigraphy in 431
   patients. Mean activity scores for the 5, 10, 15, and 20 min preceding
   each BP measurement were calculated, and BP and heart rate were related
   to these variables using linear mixed model regression. Various patient
   characteristics were added to the mixed model as covariates. Patients
   were heterogeneous in age (48 +/- 13 years), sex (49\% men), and average
   24-h BP (132/81 +/- 15/10 mm Hg). Mean daytime activity level was 44 +/-
   15 U. During the daytime, systolic BP (r = 0.33), diastolic BP (r =
   0.29), and heart rate (r = 0.42) correlated best with the average
   activity for the 15 min preceding each measurement (P <.001). Variance
   was very high, with activity explaining from 0\% to 62\% of BP
   variability for different individuals. Men and the obese had a greater
   reactivity of systolic BP to activity; older patients and those on
   antihypertensive therapy had a lower reactivity of heart rate. Blood
   pressure level is significantly associated with physical activity, but
   the percentage of variance of BP explained by physical activity varies
   greatly between individuals. Correlation is strongest between BP and
   average activity integrated over the previous 15 min. Much of the
   variance in blood pressure remains unexplained. Am J Hypertens 2000;

Abstract = {{In this study, we examined whether the adrenergic volume response of

   (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were made anaemic by reducing their haematocrit to
   approximately 50 \% of the original value. After 3-4 weeks, small, young
   erythrocytes were seen in the circulation. By measuring the volume
   distribution of blood samples from anaemic fish before and after
   noradrenaline stimulation (10 min, 10(-5) mol l(-1) final
   concentration), we were able to show that the volume response of young,
   immature erythrocytes to catecholamine stimulation was greater than that
   of mature erythrocytes, In addition, the membrane fluidity, measured
   using the steady-state fluorescence polarisation method, was greater in
   anaemic fish after 24 days of recovery from bleeding than in control
   fish. Since blood from anaemic fish contained a large fraction of
   immature erythrocytes, this result indicates that the fluidity of the
   membrane of immature erythrocytes is greater than that of mature
   erythrocytes.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{2431-2439}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Study Design. A three-dimensional nonlinear poroelastic finite-element
   model of a vertebra disc was used to analyze the biomechanical effects
   of impact loading on the spinal segment.
   Objectives, To predict changes in biomechanical parameters such as
   intradiscal pressure, dynamic stiffness, stresses in the endplate
   region, and the shock-absorbing mechanism of the spine under different
   impact duration/loading rates, and to investigate the relation between
   the rate of loading and the fracture potential of the vertebral body.
   Summary of Background Data. It is not practical to discern the role of
   impact duration using experimental protocols. Analytical studies are
   better suited to this purpose. However, previous poroelastic
   finite-element models of the motion segments have dealt mostly with
   creep phenomena.
   Methods. A three-dimensional, L3-L4 motion-segment, finite-element model
   was modified to incorporate the poroelastic properties of the disc,
   endplate, and cancellous core, and thus simulate the shock-absorbing
   phenomena. The results were analyzed under variable impact durations for
   a constant maximum compressive impact load of 3 kN.
   Results. For a shorter impact duration and a given F-max, relatively
   high cancellous core pressure was generated as compared with a case of
   long impact duration, although the amount of impulse was increased. In
   contrast, relatively constant pore pressures were generated in the
   nucleus regardless of the impact duration. The changes in spinal segment
   stiffness as a function of impact duration indicated that for a shorter
   duration of impact, high dynamic stiffness increases the stability of
   the spinal segment against the impact load. However, the corresponding
   increase in stresses within the vertebral body and endplate may produce
   fractures.
   Conclusions. The finite-element technique was used to address the role
   of impact duration in producing trauma to the spinal motion segment.
   Within the limitations of the model, the results suggest that fractures
   are likely to occur under shorter impact duration conditions. Depending
   on the strength of the region, a fracture may be initiated in the
   endplate region or the posterior wall of the cortical shell. The nucleus
   pressure is independent of the impact duration and depends only on the
   magnitude of the impact force.}},

Abstract = {{A highly chromate-selective biosorbent with high adsorption capacity was
   found by examining the chromate adsorption capacities of 48 species of
   red, brown, or green marine algae sampled from the east coast of Korea.
   As a result of screening, a red marine alga showed excellent adsorption
   characteristics. It was identified as Pachymeniopsis sp. The timing of
   the sampling of Pachymeniopsis sp. did not affect the adsorption
   capacity of the alga but the optimum period for mass collection was
   April-May. The alga also showed high selectivity for chromate and its
   adsorption capacity for other heavy metal ions such as cadmium and
   manganese was relatively low. An investigation of the adsorption
   isotherm of Pachymeniopsis sp. as a dried powder for chromate adsorption
   at 25 degreesC showed Langmuir-type dependence. The maximum chromate
   adsorption capacity of the selected alga was about 225 mg/g. The
   desorption of adsorbed chromate from Pachymeniopsis sp. was done by
   treating samples with 1 N NaOH. It was confirmed that ion exchange type
   adsorption was observed with anion exchangers but not with cation
   exchangers. Therefore it is believed that the chromate adsorption is
   based on the anionic exchange of Pachymeniopsis sp.}},

Abstract = {{The flavivirus receptor-binding domain has been putatively assigned to a
   hydrophilic region (FG loop) in the envelope (E) protein. In some
   flaviviruses this domain harbors the integrin-binding motif Arg-Gly-Asp
   (RGD), One of us has shown earlier that host cell adaptation of Murray
   Valley encephalitis virus (MVE) can result in the selection of
   attenuated variants altered at E protein residue Asp(390), which is part
   of an RGD motif. Here, a full-length, infectious cDNA clone of MVE was
   constructed and employed to systematically investigate the impact of
   single amino acid changes at Asp(390) on cell tropism, virus entry, and
   virulence. Each of 10 different E protein 390 mutants was viable. Three
   mutants (Gly(390), Ala(390), and His(390)) showed pronounced differences
   from an infectious clone-derived control virus in growth in mammalian
   and mosquito cells, The altered cell tropism correlated with (i) a
   difference in entry kinetics, (ii) an increased dependence on
   glycosaminoglycans (determined by inhibition of virus infectivity by
   heparin) for attachment of the three mutants to different mammalian
   cells, and (iii) the loss of virulence in mice. These results confirm a
   functional role of the FG loop in the flavivirus E protein in virus
   entry and suggest that encephalitic flaviviruses can enter cells via
   attachment to glycosaminoglycans. However, it appears that additional
   cell surface molecules are also used as receptors by natural isolates of
   MVE and that the increased dependence on glycosaminoglycans for entry
   results in the loss of neuroinvasiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Primary normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOKs) undergo differentiation
   in the presence of calcium concentrations higher than 0.15 mM in vitro,
   which is useful in investigating the mechanisms involved in the
   differentiation of epithelial cells. Serial subculture of NHOKs to the
   postmitotic stage also induces terminal differentiation. However, the
   detailed mechanisms of both differentiation processes remain
   substantially unknown. To investigate the molecular differences in these
   processes, NHOKs were induced to differentiate by exposure to 1.2 mM of
   calcium and by serial subculture to the postmitotic stage. To study
   whether the cells were induced to differentiate and to undergo
   replicative senescence, the amount of cellular involucrin and the
   expression of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal)
   were measured respectively. The expression of replicative
   senescence-associated genes and the activity of telomerase from the
   differentiated cells were also determined. Both calcium treatment and
   serial subculture to the postmitotic stage notably elevated the cellular
   involucrin. The percentage of SA-beta-gal-positive cells was
   significantly elevated by the continued subculture, but such changes
   were not observed in keratinocytes exposed to calcium. The concentration
   of cellular p16(INK4A) protein was progressively increased by the
   continued subculture but was not changed by calcium treatment. On the
   other hand, the concentrations of cellular p53 were similar in both
   differentiation processes. However, telomerase activity was lost in
   NHOKs that had undergone differentiation by both calcium treatment and
   serial subculture. The results indicate that calcium-induced
   differentiation of NHOKs has similar characteristics to their serial
   subculture-induced differentiation, but that the differentiation
   processes are not identical, because calcium-induced differentiation
   does not concur with either replicative senescence or the gradually
   increased concentration of p16(INK4A). (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Perivasculitis and endothelial cell abnormalities are prominent
   histopathologic features of syphilis. Various cutaneous lesions are the
   main clinical features of syphilis. We examined whether Treponema
   pallidum 47 kDa antigen regulates the expression of cell adhesion
   molecules on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) and
   the regulation of T-lymphocytes binding to HDMEC. Using
   immunofluorescence flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA), we demonstrated that T. pallidum upregulated the expression of
   adhesion molecules, including intercellular adhesion molecule 1
   (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin. The
   47 kDa antigen of T. pallidum also activated endothelium as measured by
   the upregulation of the expression of adhesion molecules on HDMEC, and
   it also promoted an increased adherence of T-lymphocytes to HDMEC. The
   expressions of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on HDMEC and the adherence of
   T-lymphocytes to HDMEC were inhibited by treatment with anti-TNF-alpha
   antibody or anti-IL-1 alpha antibody. These results show that T,
   pallidum or T. pallidum-specific 47 kDa antigen are capable of
   stimulating HDMEC to increase the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and
   E-selectin and thereby, promote the adherence of T-lymphocytes. The
   whole process may Play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of
   syphilis and it is likely that TNF-alpha and IL-1 alpha are involved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a meshfree method called Reproducing Kernel Particle
   Method (RKPM) with an inherent characteristic of multi-resolution is
   modified to develop structural analysis algorithm using two scales. The
   shape function of RKPM is decomposed into two scales, high and low. The
   two scale decomposition is incorporated into linear elastic formulation
   to obtain high and low scale components of von Mises stresses. The
   advantage of using this algorithm is that the high scale component of
   von Mises stress indicates the high stress gradient regions without
   posteriori estimation. This algorithm is applied to the analysis of 2-
   and 3-dimensional stress concentration problems. It is important to note
   that the two scale analysis method has been applied to S-dimensional
   stress concentration problem for the very first time. Also, the
   possibility of applying this algorithm to adaptive refinement technique
   is studied. The proposed method is verified by analyzing typical 2- and
   S-dimensional Linear elastic stress concentration problems. The results
   show that the algorithm can effectively locate the high stress
   concentration regions and can be utilized as an efficient indicator for
   the adaptive refinement technique.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. In this study, conjugates of heparin and deoxycholic acid were
   synthesized in order to enhance the heparin absorption in the GI tract.
   Oral delivery of heparin is a preferred therapy in the treatment of
   patients who are at high risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary
   embolism.
   Methods. Several different kinds of heparin derivatives were
   synthesized, and their absorption in the GI tract was determined by
   activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and factor Xa (FXa) assay.
   Any histological changes caused by heparin derivatives were examined by
   hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stain and transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM).
   Results. After administering heparin-DOCA orally, the clotting time in
   aPTT assay was increased with the increase of the coupled DOCA amount.
   The maximum clotting time of heparin-DOCA was 136+/-33 sec at 200 mg/kg
   of oral dose. This value was 7 times higher than the baseline. The
   absorption of heparin-cholesterol, heparin-palmitic acid, and
   heparin-lauric acid conjugates in the GI tract was lower than that of
   heparin-DOCA. Histological examination of the GI tract indicated that
   heparin derivatives did not cause any damage to the microvilli and the
   cell layer.
   Conclusions. DOCA coupled with heparin greatly enhanced absorption of
   heparin in the GI tract, and this enhancing effect was induced without
   changing the tissue structure of the GI wall.}},

Abstract = {{Ab initio molecular orbital calculations have been employed to
   investigate the structures and energetics of the adduct isomers arising
   from the addition reaction of OH to isoprene. Several levels of ab
   initio theory were evaluated using a set of organic radical species to
   establish the appropriate level of approximation. The method of gradient
   corrected density functionals (NLDFT) in conjunction with moderate basis
   sets was found to yield satisfactory molecular geometries and
   vibrational frequencies. Single-point energy calculations were performed
   using various methods, including MP2, MP4, and CCSD(T). The most
   energetically favorable isomers are those with OH addition to the
   terminal carbon positions. At the CCSD(T)/6-311G{*}{*} level of theory
   corrected with zero-point energy (ZPE), the isomers with OH additions to
   isoprene at C1 to C4 positions (i.e., isomers I-IV) are 34.8, 24.2,
   22.4, and 32.3 kcal mol(-1) more stable than the OH and isoprene,
   respectively. The activation energies against OH migration transforming
   the higher energy isomers into the lower energy ones (i.e., II to I or
   III to IV) are significant (25.5-26.5 kcal mol(-1)), indicating that
   thermal equilibrium of the OH-isoprene adduct isomers is unlikely to be
   established. In addition, we have developed and validated a
   computationally efficient method to calculate the energetics of the
   OH-isoprene reaction system. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Nuclear movement is critical for several developmental processes in
   eukaryotes. Drosophila oogenesis provides a paradigmatic example in
   which localization of the nucleus generates a source of cellular
   asymmetry that is used in patterning both the anterior-posterior and the
   dorsal-ventral axes of the oocyte. In this study we show that mutations
   in the Drosophila Lissencephaly1 (DLis1) gene result in partial
   ventralization of the eggshell. DLis1 mutations affect the localization
   of gurken mRNA and protein in the oocyte. These defects are correlated
   with incorrect positioning of the oocyte nucleus, suggesting that DLis1
   is required for nuclear migration. DLis1 shows significant sequence
   conservation across the evolutionary spectrum. Fungal cognates of DLis1
   are involved in nuclear migration while homologs in humans and mice are
   implicated in neuronal migration. DLis1 shows genetic interactions with
   the Glued and Dynein heavy chain subunits of the dynein/dynactin
   complex, supporting the idea that the Lis1 family of proteins plays a
   role in microtubule motor-based nuclear motility. (C) 2000 Academic

Abstract = {{In this double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial, we compared
   the analgesic effect of preoperative 0.25\% bupivacaine (n=21) skin
   infiltration with normal saline (n=19) in patients undergoing abdominal
   hysterectomy through a lower midline incision. All patients received
   postoperative patient-controlled analgesia with morphine and were
   followed for 72 hours. The main outcome measures were morphine
   consumption and pain score at rest, and the contribution of different
   components of pain was also assessed prospectively. No statistically
   significant differences were found. All except one patient (n =39) could
   distinguish the different characteristics of somatic and visceral pain.
   Visceral pain predominated in the first 48 hours. We concluded that
   local anaesthetic infiltration is not effective in reducing pain after
   abdominal hysterectomy. Effective postoperative analgesia should aim to
   eliminate the visceral pain component.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term effects of elevated (ambient plus 350 mu mol mol(-1))
   atmospheric CO2 concentration (C-a) on the leaf senescence of Quercus
   myrtifolia Willd was studied in a scrub-oak community during the
   transition from autumn (December 1997) to spring (April 1998). Plants
   were grown in large open-top chambers at the Smithsonian CO2 Research
   Site, Merritt Island Wildlife Refuge, Cape Canaveral, Florida.
   Chlorophyll (a + b) concentration, Rubisco activity and N concentration
   decreased by 75\%, 82\%, and 52\%, respectively, from December (1997) to
   April (1998) in the leaves grown at ambient C-a. In contrast, the leaves
   of plants grown at elevated C-a showed no significant decrease in
   chlorophyll (a + b) concentration or Rubisco activity, and only a 25\%
   reduction in nitrogen. These results indicate that leaf senescence was
   delayed during this period at elevated C-a. Delayed leaf senescence in
   elevated C-a had important consequences for leaf photosynthesis. In
   elevated C-a the net photosynthetic rate of leaves that flushed in
   Spring 1997 (last year's leaves) and were 13 months old was not
   different from fully-expanded leaves that flushed in 1998, and were
   approximately 1 month old (current year's leaves). In ambient C-a the
   net photosynthetic rate of last year's leaves was 54\% lower than for
   current year's leaves. When leaves were fully senesced, nitrogen
   concentration decreased to about 40\% of the concentration in
   non-senesced leaves, in both CO2 treatments. In April, net
   photosynthesis was 97\% greater in leaves grown in elevated C-a than in
   those grown at ambient. During the period when elevated C-a delayed leaf
   senescence, more leaves operating at higher photosynthetic rate would
   allow the ecosystem dominated by Q. myrtifolia to gain more carbon at
   elevated C-a than at ambient C-a.}},

Abstract = {{Sudden death syndrome of soybean (Glycine max) is caused by the
   soilborne fungus, Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines, that infects soybean
   roots. Besides root necrosis, symptoms include interveinal leaf
   chlorosis, necrosis and premature defoliation. It is proposed that a
   fungal toxin is produced in soybean roots and translocated to foliage.
   In this study, we isolated compounds from soybean stem exudates from
   plants that were either inoculated or not inoculated with F. solani f.
   sp. glycines. A protein with an estimated molecular mass of 17 kDa and
   designated as FISP 17 for F: solani f. sp. glycines-induced stress
   protein was identified using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis. This protein occurred only in F. solani f. sp.
   glycines-infected soybean stem exudates. The N-terminal amino acid
   sequence of the purified protein had 100 \% identity with a
   starvation-associated message 22 protein, and 80 and 78 \% identity with
   purified bean pathogenesis-related proteins, PvPR1 and PvPR2,
   respectively. To determine if the protein was of plant or fungal origin,
   a synthetic peptide was designed based on the N-terminal sequence and
   used to raise a polyclonal antibody from rabbit. Western blot analysis
   showed that the antibody only reacted with a 17-kDa protein in F. solani
   f. so. glycines-infected plant exudates, but no reaction occurred with
   healthy plant exudates or with culture filtrates of F. solani f. Sp.
   glycines. This is the first report of the presence of a stress-induced
   protein in stem exudates of soybean seedlings root-infected with F:

Abstract = {{The effect of increased perceived risk of predation on the trajectory
   describing the daily gain in body mass of captive Greenfinches Carduelis
   chloris was tested. Theoretically, increased risk of predation is
   expected to shift the gain in body mass towards the latter part of the
   day and reduce body mass. The perceived risk of predation was increased
   with a stuffed flying hawk three times per day. Following each
   presentation of the predator, foraging stopped and the birds lost mass.
   When feeding resumed, the birds compensated for the mass loss by
   increasing the rate of body mass gain, in line with theoretical
   predictions. In the presence of the predator, the daily accumulation of
   body reserves was lower compared with risk-free situations. However, on
   the days following presentation of the hawk, when the birds were
   presumably aware of an increased risk of predation, Greenfinches did not
   exhibit the predicted change in reserve accumulation, but rather
   maintained their usual pattern of body mass gain.}},

   through transverse homogeneous cold plasma. We derive a steady-structure
   equation of laser pulse and solve it under different on-axis conditions.
   We compare Hamiltonian values at solutions with different on-axis
   conditions to examine their relative stability. Numerical results show
   that for different ionic density, symmetric structure is not always
   stable relative to asymmetric one of same power. For a given ionic
   density, whether a symmetric structure is stable is determined by its
   power. This result agrees with the phenomenon of pulse ``head
   bending{''}, qualitatively. Our theory reveals that, in addition to the
   plasma's transverse inhomogeneity, there is another mechanism
   responsible for asymmetric structure.}},

Abstract = {{In this report, the O(D-1)+CH4 reaction has been reinvestigated using
   universal crossed molecular beam methods. Angular resolved

   Different product angular distributions have been observed for these
   product channels, indicating that these reaction channels occur via
   distinctive dynamical pathways. This study provides an excellent example
   of multiple dynamical pathways in a single chemical reaction, which
   opens enormous opportunities in investigating the dynamics of
   complicated chemical reactions that are important in combustion and
   atmospheric chemistry, and also provides a link between kinetics studies
   and dynamical research. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{We describe a new method for the site-specific incorporation of an
   extrinsic cysteine to the C-termini of immunoglobulin G (IgG) using
   carboxypeptidase Y (CPase Y) catalyzed transpeptidation. The
   transpeptidase activity of CPase Y was employed to attach cysteine
   esters to the C-termini of the IgG molecule (cysteinylation) at alkaline
   pH. No CPase Y catalyzed transpeptidation products were found when
   native IgG was used as the substrate or when cysteine was used as the
   nucleophile. However, C-terminal labeling occurred when cysteine ethyl
   ester (CysOEt) or cysteine isobutyl ester (CysOiBu) was used as the
   nucleophile and IgG methyl ester as the substrate. When CysOiBu was used
   as the nucleophile, the maximal labeling yield obtained with IgG methyl
   ester as substrate was 25\%, assuming all four C-termini in the IgG
   molecule were labeled equally. The C-terminal labeling pattern of
   cysteinylated IgG was determined by autoradiography followed by the
   integration of radio-density. It revealed that both the C-termini of the
   heavy and light chains of IgG methyl ester were labeled with CysOiBu.

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: There is an ongoing discussion whether Lisch corneal dystrophy
   (band-shaped and whorled microcystic dystrophy of the corneal
   epithelium) represents a disorder that is different from Meesmann
   corneal dystrophy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate at the
   molecular level if Lisch and Meesmann corneal dystrophies are
   genetically distinct.
   METHODS: We examined at the slit lamp a total of 48 members of a family
   with an aggregation of Lisch corneal dystrophy. Genomic DNA was
   extracted from leukocytes of the peripheral blood of seven affected and
   six unaffected members of this family. Mutational hotspots in the
   cornea-specific keratin genes K3 and K12 were scanned for mutations by
   single-strand conformation analysis. To test for linkage to the keratin
   K3 or K12 loci or for X-chromosomal inheritance, six (K3) and four (K12)
   microsatellite markers each flanking the keratin loci as well as 22
   microsatellite markers covering the X-chromosome were typed. Linkage was
   analyzed using the MLINK and FASTMAP procedures.
   RESULTS: A total of 19 trait carriers were identified in six generations
   of the family. No hereditary transmission from father to son was
   observed. Linkage was excluded for the keratin K3 and K12 genes.
   Furthermore, single-strand conformation analysis detected no mutations
   in these genes. Multipoint linkage analysis revealed linkage with a
   maximum likelihood of the odds (LOD) score of 2.93 at Xp22.3, Linkage
   was excluded for Xp22.2 to Xqter.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lisch corneal dystrophy is genetically different from
   Meesmann corneal dystrophy. Evidence was found for linkage of the gene
   for Lisch corneal dystrophy to Xp22.3. (C) 2000 by Elsevier Science Inc.

Abstract = {{Purposes: To compare the degree of curvature in the dose-response for
   chromosome aberrations and for radiation-induced cancer.
   Materials and methods: Comparison of the ratio of the quadratic and
   linear coefficients (in dose) in Japanese atomic bomb survivor cancer
   incidence data, based on follow-up to 1987 and taking account of random
   errors in DS86 dose estimates with the same ratio in four datasets of
   chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes measured in vitro
   and exposed to Co-60 gamma radiation.
   Results: There are no statistically significant differences between the
   four in vitro datasets in the ratio of the quadratic to the linear
   coefficients for dicentrics or chromosome translocations, nor are there
   indications of differences between this ratio for dicentrics and that
   for complete chromosome translocations (p > 0.1 in all cases). If the
   0-4 Gy dose range is used in the Japanese atomic bomb survivor data, the
   ratio of the quadratic to the linear coefficients for all solid cancers
   is 0.06Sv(-1) (95\% CI -0.22, 0.67) and so is not significantly
   different from 0; this ratio is statistically highly inconsistent (p <
   0.0001) with the analogous ratio estimated for the in vitro chromosome
   aberration data (4-.20Sv(-1); 95\% CI 3.06, 6.51). By contrast, there
   are no statistically significant differences (p = 0.42) between the
   ratio of the quadratic to the linear coefficients for leukaemia
   incidence in the Japanese cohort, 1.81Sv(-1) (95\% CI 0.21, > 1000),
   with that for chromosome aberrations in vitro. These results are not
   markedly changed if the 0-2 Gy dose range is used in the Japanese atomic
   bomb survivor data.
   Conclusions: It is unlikely that in vitro chromosome aberrations could
   be a correlate for the initiating radiogenic lesions leading to
   radiation-induced solid cancers. However, taken together with certain
   other biological information, it may not be unreasonable on this basis
   to use in vitro chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes
   as a correlate of the radiogenic lesions leading to radiation-induced
   leukaemia.}},

Abstract = {{A closed form analytical solution to the Pennes' equation with random
   heating was obtained using the Green's function method. To meet the
   requirements for the tumor killing temperature and the kin burn
   threshold, an approach to optimize the cancer hyperthermia parameters
   was proposed. For clinical practices, a solution to reveal the
   relationship between skin surface temperature and the transient
   temperature inside the tissue was obtained. Parametric study shows the
   feasibility of the heating optimization. The present approach ran be
   incorporated in the apparatus to establish a noninvasive hyperthermia
   system.}},

Abstract = {{tinder pure shear loading, an off-axis element of orthotropic material
   such as pure wood undergoes both sheer and normal deformations. The
   ratio of the shear strain to a normal strain is defined as the shear
   coupling coefficient associated with the direction of the normal strain.
   The effects of shear coupling on shear properties of wood as predicted
   by the orthotropic elasticity theory were validated using our recently
   developed shear test fixture. The validation also serves to demonstrate
   that the shear test fixture possesses the capability to introduce a
   state of pure shear to the critical section of a specimen as required
   and that orthotropic elasticity theory should be used to describe the
   mechanical properties of pure wood.}},
