Abstract = {{Samples from 14 seismic shothole and 3 outcrop samples drilled by Shell
   Petroleum Development Tanzania Limited in the Mandawa area of southern
   Tanzania were subjected to micropaleontological analyses and
   interpretation. The early Cretaceous foraminiferal microfaunas
   identified comprise short ranging index fossils indicative of a Late
   Albian-Early Cenomanian age. Foraminiferal assemblage zones were
   identified on the basis of zonal marker species.
   The Upper Cenomanian-Lower Albian marine sediments of the Mandawa area,
   are very rich in single keeled and non-keeled planktic foraminifera.
   Stratigraphically important foraminiferal species in the Tanzanian
   samples are illustrated by SEM micrographs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of finding an optimal \& sub-optimal
   task-allocation (assign the processing node for each module of a task or
   program) in redundant distributed computing systems, with the goal of
   maximizing system-reliability (probability that the system completes the
   entire task successfully). Finding an optimal task-allocation is NP-hard
   in the strong sense. An efficient algorithm is presented for optimal
   task-allocation in a distributed computing system with level-2
   redundancy. The algorithm, a) uses branch \& bound with underestimates
   for reducing the average time complexity of optimal task-allocation
   computations, and b) reorders the list of modules to allow a subset of
   modules that does not intra-communicate to be assigned last, for further
   reduction in the computations of optimal task-allocation for maximizing
   reliability. An efficient heuristic algorithm is given which obtains
   sub-optimal solutions in a reasonable computation time. The performance
   of our algorithms is given over a wide range of parameters such as:
   number of modules, number of processing nodes, ratio of average
   execution cost to average communication cost, and connectivity of
   modules. The effectiveness of the optimal task-allocation algorithm is
   demonstrated by comparing it to a recent competing optimal
   task-allocation algorithm, for maximizing reliability. The performance
   of our algorithm improves very much when the difference between the
   number of modules and the connectivity increases. Our heuristic
   algorithm produced optimal solutions in 24\% of the cases and found
   allocations within 1.5 times the optimal in about 86\% of the cases.1}},

Abstract = {{Part I of this paper {[}1] experimental results were presented and
   discussed. In this part, we investigate theoretically the dynamics of
   end-pumped solid-state lasers due to enhanced spatial hole burning. This
   becomes possible by a fast numerical implementation of the saturated
   gain in the presence of strong spatial hole burning that allows to treat
   the multimode case for an arbitrary pumping level. We find for a wide
   range of laser parameters that the mode spacing of the cw running modes
   is essentially determined by the length of the gain medium and only
   weakly depends on the absorption depth of the pump transition. It is
   shown that spatial hole burning can lead to a completely flat saturated
   gain profile over half of the gain bandwidth. In mode-locked lasers, the
   flat gain due to spatial hole burning results in shorter pulses. But the
   pulses are neither Gaussian-nor sech-shaped as they are in actively or
   passively mode-locked lasers without: spatial hole burning. Further, we
   show that soliton-like pulse shaping can be used to restore a
   transform-limited sech-shaped pulse in an end-pumped solid-state laser
   while exploiting the full gain bandwidth of the laser material.}},

   quantum well structures (10 periods each) with doping concentrations
   from 1 x 10(19) cm(-3) to 4 x 10(20) cm(-3) grown by Si molecular beam
   epitaxy were used in the experiment. It was found that as the doping in
   the quantum well is increased the peak position of the transition moves
   to a higher energy. This behavior is due to the formation of delta-like
   potential well inside the quantum well and the collective nature of the
   intersubband transitions. In order to assess the experimental data,
   transition energies for different doping concentrations are calculated
   using a self-consistent scheme. The experimental data are in good
   agreement with the calculation if the many-body effects are
   incorporated. This work demonstrates the importance of doping effects in

Abstract = {{Hyperlipidemia has been associated with the development of transplant
   coronary vasculopathy (TCV) in heart transplant recipients and chronic
   rejection in kidney transplant recipients. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors
   (HMGCoARIs) are effective in treating post-transplant hyperlipidemia,
   but their effects on patient and graft outcome remain unclear. In a
   prospective randomized trial investigating pravastatin (PVS) use early
   after heart transplantation, we observed that PVS treated patients had a
   decreased incidence of clinically severe acute rejection episodes
   resulting in a significant improvement in one year survival (94\% vs.
   78\% in the control group, P = 0.02), and decreases in both the
   incidence and progression of TCV. This observation was validated in a
   prospective randomized study of kidney transplant recipients where we
   found that PVS reduced the incidence of acute rejection episodes (25\%
   vs. 58\% in the control group, P = 0.01). In both the heart and kidney
   transplant recipients taking PVS, we noted decreases in natural killer
   cell (NKC) cytotoxicity. In vitro studies reveal that: PVS inhibits NKC
   cytotoxicty; PVS acts synergistically with cyclosporine to inhibit
   cytotoxic lymphocyte activity; and, other HMGCoARIs inhibit T-cell
   proliferation and monocyte chemotaxis. In conclusion, HMGCoARIs may have
   immunosuppressive properties in transplant recipients that could be
   useful in combating acute and chronic rejection.}},

Abstract = {{Cytosolic Ca2+ transients induced by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were
   imaged in primary cultured rat hepatocytes using newly developed rapid
   scanning confocal microscopes and Indo-1. HGF (40 ng/ml) increased
   cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ({[}Ca2+](i)) In about 60\% of
   hepatocytes, in 45\% of which the increases were oscillatory. In each of
   the oscillatory hepatocytes, the repetitive increases in {[}Ca2+](i)
   originated from a specific same region adjacent to the cell membrane and
   propagated across the cell like waves. Phenylephrine (10 mu M) also
   induced Ca2+ waves. The locus where HGF-induced Ca2+ waves and
   phenylephrine-induced Ca2+ waves were originated was the same, and there
   was a correlation in the peak height between HGF-induced Ca2+ waves and
   phenylephrine-induced Ca2+ waves in each cell, although the mechanisms
   of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P-3) formation induced by HGF
   should be different from those by phenylephrine. On the other hand,
   there was no correlation between sensitivity of each cell to HGF and
   that to phenylephrine which were measured as latent periods prior to
   Ca2+ rises after an addition of the agonists. These results suggested
   the following: the spatial patterns of Ca2+ waves were decided by a
   common mechanism, probably not the propagation of Ins(1,4,5)P-3 but the
   distribution of Ins(1,4,5)P-3-sensitive Ca2+ pools; sensitivities of
   each cell to the agonists did not mainly depend on the common mechanism.}},

   male patients with liver cirrhosis (23 alcoholic, 33 viral) age- and
   Child's grade-matched, and 20 age-matched healthy men, as a control
   group, were included in this study. Clinical signs of hypogonadism and
   feminization were examined in the cirrhotic patients.
   Follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin,
   testosterone, free testosterone, estradiol, androstenedione,
   dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and sex hormone-binding globulin were
   estimated in all groups. Seminal fluid was also analyzed in 7 alcoholic
   and 15 viral cirrhotics. Serum levels of estradiol, androstenedione, and
   sex hormone-binding globulin were significantly higher, and free
   testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels were
   significantly lower in both groups of cirrhotics compared with the

   found to have higher estradiol and lower free testosterone levels than
   child's A and B patients. Alcoholic and viral cirrhotics had markedly
   reduced sperm motility and density. The differences between alcoholic
   and viral cirrhotic patients in the clinical signs of hypogonadism,
   serum levels of sex steroids, and the results of seminal fluid analysis
   were not statistically significant. These findings suggest that liver
   cirrhosis per se, independent of etiology, causes hypogonadism and

   correlates well with the severity of liver failure.}},

   applied pressures. An electromechanical device was used to advance a
   probe tip 0.6 mm in diameter into the facial sulcus at a constant speed
   until resisting forces of 0.70 N were encountered. The device registered
   the resisting force and probe advancement simultaneously. The gingiva of
   all 2nd incisors, 2nd premolars, and 1st molars of 4 young adult male
   beagle dogs were tested. After the first measurement, the buccal gingiva
   of experimental sites were incised mesiodistally from the gingival
   margin to the alveolar crest and the sulcus was reprobed. 2 experimental
   and control quadrants were selected randomly resulting in 6 sets of both
   experimental and control data from each animal. The data were analyzed
   with analysis of variance. The analysis demonstrated significant
   variation from site to site, and dog to dog; therefore, only changes
   between the 1st and 2nd probings at the same sites could be compared.
   Less variability of probing distance in different animals occurred at
   higher forces; however, the incision had a significant effect on probing
   distance at these forces. The pressure at which probing distance had
   less variability among animals and least affected when the gingival
   sulcular wall was incised was estimated to be 106 N/cm(2). This
   corresponds to 30 g force on the 0.6 mm diameter probe.}},

Abstract = {{The complex (patho-)physiological events accompanying heating of tumor
   tissues have been reviewed, with particular emphasis on the changes in
   blood flow, oxygenation, metabolic and bioenenergetic status. In human
   tumors, pronounced heterogeneity is seen in rates of blood flow, and
   flow changes upon heating are unpredictable and spatially and temporally
   variable. Flow increases in some cases may result in improved heat
   dissipation such that therapeutically relevant temperatures may not be
   achieved. Tumor oxygenation changes tend to reflect alterations in blood
   flow during hyperthermia with increases in oxygenation followed by a
   return to baseline levels being reported for some human and experimental
   tumors, at least upon moderate hyperthermia. Also, a large amount of
   variation is seen in changes in tumor glucose levels upon hyperthermia,
   although these appear to be related to changes in blood flow and the
   development of interstitial edema. Lactate levels increase upon
   hyperthermia as a result of intensified glycolysis. Tumor pH (both
   intra- and extracellular) decrease upon high-dose hyperthermia, with
   subsequent recovery depending on the dose of hyperthermia delivered.
   Tumor bioenergetic status worsens during hyperthermia, as evidenced by
   decreases in ATP and phosphocreatine and increases in inorganic
   phosphate. ATP hydrolysis results in an accumulation of the purine
   catabolites hypoxanthine, xanthine and uric acid and proton formation,
   which may in turn contribute to a heat-induced acidosis. Additionally,
   the formation of highly reactive oxygen species may contribute to heat
   induced cytotoxicity.}},

   had positive margins after the diagnostic procedure. Pathologically,
   diagnosis was based on histology, with confirmation by CD34 staining.
   Definitive surgical therapy consisted of wide local excision (1-3 cm
   margins) in 5 patients and Moh's micrographic resection in 2 patients.
   There have been no local recurrences or distant metastases, with a mean

Abstract = {{Gc-globulin (vitamin D binding protein) has been shown to augment
   significantly the leukocyte chemotactic activity of the activated C
   peptides C5a and C5a(desArg) (i.e., the co-chemotactic effect). However,
   the mechanism of chemotaxis enhancement is not known. To investigate the
   role that the neutrophil plays in this process, cells were co-incubated
   with Gc-globulin for up to 45 min and washed, and their subsequent
   chemotactic response to a suboptimal concentration of C5a alone was
   measured during a 30-min assay. The generation of co-chemotactic
   activity during the preincubation period was time dependent, showed
   minimal activity for the first 10 min and a steep rise from 10 to 20
   min, and was maximal and stable at 30 min. The binding of radiolabeled
   Gc-globulin by neutrophils at 37 degrees C mirrored this time-dependent
   generation of C5a co-chemotactic activity, with stable cellular levels
   achieved between 30 and 45 min at 36 +/- 4 fmol (2 +/- 0.1 ng)/10(6)
   cells. The binding of radiolabeled Cc-globulin and the generation of
   co-chemotactic activity were dependent upon physiologic temperatures (37
   degrees C) and levels of Ca2+ (1.3 mM) and Mg2+ (0.8 mM), and were
   inhibited by an Ab to Gc-globulin. Finally, the C5a co-chemotactic
   activity of Gc-globulin would decay rapidly if neutrophils were washed
   and then incubated a second time at 37 degrees C before chemotaxis to
   C5a. These results demonstrate that neutrophils bind exogenous
   Gc-globulin and generate C5a co-chemotactic activity in a time-,
   temperature-, and divalent cation-dependent manner. Moreover, this
   activity is transient if neutrophils lack a continuous supply of
   Gc-globulin.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: 1. To compare the pulsatility index (PI) of the umbilical
   artery in two groups of fetuses versus controls: those who had ductal
   constriction after maternal indomethacin therapy and those who had no
   ductal constriction.
   2. To evaluate the paired changes in umbilical artery PI in the
   individual fetus who had ductal constriction.
   Methods: Image-directed pulsed Doppler echocardiography was performed in
   two groups of fetuses, 48 fetuses from normal pregnancies and 44 fetuses
   whose mothers received indomethacin for premature labor. Maximal fetal
   blood velocity waveforms of ductus arteriosus and umbilical artery were
   recorded and analyzed for maximal, end-diastolic, and mean velocity. The
   PIs of these two vessels were calculated.
   Results: The umbilical artery PI in studies with ductal constriction was
   significantly lower than those in the group without ductal constriction
   and the normal control. In the individual fetus who had ductal
   constriction, the umbilical artery PI was also decreased significantly
   when the ductal constriction occurred compared with the baseline value.
   Conclusions: Indomethacin exposure sufficient to cause ductal
   constriction has an effect on the placental blood velocity pattern. The
   decrease in PI suggested decreased placental resistance, perhaps by the
   differential effect of indomethacin on the production of prostacyclin
   and thromboxane or by the mechanical effect of uterine relaxation.}},

Abstract = {{Dopamine release from dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra plays
   an important role in regulating their activity. In the present
   experiments the whole-cell clamp technique was used to elucidate the
   modulatory role of dopamine on K+ conductance in substantia nigra
   neurons in culture. In pars compacta neurons held near the resting
   potential, dopamine and quinpirole (a D-2 receptor agonist) increased
   membrane conductance. This response was blocked by S(-)-sulpiride, a D-2
   receptor antagonist. The current-voltage relation of the
   quinpirole-induced current showed an inward rectification with a
   reversal potential that approximately equaled the K+ equilibrium
   potential. Intracellular application of a non-hydrolysable GTP analogue,
   guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate; 0.1-0.5 mM) into pars compacta
   neurons produced an initial spontaneous increase in an inwardly
   rectifying K+ conductance. Quinpirole markedly accelerated this
   conductance increase. In cells loaded with a poorly metabolized GDP
   analogue, guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate), the quinpirole response
   was diminished. Treatment of pars compacta neurons with pertussis toxin
   abolished the D-2 response. Intracellular application of cyclic AMP (1
   mM) neither mimicked nor occluded the D-2 response. These results
   indicate that D-2 receptor agonists produce neuronal inhibition by
   activating an inwardly rectifying K+ current, that this D-2 agonist
   effect is mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, and that
   cyclic AMP does not mediate the D-2 response. Unexpectedly, in cells
   loaded with guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) after the inwardly
   rectifying K+ conductance spontaneously reached a maximum, it started to
   decline slowly. In cells loaded with guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate),
   the quinpirole response became diminished at first, but then the
   membrane conductance slowly increased, together with an increase in the
   quinpirole response. These results were explained by an interplay of two
   G proteins, one producing an increase and the other producing a decrease
   in the K+ conductance. In some pars reticulata neurons, R(+)-SKF-38393
   (a D-1 receptor agonist) reduced an inwardly rectifying K+ conductance;
   this would excite the neuron under current clamp conditions.
   The present study shows that cultured substantia nigra neurons produce
   functional responses to dopamine agonists. Using these neurons, the
   ionic mechanisms and signal transduction mechanisms of the responses
   were elucidated in a more critical manner than in previous studies.}},

Abstract = {{Setting: Longitudinal epidemiological study based on diabetic and
   non-diabetic civil servants in Korea.
   Objective: To determine a comparative incidence of pulmonary
   tuberculosis (PTB) between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects.
   Design: Investigation of newly developed PTB among diabetics and
   non-diabetics between 1988 and 1990, on the basis of biennial medical
   examination and the medical records of those who claimed health
   insurance for tuberculosis.
   Results: The 1990 medical examination and investigation of medical
   records of the health insurance claimants revealed that PTB had
   developed in 170 patients (including 37 smear and eight culture
   positives) among 8015 diabetics, and in 4935 patients (including 538
   smear and 342 culture positives) among 806 698 control subjects.
   Estimated annual incidence rates of PTB of (1) all types, (2) smear
   and/or culture positive versus (3) smear positive cases were 1061, 281
   and 231 per 10(5) respectively among diabetics and 306, 55 and 33 per
   10(5) among non-diabetic controls. PTB developed in 167 of 7695 male
   diabetics and in 3 of 320 female diabetics, The greater the age, the
   more diabetics were found.
   Conclusion: Relative risks (RR) of developing PTB of all types and
   bacteriologically confirmed cases were 3.47 times and 5.15 times higher
   in the diabetics than in the matched controls, A greater RR was observed
   in those at the age of 30-49 than in those of 50 years or more.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously reported that a monoclonal antibody 1D11 derived from

   increased production of IL-3, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in the IL-3-dependent
   bone marrow-derived cell line FDC-P2/185-4. In this report, we analyzed
   a sequence of cDNA encoding the V region of 1D11, and found that V-H and
   V-L segments of 1D11 belonged to the J558 and V-kappa 21 family,
   respectively, The nucleotide sequence of 1D11 in the V-H Segment was
   highly homologous to that of AM9, a monoclonal RF derived from MRL/lpr
   mouse, and the only difference was the replacement of 3 nucleotides in
   the framework region 1 (FR1), However, the deduced amino acid sequence
   of 1D11 was identical to that of AM9, In contrast with the V-H segment,
   the sequences of the V-L regions of these two antibodies were quite
   different from each other; 1D11 showed a 3 base deletion in the FR2 and
   a 24 base insertion in the FR3 compared with AM9, At present, the
   mechanisms of such insertions or deletions in the FRs of autoantibodies
   are almost unknown, It is generally accepted that the differences in
   specificity and affinity of these autoantibodies depend on differences
   of CDR sequence, However, it is possible that not only CDRs but also FRs
   of autoantibodies play a critical role in pathogenicity and/or
   specificity in autoimmune diseases.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of comparing 3-D transform and iterative

   The algorithms compared are the 3-D-reprojection (3DRP) method, the

   likelihood (ML-EM) algorithm, For the iterative methods, alternatives to
   the cubic voxel basis functions are also implemented, The comparisons
   are based on a series of figures of merit, including the point-spread
   function, the contrast recovery coefficient, and signal-to-noise ratios
   (SNR). The results show that the ART method implemented with the new
   basis functions requires only one cycle through the data to produce
   images with measured SNR values comparable to or better than the 3DRP
   method, The ML-ER I method was run for 10 iterations and produced images
   with lower SNR values for the test phantom used, With the exception of
   the ML-EM results, these are in agreement with our previous simulation

   tgm showed histologically evident neutrophilia in BM. Increase in
   precursors of granulocytes and monocytes in hIL-6 tgm was demonstrated
   by an assay for colony forming unit in culture (CFU-C) of BM cells.
   Decrease in osteoblasts and osteoid and suppression of primary spongiosa
   formation were predominantly observed in hIL-6 tgm at 14 weeks old, the
   terminal stage of life for hIL-6 tgm. An assay for colony forming unit
   in fibroblastic (CFU-F) of BM cells revealed a decrease in osteoblast
   precursor (with regard to alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies) in
   hIL-6 tgm at 15 weeks old. Histomorphometry demonstrated a decrease of
   both osteoclast number and bone resorption in hIL-6 tgm. These results
   suggested that enhanced granulocytic hematopoiesis, suppressed bone
   turnover, and alteration of cellular population in stromal cells in BM
   occurred in hIL-6 tgm. Thus we provide new findings that facilitate
   understanding of cellular interrelationships among hematopoietic cells,

Abstract = {{One of the most beautiful and important results in geometric convexity
   is Hadwiger's characterization theorem for the quermassintegrals.
   Hadwiger's theorem classifies all continuous rigid motion invariant
   valuations on convex bodies as consisting of the linear span of the
   quermassintegrals (or, equivalently, of the intrinsic volumes) {[}4].
   Hadwiger's characterization leads to effortless proofs of numerous
   results in integral geometry, including various kinematic formulas {[}7,
   9] and the mean projection formulas for convex bodies {[}10]. Hadwiger's
   result also provides a connection between rigid motion invariant set
   functions and symmetric polynomials {[}1, 7].
   Unfortunately the only known proof of Hadwiger's result until now has
   been that given in {[}4] and is the product of a long and arduous
   sequence of cut and paste arguments.
   The purpose of this paper is to present a new and shorter proof of
   Hadwiger's characterization theorem, digestible within a few minutes. En
   route to this result is a more general characterization of volume in
   Euclidean space. The proof relies almost entirely on elementary
   techniques, with the exception of Proposition 3.1, a well-known
   consequence of the theory of spherical harmonics.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we investigated the influence of red Light, which
   naturally occurs during dawn and dusk, on locomotor activity and body
   temperature rhythms of Djungarian hamsters (Phonopus sungarus). A single
   weak red light pulse given 2 h before regular lights on had acute as
   well as long-term effects persisting for several days following
   exposure. The hamsters immediately stopped their locomotor activity,
   accompanied by a drop in body temperature. In the following undisturbed
   nights (LD 16:8) the nocturnal activity stopped earlier than usual. This
   lasting effect of the light pulse was more pronounced than the acute
   effect. The activity phase compressed gradually during 3 to 5 days after
   the light pulse was administered while time of activity onset was almost
   unaffected. It took 6 to 11 days for complete recovery of the original
   activity phase. The maximal activity compression and the recovery period
   depended on the duration of the single red light pulse and its
   intensity. Red light pulses of 15 min duration were about twice
   effective as 1 min pulses; and the effect of a red light pulse of 130
   mW/m(2) was about 1.5 times stronger than a 30 mW/m(2) red light pulse.
   The maximal value of activity phase compression reached in this
   experiment was 2.5 + 0.2 h with a recovery period of 11.1 +/- 0.3 days
   following a given red light pulse of 90 mW/m(2) and 15 min. The
   `'morning oscillator'' seems to be persistently affected. This indicates
   a very high photosensitivity of the Djungarian hamster's circadian
   system to red light.}},

   oxygen saturation, and cardiac rhythm were examined before and after
   phlebotomy, and response to orthostatic challenge was evaluated,

   to baseline hemodynamic measurements, significant differences between
   the groups' responses to phlebotomy were not observed, After whole blood

   0.062), In candidates for lung transplantation there was a mean change
   of +2.2 mm Hg after orthostatic challenge versus a mean change of +8.5
   mm Hg in their control subjects (p = 0.052), Furthermore, no changes in
   cardiac rhythm or arterial oxygen saturation were detected, Conclusions:
   The hemodynamic effects of autologous blood donation in a group of
   patients with significant cardiac or pulmonary disease were not
   different from those observed in patients considered acceptable
   candidates for autologous blood collection, On the basis of these
   objective findings, we believe that patients with less severe degrees of
   heart or lung disease should not be excluded from participation in
   autologous blood donation programs.}},

Abstract = {{Study objective - To assess whether small area measures of socioeconomic
   deprivation predict variation in individual smoking behaviour. To
   examine the adequacy of an individual level statistical model for the
   analysis of data on groups of individuals who live in the same
   geographical area.
   Design - Individual level and two level logistic regression analysis of
   data on individual smoking from a regional health survey, and
   neighbourhood deprivation scores for 1991 census wards calculated from
   1991 census data.
   Setting - The North West Thames Regional Health Authority area.
   Participants - Random sample of 8251 adults in North West Thames Region.
   Main results - There was a highly significant association between being
   a smoker and the neighbourhood deprivation score of the area of
   residence. With the two level model, after allowing for age and sex, the
   estimated odds ratio of being a smoker for an individual in the highest
   quintile of deprivation compared with someone in the lowest quintile was
   1.52 (95\% confidence interval 1.33, 1.74). Results obtained using the
   individual level model were similar. Variation between wards accounted
   for around 6\% of the total variation in smoking behaviour after
   neighbourhood deprivation of the ward had been taken into account.
   Deprivation of the area of residence remained a significant predictor of
   smoking status even after the socioeconomic group of the individual had
   been taken into account.
   Conclusions - Neighbourhood deprivation of the area of residence is a
   predictor of smoking status of individuals. In this example the two
   level model was reasonably well approximated by the individual level
   model.}},

Abstract = {{The oxidation behaviour of one-dimensional and two-dimensional SiC fibre
   reinforced SiC was investigated up to 1520 degrees C in air, as well as
   in water vapour saturated air and argon by calorimetry, DTA and TGA. The
   oxidation process takes place in three steps: (1) oxidation of free
   carbon in the carbon coated composites between 530 and 690 degrees C
   with mass losses up to 7.5\%; (2) a fast exothermal process associated
   with mass gain starting at 800 degrees C and terminated below 1500
   degrees C within 1 h; (3) the diffusion controlled oxidation of bulk
   SiC. The processes follow a logarithmic rate law between 875 and 985
   degrees C with an effective activation energy Q = 84 kJ/mol. The
   amorphous reaction product SiO2 transforms to cristobalite at (930 +/-
   50)degrees C. The oxidation kinetics follows a quadratic rate law above
   1000 degrees C with rate constants k = 3.5 X 10(-7) g(2)/cm(4) h for 1D
   SiC/SiC and k = 5 x 10(-8) g(2)/cm(4) h for 2D SiC/SiC at 1520 degrees C
   in air. The rate constants are up to three orders of magnitude higher
   than that for high density monolithic SiC which is explained by the high
   porosity of the SiC matrix.}},

   homeostasis and adipocyte differentiation. The PGJ(2) metabolite
   15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-PGJ(2) binds directly to PPAR gamma and promotes
   efficient differentiation of C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts to adipocytes. These
   data provide strong evidence that a fatty acid metabolite can function

   thin films is reported. Two sets of (111) textured films, rapid annealed
   at 600 and 650 degrees C, were studied. The degree of texture and grain
   size as a function of Nb was analogous for the two sets. Surface
   coverage by a pyrochlore phase increased with Nb addition, however its
   quantity and distribution was determined by the annealing temperature,
   being less for the 650 degrees C set of films. For the two sets a strong
   continuous decay of the remanent and maximum polarizations, and the
   slope at the coercive field, (dP/dE)(Ec), was observed with increasing
   Nb. The remanent polarization was reduced by a scaling factor at any
   given field, yielding no changes in the saturation profiles as a
   function of doping. The difference of the maximum minus remanent
   polarization and the width of the loop were not influenced by Nb at any
   given field. A linear increase in coercive field asymmetry (up to
   40kV/cm) was observed with Nb addition, yet was field independent and

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The geophysical interpretation of satellite tracking residuals generally
   ignores the filtering effect of initial orbit correction on the true
   errors of the model. While the filtered information is usually regarded
   as lost, knowing the spectral characteristics of the filter is a great
   aid in the detailed interpretation of residuals, especially of global
   data sets. In this regard, we derive the filter characteristics
   (admittances) of orbit correction in the presence of geopotential-caused
   trajectory errors. We then apply the filter to determine the likely
   power of the lost radial information in crossover differences of sea
   heights determined from satellite altimetry or in the latitude lumped
   coefficients derived from them. For example, we find that resonant
   geopotential information with periods longer than the corrected orbit's
   are length is largely lost in residual crossover data. Results are given
   for GEOSAT, ERS-1 and TOPEX/Poseidon in their Exact Repeat Missions,
   using calibrated variance-covariance matrices of the harmonic
   geopotential coefficients of several recent Earth gravity models. To
   prove that filtering is important, we first employed a simple cut of all
   perturbing terms with periods longer than the general tracking period (4
   days for GEOSAT and ERS-1, and 10 days for TOPEX). But the cut is too
   crude a method from a theoretical viewpoint, and thus, we developed two
   new filters. A comparison of their admittances explains the differences
   (and sometimes anomalous behaviour) between them and the cut. Many
   numerical examples (single-satellite crossover errors and latitude
   lumped coefficient errors, as projected from the variance-covariance
   matrices) are presented.}},

   incorporation and pulse-chase experiments. ES-derived cardiomyocytes
   were mitotically active and predominantly mononucleated at 11 days after
   cardiogenic induction. By 21 days postinduction, cardiomyocyte DNA
   synthesis was markedly decreased, with a concomitant increase in the
   percentage of multinucleated cells. Interestingly, the duration of
   active cardiomyocyte reduplication in the ES system appeared to be
   roughly similar to that observed during normal murine cardiogenesis.
   Given these observations, as well as the genetic tractability of ES

Abstract = {{Methods: MRI studies with high temporal resolution can be achieved with
   an optimized saturation recovery TurboFLASH sequence, which allows a
   more detailed characterization of contrast enhancement in tissue as is
   available with the current FLASH 3D techniques. A two compartment model
   allows characterization of signal time curves with three parameters, Amp
   (amplitude), k(21) (distribution rate constant) and k(el) (elimination
   rate constant).
   Results: In a prospective study on 314 patients with indetermined breast
   lesions signal-time-curves revealed differences in the k(21) parameter
   between benign (0.56+/-0.46) and malignant lesions (1.25+/-0.80) (p <
   0.0001) as well as between different histological classifications.
   Conclusion: The introduced MR technique enables a better evaluation of
   the vascular permeability for the MR contrast media in lesions. Distinct
   differences were detected, which are influenced by elevated expression
   of angiogenesis factors such as the vascular endothelial growth factor.}},

   BOSTON, MA, APR 20-22, 1995}},
Organization = {{Soc Pediat Cardiovasc Surg}},
Abstract = {{Background. We conceptualized that by adding small amounts of prograde
   pulmonary blood flow to the hemi-Fontan operation, or bidirectional
   Glenn procedure, this modified hemi-Fontan operation could be safely
   done at an early age, with better oxygenation, and with less potential
   for pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae.
   Methods. Since April 1992 the hemi-Fontan operation was modified by
   adding some prograde flow through the native pulmonary artery in 10
   high-risk infants, either by leaving the critical subpulmonary stenosis
   untreated (n = 6) or by tightening a previously placed pulmonary artery
   band (n = 4). All other sources of pulmonary blood now were interrupted.
   Patients were 4 to 23 months old (3.8 to 10.3 kg). Diagnoses included
   isolated dextrocardia with single ventricle (3) and polysplenia syndrome
   (2). Cardiopulmonary bypass was needed in 5 patients.
   Results. There were no hospital deaths. Mean postoperative intensive
   care unit stay was 2 days, and 9 of 10 patients were discharged within 7
   days of operation. One 4-month-old infant with Down's syndrome survived
   postoperative takedown of the hemi-Fontan repair after pneumonia and
   caval thrombosis developed. Eight patients are currently asymptomatic
   receiving minimal medication, and oxygen saturations range from 84\% to
   93\%.
   Conclusions. Adding small volumes of prograde pulmonary blood flow to
   the hemi-Fontan operation is safe, provides improved oxygenation, may
   encourage growth of central pulmonary arteries, and represent an
   alternative definitive palliation for high-risk Fontan candidates.}},

Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{To use RAPD method for the identification of evergreen azalea cultivars,
   the optimum method for DNB extraction in Rhododendron spp. was
   investigated. Of almost all Rhododendron species native to Japan and
   some cultivar groups, neither SDS nor CTAB method was sufficient to
   isolate clean DNA from leaves. But, by using the modified CTAB method
   after Greenwood et al. (1989), we obtained a good yield of high quality
   DNA from the materials used in this experiment.
   Using the optimum extraction method mentioned above and RAPD analysis,
   differences among azalea cultivars could be distinguished. Sixteen out
   of 100 primers tested produced obvious, definitive polymorphic DNA
   bands. Cultivars in the Edo-Kirishima group (9 cultivars) or Kurume
   azalea group (14 cultivars) were clearly recognized from one another by
   using primer OPK-19 or OPK-20. In the Satsuki group, these two primers
   could be used to discern `Kouzan' from its bud sport cultivars.
   The results of this study strongly suggest that RAPD method is a very
   useful tool for cultivar identification in evergreen azalea.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Severe peripheral arterial occlusive disease (pAOD) requires
   adequate diagnostic imagery of poststenotic and postocclusive vascular
   regions. This study was designed to evaluate the validity of i.a. DSA
   using fine-needle technique (FNA) especially concerning the vascular
   area of the lower limb.
   Material and methods: 206 FNA of the lower limb were evaluated
   retrospectively. Besides evaluation of the image quality of the 1119
   angiographic image series, main points of interest were the
   determination of accuracy of the FNA in comparison to the operative
   findings, the average radiocontrast agent consumption and the rate of
   complication.
   Results: In all cases the image quality was rated either very good or
   good in the pelvic, femoral and popliteal vessels. 94\% of the image
   series of the lower leg and foot could be rated as well as very
   good/good although 75\% of all patients demonstrated an advanced stage
   of pAOD. Accuracy of FNA compared to operative findings came up to 82\%.
   The average radiocontrast consumption amounted to 69 mi per examination.
   Overall, two major complications were seen.
   Conclusion: I.a. DSA of the lower limb using fine-needle-technique is an
   easily applied angiographic method of low radiocontrast agent
   consumption and a low complication rate. Essential information can be
   acquired preoperatively in planning far peripheral bypass anastomoses.
   Postoperative vascular complications can be safely assessed.}},

Abstract = {{In cell suspensions of tobacco LT cells, cultured on Linsmaier and Skoog
   medium with 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-acetic acid (2,4-D) as the sole plant

   accumulation of cells in the G2-phase of the cell cycle appeared to
   increase. Cells arrested in the G2-phase could enter mitosis and
   continue cycling after addition of 2,4-D or the auxin analogue NAA.
   Addition of cytokinins or 3,5-D did not enable passage of the cells into

Abstract = {{Effect of human recombinant thrombopoietin (TPO) on platelet activation
   in vitro was studied. Although TPO by itself did not cause platelet
   aggregation, it upregulated ADP-induced aggregation, especially the
   second wave of aggregation. This effect was dose-dependent for up to 5
   ng/ml of TPO. When platelets were activated by epinephrine, collagen, or
   alpha-thrombin, similar effect was observed. However, TPO did not affect
   A23187- or PMA-induced aggregation, suggesting that TPO may have
   modulated the signal transduction pathway upstream of inositol
   1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol production. TPO also upregulated
   thrombin-induced alpha-granule secretion. To clarify the involvement of
   protein tyrosine phosphorylation, platelets were activated by TPO and/or
   suboptimal concentration of ADP, then tyrosine phosphorylation was
   detected by immunoblot analysis, using anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal
   antibody. TPO by itself caused significant tyrosine phosphorylation of
   146, 130, 122, 108, 97, 94, and 88 kDa proteins. Further, by using
   antibodies against signal transduction molecules, for
   immunoprecipitation, we observed the significant tyrosine
   phosphorylation in Jak2 and Tyk2 molecules after TPO-stimulation. The
   results of the present experiment clearly indicate that TPO directly
   activated platelets and modulated intracellular signal transduction
   pathway.}},

   procaine to inhibit sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release in rabbit
   papillary muscles. Rapid cooling-induced contractures were used as an
   index of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content. Decay of potentiated state
   was measured to study whether the transsarcolemmal Ca2+ efflux is
   decreased in the presence of procaine. Procaine (0.5, 1.0 mM) inhibited
   contractions elicited by electrical stimulation and enhanced the rapid
   cooling-induced contracture. The initial decay of potentiated state that
   occurs when the muscle was stimulated at a Low frequency was slowed in
   the presence of procaine. These results suggest that procaine inhibition
   of Ca2+-induced release of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ decreases the
   transsarcolemmal Ca2+ efflux relative to the influx, resulting in an

Abstract = {{The in vitro effect of endothelin-1 (ET-1) on the capacity of
   polymerphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) to generate reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) was investigated. Human PMNLs were separated from healthy
   volunteers and preincubated for 10 min. at 37 degrees C with varying
   concentrations (10-(7)-10-(12) M) of ET-1. After subsequent stimulation
   with FMLP (10(-7) M) or opsonized zymosan (0.5 mg/ml) the intra- and
   extracellular generation of ROS was assessed by luminol-amplified
   chemiluminescence, superoxide radical (. O-2(-)) and hydrogen peroxide
   (H2O2) production. Results: ET-1 alone failed to stimulate ROS
   generation. Neither the capacity for extracellular generation of oxygen
   metabolites nor the production of ROS with an intracellular origin was
   changed after preincubation of PMNLs with ET-1. ET-1 did not cause a
   shift of the . O-2(-)/H2O2 production ratio after stimulation of PMNLs
   with FMLP. These findings suggest that ET-1 in vitro does not prime
   human PMNLs for enhanced production of ROS.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates evidence of dentatothalamic pathway
   lesions in nineteen patients with severe kinetic post-traumatic tremor
   retrospectively by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Kinetic tremor is
   thought to be characteristic of lesions of the cerebellar outflow While
   this hypothesis is supported by experimental data, neuropathological and
   neuroradiological findings have been limited. The appendicular tremors
   were unilateral in 13 patients and bilateral in 6, accounting for 25
   instances of tremor. The tremor developed after severe head trauma in 18
   patients. These patients had evidence of diffuse axonal injury on MRI.
   Postural and kinetic tremor was present in all patients, and was
   accompanied by tremor also present at rest in 14 instances. Multiplanar
   MRI studies were performed on a high-field MRI system operating at 2.0 T
   in 13 patients and on intermediate-field strength MRI systems in 6
   patients according to a standardized protocol. To detect small deposits
   of hemosiderin after post-traumatic lesions, the protocol included a
   heavily T2-weighted spin-echo pulse sequence. Lesions of the
   dentatothalamic pathways were found in 22 instances. The lesions were
   classified into different types according to their distribution. A
   lesion of the dentate nucleus ipsilateral to the tremor (type I) was
   found in one instance (4\%), lesions involving the ipsilateral
   predecussational dentatothalamic pathway (type II and III) were found in
   14 instances (56\%), and lesions involving the contralateral
   post-decussational course (type IV) in 7 instances (28\%). One patient
   with a mild head trauma had a lesion of the contralateral thalamus. The
   lesions appeared as hypointense, hyperintense or mixed. Two of three
   patients with a parkinsonian-like rest tremor had type IV lesions
   involving the substantia nigra. The nosological concepts of tremors are
   discussed. `Midbrain' tremor may have distinct pathoanatomical lesion
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{The notion of a transitive closure of a fuzzy relation is very useful
   for clustering in pattern recognition, for fuzzy databases, etc. It is
   based on translating the standard definition of transitivity and
   transitive closure into fuzzy terms. This definition works fine, but to
   some extent it does not fully capture our understanding of transitivity.
   The reason is that this definition is based on fuzzifying only the
   positive side of transitivity: if R(a, b) and R(b, c), then R(a, c); but
   transitivity also includes a negative side: if R(a, b) and not R(a, c),
   then not R(b, c). In classical logic, this negative statement follows
   from the standard `'positive'' definition of transitivity. In fuzzy
   logic, this negative part of the transitivity has-to be formulated as an
   additional demand. In the present article, we define a strongly
   transitive fuzzy relation as the one that satisfies both the positive
   and the negative parts of the transitivity demands, prove the existence
   of strong transitive closure, and find the relationship between strongly
   transitive similarity and clustering. (C) 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Polymerizations of cyclotrimethylenecarbonate (TMC) with SnCl4, SnBr4
   and SnI4 were conducted in bulk. The reaction time, the temperature and
   the monomer/initiator (M/I) ratio were varied, and the influence of
   these parameters on yields and molecular weights was investigated.
   Yields above 90\% were obtained with all these initiators, but the
   highest molecular weights (M(w) approximate to 1.5 x 10(5)) resulted
   from SnI4-initiated polymerizations. SnI4 has the additional advantage
   that the polycarbonates were free of ether groups when prepared at
   moderate temperatures (e.g. 60 degrees C). In contrast, SnCl4 and SnBr4
   cause partial decarboxylation even at 60 degrees C, and at higher
   temperatures up to 20 mol\% of the carbonate groups may be replaced by
   ether linkages. Furthermore, mechanistic studies were conducted. SnCl4
   and SnBr4 form solid 1:2 complexes with TMC at 20-25 degrees C.
   Infra-red, H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (n.m.r.)
   spectroscopies indicate complexation at the carbonyl oxygen. Kinetic
   measurements of polymerizations in solvents of different polarity
   suggest cationic polymerization mechanisms. In addition to CH2-OH, CH2Cl
   and CH2Br endgroups were detected by H-1 n.m.r. spectroscopy. The
   endgroup analyses of reaction mixtures and isolated poly(TMC) support
   the assumption of a cationic polymerization mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Unintended, accidental, or unavoidable human exposures may result from
   pesticide use. Risk Characterization provides registrants, regulators,
   and the public a means to assess relative risks of pesticide use.
   Exposure Assessments are less standardized. Potential Dermal Exposure
   (PDE; mg/kg) is the amount of contact with the potential for dermal
   absorption (DA). Mixer/loader/applicator data developed using passive
   dosimetry and skin washing forms a Tier 1 Generic Database. If
   disqualifying estimates are obtained a more accurate estimate (Tier 2)
   may be developed from measurements of DA, clothing protection, and PDE
   under use conditions. Direct estimates of absorbed dose (Tier 3) require
   metabolic and kinetic data and biological monitoring. Harvesters and
   other persons who contact treated surfaces need reentry intervals to
   minimize acute and chronic exposure. Work tasks, dislodgeable foliar
   residue, and duration of exposure are the foundations for
   exposure-based, generic estimates of harvester PDE.}},

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) is considered to contribute to the impairment of B
   cell function in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The effects of
   compounds that release NO were tested on the membrane potential and
   ionic currents of mouse pancreatic B cells using intracellular
   microelectrodes and the whole-cell patch-clamp technique.
   S-Nitroso-cysteine led to a concentration-dependent reduction of
   electrical activity induced by 15 nM glucose. At a concentration of 1
   mM, S-nitroso-cysteine caused a hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane
   with complete suppression of electrical activity. In about half of the
   cells tested, electrical activity reappeared during treatment with
   S-nitroso-cysteine or after wash-out. However, in the other cells the
   hyperpolarization was followed by a slow depolarization and electrical
   activity did not reappear. The perforated-patch whole-cell K-ATP(+)
   current first increased and subsequently decreased again during exposure
   to 1 mM S-nitroso-cysteine. With 0.1 and 0.01 mM S-nitroso-cysteine,
   only the rise of the current amplitude was observed. S-nitroso-cysteine
   (1 mM) almost completely abolished the current through voltage-dependent
   Ca2+ channels (measured with Ba2+ as charge carrier). Like
   S-nitroso-cysteine, 100 mu M sodium-nitroprusside, another donor, evoked
   a marked hyperpolarization of the membrane potential that was at least
   in part reversible. To further ascertain that the effect of
   S-nitroso-cysteine was mediated by NO, we tested the decomposition
   products of S-nitroso-cysteine. Nitrite and denitrosylated
   S-nitroso-cysteine (1 mM) did not alter electrical activity of B cells,
   whereas cysteine (1 mM) caused a slight depolarization. It is concluded
   that exogenous NO evokes rapid changes of B cell function by influencing
   the activity of ion channels.}},

Abstract = {{Discontinuity of grandparent-grandchiId relationships has been largely
   overlooked in social science research, despite the fact that the
   salience of the grandparent-grandchild attachment bond is the subject of
   considerable discussion. This article reports the results of an
   exploratory study of grandparent-grandchiId contact loss, by means of a
   survey of the core membership of five `'grandparent rights'' groups
   across Canada. As reflected in the particular concerns of this
   membership, there are four primary circumstances associated with
   grandparent loss of contact with grandchildren: parental divorce,
   conflict with both parents, death of adult child, and stepparent
   adoption following remarriage. Grandparents whose adult children are
   noncustodial parents (mostly paternal grandparents) are at high risk for
   contact lass, and adult children-in-law appear to be the primary
   mediators in the ongoing grandparent-grandchild relationship. Disrupted
   grandchild access is seen as having profound negative consequences for
   grandparents, and this has important implications for socio-legal policy
   and therapeutic practice.}},

Abstract = {{Water-protein interactions drive protein folding, stabilize the folded
   structure, and influence molecular recognition and catalysis. We
   analyzed the closest protein contacts of 10,837 water molecules in
   crystallographic structures to define a specific hydrophilicity scale
   reflecting specific rather than bulk solvent interactions. The
   tendencies of different atom and residue types to be the nearest protein
   neighbors of bound water molecules correlated with other hydrophobicity
   scales, verified the relevance of crystallographically determined water
   positions, and provided a direct experimental measure of water affinity
   in the context of the folded protein. This specific hydrophilicity was
   highly correlated with hydrogen-bonding capacity, and correlated better
   with experimental than computationally derived measures of partitioning
   between aqueous and organic phases. Atoms with related chemistry
   clustered with respect to the number of bound water molecules, Neutral
   and negatively charged oxygen atoms were the most hydrophilic, followed
   by positively-charged then neutral nitrogen atoms, followed by carbon
   and sulfur atoms. Agreement between observed side-chain specific
   hydrophilicity values and values derived from the atomic hydrophilicity
   scale showed that hydrophilicity values can be synthesized for different
   functional groups, such as unusual side or main chains, discontinuous
   epitopes, and drug molecules. Two methods of atomic hydrophilicity
   analysis provided a measure of complementarity in the interfaces of

Abstract = {{A new process concept is outlined to utilize low and high pressure feed
   streams efficiently in a single pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process.
   The low pressure feed is processed first in the PSA unit to produce low
   pressure product. Following this, the high pressure stream is processed
   in the same unit. Low pressure generated in the first part of the
   process is used internally in the process to assist the production of
   high pressure product. Essentially 100\% recovery of the high pressure
   product is possible. This is achieved in a single unit without the need
   to store gas product during the intermediate process steps. The process
   concept is demonstrated for pure hydrogen production. A process is
   simulated in which two streams, both containing 25\% methane and 75\%
   hydrogen at two different pressures, are supplied to a single PSA unit.
   The simulation shows that, using a five-bed process, one can produce
   100\% high pressure hydrogen at ultra-high purities (i.e. ppm levels of
   methane in the product). If the low pressure stream is not integrated,
   then the maximum high pressure H-2 recovery is only 85\%.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous kidney-pancreas (SPK) transplantation has become an
   accepted therapeutic modality for patients with Type I diabetes
   mellitus-mediated end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, the
   intraperitonel placement of the renal allograft may pose technical
   problems when attempting percutaneous biopsy or Doppler ultrasound
   examination. Recently, the Stanford University Transplant Center adopted
   the technique of retroperitoneal placement of the renal allograft with
   intraperitonel placement of the pancreas allograft (RETRO). From August
   1993 to August 1994, a total of 12 patients underwent SPK with this new
   technique. Twelve patients who had received SPK with the standard
   technique served as historical controls (INTRA). Demographic data,
   followup, operative time, creatinine and amylase on discharge, length of
   stay, intraoperative fluid requirements, rejection episodes, thrombotic
   complications, infections, and number of open and closed renal biopsies
   were compared between the two groups. Average length df follow-up was
   greater in the INTRA group (29.3 +/- 1.7 vs. 15.9 +/- 1.1 months). In
   addition, the RETRO group had significantly fewer open renal biopsies
   (1/15) in comparison to the INTRA group (7/12) (p < 0.001). The two
   groups otherwise did not dilfer in any of the parameters studied. We
   conclude that retroperitoneal kidney and intraperitoneal pancreas
   allograft placement is associated with a significantly decreased
   requirement for open renal biopsy with its associated operating room and
   anesthetic costs. In addition, the option of transcystoscopic or
   percutaneous needle biopsy of the pancreas allograft is preserved. This
   technique should be considered as an alternative to intraperitoneal
   placement of both the pancreas and renal allografts.}},

Abstract = {{Peritoneoscopic surgery has been performed widely for a variety of
   abdominal surgical diseases. We describe here a safe and reliable
   technique of laparoscopic-assisted mesenterioadhesiotomy and peritoneal
   Tenckhoff catheter placement in patients who have previously undergone
   abdominal surgery. Five patients suffering from end-stage renal failure
   previously underwent single and/or polyabdominal surgery. The surgical
   procedures included hysterectomy, ovarian resection, appendectomy, and
   transabdominal right nephrectomy. Under general endotrachial anesthesia,
   a laparoscope was placed down through a direct cut made using a trocar.
   After CO2 gas insufflation, another one or two trocars were put in place
   for surgical procedures. To avoid intestinal injury,
   mesenterioadhesiotomy was performed carefully using a high-frequency
   hook electrode, forceps, and scissors forceps, and the Tenckhoff
   catheter was subsequently inserted with forceps directly into Douglas'
   fossa. Peritoneal equilibration tests performed 30-70 days after the
   initiation of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) treatment
   revealed moderate to good peritoneal effectiveness. This procedure
   permits the surgeon to perform safe and exact catheter placement into
   Douglas' fossa even when there is a possibility that peritoneal and
   mesenterial adhesion are present. We believe that this technique of
   catheter placement may extend the indication for CAPD treatment in
   patients with predisposing lower abdominal surgery.}},

   We investigated susceptibility to MV of granulocytes and lymphocytes
   from individuals with different lymphocyte MCP phenotypes. In any
   individual, granulocytes were > 10-fold less susceptible to MV than
   lymphocytes, and the lymphocytes with predominant H form were generally
   less susceptible to those with an increasing amount of L form. Thus,
   lymphocytes always exhibit high susceptibility to MV compared to

   effective compounds were added to ERDF medium supplemented with insulin,
   transferrin, ethanolamine and sodium selenite (ITES-ERDF). Bovine serum
   albumin (BSA) and alpha-tocopherol elevated clonal cell growth
   remarkably. Casein significantly stimulated the growth of NAT-30 cells
   at relatively low cell densities. Almost all human-human hybridomas,
   which were not able to proliferate in ITES-ERDF medium alone, could grow
   in ITES-ERDF medium supplemented with BSA, alpha-tocopherol, and casein

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: TO provide an overview of the clinical manifestations,
   pathophysiology, and oncologic implications of the cutaneous
   paraneoplastic syndromes that occur predominantly in patients with sold
   tumors.
   METHODS: a review was performed of the literature identified by a
   comprehensive MEDLINE search.
   RESULTS: Diverse cutaneous paraneoplastic syndromes may be associated
   with underlying tumors. They include musculoskeletal disorders
   (clubbing, hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, dermatomyositis, and
   multicentric reticulohistiocytosis), reactive erythemas (erythema
   gyratum repens and necrolytic migratory erythema), vascular dermatoses
   (Trousseau's syndrome), papulosquamous disorders (acanthosis nigricans,
   tripe palms, palmar hyperkeratosis, acquired ichthyosis, pityriasis
   rotunda, Bazex's syndrome, florid cutaneous papillomatosis, the sign of
   Leser-Trelat, and extramammary Paget's disease), and disorders of hair
   growth (hypertrichosis lanuginosa acquisita). The clinical
   manifestations of these dermatoses may precede, coincide with, or follow
   the diagnosis of cancer. The presence of a cutaneous paraneoplastic
   syndrome is often associated with a poor prognosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous paraneoplastic syndromes are specific
   constellations of mucous membrane and/or skin abnormalities that are
   caused by an underlying tumor. Since they may be the presenting sign of
   an occult cancer, cognizance of their features and clinical implications
   are of considerable importance. Individuals with these syndromes should
   have a thorough workup for an associated malignancy.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, stacked successions of ancient tidal rhythmites have been
   found to preserve long records of tidal cycles. These include semidaily,
   daily, semimonthly, monthly, semiannual, annual and multiyear periods.
   Though such deposits reveal much about ancient tidal dynamics, the tidal
   signatures within the rhythmites can be masked or modified by basinal or
   nontidal effects. This paper discusses the results of an analysis of
   data from several different modern tidal stations. We show how actual
   tidal data can be abstracted to a form similar to what might ideally be
   preserved in the rock record, and then power spectra are calculated to
   yield estimates of the astronomical periods which can be compared to the
   current values. In this study, data from four modern tidal stations,
   ranging from diurnal to semidiurnal, are analyzed as both time- and
   event-series. A series of tests, which involve selective removal of
   parts of the tidal signal, are made using the modern tidal-station data.
   These tests were performed in order to determine to what extent the
   tidal signal can be degraded and still be recognized. Finally, we
   discuss some implications of the similarities of the modern and ancient
   tidal data and suggest how ancient data may be used to constrain basinal
   paleogeography and make inferences regarding ancient lunar orbital
   geometries.}},

Abstract = {{A family of polysiloxanes which have been designed for the purpose of
   achieving high pyroelectric activity in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film form
   is reported. The alternate layer LB deposition process has been used in
   which each siloxane monolayer (S) is co-deposited with a monomeric
   eicosylamine monolayer (E) to form alternate layer multilayer assemblies
   of the form SESESE.... This approach ensures a macroscopic polarization
   within the LB film, which is an essential criterion for observation of
   the pyroelectric effect. Pyroelectric devices have been fabricated using
   aluminium electrodes and their pyroelectric sensitivity has been
   measured using a quasi-static technique. This collaborative study has
   involved investigating the effect on the pyroelectric response of (i)
   varying the degree of substitution on the polysiloxane backbone with
   aliphatic pendant side-chains, (ii) varying the length of the aliphatic
   pendant side-chains and (iii) incorporating polar aromatic pendant
   side-chains. This iterative strategy has led to an improvement in the
   pyroelectric coefficient from around 0.8 mu C m(-2) K-1 for an aliphatic
   substituted homopolymer to 4.6 mu C m(-2) K-1 for a copolysiloxane
   substituted with an aromatic pendant side-chain. The effects of LB film
   thickness (number of deposited monolayers) and the electrode overlap
   area have also been investigated and have brought about a further
   dramatic increase in activity to around 13 mu C m(-2) K-1. This is the
   highest pyroelectric coefficient ever reported for an alternate layer LB
   film assembly. It is believed that the activity of these thin films
   arises predominantly from the primary pyroelectric effect since an
   investigation into the response from two substrates possessing very
   different thermal expansion coefficients yielded almost identical
   behaviour, suggesting that the secondary piezoelectric component is
   small.}},

Abstract = {{Human nasal mucosa biopsy samples were studied by biochemical and
   histological methods to determine whether the concentration of
   calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-LI) as a
   marker of sensory nerves was dependent on the activity of neutral
   endopeptidase-like enzyme (NEP-LE). Mucosal samples from the middle
   turbinate were obtained from 32 patients undergoing functional
   endoscopic nasal surgery for non-allergic chronic rhinosinusitis. The
   degree of symptoms related to nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea and
   headaches was recorded. The number of inflammatory cells in each biopsy
   sample was evaluated by conventional histopathological examination.
   CGRP-LI was measured by radioimmunoassay. The activity of NEP-LE was
   evaluated in vitro using {[}H-3] Leu(5)-enkephalin as substrate. A good
   correlation was observed between increased concentrations of CGRP,
   abundant inflammatory cells and the intensity of symptoms (R(2) = 0.80).
   A low activity of NEP-LE was associated with a high concentration of
   both inflammatory cells and CGRP, suggesting that NEP-LE activity was
   reduced during inflammation. These observations further support the
   hypothesis that reduced degradation of sensory neuropeptides could be
   involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of non-specific chronic
   rhinosinusitis.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The study examined whether outreach teams of mental health
   professionals and police officers could assess and make appropriate
   dispositions for psychiatric emergency cases in the community, even in
   situations involving violence or potential violence. The study also
   assessed whether such teams could reduce criminalization of mentally ill
   persons. Methods: One hundred and one consecutive referrals to law
   enforcement-mental health teams in Los Angeles were studied through
   records review. Subjects' status during a six-month follow-up period was
   also examined. Results: Referrals had a high rate of past criminal
   arrests, violence, and major psychopathology. Sixty-three had a history
   of violence against persons, 59 had a criminal arrest history, 79 had
   prior psychiatric hospitalizations, and 66 were serious substance
   abusers. At referral 70 manifested severe psychiatric symptoms, 20 were
   overtly violent, and 29 others exhibited threatening behavior. However,
   only two of the group were arrested 80 were taken to hospitals. At
   six-month follow-up of 85 referrals, 22 percent had been arrested (12
   percent for crimes of violence), and 42 percent had been rehospitalized.
   Conclusions: Outreach emergency teams composed of a police officer and a
   mental health professional are able to deal appropriately with persons
   who have acute and severe mental illness, a high potential for violence,
   a high incidence of substance abuse, and long histories with both the
   criminal justice and mental health systems. Such teams apparently avoid
   criminalization of the mentally ill.}},

Abstract = {{The partial pair correlation functions of amorphous Dy44Ni56 as obtained
   experimentally in an earlier paper are simulated by a cluster relaxation
   procedure. Reasonable agreement with the experimental functions is
   obtained when non-additive pair potentials with preference for Dy-Ni
   atomic pairs are applied. The refinement of the atomic cluster by using
   the reverse Monte Carlo method yields perfect agreement. The
   characterization of the chemical short range order depends on the
   definition of an appropriate hypothetic statistical reference system
   since the influence of the size effect is essential. The structure of
   amorphous Dy44Ni56 is compared with representative examples from
   different groups of metallic glasses, such as Nb-Ni, Ni-B and Ni-P. Some
   structural features point to a relationship with the related crystalline
   phase DyNi, whereas other features show that the different types of
   metallic glass have certain structural principles in common. The
   structural models reveal rather broad distributions of the local
   structural properties and show that amorphous Dy44Ni56 is not built as
   an assembly of defined structural units.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives - To improve blood pressure control among hypertensive
   (>140/90 mmHg) excessive alcohol drinkers.
   Design - Fourteen worksite physicians were randomised into an
   intervention group and a control group. The intervention was based on
   training worksite physicians and follow up of those hypertensive
   subjects defined as excessive drinkers. Follow up was based on self
   monitoring of alcohol consumption by the subject, in view of the results
   of their gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity determination.
   Setting - Fourteen workplaces in France mainly in the industrial sector.
   Subjects - Altogether 15 301 subjects were screened by the 14
   physicians: 129 of these were included in the study.
   Main outcome measures - This was the difference between the initial
   systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the SBP one year later (Delta BP).
   Secondary criteria were the difference between the initial and final
   diastolic blood pressure (Delta DBP) and Delta BP at two years;
   antihypertensive treatment; stated alcohol consumption (Delta AC); Delta
   GGT; and body mass index (Delta BMI).
   Results - The decrease in SEP levels was significantly larger in the
   intervention group than in the control group: at one year, Delta SBP
   values were -11.9 (15.6) mmHg and -4.6 (13.8) respectively (p<0.05).
   This benefit was still observed after two years of follow up (-13.8
   (17.4) mmHg v -7.5 (14.2) mmHg (p<0.05)). No difference was observed in
   DBP. The percentage of treated subjects did not differ between groups.
   At one year, Delta AC was larger in the intervention group (-2.8 (5.2)
   U/d) than in the control group (-1.6 (3.4) (p<0.1)). Delta GGT and Delta
   BMI did not differ between the two groups. A weak positive correlation
   was observed between Delta AC and Delta SBP (r = 0.16).
   Conclusions - An intervention aimed at the hypertensive excessive
   drinkers in a working population was found to be effective in reducing
   SEP on a long term basis (two years). The mechanisms of reduction in
   alcohol consumption and improved drug compliance cannot be ascertained
   in this pragmatic study. From a public health point of view, reducing
   the excess cardiovascular risk among a `'hard to reach'' population
   seems feasible with a strategy specifically designed for this high risk
   group.}},

Abstract = {{A prospective study of transplacental transmission of human

   HIV was detected in placental and fetal tissues in 7 of 14 by in situ
   hybridization. The proportion of fetal infection far exceeded the
   transmission rate of 13\% in liveborn babies. No association was seen
   between fetal transmission and a maternal history of drug abuse or
   coinfections; mothers with AIDS more often had fetal loss associated
   with HIV transmission than did asymptomatic mothers. In affected
   fetuses, HIV was detected in many tissues and was associated with thymic
   pathology. This suggests that maternal HIV infection increases the risk
   for pregnancy loss associated with HIV transmission. The possibility
   that HIV may be fetotoxic, that thymic dysfunction may interfere with
   pregnancy progression, or that the intrauterine milieu in
   HIV-seropositive pregnancies may be unfavorable (or a combination of

Abstract = {{Sulphur emissions from Russian Kola Peninsula smelters are known to
   cause surface water acidification in the border areas between Norway and
   Russia. The sulphur deposition is also high in the eastern part of
   Finnish Lapland. In 1990, a monitoring programme was started to survey
   the effects of acid deposition on sensitive fish populations in
   north-eastern Finnish Lapland. Altogether 103 sites in three areas were
   electrofished and autumn water samples were taken. Besides the brown
   trout (Salmo trutta), special attention was paid to the occurrence of
   minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) since it is a common species in small waters
   and is highly sensitive to acidification. During the first three years
   of monitoring no signs of acidification were recorded. The alkalinity
   values of brooks generally exceeded 0.1 mmol/l. Brown trout, minnow and
   burbot (Lota lota) were caught frequently in the study sites. Later the
   study was focused on the uninhabited Vatari area which is receiving the
   highest sulphur deposition in Finnish Lapland. The alkalinity values of
   the sampled brooks were in most cases below 0.05 mmol/l, indicating a
   decreased buffer capacity. However, the electrofishing of the brooks
   showed no acid-induced damage. The lowest alkalinity values were
   detected from a group of small upland ponds. In four such ponds the
   alkalinity was zero or negative. No minnows were caught from these four
   ponds apart from one, where the minnows were exceptionally large. The
   results show that the waters near the eastern border of northern Finnish
   Lapland are threatened by acidification. No damage to fish populations
   subject to fishing was observed. The absence of minnows in some small
   waters is possibly the first sign of acid-induced fish population
   damage.}},

   to compare its usefulness with the widely accepted auxotype/serovar
   classification scheme.
   Methods-The outer membrane protein IB genes of 47 gonococcal isolates
   belonging to 10 different serovars were amplified by PCR. The similar to
   1 kb DNA products were then digested separately with restriction enzymes
   CfoI and MspA1I, and electrophoresed on agarose gels.
   Results-Cleavage of PIB genes by MspA1I and CfoI differentiated all the
   N gonorrhoeae strains into five and six PCR-RFLP profiles, respectively.
   PCR-RFLP was more discriminatory than auxotyping, which classifies the
   strains into only two auxotypes. Some strains belonging to common
   serovars could be further differentiated. A combination of PCR-RFLP
   analysis, serotyping further crimination of the strains into 34
   subtypes. The PCR-RFLP method was easy to perform, reliable,
   reproducible, and consistent with published nucleotide sequence data.
   Conclusion-The PCR-RFLP method can augment auxotyping and serotyping or
   be used as a preliminary screening tool to differentiate N gonorrhoeae
   strains in areas where serotyping reagents are not easily available.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have challenged the generally accepted hypothesis that
   bronchial particle clearance is complete within 24-48 h postdeposition.
   We studied bronchial retention of inert particles using a bronchoscope
   and microspray nozzle to localize deposition in a bronchus while
   avoiding alveolar deposition. Six-microliter aliquots (444 kBq) of
   submicrometer (number mean diameter = 0.22 mu m, geometric standard
   deviation = 1.75) technetium 99m-labeled (Tc-99m) sulfur colloid (SC)
   particles (n = 6) or the unbound radiolabel Tc-99m-pertechnetate
   ((TcO4-)-Tc-99m; n = 3) were sprayed onto a 5-mm-diam bronchus in
   halothane-anesthetized dogs. Radioactivity at the deposition site and
   clearance pathway was monitored externally with a gamma camera beginning
   immediately postspray. Bronchial retention of SC was 8.5 +/- 2.4 and 1.5
   +/- 0.7\% at 3 and 24 h postspray, respectively. Tracheal mucus velocity
   was measured at 10.4 +/- 2.2 mm/min. For comparison, clearance of
   inhaled submicrometer SC particles was also measured in the same dogs.
   Retention of inhaled aerosolized SC (peripheral lung deposition) was
   98.1 +/- 1.1 and 76.3 +/- 1.8\% at 3 and 24 h, respectively.
   (TcO4-)-Tc-99m cleared from the bronchi slightly more rapidly than did
   SC. Radioactivity was readily detected in the blood after deposition of
   (TCO4-)-T-99m but not Of SC. Thus SC cleared by mucociliary transport,
   whereas (TcO4-)-Tc-99m cleared predominantly by transepithelial
   absorption. We conclude that clearance of submicrometer particles from a
   5-mm conducting airway is very nearly complete by 24 h, with similar to
   92\% of the clearance occurring within the first 3 h postdeposition.}},

Abstract = {{The microbial plankton of three saline lakes (Highway Lake, Ace Lake and
   Lake Abraxas) in the Vestfold Hills oasis, eastern Antarctica was
   investigated during the austral summer of 1993. The three lakes span the
   salinity range from brackish to seawater. In the two deeper meromictic
   lakes (Ace and Abraxas) the distribution of the microbial components was
   related to the chemical and physical characteristics of the water
   column. Heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates were most abundant above
   the chemocline in oxygenated epilimnetic waters, while bacteria numbers
   increased dramatically in the water below the chemocline. In Highway
   Lake, where the water column has a uniform conductivity and temperature,
   vertical distribution of the microbial plankton displayed a different
   pattern. Abundances of bacteria in epilimnetic water ranged between
   1.02-1.2x10(8) l(-1) in Ace Lake and 3.6-3.8x10(8) l(-1) in Lake
   Abraxas. In Highway Lake bacterial concentrations averaged
   0.54-1.06x10(8) l(-1). Nanoflagellate concentrations in Ace and Highway
   Lakes were in the region of 450-3000x10(3) l(-1), while in Lake Abraxas
   they were much lower: 92-790x10(3) l(-1), which reflected the much lower
   bacterial food resources in this lake.
   The ciliate concentration in Highway Lake was extremely high, on
   occasions in excess of 200x10(3) l(-1). Mesodinium rubrum was abundant
   in all three lakes during November and December and ranged from 34-48\%
   of the total ciliate community in Highway Lake, 83-99\% in Ace Lake and
   82-88\% in Lake Abraxas. Primary production measurements in Ace Lake and
   Highway Lake indicate that Mesodinium may be contributing between
   15-40\% of carbon fixation in the phytoplankton.}},

Abstract = {{The glutamate dehydrogenase gene from the hyperthermophilic archaeon
   Pyrococcus furiosus has been functionally expressed in Escherichia coli
   under the control of the lambda, P-L promoter. The P.furiosus glutamate
   dehydrogenase amounted to 20\% of the total E.coli cell protein, and the
   vast majority consisted of hexamers, Following activation by heat
   treatment, an enzyme could be purified from E,coli that was
   indistinguishable from the glutamate dehydrogenase purified from
   P.furiosus. Hybrid genes, that consisted of the coding regions for the
   homologous glutamate dehydrogenases from P.furiosus and the mesophilic
   bacterium Clostridium difficile, were constructed and successfully
   expressed in E,coli, One of the resulting hybrid proteins, containing
   the glutamate binding domain of the C,difficile enzyme and the cofactor
   binding domain of the P.furiosus enzyme, did not show a detectable
   activity, In contrast, the complementary hybrid containing the
   P.furiosus glutamate and the C.difficile cofactor binding domain was a
   catalytically active hexamer that showed a reduced substrate affinity
   but maintained efficient cofactor binding with the specificity found in
   the Clostridium symbiosum enzyme, Compared with the C,difficile
   glutamate dehydrogenase, the archaeal-bacterial hybrid is slightly more
   thermoactive, less thermostable but much more stable towards guanidinium
   chloride-induced inactivation and denaturation.}},

Abstract = {{We measure the low frequency limit f(lo) of 1028 type III bursts and
   compare it with the observed plasma, frequency at the spacecraft f(p).
   We consider three periods: when Ulysses was in the ecliptic plane near
   the Sun, far from the Sun, and out of the ecliptic; the average plasma
   frequency was 20, 10, and 5 kHz respectively. The major results are: 1)
   During the entire period of Ulysses flight November 1990 to March 1995,
   9 kHz is the lowest frequency at which type III electromagnetic
   radiation was ever seen, even though f(p) was often 3-4 kHz. 2) The
   distribution of cutoffs is independent of ecliptic latitude, and of f(p)
   at the spacecraft (excepting of course that f(lo) greater than or equal
   to f(p)) and is broadly spread between 17 and 300 kHz. 3) When f(p) is
   about 20, 10 and 5 kill;, only 15, 5 and 0\% respectively ofabout 20, 10
   and 5 kill;, only 15, 5 and 0\% respectively of type III burst radiation
   approaches within a factor of two of f(p).
   We develop three hypotheses to explain these results: 1) that the
   low-frequency cutoff of type III bursts is intrinsic to the radiation
   mechanism, 2) that it is due to directivity of the radiation, and 3)
   that it is due to propagation conditions between the burst source and
   the spacecraft. The evidence for intrinsic cutoffs is strong, but
   propagation effects play a role in some cases.}},

Abstract = {{We use Monte Carlo techniques and analytical methods to study the phase
   diagram of multicomponent Widom-Rowlinson models on a square lattice:
   there are M species all with the same fugacity z and a nearest-neighbor
   hard-core exclusion between unlike particles. Simulations show that for
   M between 2 and 6 there is a direct transition from the gas phase at z <
   z(d)(M) to a demixed phase consisting mostly of one species at z >
   z(d)(M), while for M greater than or equal to 7 there is an intermediate
   `'crystal phase'' for z lying between z(e)(M) and z(d)(M). In this
   phase, which is driven by entropy, particles, independent of species,
   preferentially occupy one of the sublattices, i.e., spatial symmetry but
   not particle symmetry is broken. The transition at Z(d)(M) appears to be
   first order for M greater than or equal to 5, putting it in the Potts
   model universality class. For large M the transition between the
   crystalline and demixed phases at Id(M) can be proven to be first order
   with Z(d)(M)similar to M - 2 + 1/M+..., while z(e)(M) is argued to
   behave as lambda(cr)/M, with lambda(cr) the critical value of the
   fugacity at which the one-component hard square lattice gas has a
   transition, and to be always of the Ising type. Explicit calculations
   for the Bethe lattice with the coordination number q = 4 give results
   similar to those for the square lattice, except that the transition at
   z(d)(M) becomes first order at M > 2. This happens for all q, consistent
   with the model being in the Potts universality class.}},

Abstract = {{Contamination with a pathogen, residual live organisms in inactivated
   products, and a lack of safety of live products may be considered to
   constitute the greatest risks associated with the use and the

   conducted to monitor the risks, the limitations of such tests must be
   recognised and steps should always be taken to minimise and as far as
   possible, avoid the risk. Tests must be suitably sensitive and specific
   for their function, but they must also be practical and reproducible.
   Studies on the sensitivity of tests provide a measure of their
   limitations.
   The author describes points to consider for the assessment of the
   suitability of different test methods. Emphasis is placed on tests for
   parameters associated with risk, such as extraneous agent testing.
   Examples of such analyses are discussed. There is a need for an exchange
   of information anna scientific debate on such issues if international
   acceptance of test methods and harmonisation of requirements are to be

Abstract = {{A chaos maximizing optimal control problem is formulated and applied to
   Duffing's equation to maximize the largest Lyapunov exponent. The
   resulting bang-bang optimal controller yields a positive value of the
   largest Lyapunov exponent, indicating chaotic behavior. In fact, the
   largest Lyapunov exponent is approximately twice as large as that
   achieved with simple sinusoidal forcing at the same amplitude bounds.
   However, the resulting phase portrait of the optimal trajectory is a
   limit cycle and is not chaotic at all. This paradoxical result
   contradicts the basic theory that a bounded trajectory with at least one
   positive Lyapunov exponent must be chaotic. Details concerning the
   development of a chaos measurement that is viable for current optimal
   control theory, a method of continuous normalization, the paradoxical
   chaotic limit cycle, resolution of the paradox, and closed-loop optimal
   jump condition in an augmented space are presented. In particular, for
   systems of differential equations with only piecewise differentiable
   right-hand sides due to a switching control, a jump discontinuity
   condition must be imposed on the state perturbations in order to compute
   correct Lyapunov exponents.}},

Abstract = {{The computer department of the General Electric Corporation began with
   the winning of a single contract to provide a special purpose computer
   system to the Bank of America, and expanded to the development of a line
   of upward compatible machines in advance of the IBM System/360 and whose
   descendants still exist in 1995, to a highly successful time-sharing
   service, and to a process control business. Over the objections of the
   executive officers of the Company the computer department strived to
   become the number two in the industry, but after fifteen years, to the
   surprise of many in the industry GE sold the operation and got out of
   the competition to concentrate on other products that had a faster turn
   around on investment and a well established first or second place in
   their industry. This paper looks at the history of the GE computer
   department and attempts to draw some conclusions regarding the reasons
   why this fifteen year venture was not more successful, while recognizing
   that there were successful aspects of the operation that could have
   balanced the books and provided necessary capital for a continued

   factor (bFGF) gene expression in drug-sensitive human breast carcinoma
   (MCF-7) cells and its drug-resistant variant (MCF-7/ADR) cells, Northern
   blot and gel mobility shift assays showed that 135 cGy of ionizing
   radiation induced c-jun. and c-fos gene expression, AP-1 binding
   activity, as well as bFGF gene expression in MCF-7/ADR cells, In MCF-7
   cells, however, we observed little/no induction of bFGF gene expression
   and AP-1 binding activity after the stress. Nevertheless, MCF-7 cells
   transfected with plasmids containing c-jun gene contain high levels of
   bFGF protein. H-7 (60 mu g/ml), a potent protein kinase C (PKC)
   inhibitor, inhibited the stress-induced AP-1 binding activity and bFGF
   gene expression in MCF-7/ADR cells. Corroborating this observation,
   overexpression of PKC alpha induced bFGF gene expression in MCF-7 cells.
   Taken together, these results suggest that stress-induced bFGF gene
   expression is mediated through the activation of PKC and AP-1
   transcription factors, Differences in the levels of PKC activity and
   AP-1 binding factors may be responsible for differential expression of
   bFGF among breast cancer cell lines. Although there are large
   differences in response to ionizing radiation between MCF-7 and
   MCF-7/ADR cell lines, we observed no significant differences in
   radiocytotoxicity between them.}},

   accounting for 72\% of infections investigated in 1993. The symptoms and
   signs of the infection were variable and accurate diagnosis may be

Abstract = {{The nucleotide sequences of two mitochondrial DNA regions were used to
   determine phylogenetic relationships in the genus Daphnia (water fleas),
   a group for which systematics are historically unstable. A portion of
   the small ribosomal RNA was used to reconstruct higher-level
   relationships among species, while a portion of the more rapidly
   evolving control region was used to reconstruct lower-level
   relationships among populations. Two unexpected results were obtained.
   First, the subgeneric status of Ctenodaphnia falls into uncertainty on
   the basis of the failure of the 12S rRNA sequences to support these
   species as comprising an outgroup to the remainder of Daphnia species.
   Second, the high similarity of 125 rRNA sequences of Daphnia pulex: and
   Daphnia pulicaria samples, coupled with the dual paraphyly of these
   samples as reconstructed from control-region analysis, suggests that
   they are two clonotype constellations within the same species complex. A
   combination of a variety of ecological influences has apparently
   resulted in the evolution of sets of Daphnia genotypes that are
   genetically cohesive despite their phenotypic divergence. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{The electrical conductivity sigma has been calculated for n-type delta
   doping GaAs superlattices (SLs) in a direction perpendicular to the
   layers. The transport along the SL growth direction is investigated by
   first performing self-consistent calculations of the miniband structure
   as a function of the SLs' periods d and the sheet doping concentrations
   N-D. The Schrodinger equation, with the appropriate periodic boundary
   condition, coupled to the Poisson equation are self-consistently solved
   within the framework of the local density functional approximation for
   the electron exchange-correlation effects. Assuming that the transport
   in the SL occurs through extended miniband states, sigma is calculated
   at zero temperature and low field ohmic limits by the quasi-classical
   Boltzmann kinetic equation. Using semiquantitative arguments we have
   shown recently that the particular miniband structure of the delta
   doping SLs leads to a plateau-like behaviour of sigma as a function of
   the Fermi level position or of the donor concentration. In the present

Abstract = {{pp125(FAK) (focal adhesion kinase) a protein tyrosine kinase that may
   mediate cellular responses to adhesion, is activated and
   tyrosine-phosphorylated when platelets adhere to fibrinogen via the
   integrin, alpha(IIb)beta(3). To determine whether either of the
   cytoplasmic tails of alpha(IIb)beta(3) regulates FAK phosphorylation,
   CHO cells were stably transfected with alpha(IIb)beta(3) or various
   cytoplasmic tail truncation mutants. Cells expressing wild-type
   alpha(IIb)beta(3) or alpha(IIb)beta(3) that lacked the COOH-terminal 13
   or 18 residues of the 20 residue alpha(IIb) tail adhered to and spread
   on fibrinogen or on an anti-am, antibody, and FAK became
   tyrosine-phosphorylated. FAK also became phosphorylated in adherent
   cells lacking the COOH-terminal 35 or 39 residues of the 47 residue
   beta(3) tail, although the extent of phosphorylation was reduced by
   about 50\% in the latter mutant. Little or no FAK phosphorylation was
   observed if 46 residues were deleted from the beta(3) tail, None of
   these beta(3) truncation mutants spread on the anti-am antibody, When
   cells with wild-type alpha(IIb)beta(3) or truncated pg were detached
   from a surface, FAK became rapidly dephosphorylated. In contrast, FAK
   remained phosphorylated in the two am,truncation mutants for up to 90
   minutes in suspension, This persistent phosphorylation was not due to
   occupancy of alpha(IIb)beta(3) by adhesive ligands because it was also
   observed with an aim tail truncation mutant that contained an additional
   mutation in the extracellular portion of the receptor that prevents
   ligand binding, These studies demonstrate that: (1) the beta(3)
   cytoplasmic tail, including the membrane-proximal portion, is involved
   in initiation of FAK phosphorylation; (2) FAK phosphorylation can be
   initiated by cell adhesion in the absence of cell spreading; and (3) the
   membrane-distal portion of the alpha(IIb) cytoplasmic tail may normally
   function to dampen FAK phosphorylation in non-anchored cells.}},

Abstract = {{1. Molecular and electronic structural parameters have been determined,
   by molecular orbital (MO) calculations, for a homologous series of 8
   alkoxyresorufins (methoxy- to octoxy-).
   2. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARS) between these
   structural parameters and the rates of metabolism of the
   alkoxyresorufins in hepatic microsomes from the 3-methylcholanthrene
   (MC)-, and phenobarbital (PB)-pretreated mouse, and the
   beta-naphthoflavone (PNF)-pretreated rat have been established.
   3. The most significant single relationship is between beta NF-induction
   of cytochrome P4501 (CYP1A) and the total nucleophilic
   superdelocalizability (Sigma S-N) for the eight compounds in the series.
   4. For double regressions, the electronic charge on the alkoxy oxygen,
   Q(O), or alpha-carbon Q(C), is important when combined with the
   hydrophobic substituent constant (pi).
   5. These findings indicate that the rates of metabolism of these
   alkoxyresorufins are dependent upon their ability to cross cellular
   membranes, to fit the relevant CYP1A binding site, and on their ability
   to accept electrons from a donor nucleophilic species.
   6. A different set of parameters correlated with CYP2B activity, namely,
   parameters of overall shape, which indicates that the way in which the
   alkoxyresorufins fit the CYP2B site, determines their differences in
   specificity.
   7. Computer graphic interactive docking studies of the alkoxyresorufins
   with their affinity-specific cytochromes P450, namely, methoxy- with
   CYP1A2; ethoxy- with CYP1A1; pentoxy- with CYP2B1; and benzyloxy- with
   CYP3A, have also been undertaken to show the specific interactions of
   the alkoxyresorufins with the binding sites of the individual P450s.}},

Journal = {{HYPERTENSION}},
Year = {{1995}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonists reduce mean
   arterial pressure in various experimental models of hypertension,
   including two-kidney, one clip (2K1C) renal hypertension. However, the
   regional hemodynamic mechanisms underlying the hypotensive effect of
   AT(1) receptor antagonists in 2K1C rats under dynamic conditions have
   not been documented. Therefore, in the present study we determined the
   hemodynamic profile of the AT(1) receptor antagonist CV-11974 in
   conscious 2K1C rats and sham-operated control rats. Approximately 4
   weeks after clipping, rats underwent a further two-stage operation for
   implantation of Doppler flow probes on the contralateral (left) renal
   artery, superior mesenteric artery, and distal aorta as well as for the
   implantation of intravascular catheters. At least 24 hours after the
   last operation continuous recordings were made of mean arterial
   pressure; heart rate; and renal, mesenteric, and hindquarters flows and
   conductances (Doppler shift/mean arterial pressure) in response to three
   doses of CV-11974 (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/kg IV). CV-11974 caused a small
   hypotensive effect (decrease of approximately 15 mmH,a) in the sham
   group, but regional flows and vascular conductances did not change. By
   contrast, in 2K1C rats CV-11974 caused dose-dependent hypotension that
   was maximal (-19+/-6, -41+/-4, and -51+/-8 mm Hg, respectively) after 6
   hours. These changes were associated with generalized vasodilatation
   (increased conductance) in all three vascular beds, although there were
   subtle differences with the different CV-11974 doses. The lowest dose of
   this compound tested (0.01 mg/kg, n=7) caused transient vasodilatation,
   and the intermediate dose (0.1 mg/kg, n=8) caused maximal vasodilatation
   in the mesenteric and hindquarters circulations (approximately 50\%
   increase in conductances). A 10-fold higher dose of CV-11974 (1.0 mg/kg,
   n=7) produced sustained, hyperemic renal vasodilatation (approximately
   30\% and 70\% increases in renal flow and conductance, respectively) in
   addition to mesenteric and hindquarters vasodilatation. Thus,
   CV-11974-induced hypotension was accompanied by widespread
   vasodilatation, although this was dose dependent only in the renal
   vascular bed. This study illustrates that AT(1) receptor blockade causes
   vasodilatation in both renal and nonrenal circulations in 2K1C
   hypertension, contrasting with the relatively selective renal
   vasodilatation observed previously in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
   In addition, it was demonstrated that the maximal hypotension caused by
   CV-11974 occurred much later than the blockade of the cardiovascular
   effects of angiotensin II. This temporal disparity may imply that in
   addition to inhibition of tonic vasoconstriction maintained by
   circulating and/or tissue renin angiotensin systems, other mechanisms
   may also be involved in the antihypertensive effect of CV-11974.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of a series of 32 molecular radical anions from carboxylic
   acids salts RCOOCat(-.); where R = CH3, CH3CH2, CH3CH2CH2, (CH3)(2)CH,
   C6H5, o-CH3-C6H4, m-CH3-C6H(4), and p-CH3-C6H4 and Cat = Li, Na, K, Rb,
   has been proven by the observation of their fragmentation in
   negative-ion fast-atom bombardment tandem mass spectrometry. These
   species occur at very low abundance and are not detected in the
   fast-atom bombardment spectra because they are hidden in the background.
   However, the collision-induced dissociation fragmentation of ions
   selected at the mass-to-charge ratio values that correspond to these
   species display characteristic signals that are completely different
   from the signals observed from pure matrix or after addition of
   corresponding metal hydroxide to the matrix. The main fragmentation
   observed is the loss of the neutral metal atom from RCOOCat(-), followed
   by a loss of CO2 for the aromatic compounds. Neutral loss experiments
   also confirm the existence of these radical anions. Scans for the loss
   of a selected metal after addition of one of the carboxylic acid salts
   to the matrix display abundant peaks at mass-to-charge ratio values that
   correspond to the salt radical anions. Some weaker peaks appear at other
   mass-to-charge ratio values independent of the salt that is used and
   also are observed from the matrix when the corresponding metal hydroxide
   is added. When alkali metal salts from some deuterated acids are
   analyzed, the predicted shifts are observed. The loss of the neutral
   metal is more pronounced from RCOONa(-.), RCOOK(-.), and RCOORb(-.) than
   from RCOOLi(-.).}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the utility of stereotaxic core biopsy (SCB) in
   diagnosing recurrent carcinoma after breast-conserving therapy (BCT).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 316 patients evaluated with SCB, 17 (5\%) had
   nonpalpable lesions in breasts previously treated with BCT. Surgical
   correlation was obtained in 14 patients. SCBs were performed with
   digital stereotaxic equipment, with patients prone.
   RESULTS: Carcinoma detected at SCB in 11 (79\%) of 14 patients included
   infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IFDC) in five, ductal carcinoma in situ
   (DCIS) in five, and infiltrating lobular carcinoma (ILC) in one.
   Surgical histopathologic findings agreed with core biopsy findings in 10
   of these patients. In one patient with two SCB-proved foci of IFDC, one
   IFDC was identified at mastectomy. In two (14\%) patients, SCB revealed
   atypical ductal hyperplasia; however, DCIS was found at surgical biopsy.
   In one patient, the SCB finding of fat necrosis was confirmed at
   surgical biopsy.
   CONCLUSION: These data suggest that SCB may be useful in diagnosing
   recurrent carcinoma in the conservatively treated breast.}},

Abstract = {{A goal oriented migrant optimizing energy expenditure during flight

   Compared to other models (constant track or constant airspeed), the
   largest benefit from using the optimal strategy results with lateral and
   opposing winds. With decreasing distance to the goal, compensation for
   wind drift should be extended by adjusting heading and increasing
   airspeed. Regardless of their flight mechanics, birds completing their
   migratory journey in a few long flights should fly faster and compensate
   more for lateral wind drift, than birds travelling in numerous short
   hops. An analysis of flight paths of small passerines gathered with a
   tracking radar at night showed good correlations between measured
   headings and airspeeds and those predicted by the optimal strategy.}},

   2.0 to 2.5 h was independent of the dosage regimen, Isepamicin excreted
   in urine over 24 h accounted for about 100\% of the dose. The results

Abstract = {{The time dependence of hot carrier degradation in PMOSFETs is simulated
   on a 2D device simulator, MEDICI. The degradation is modelled by a
   spatially uniform negative fixed charge, introduced at the oxide-silicon
   interface. The effect on the device drain current, threshold voltage and
   transconductance is studied as a function of the extent and magnitude of
   the fixed charge. The extent of the fixed charge is identified with the
   drain extension due to the inversion, by the fixed charge, of part of
   the channel adjacent to the drain junction. The drain extension is
   experimentally determined from the gate-to-drain capacitance, whose
   stress time dependence therefore gives an indirect time dependence for
   the degradation of other device parameters. Simulation results show a
   logarithmic time dependence of degradation in a number of device
   parameters, confirming earlier experimental observations. Simulation of
   the electron injection current reveals two peaks, the first one near the
   drain junction and the second one near the edge of the degradation
   region. The second peak is considerably weaker and accounts for the
   progressively longer time needed to create additional degradation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an extremely ill-posed problem of determining the surface
   temperature and/or heat flux histories q(t) is considered. To analyse
   precisely its degree of ill-posedness and its resolution limit, we have
   studied the problem using different analysis tools-singular-value
   decomposition and multiresolution analysis. The main purpose of this
   paper is to develop a `sensitivity decomposition' concept that splits
   the sought function space V into ill-posed and well-posed parts in order
   to give a convenient regularized solution. We show some advantages of
   using wavelets (or hierarchical bases) to determine such a decomposition
   for ill-posed problems. Wavelets are capable of decomposing the sought
   function space V into the direct summation of subspaces such that the
   sensitivity of the observations with respect to the variation of the
   function to be determined q(t) in each subspace provided by the
   decomposition has quite a different magnitude. Based on the results
   derived from sensitivity analysis, we propose a hierarchical method
   using the discretization size h (or scale level j) as a regularization
   parameter. When the level of noise is unknown, the hierarchical method
   also gives a simple rule to get a suboptimal regularization parameter.
   Numerical results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Fuzzy sets in the subject space are transformed to fuzzy solid sets in
   an increased object space on the basis of the development of the local
   umbra concept. Further, a counting transform is defined for
   reconstructing the fuzzy sets from the fuzzy solid sets, and the
   dilation and erosion operators in mathematical morphology are redefined
   in the fuzzy solid-set space. The algebraic structures of fuzzy solid
   sets can lead not only to fuzzy logic but also to arithmetic operations.
   Thus a fuzzy solid-set image algebra of two image transforms and five
   set operators is defined that can formulate binary and gray-scale
   morphological image-processing functions consisting of dilation,
   erosion, intersection, union, complement, addition, subtraction, and
   reflection in a unified form. A cellular set-logic array architecture is
   suggested for executing this image algebra. The optical implementation
   of the architecture, based on area coding of gray-scale values, is
   demonstrated. (C) 1995 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{During economic downturns, traditional gender allocations of labor have

   studies have examined the division of labor in the household or in paid
   employment, we examined if where both intersect, in family-owned and
   family-operated enterprises in the farm sector of the 1980s, This
   context, combining crisis conditions and the agency of economic actors,
   should be related to greater flexibility in labor allocations, leading
   to the feminization of farming. However, a contrasting perspective
   argues for rigidity of gender roles in farming. We use data from a
   twelve-state midwestern sample and a move detailed Ohio study. The
   results failed to support the flexibility thesis. The rigidity of
   production roles was further translated into different factors related
   to women's and men's stress.}},

Abstract = {{Freezing and thawing of the endemic moss species Grimmia antarctici
   Card, caused photoinhibition. When snow cover was removed from moss in
   the field, resulting in exposure to fluctuating temperatures and light
   conditions, photoinhibition, measured as a reduction in the ratio of
   variable to maximum chlorophyll a fluorescence (F-v/F-m), was observed.
   The extent of photoinhibition was highly variable and appeared to be
   reversible during periods of warmer temperatures, A series of controlled
   laboratory studies found that the light conditions that prevail between
   freezing and thawing events influenced the recovery from photoinhibition
   observed during freezing and thawing, with low light conditions
   facilitating the greatest rates of recovery, After four cycles of
   freezing and thawing, recovery from photoinhibition in hydrated moss was
   achieved within 12 h of transfer to 5 degrees C and 15 mu mol quanta
   m(-2) s(-1). These results favour the hypothesis that photoinhibition
   observed during freezing represents a protective process involving the
   down-regulation of photosystem II when photosynthetic carbon

Abstract = {{Alteration of the p53 gene is the most frequent genetic alteration in
   human cancer and leads to the accumulation of mutant p53 in the nucleus
   of tumor cells, In addition, it has been shown that patients with
   various types of neoplasia have p53 antibodies in their sera which could
   be used as an indirect diagnostic procedure for p53 alteration.
   Using a new ELISA, we have analyzed the sera from more than 1000
   patients with various types of cancer and from healthy blood donors, We
   demonstrate that p53 antibodies are detected mainly in cancer patients
   and are strictly proportional to the occurrence of p53 mutations. Using
   various immunological approaches, these antibodies were unambiguously
   demonstrated to be directed toward the human p53 protein, Isotyping
   analysis of these antibodies strongly suggested that they correspond to
   a humoral response to the p53 protein which accumulates in the tumor
   cell, This finding suggests that serological analysis, combined with
   histochemistry, is suitable for assessing the integrity of the p53 gene

Abstract = {{Erythromycin is the drug of choice for treatment of Mycoplasma
   pneumoniae infections due to its susceptibility to low levels of this
   antibiotic, After exposure of susceptible strains to erythromycin in
   vitro and in vivo, mutants resistant to erythromycin and other
   macrolides were isolated, Their phenotypes have been characterized, but
   the genetic basis for resistance has never been determined. We isolated
   two resistant mutants (M129-ER1 and M129-ER2) by growing M. pneumoniae
   M129 on agar containing different amounts of erythromycin. Ln broth
   dilution tests both strains displayed resistance to high levels of
   several macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) antibiotics. fn
   binding studies, ribosomes isolated from the resistant strains exhibited
   significantly Lower affinity for {[}C-14]erythromycin than did ribosomes
   from the M129 parent strain. Sequencing of DNA amplified from the region
   of the 23S rRNA gene encoding domain V revealed an A-to-G transition in
   the central loop at position 2063 of M129-ER1 and a similar A-to-G
   transition at position 2064 in M129-ER2, Transitions at homologous
   locations in the 23S rRNA from other organisms have been shown to result
   in resistance to MLS antibiotics. Thus, MLS-like resistance can occur in
   IM, pneumoniae as the result of point mutations in the 23S rRNA gene
   which reduce the affinity of these antibiotics for the ribosome, Since
   they involve only single-base changes, development of resistance to
   erythromycin in vivo by these mechanisms could be a relatively frequent
   event.}},

Abstract = {{Background Recurrence after resection of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   is generally associated with a poor outcome and is treated with either
   systemic agents or palliative irradiation. Recently, long-term survival
   has been reported after resection of isolated brain metastases from
   non-small cell lung carcinoma, but resection of other metastatic sites
   has not been explored fully.
   Methods. We have identified 14 patients who had solitary extracranial
   metastases treated aggressively after curative treatment of their
   non-small cell lung carcinoma. The histology was squamous carcinoma in
   5, adenocarcinoma in 8, and large cell carcinoma in 1. Initially, 3
   patients had stage I,5 stage II, and 6 stage IIIa disease.
   Results. The sites of metastases included extrathoracic lymph nodes
   (six), skeletal muscle (four), bone (three), and small bowel (one). The
   median disease-free interval before metastases was 19.5 months (range, 5
   to 71 months). Complete surgical resection of the metastatic site was
   the treatment in 12 of 14 patients. Two patients received only curative
   irradiation to the metastatic site, with complete response. The overall
   10-year actuarial survival (Kaplan-Meier) was 86\%. To date, 11 patients
   are alive and well after treatment of their metastases (17 months to 13
   years), 1 has recurrent disease, 1 died of recurrent widespread
   metastases, and 2 died of unrelated causes.
   Conclusion. Long-term survival is possible after treatment of isolated
   metastases to various sites from nonsmall cell lung carcinoma, but
   patient selection is critical.}},

Abstract = {{Cadherins are calcium-binding proteins which are responsible for
   cell-cell adhesion in biological systems. Cadherins are involved in
   embryo compaction, neurite growth, cellular differentiation and

   contains His-Ala-Val sequence and is derived from the N-cadherin
   sequence has been shown to inhibit embryo compaction and neurite growth;
   this is caused by inhibition of the cadherin-cadherin interactions.
   Peptide 1 was synthesized and its solution conformation was determined
   by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, circular dichroism and molecular
   dynamics simulations. These studies indicated that the peptide has an
   extended structure from residue Leu1 to Asp7, possibly a beta-sheet
   structure, followed by a beta-turn from Asp7 to Gly10. The X-ray crystal
   structure of a sequence similar to that of peptide 1 in hemagglutinin

   recurrent falls by selected clinical variables and the history of
   falling during the previous year.
   Design - A community-based prospective study covering two years.
   Setting - All home-dwelling persons (N=1016) aged 70 years or older
   living in five municipalities in northern Finland.
   Outcome measures - The risk factors of recurrent falling by selected
   clinical variables using cross-tabulations and multivariate analyses.
   Results - Previous falls, peripheral neuropathy, use of psychotropic
   medication and slow walking speed mere independent risk factors for
   recurrent falling. The risk of recurrent falling increased with an
   increasing number of previous falls.
   Conclusions - Early preventive measures should be taken among the
   elderly persons who are prone to falling. In order to reduce the risk of
   recurrent falls among the elderly, the attending physician should take a
   critical view of the use of psychotropic medications, and attempts
   should be made to treat conditions underlying peripheral neuropathies

Abstract = {{An in-service failure of a thin-walled titanium bleed-air duct from a
   wide-bodied commercial aircraft has been investigated. Cracking had
   occurred in the hear-affected zone (HAZ) adjacent to a circumferential
   weld joining two sections of the duct which was manufactured from
   commercially pure (grade 3) titanium sheet. Specimens were cut from the
   duct to include an intact weld and tested under known conditions
   (overload, fatigue, sustained loading) for comparison with the failed
   duct. Metallographic observations showed that cracking occurred through
   an acicular alpha HAZ, and fractographic observations revealed brittle,
   cleavage-like cracking with occasional areas of fatigue striations for
   both the failed duct and fatigued specimens. These observations, and the
   absence of sustained-load cracking in test specimens, suggested that the
   in-service failure had occurred primarily by fatigue. Observations also
   indicated that small, cleavage-like cracks had been present in the ducts
   prior to service, although whether these cracks were caused by overload
   tearing, stress-corrosion cracking, hot-salt cracking or fatigue was not
   clear. Other possible causes of cleavage-like cracking, e.g. the
   presence of hydrides as proposed for previous failures, contamination of
   HAZs by oxygen/nitrogen, are discussed. Possible ways of preventing

Abstract = {{An experimental and theoretical study of the behavior of a List/Buss
   Kokneter is presented. The experimental study which uses polypropylene
   considers (I) the interaction of the Kokneter with a crosshead screw

   modeling study considers the dynamics of flow including the influence of
   screw oscillation. Calculations are made for various individual Buss
   elements. A model is developed for the total system including the
   crosshead screw extruder. It is shown that an oscillating length of fill
   in the crosshead screw extruder can account for the throughput
   oscillation stabilization characteristics of the composite machine.
   Predictions of pressure profiles and positions of starvation in a
   starved flow machine are made.}},

   trophic group, order, and to lower taxa when possible. Population
   densities were determined after 7 weeks of crop growth and 3 weeks after
   incorporation of green crop residue. Plant-parasitic nematode genera
   included Pratylenchus, Longidorus, Xiphinema, and Paratrichodorus. The
   plant-feeder trophic group increased or was maintained on all crops
   after 7 weeks, at which time population densities were lowest on corn in
   1993 and equivalent among crops in 1994. The total number of nematodes

   cases and controls, swimming pool use was the only risk factor
   significantly associated with illness (OR = 13.0; 95\% Cl 2.6, 88.7).
   Following waterborne outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis associated with

Abstract = {{Lipid hydroperoxides are important products of enzymatic processes and
   autooxidation products of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Analysis of such
   compounds has proved difficult in the past, but negative ion
   electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was found to be suitable for
   direct analysis. Abundant {[}M-H](-) ions were observed in full scan
   mode for hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic (HPETE), hydroperoxyoctadecenoic
   acid isomers, and 5,12-diHPETE. Loss of water was observed for all
   species. Collisional activation and tandem mass spectrometry generated
   unique and characteristic spectra that shared some common features such
   as loss of small neutral molecules. More importantly, fragment ions that
   were indicative of the position of the hydroperoxide were observed.
   Collision-induced decomposition (CID) of {[}M-H2O](-) for the HPETE
   isomers was found to be virtually identical to the CID mass spectra of
   the {[}M-H](-) anions from corresponding keto-eicosatetraenoic acids,
   which suggests that the hydroperoxide anions decompose via a dehydration
   intermediate that resembles the keto acid molecular anion. Cleavage of
   the double bond allylic to the hydroperoxide formed structurally
   characteristic ions at m/z 129 from 5-HPETE, m/z 153 from 12-HPETE, and
   m/z 113 from 15-HPETE. Charge-driven allylic fragmentation led to
   formation of m/z 203 from 5-HPETE, m/z 179 from 12-HPETE, and m/z 219
   from 15-HPETE. Mechanisms consistent with the decomposition of stable
   isotope analogues are proposed for the formation of these and other
   characteristic ions. These specific decompositions can be used in
   multiple reaction monitoring to measure picomolar concentrations of
   hydroperoxides by direct high performance liquid chromatography tandem
   mass spectrometry.}},

   peculiarities of the biology of G. stercorosus (dwelling in forests, the
   possibility of larval development on plant diet). For the mite
   Neopodocinum meridionalis (Sellnick, 1931), G. stercorosus was proved to

Abstract = {{The presence of an intra-adrenal kallikrein-kinin system suggests the
   possible involvement of bradykinin (BK) in the regulation of adrenal
   functions. The present study aimed at invetigating whether BK is
   involved in the in vivo acute regulation of aldosterone (ALDO) and
   corticosterone (B) secretions in the rat. The bolus subcutaneous
   administration of 4 nmol of BK markedly raised the plasma concentrations
   of ALDO (PAC) and B (PBC) 60 min after the injection; PAC and PBC
   returned to the baseline within 120 min. D-Arg, {[}Hyp(3), D-Phe(7)]-BK,
   a specific antagonist of BK receptors (BK-A) did not suppress BK
   effects, and unexpectedly increased PAC and PBC and potentiated the
   secretagogue action of BK. BK was found to elicit a net rise in PAC and
   PBC also in rats bearing enucleated-regenerated adrenal glands deprived
   of medullary chromaffin cells. In light of the present findings the
   hypothesis is advanced that BK plays a role in the acute regulation of
   secretion of the adrenal cortex in rats, probably by a
   receptor-independent mechanism, whose elucidation requires further
   studies, but which does not conceivably involve cortical-medullary
   paracrine interactions. The marked secretagogue effect of BK-A may be
   ascribed to its hypertensive action, which by increasing adrenal blood
   flow raises steroid release.}},

   Manufacturability of the process continues to be a major challenge: a

   non-existent. The opportunity is there, the capability is not. Several
   equipment vendors (Westech Systems, Strasbaugh Inc., Speedfam Corp.,
   Cyberg Systems) have jumped in with claims of a complete solution.
   Unless detailed process integration is carried out together with
   automation, manufacturability of the process will continue to be a major
   challenge for the industry. Unpolished wafers in and polished clean
   wafers out, with no operator handling, is possible with the right

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the problem of the order parameter for simple

   associated with an internal geometry, which is characterized by a zero
   curvature tenser. It is shown that the field should be regarded as the
   distortion field, well known in the general theory of elasticity. An
   essential feature of the field is the lack of integrability conditions
   and the fact that the order parameter cannot be reduced to a vector. The
   direct consequence of this feature is the existence of dislocations and
   disclinations. The problem of the elastic energy density of the defects
   is solved by means of the hypothesis that the ideal unstressed state of
   the glass is realized in curved space.}},

   phospholipase-mediated signal transduction in vivo remain largely
   unknown. Three- to four-week-old C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to
   diets in which the 10\% lipid component of the purified diet was either
   corn oil ethyl ester (control) or (n-3) ethyl ester {[}(n-3)
   PUFA-enriched]. After 4 wk, thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal
   macrophages were harvested and assayed for (1) total DG mass, (2) DG
   molecular species fraction analyses by argentation TLC and (3)
   separation of phospholipid classes and analyses of their molecular
   species fractions. We found that basal DG mass and the increase in DG
   mass after stimulation with platelet-activating factor or phorbol
   myristate acetate were similar in cells from control and (n-3)
   PUFA-enriched diet groups, whereas ionomycin-stimulated DG formation was
   less in the cells from the (n-3) PUFA-enriched diet group. Analyses of
   DG molecular species fractions showed that the proportions of species
   with five and six double bonds were markedly greater in the (n-3)
   PUFA-enriched diet group macrophages compared with those of the control
   diet group. The molecular species fractions of all phospholipid classes
   including phosphatidylinositol showed substantial incorporation of (n-3)
   PUFA. These results demonstrate that dietary enrichment with (n-3) PUFA
   induces marked changes in DG metabolism in murine peritoneal
   macrophages. These changes may contribute to the mechanisms of
   antiinflammatory, antithrombotic and antineoplastic actions associated
   with dietary (n-3) PUFA supplementation.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decades a number of near optimal priority queues have been
   developed. Many of these priority queues are suitable for the efficient
   management of events generated during simulations of hard-particle
   systems. In this paper we compare the execution times of the fastest
   priority queues known today as well as some forms of binary search trees
   used as priority queues. We conclude that an unusual adaptation of a
   strictly balanced binary tree has the best performance for this class of

Abstract = {{We evaluated the ability of a series of 3-phenylhydantoin derivatives to
   induce a lymphoproliferative popliteal lymph node reaction in C57B1/6
   mice. 5-Aryl-3-phenylhydantoins induced a significant
   lymphoproliferative reaction, whereas the 5-alkyl-substituted and the
   unsubstituted 3-phenylhydantoins did not. 5-Alkyl-3-phenylhydantoins
   were unable to induce a lymphoproliferative reaction, unlike the
   corresponding 5-alkyl-3-phenyl-2-thiohydantoins, which have been
   reported to induce a significant lymphoproliferative reaction in the
   same strain of mice. Based on these results, we suggest that, to induce
   a lymphoproliferative popliteal lymph node reaction, hydantoins have to
   bind covalently to proteins through the N-atoms if they are activated by
   electrophilic groups bound to the hydantoin ring. We also suggest that
   2-thiohydantoins can bind through their S-atom, whereas hydantoins
   cannot do so through their O-atoms.}},

Abstract = {{Esophageal involvement with histoplasmosis is uncommon, but has been
   recognized in two clinical settings. Most commonly, the esophagus
   becomes involved as a result of contiguous mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
   Such patients usually present with dysphagia secondary to midesophageal
   compression or stricture. The esophagus can also be involved in cases of
   disseminated histoplasmosis. Esophageal ulcers or nodular lesions are
   the usual clinical manifestations in this setting. We report a case of
   mediastinal histoplasmosis with esophageal narrowing and mucosal
   ulceration that presented with dysphagia, The diagnosis was established
   at thoracotomy by the histologic finding of necrotizing granulomas and a
   positive fungal stain. The case was successfully treated with
   amphotericin B. The literature on esophageal and gastrointestinal
   histoplasmosis is reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{Ras proteins function during cell growth and development as essential,
   plasma membrane bound signaling proteins. Current evidence suggests that
   Ras is part of a signal transduction chain extending from extracellular
   signals to transcriptional regulation in the nucleus. Growth factor and
   cytokine activation of many tyrosine kinase and kinase-linked receptors
   recruits many proteins to the plasma membrane including Ras-specific
   guanine nucleotide releasing proteins (GNRP). Under the influence of a
   GNRP, Ras proteins bind GTP, resulting in activation of the Ras signal.
   The GTP-bound form of Ras is capable of interacting directly with
   RasGAP, neurofibromin, and the Raf kinases. Although believed to be
   endowed with some signaling capacity, RasGAP and neurofibromin act
   primarily to negatively regulate Ras. Based upon genetic and biochemical
   studies in a variety of diverse organisms, the Raf kinases are
   considered the primary targets of Ras signaling. Activation of the Raf
   kinases is the first step in a cascade of multiple protein kinases,
   including Mek, Erk1, and Erk2.
   We are attempting to understand structurally how activated Ras proteins
   interact specifically with Raf kinases to induce the downstream signals
   necessary for cell division. Using mutagenesis, peptide epitope
   scanning, and in vitro reconstitution of protein interactions, we have
   identified specific sites of association between the Ras-GTP and c-Raf-1
   proteins. The interaction between these contact points is essential for
   the plasma membrane localization of Raf, which ultimately leads to
   kinase activation. The formation of this protein complex is negatively
   regulated by protein kinase A (PKA) through phosphorylation of the
   c-Raf-1 N-terminus. Phosphorylation of c-Raf-1 serine 43 is believed to
   cause an N-terminal cap structure to cover the Ras docking site. (C)

   fulfillment/violation of expectations was related to location of sojourn
   and somewhat to gender, but not to prior intercultural experience. 
   Finally, there was a positive relationship between the violation of

Abstract = {{This article examines the development of medical knowledge and practice
   with regard to sickness in old age in the early years of the National
   Health Service. It suggests that the creation of a speciality of
   geriatrics was inspired by the need to prevent hospital beds being
   blocked by long-stay patients. Thus, the efficient use of hospital
   provision required the diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of
   elderly patients. The publication of medical texts on sickness in old
   age, provided the basis for a more interventionist approach to the care
   of sick, elderly people, but the development of geriatrics as a separate
   speciality was hindered by professional disputes over administrative
   responsibility, finding, private practice, and medical training. One key
   area of debate was whether sickness in old age was primarily a social
   rather than a medical problem. This needs to be considered with regard
   to the relationship between the hospital and the local community and the
   article examines the contribution of social and medical surveys of
   elderly people at home to the discourse on sickness and old age.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between
   self-rating and therapist rating in nonpsychotic patients with unipolar
   depressive disorders. We also wanted to find out whether the presence of
   personality disorders would influence the results. At admission and
   discharge 117 patients filled in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and
   were rated by a therapist on the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating
   Scale (CPRS). Based on the CPRS-scores, two indices of depression were
   calculated: CPRS-dep and Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale
   (MADRS). Sixty-three patients had DSM-III-R major depression. 30 had
   dysthymic disorder, while 24 had no depressive disorder. Eighty suffered
   from one or more personality disorders, mostly within cluster C. The
   self rating (BDI) and therapist ratings (CPRS-dep and MADRS) were
   strongly intercorrelated, with a nonsignificant tendency for weaker
   correlations in patients with personality disorders. All scales were
   useful to separate depressed from non-depressed, and to discriminate
   between major depression and dysthymic disorder, with a tendency in
   favour of BDI. As cut-off scores for major depression we recommend the
   sum score of 23 on the BDI, and mean scores of 1 on CPRS-dep and 1.1 on
   MADRS on a 0-3 scale. When these values are used, 70-79\% of patients
   are correctly classified.}},

Title = {{Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: Influence of intraoperative
   management on surgical outcome}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study was designed to determine the influence of changes
   in intraoperative management on the outcome of ruptured abdominal aortic
   aneurysm (RAAA).
   Methods: Retrospective review of our surgical experience of RAAA
   identified 61 patients and was separated into two periods: 1986 to 1988
   (group 1 {[}n = 21 patients]) and 1989 to 1994 (group 2 {[}n = 40
   patients]). Since 1989 operations have been conducted by two vascular
   surgeons without systemic administration of heparin and with control of
   suprarenal aorta if extensive hematoma is present, use of
   collagen-impregnated grafts, preferential repair with aortoaortic
   grafting, acid routine use of intraoperative autotransfusion.
   Results: Factors differing between the groups were use of intraoperative
   autotransfusion (4.76\% in group 1 vs 80\% in group 2,p < 0.00001),
   repair with tube grafting (42.8\% in group 1 vs 80\% in group 2, p =
   0.003), number of packed homologous red blood cells (7.5 +/- 5.2 units
   in group 1 vs 3.1 +/- 3.6 units in group 2, p = 0.008), postoperative
   blood loss (365 +/- 705 ml in group 1 vs 133 +/- 351 ml in group 2, p =
   0.01). The intraoperative mortality rate was significantly lower in
   group 2 (5\% vs 28.6\%, p = 0.016). The only predictive factor was the
   use of intraoperative autotransfusion with a lower mortality rate in
   patients undergoing autotransfusion (p = 0.029). The postoperative
   mortality rate was significantly Lower in group 2 (20\% vs 52.4\%, p =
   0.009). Predictive factors were use of intraoperative autotransfusion (p
   = 0.0009), age of the patients (P = 0.0039), and repair with tube graft
   (p = 0.039). The odds ratio of postoperative death was 25 times higher
   without intraoperative autotransfusion and seven times lower when a tube
   graft was used.
   Conclusion: Continuing efforts to achieve improvement in surgical
   technique and use of intraoperative autotransfusion were important
   determinants in lowering the postoperative mortality rate of RAAA to
   20\%.}},

Abstract = {{The mucociliary transport rate was measured using sequential images of
   graphite particles moving on 17 isolated human inferior turbinates.
   These had been removed from 13 patients who had normal saccharin
   clearance tests on the day of surgery. The initial mean mucociliary
   transport rate was found to be 4.1 mm/min rising to 5.0 mm/min 2 h after
   harvesting. After 4 h it fell to 3.7 mm/min. Where the rate was measured
   at two different sites on the same turbinate (n = 4), there was a close
   correlation over 6 h (r = 0.95, P < 0.001). When the turbinates were
   exposed to an aqueous solution of adrenaline (1:10000) or a 2.5\%
   cocaine solution, the rate increased or decreased respectively by 100\%
   and 58\% but returned to within 10\% of the initial level within 2 h. We
   believe that the isolated inferior turbinate can be considered a useful

Abstract = {{In four hectares of primary montane wet forest in Monteverde, Costa
   Rica, 1403 live trees (>10 cm diameter at breast height) were censused
   for major damage and mortality during a four-year period. Overall tree
   damage and mortality after four years was 15.9 trees ha(-1) yr(-1), with
   over 80 percent due to snapping of trunks and uprooting of whole trees.
   Of the 73 stems that snapped during the study interval, 20 regenerated
   live foliage from their broken seems. This resulted in an actual
   mortality rate of 12.7 trees ha(-1) yr(-1), or 2.2 percent, which is in
   the mid-range of annual tree mortality reported for other forests. Tree
   death occurred during all seasons of the year, but rates were highest
   during the wet season. Individuals of gap-colonizing species died at a
   higher rate than expected from their representation in the population.
   This study suggests chat although montane sites are subject to high
   winds and unstable soils, overall rates and types of mortality are
   similar to lowland forest sites.}},

Abstract = {{Two experiments, using Romney Marsh ewes, tested for the existence and
   role of a critical interval of the circadian pacemaker located near dusk
   that may be integrally involved in the precise timing of the breeding
   season. Groups of Romney Marsh ewes (n = 6) were provided with exogenous
   melatonin by injection at dusk (Experiment 1) or by infusion at dawn or
   subjected to extended darkness at dawn (Experiment 2) from the winter to
   the summer solstice before being exposed to natural photoperiod at
   latitude 35 degrees S. Other than the experimental protocols, all
   animals were held in natural photoperiod. The onset of the breeding
   season (defined as cyclic ovarian activity as indicated by plasma
   progesterone monitoring) was normal in those animals treated with
   morning melatonin but was delayed in those animals treated with
   melatonin at dusk or extended darkness at dawn compared to controls in
   natural photoperiod (p < .01). Exogenous melatonin at dusk was
   associated with a phase advance of the onset of the circadian pacemaker
   (as measured by endogenous melatonin in acutely extended darkness);
   additional darkness at dawn was associated with a phase delay of both
   the onset and the offset of the circadian pacemaker. Exogenous morning
   melatonin did not change the phase of the circadian pacemaker relative
   to the controls. The results are consistent with an external coincidence
   model of seasonal breeding in which a critical interval of the circadian
   pacemaker requires exposure to light during spring/summer to time estrus
   correctly. The proposed critical interval appears to be located near
   dusk in this model and is phase locked to the circadian pacemaker. The
   effect of the exogenous melatonin on the timing of the breeding season
   is similar to darkness when administered at dusk but is not equivalent
   to darkness at dawn. The timing of anestrus was not affected by any of
   the experimental treatments and may reflect a common response to an
   environmental influence.}},

Abstract = {{Atherosclerosis and postangioplasty restenosis may result from abnormal

   agent, and show little induction of collagen synthesis to TGF-beta 1,
   yet cells grown from human vascular lesions are growth stimulated by
   TGF-beta 1 and markedly increase collagen synthesis, Both cell types
   increase plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 production, switch actin
   phenotypes in response to TGF-beta 1, and produce similar levels of
   TGF-P activity, Membrane cross-linking of I-125-TGF-beta 1 indicates
   that normal human smooth muscle cells express type I, II, and III
   receptors, The type II receptor is strikingly decreased in lesion cells,
   with little change in the type I or III receptors, RT-PCR confirmed that
   the type LI TGF-beta 1 receptor mRNA is reduced in lesion cells,
   Transfection of the type II receptor into lesion cells restores the
   growth inhibitory response to TGF-P1, implying that signaling remains
   responsive, Because TGF-P1 is overexpressed in fibroproliferative
   vascular lesions, receptor-variant cells would be allowed to grow in a

Abstract = {{The expression of cytosolic and plastid pyruvate kinase (PK; E.C.
   2.7.1.40) in various tissues of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit
   Havana SRI) was investigated. To facilitate this study, a cDNA clone for
   cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PKc) was isolated from a tobacco seed cDNA
   expression library. This cDNA has an open reading frame capable of
   encoding a 508-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of
   55.1 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence has 76\% identity with the
   sequence of potato PKc. Southern blot analysis shows that N. tabacum
   contains two copies of the PKc gene, each derived from the single gene
   found in its progenitors, N. tomentosiformis and N. sylvestris. Northern
   blots detected a 1.9-kb band in flower, seed, root, stem and leaf
   tissues of N. tabacum. Immunoblotting using anti-{[}castor oil seed
   (COS) PKc]-immunoglobulin G (IgG) detected 58- and 56-kDa polypeptides
   in all tobacco tissues examined. In developing seeds, mRNA levels were
   low except for a peak at 8 days post anthesis (dpa), whereas the highest
   level of the PKc polypeptides was detected 10-16 dpa. The persistence of
   PKc well after the peak in mRNA levels suggests that PKc is stable in
   developing seeds. Our previous studies have shown that leucoplast PK
   (PKp) mRNA could be detected throughout tobacco seed development as well
   as in somatic tissues. In developing seeds, steady state PKp mRNA levels
   showed a broad peak of accumulation from 8-20 dpa, reaching maximum
   levels at 16 dpa. In the present study, polypeptides of 63 and 60 kDa
   were detected on immunoblots probed with anti(COS PKp)-IgG in developing
   tobacco seeds 10-20 dpa. The observed pattern of PKp protein
   accumulation closely correlated with the profile of steady state mRNA
   levels suggesting that this isoenzyme has a much greater rate of
   turnover than that of PKc. In contrast to PKc, there was no detectable
   accumulation of PKp protein at other times during seed development or in
   somatic tissues even though significant levels of PKp mRNA could be
   detected. The differences in the protein accumulation and mRNA
   expression patterns of PKc and PKp suggest that the tissue-specific and
   developmental expression of these isoenzymes in tobacco may be
   controlled by independent transcriptional and post-transcriptional
   mechanisms.}},

   study was to assess whether protein kinase C (PKC) transduces the LPS

   ng/ml) stimulated myocyte PKC activity, inducible NOS (iNOS) expression,
   and NOS activity in a time- and protein synthesis-dependent fashion.
   Directly activating PKC with beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (beta-PDB)
   also induced myocyte iNOS synthesis and NOS activity and reduced
   electrically stimulated contractility, while the inactive alpha-PDB was
   ineffectual. Contractility could be restored to beta-PDB-incubated cells
   by superfusion with the NOS inhibitor N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl
   ester. PKC blockade with sphingosine, chelerythrine, or calphostin-C
   precluded LPS- and beta-PDB-induced increases in NOS activity and
   protected contractility. Depletion of PKC by 18 h of incubation with
   beta-PDB in the presence of chelerythrine also blocked acquisition of
   enhanced NOS activity and contractile dysfunction when the myocytes were
   subsequently exposed to LPS. These findings suggest that PKC is a
   significant intracellular mediator for the effects of LPS on cardiac

Abstract = {{Human serum angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) levels vary
   substantially between individuals and are highly heritable. Segregation
   analysis in European families has shown that more than half of the total
   variability in ACE levels is influenced by quantitative-trait loci
   (QTL). One of these QTLs is located within or close to the ACE locus
   itself, Combined segregation/linkage analysis in a series of African
   Caribbean families from Jamaica shows that the ACE insertion-deletion
   polymorphism is in moderate linkage disequilibrium with an ACE-linked
   QTL. Linkage analysis with a highly informative polymorphism at the
   neighboring growth-hormone gene (GH) shows surprisingly little support
   for linkage (LOD score {[}Z] = 0.12). An extended analysis with a
   two-QTL model, where an ACE-linked QTL interacts additively with an
   unlinked QTL, significantly improves both the fit of the model (P =
   .002) and the support for linkage between the ACE-linked QTL and GH
   polymorphism (Z = 5.0). We conclude that two QTLs jointly influence
   serum ACE levels in this population. One QTL is located within or close
   to the ACE locus and explains 27\% of the total variability; the second
   QTL is unlinked to the ACE locus and explains 52\% of the variability.

Title = {{Gas drag and the orbital evolution of a captured triton}},
Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{392-413}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Gas drag is a possible mechanism for capturing Triton. We examine the
   energetics of gas drag capture, compare the role of gas drag in
   subsequent orbital evolution with that of tides, and evaluate whether a
   Triton captured by gas drag could have avoided spiraling into Neptune.
   On its own, gas drag causes the inclination of an orbit to become more
   prograde, and Triton's retrograde status potentially places an upper
   limit on the orbital energy lost due to gas drag and hence a lower limit
   on the amount of tidal evolution and concomitant heating. A putative
   Neptune nebula is modeled after a minimum mass Uranus nebula and is
   assumed to be isothermal and cool. Triton's initial apocenter is set at
   the radius of Neptune's Hill sphere and its initial pericenter within
   the radial range of the nebula. Despite strong evolution of both
   semimajor axis and eccentricity, Triton's inclination only changes by a
   few degrees due to gas drag, when uncoupled to inclination variations
   due to solar-torque-induced precession. Results are insensitive to
   variations in radial surface density distribution or temperature, for
   fixed nebular mass. Thus, Triton could have evolved to its present
   retrograde circular orbit by gas drag alone, and massive tidal heating
   is not an inevitable consequence of capture. Nontrivial tidal heating is
   still likely, though, because Triton's post-gas-drag eccentricity, i.e.,
   that remaining when Triton's present-day angular momentum was reached,
   is likely to have exceeded similar to 0.2. Despite Triton's mass,
   single-pass capture is shown to be energetically favorable for our
   nominal nebula. Capture is also energetically possible for (i) nebulae
   that are less massive by an order of magnitude, if Triton's heliocentric
   orbit was energetically close to a temporary gravitational capture, and
   (ii) the solar gas flowing into Neptune's accretion sphere at an earlier
   stage of formation. Survival of Triton against gas drag in the last case
   is unlikely, but the low-mass case may apply to the compact H- and
   He-depleted nebulae that form around planets such as Uranus and Neptune
   in various accretion scenarios. Once captured, evolution is rapid in the
   absence of solar perturbations, with the orbital angular momentum
   reduced to Triton's present value in under 10(3) years for the case of
   the nominal nebula. Solar tides, however, cause Triton's orbit to
   oscillate in and out of the protosatellite nebula and can extend the
   gasdrag time scale, for certain initial conditions, to similar to
   10(4)-10(5) years. Therefore Triton could have survived a short-lived
   (similar to 10(3) years), hot, turbulent nebula that may have formed by
   a giant impact with Neptune. It might have also survived a cooler, less
   turbulent, but longer-lived (similar to 10(6) years) low-mass nebula:
   the mass and angular momentum of Triton and that of a low-mass (H-and
   He-depleted) nebula are comparable, so orbital evolution for such a
   capture may `'self-terminate.'' In particular, Triton may clear an
   annular region in the nebula after multiple passes through it, and for
   sufficiently slow radial redistribution of nebular mass, cease evolving
   by gas drag entirely. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To characterize the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features of
   patellar tendinitis.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with a clinical diagnosis of
   patellar tendinitis underwent gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging of the
   knee.
   RESULTS: Grades of patellar abnormality, based on findings in the
   enthesial region at MR imaging, correlated with signs of increasing
   fibrovascular repair: grade 1 (n = 4), enhancing area adjacent to
   patellar apex, with marginal zone of intermediate signal intensity, and
   a patellar apical chondral-bone avulsion; grade 2 (n = 5), same signs as
   grade 1 damage but without avulsion; grade 3 (n = 6), homogeneous,
   nonenhancing area of intermediate signal intensity adjacent to the
   patellar apex seen on all images. Changes were most obvious posteriorly
   and involved the central and medial thirds of the tendon. Chronic injury
   to the medial retinaculum was a common associated finding.
   CONCLUSION: Patellar tendinitis demonstrates a consistent spectrum of
   changes at MR imaging that can aid understanding of the origin and
   treatment of damage.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics
   of patients whose identities are unknown at presentation to psychiatric
   services.
   Method: We retrospectively reviewed 12 years of presentations to an
   emergency psychiatric unit and identified 37 anonymous presentations in
   that period, Cases were assessed with regard to demographic data, legal
   status, reasons for presentation, putative diagnosis at presentation,
   eventual documented (ICD-9) diagnosis, previous history, duration of
   anonymity, method of identification and re-occurrence.
   Results: 0.6\% of all patients who presented during the study period
   were unidentified for at least 24 hours. Patients were young (mean age
   33.6 years), Over half were of foreign nationality (53\%), The majority
   were suffering from major psychotic illnesses (86\%). When compared with
   all admissions during the study period, schizophrenia and drug-induced
   psychoses were significantly more common in the group unidentified at
   presentation. Malingering, organic psychiatric disorders and
   dissociative states were not commonly encountered underlying diagnoses,
   All of our patients were subsequently identified, Successful
   identification methods included self admission, careful examination of
   personal belongings, careful history taking, liaison with police and
   recognition by staff. Patients frequently had a previous psychiatric
   history (91\%). Recurrence was uncommon.
   Conclusion: The anonymous presentation represents a unique challenge to
   the investigative skills of the psychiatrist. The application of basic
   strategies enables the successful identification of the majority of
   cases.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the morphological variation of the holoparasitic mistletoe
   Tristerix aphyllus in 20 populations of central Chile by focusing upon 8
   qualitative characters that represent different architectural attributes
   of the parasite. Our results show that specific characters present a low
   congruent variation across populations, which suggests a low integration
   of the architectural phenotype. similarly, 44 different combinations of
   traits were identified, and their prevalence at each population was
   indistinguishable from that occasioned by a random process. Characters
   did not contribute equally to the overall architectural variation.
   sympodial growth pattern, tetrapodism, single branch, and closed branch
   were the most important traits in contributing to architectural
   variation across populations. The disintegrated architectural phenotype
   indicates absence of a unique architectural design in this species.
   Rather, the random prevalence of character combinations suggests that
   the geographical pattern may be better described as a `'random
   patchwork''. On the base of these antecedents, and considering the
   leafless holoparasitic biology of T. aphyllus we suggest that non
   adaptive architecture prevails in this species.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of the four founding lineage haplogroups in Native
   Americans from North, Central, and South America shows a north to south
   increase in the frequency of lineage B and a North to South decrease in
   the frequency of lineage A. All four founding lineage haplogroups were
   detected in North, Central, and South America, and in Greenberg et al.'s

   (Amerind, NaDene, and Eskaleut), with all four haplogroups often found
   within a single population. Lineage A was the most common lineage in
   North America, regardless of language group. This overall distribution
   is most parsimonious with a single wave of migration into the New World
   which included multiple variants of all four founding lineage types.
   Torroni et al.'s ({[}1993a] Am. J. Hum. Genet. 53:563-590) report that
   lineage B has a more recent divergence time than the other three
   lineages can best be explained by multiple variants of lineages A, C,
   and D, and fewer variants of lineage B entering the New World.

   PET centres that responded to the questionnaire was 26, which included
   more than 90\% of the larger European PET centres. The survey showed
   that 2-{[}F-18]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose is by far the most important PET

   by {[}O-15]water, {[}O-15]carbonmonoxide, {[}N-13]ammonia,

   PET radiopharmaceuticals are in regular use, however, at rather low

   interlopers included in the most recently identified asteroid families
   is developed, The method is based on the analysis of the local
   properties of the asteroidal distribution in the zones of the proper
   element space in which families are located, An application to the most
   important families listed by Zappala et al. (1995, Icarus 166) allows
   one to derive the probable amount of interlopers at different size
   ranges, In some cases, the results suggest that the criteria adopted to
   derive the nominal memberships have been quite conservative, The
   procedure developed in this paper allows one to assess `'how many''
   interlopers are probably included in the nominal member lists, but not
   `'which ones.'' However, such a quantitative estimate of the amount of
   probable interlopers is very useful and should be taken into account in
   any analysis of the physical properties of the families, since the
   presence of interlopers can explain some apparent discrepancies in
   several cases. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of calcium on the control exerted by the adenine nucleotide
   translocator over respiration in isolated heart mitochondria was
   investigated in order to determine whether calcium directly stimulates
   the translocator, At respiration rates intermediate between states 3 and
   4, Ca2+ is shown to increase the control over 2-oxoglutarate oxidation
   exerted by the adenine nucleotide translocator in rat heart
   mitochondria, This did not occur when succinate was the respiratory
   substrate, even though the control exerted by the translocator was
   substantial, indicating that Ca2+ does not have a direct effect on the
   adenine nucleotide translocator, Ca2+ increased the uncoupled oxidation
   rate of 2-oxoglutarate, but not succinate, Using the summation theorem
   for flux control, the effect of Ca2+ is explained by a shift of the
   control over respiration rate toward the adenine nucleotide
   translocator, from the respiratory chain, presumably as the result of
   the activation of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Increasingly discussions of education reform end up in debate over how
   much money will be required refund it. Although educators often argue
   for more funds and critics counter that school spending is already at an
   ail-time high, neither group has looked systematically at the use
   existing resources. This analysis addresses how school systems might
   reconsider their use of teachers, their most important and expensive
   resource, to support reform. A case study of Boston Public Schools shows
   how the specialization and fragmentation of teaching resources reduced
   the individual attention most students received and limited a school's
   flexibility to respond to student needs. The analysis develops three
   measures that might be used as indicators of the size of opportunity for
   freeing reaching resources. It identifies four practices that together
   account for over 40\% of Boston's teaching resources and could provide
   significant opportunity to redirect, resources to support reform.}},

Abstract = {{The p53 tumor suppressor gene product is a sequence-specific DNA-binding
   protein that is necessary for the G(1) arrest of many cell types,
   Consistent with its role as a cell cycle checkpoint factor, p53 has been
   shown to be capable of both transcriptional activation and
   repression.;Here we show a new potential role for p53 as a
   DNA-binding-dependent regulator of DNA replication. Constructs
   containing multiple copies of the ribosomal gene cluster (RGC) p53
   binding site cloned on the late side of the polyomavirus origin were
   used in in vitro replication assays. In the presence of p53, the
   replication of these constructs was strongly inhibited, while the
   replication of constructs containing a mutant version of the RGC site
   was not affected by p53. Several tumor-derived mutant p53 proteins were
   unable to inhibit replication of the construct with wild-type RGC sites,
   Additionally, the transactivator GAL4-VP16 was unable to inhibit
   replication of a construct containing GAL4 binding sites adjacent to the
   polyomavirus origin, We also show that the inhibition by p53 can occur
   from sites cloned as far as 600 bp from the origin, Preincubation
   experiments suggest that p53 inhibits replication at a step mediated by
   ATP, possibly by inhibiting the binding of polyomavirus T antigen to the
   core origin, The presence of an endogenous p53 binding site in the
   polyomavirus origin suggests potential mechanisms for the observed
   inhibition.}},

Abstract = {{A 75 kDa protein from spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana)
   gut-juice has been isolated and shown to cause a specific precipitation
   of the delta-endotoxin from Bacillus thurirtgiensis subsp, soffo. This
   75 kDa protein, separated by either column chromatography or SDS-PAGE,
   caused precipitation of the sotto toxin in both agarose diffusion gels
   and the PAGE gels, The precipitation event leads to limited proteolysis
   of the toxin and loss of larval toxicity, SDSPAGE analysis of the
   precipitated toxin indicates that proteolysis of the toxin is not a
   prerequisite for precipitation, The protein responsible for
   precipitation, exhibits elastase-like adtivity and appears to be a
   complex which partially dissociates during boiling in SDS-PAGE sample
   buffer, Gut-juice from gypsy moth, forest tent caterpillar and white
   mark tussock moth also precipitated 6-endotoxin, but silkworm gut-juice
   gave a much weaker response, These results provide further evidence
   that, in the larval gut, differential processing of 6-endotoxin may play
   a role in the expression of activity towards various insect larvae,}},

Abstract = {{An elastic-plastic beam bending model has been developed to simulate the
   post-upper skin failure energy absorption behaviour of polymer composite
   sandwich beams under three-point bending. The beam skins consist of
   woven and chopped strand glass, while the core is a resin impregnated
   non-woven polyester material known as Coremat. A polyester resin was
   used for the construction. The theoretical model consists of a central
   hinge dominated by a crushing core and tensile elastic strains in the
   lower skin. Experimental measurements of the non-linear force-deflection
   characteristics for the beam are compared to the theoretical predictions
   from the model, and it is shown that the shear crushing of the core has
   an important effect on the behaviour of the beam. The model shows that
   the most important material properties are the lower skin tensile
   failure strain and the core crushing strength. Dynamic effects are
   included in the model in the form of a strain rate dependence of the
   core crushing stress and the strain rate dependence of the failure
   strain in the lower skin. The increase in material strength with strain
   rate gives rise to an improved energy absorption capacity for the beam
   under impact loading.}},

Abstract = {{Models of clusters are obtained by assigning Morse pairwise atomic
   interactions within the cluster and Lennard-Jones pairwise atomic
   interactions between clusters. Classical trajectory calculations and
   Monte Carlo sampling methods are then used to study energy transfer
   between a highly excited reactant cluster and a medium cluster and the
   statistical limits which apply to such energy transfer. The focus is on
   the complexity (size) dependence of the energy transfer efficiency. The
   impact parameter dependence of the average energy transferred per
   collision (Delta E), the cross section pi b(max)(2) for the energy
   transfer and the dependence of (Delta E) on interaction strength are
   also studied. The initial energy of the target cluster and the
   temperature of the medium cluster are varied to allow comparison with
   the trends predicted by ergodic collision theory (ECT). Most
   trajectories are obtained for zero impact parameter b but the
   b-dependence of (Delta E) is studied and modeled by a simple functional
   form. The energy transfer kernel P(E', E) is examined. The shape found
   in the MD simulation for weak interaction collisions is well reproduced
   by an empirically constrained ECT model. When the interaction strength
   is enhanced to weak chemical bonding level P(E', E) is observed to split
   into a dominant ECT-like peak and an elastic central peak, i.e., a
   distinctly bimodal form with interesting mechanistic implications.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships
   of personality traits and stress with gingival inflammation and with
   soft-tissue oral pathology.
   Methods: Personality traits of psychoticism (P), extroversion and
   introversion (E), and neuroticism (N) were measured with Eysenck's
   personality questionnaire (EPQ). Stress was measured with a modified
   organizational and individual assessment survey (OIAS) developed by
   Hendrix. Military recruits from Ft. Leonard Wood, Missouri, were
   examined for soft-tissue oral pathology and gingival status at weeks one
   (n=241) and six (n=61) of basic combat training (BCT). The EPQ and OIAS
   were administered to 217 recruits during week six of BCT. A discriminant
   analysis was used to determine correlations among study variables.
   Results: Significant correlations (P<.05) were found between personality
   traits and various measures of tolerance of stress. Little variance was
   found between groups originally presenting with or without disease. Only
   physical stress (P<.05) was shown to affect soft-tissue pathology, while
   gingival inflammation correlated significantly to E scores (P<.02),
   tolerance to change (P<.02), and anxiety (P<.05).
   Conclusions: Data support a possible relationship among certain
   personality traits, stress variables, and gingival inflammation or
   soft-tissue pathology in recruits with extreme personality
   characteristics or perception of high physical stress levels in basic
   combat training.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the role of endogenously secreted tachykinins in mediating
   contraction caused by potassium chloride (KCl) in guinea pig tracheal
   smooth muscle (TSM) strips in vitro. Maximal isometric contraction was
   elicited with similar to 45 mM KCl and was 196 +/- 8\% of the response
   to electrical field stimulation (\%EFS) in the same tissues. Muscarinic
   receptor blockade with atropine modestly attenuated this contraction
   caused by KCl to 175 +/- 9 \%EFS (P < 0.05), and treatment with a
   selective neurokinin subtype 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist, LY-297911,
   caused even greater inhibition of KCl-elicited contraction to 124 +/- 8
   \%EFS (P < 0.001). By contrast, SR-48968, a selective NK2 antagonist,
   had no effect on contraction caused by KCl (183 +/- 9 \%EFS; P = NS vs.
   KCl alone). However, given together at the same concentration, SR-48968
   augmented the inhibition of contraction caused by LY-297911 to 93 +/- 15
   \%EFS (P < 0.05 vs. LY-297911 alone). In contrast to the effect on
   KCl-induced contraction, LY-297911 caused only moderate inhibition of
   the contraction caused by capsaicin to 81 +/- 13 \%EFS (P < 0.05 vs.
   control, 114 +/- 15 \%EFS), whereas SR-48968 caused substantial
   attenuation of contraction caused by capsaicin to 23 +/- 5 \%EFS (P <
   0.005 vs. LY-297911). We demonstrate that a significant portion of the
   contraction caused by KCl, in addition to capsaicin, is elicited in
   guinea pig TSM through neurokinin secretion. However, NK1 receptors
   predominantly mediate contraction caused by KCl, and NK2 receptors
   predominantly mediate contraction elicited by capsaicin in guinea pig
   airway smooth muscle.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Between 1982 and 1984, we successfully performed `'one and a
   half ventricular repair'' using a Glenn shunt for 3 patients with
   pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum. Here we review the
   10-year follow-up results.
   Methods. In these patients, the preoperative Z scores of the tricuspid
   valve diameters ranged from -5.2 to -6.5. Right ventricular outflow
   tract reconstruction combined with a Glenn shunt were performed in all
   patients. Cardiac catheterization was done at least 10 years
   postoperatively.
   Results. All 3 patients have maintained New York Heart Association
   functional class I status for more than 10 years. Angiography in 2
   patients confirms sufficient left pulmonary artery pressure with
   pulsatile blood flow and good right ventricular contraction. A pulmonary
   arteriovenous fistula has developed in 1 patient.
   Conclusions. Although the lower limits of the tricuspid valve diameter
   for `'one and a half ventricular repair'' using a cavopulmonary shunt
   have not yet been determined, we successfully performed this procedure
   in 3 patients with severely hypoplastic right ventricles and tricuspid
   valve diameter Z scores of less than -5.0. The results up to 10 years
   postoperatively are acceptable.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To study blood pressure and antihypertensive drug treatment
   in subjects with contrasting family histories of hypertension.
   Subjects and methods: We grouped 520 offspring examined in 1990
   (mean+/-SD age 36+/-7 years) according to their parents' blood pressure
   screened in 1963-1964 as offspring of two normotensive
   (systolic/diastolic blood pressure <135/70 mmHg) parents (group 1);
   offspring of one hypertensive (greater than or equal to 145/95 mmHg) and
   one normotensive (<135/70 mmHg) parent (group 2); and offspring of two
   hypertensive (greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg) parents (group 3).
   Offspring blood pressure was measured with a conventional mercury
   sphygmomanometer by one observer. The mean of the last two of three
   seated measurements was used for analyses. Drug treatment was determined
   by interview.
   Results: Mean +/-SD blood pressure was lowest in group 1 (121 +/- 12/72
   +/- 10 mmHg), intermediate in group 2 (125 +/- 12/76 +/- 9 mmHg) and
   highest in group 3 (135 +/- 15/85 +/- 11 mmHg), P < 0.01 for each. Of
   the subjects in groups 1, 2 and 3, 1.3, 2.4 and 11.7\%, respectively,
   were taking antihypertensive drugs (P < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Screening blood pressure in parents has implications for
   offspring blood pressure almost 30 years later. Offspring of
   hypertensive parents have higher blood pressure and are given
   antihypertensive drugs at higher rates than the offspring of
   normotensive parents. Also, substantial differences were seen between
   the offspring of one and of two hypertensive parents. Thus, risk
   associated with a family history of hypertension varies with the
   definition of the family history. To obtain maximum contrast in the
   predisposition to high blood pressure, comparative studies in offspring
   of hypertensive and normotensive families should be based on blood
   pressure data from both parents.}},

Abstract = {{The cellular automata `'game of life'' (GL) proposed by J. Conway
   simulates the dynamic evolution of a society of living organisms. It has
   been extensively studied in order to understand the emergence of
   complexity and diversity from a set of local rules. More recently, the
   capability of GL to self-oranize into a critical state has opened an
   interesting debate. In this work we adopt a different approach: by
   introducing stochastic rules in the GL it is found that `'life''
   exhibits a very rich critical behavior. Discontinuous (first-order)
   irreversible phase transitions (IPT's) between an extinct phase and a
   steady state supporting life are found. A precise location of the
   critical edge is achieved by means of-an epidemic analysis, which also
   allows us to determine dynamic critical exponents. Furthermore, by means
   of a damage spreading study we conclude that the living phase is
   chaotic. The edge of the frozen-chaotic transition coincides with that
   of the IPT's life extinction. Close to the edge, fractal spreading of
   the damage is observed; however, deep inside the living phase such
   spreading becomes homogeneous.}},

Abstract = {{Surface ozone (O-3) concentrations have proved to be difficult to
   control and regional O-3 concentrations appear to be increasing in many
   parts of the world. Eucalyptus species are widely used as plantation
   trees in many regions that have Mediterranean, warm temperate and
   subtropical climates. An increased knowledge of the effects of
   tropospheric O-3 on Eucalyptus trees may assist in the management of
   these plantations. The present study was set up to evaluate injury and
   measure growth reduction caused by O-3 in eight Eucalyptus species.
   Seven month old saplings were exposed to diurnally varied concentrations
   of 26 or 172 nll(-1) O-3 (7h mean) 7h day(-1), 5 days in every 14 days,
   for 18 weeks. The plants were grown in open top field chambers fitted
   with rain excluders. Significant differences were found between the
   responses of different species. There was no visible injury or dry
   weight reduction in E. globulus. However O-3 exposure caused a 30\%
   weight reduction and 90\% leaf injury in E microcorys. E. gomphocephala
   also experienced a 30\% weight reduction but no significant leaf injury.
   Hence Eucalyptus plantations in regions with the potential for
   photochemical smog formation, such as some of the rapidly developing
   industrialising nations in Asia and South America, will need to consider
   O-3 tolerance when selecting plantation trees.}},

Abstract = {{The development of a reliable helicopter gearbox health monitoring
   system (HMS) has been the subject of considerable research over the past
   15 years. The deployment of such a system could lead to a significant
   saving in lives and vehicles as well as dramatically reduce the cost of
   helicopter maintenance. Recent research results indicate that a neural
   network-based system could provide a viable solution to the problem.
   This paper presents two neural network-based realizations of an KMS
   system. A hybrid (digital/analog) neural system is proposed as an
   extremely accurate off-line monitoring tool used to reduce helicopter
   gearbox maintenance costs. In addition, an all analog neural network is
   proposed as a real-time helicopter gearbox fault monitor that can
   exploit the ability of an analog neural network to directly compute the
   discrete Fourier transform (DFT) as a sum of weighted samples. Hardware
   performance results are obtained using the Integrated Neural Computing
   Architecture (INCA/1) analog neural network platform that was designed
   and developed at The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory. The results
   indicate that it is possible to achieve a 100\% fault detection rate
   with 0\% false alarm rate by performing a DFT directly on the first
   layer of INCA/1 followed by a small-size two-layer feed-forward neural
   network and a simple post-processing majority voting stage. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{To improve the management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in a single
   center, we used interferon alpha (IFN alpha) to treat newly diagnosed
   CML patients and investigated the factors predictive of a major
   cytogenetic response. Fifty-two patients (pts) with a median age of 51.5
   years (16-68), were given interferon alpha (IFN alpha) (5
   millions/m(2)/day, subcutaneously). The median interval between
   diagnosis and IFN alpha was 41.5 days (0-160). The doses of INF alpha
   were adjusted to maintain the white blood cell (WBC) count between 1.5
   and 5 x 10(9)/l and the platelet count between 50 and 100 x 10(9)/l. At
   diagnosis, Sokal's criteria were used to classify patients into three
   groups: low (n = 24), intermediate (n = 19) and high risk (n = 9). A
   complete hematological response (CHR) was achieved in 42 cases (80.7\%).
   A partial response was present in nine; only one patient did not
   respond. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, only the age at
   diagnosis was found to influence the CHR rate (P = 0.06). Cytogenetic
   response was evaluated in 46 responder patients. Twenty-three patients
   achieved a major cytogenetic response (MCR) which was either partial
   (greater than or equal to 65\% Ph negative cells) (n = 3) or complete
   (CCR) (n = 20). By univariate analysis, two disease-related variables
   were found to influence the MCR rate in 40 evaluable CHR patients:
   spleen size at diagnosis and peripheral blood blast percentage. However,
   using either univariate or multivariate analysis, the most significant
   factor was the achievement of CHR within 3 months (P < 0.0004 and P <
   0.0002, respectively). These results show that INF alpha can induce high
   rates of hematological and cytogenetic responses when administered in
   doses leading to myelosuppression. The achievement of CHR within 3
   months could be useful to identify early, those patients who will not
   respond to IFN alpha and who need alternative treatments such as
   allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES. A rapid gradient echo technique was optimized
   to allow breath-held imaging of the lung parenchyma. The ability of this
   sequence to detect interstitial lung disease was then compared with high
   resolution computed tomography.
   METHODS. A Turbo-FLASH gradient echo sequence (repetition time {[}TR]
   4.7, echo time {[}TE] 2) was optimized using four volunteers. The
   parameters varied, including flip angle, inversion time, slice
   thickness, and number of measurements per unit time. The effect on
   signal to noise ratio of lung inflation and position within the lung
   were also studied. The optimized sequence was then compared with high
   resolution computed tomography in five patients being investigated for
   interstitial lung disease.
   RESULTS. Greatest signal was achieved using no inversion prepulse. This
   allowed up to six measurements, each with two acquisitions, during a
   single breath-hold. Optimum signal to noise ratio was achieved using a
   flip angle of 10 degrees with a 20-mm slice thickness, although a 10-mm
   slice was felt to be preferable for clinical use. Greatest signal to
   noise ratio was generated in the posterior aspect of the lung in full
   expiration. Comparison of the optimized magnetic resonance imaging
   technique with high resolution computed tomography showed no significant
   difference (P = 0.17) when assessing the proportion of diseased to
   normal lung.
   CONCLUSIONS. Using standard magnetic resonance software and hardware, it
   has been possible to use a breath-hold sequence that allows detection
   and quantification of interstitial lung disease.}},

   In both cases, standard low-order approximations to the exact problem,

   proceed reasonably with quantization. In addition, the two-particle
   system has specific characteristics. The center-of-momentum motion
   separates out. The dependence of the solutions on the mass ratio of the
   two particles can be examined. Further, not only does the relative
   motion have the ordinary solution, in which the two particles move out
   of phase, it can also have an extraordinary solution, in which they move
   in phase with each other. Finally, the total generalized linear momentum

   explore the resonant structure of the Kuiper belt. We find that the
   inner order-one mean motion resonances with Neptune are very stable and
   give phase-protection from close encounters with Neptune. The 2/3
   resonance is very complex and stable only at small amplitude of
   libration. The overlapping secular resonances at 36 and 41 AU give rise
   to large increases in the eccentricity, and therefore to orbits that are
   very unstable.
   Furthermore, we integrate numerically the motion of the first five
   Kuiper belt objects, the orbits of which have been recently temporarily
   determined, and we analyze their orbital evolution with respect to
   resonances. The three objects 1993SB, 1993SC, and 1993RO are in the 2/3
   resonance, and, of these, the first two have a very regular evolution.
   Conversely, 1993RO is chaotic, and is expelled from the 2/3 resonance,
   encountering Neptune after 320 Myr. The object 1992QB1 is very regular
   and outside all resonances. Finally, 1993FW is chaotic, due to the 4/7
   resonance and to a secondary secular resonance. The eccentricity,
   however, is limited below 0.2, so that the body does not encounter
   Neptune. We stress that, since the orbital elements of these five
   objects are very uncertain, our results should be considered only as
   indications of possible dynamical evolutions in the Kuiper belt. (C)

Abstract = {{Most system dynamicists have used the example of a simple shower to
   explain feedback and to introduce the cyclical dynamic behaviour
   characteristic of a balancing loop. The damped system's temperature is
   relatively easy to manage. But with two showers sharing the same limited
   supply of hot water it is much harder to control the water temperature,
   because a person `'managing'' one shower is unaware of the other, yet
   must react to the aggregate temperature outcome resulting from `'joint
   management'' effort. A system dynamics model of a two shower system is
   presented and is simulated to illustrate the causes and consequences of
   interdependence in resource allocation, and to explore changes that can
   improve the coordination of decision-makers. Insights from the two
   shower model are then applied to understanding coordination in
   multinational subsidiaries with overlapping geographical markets. The
   article ends with some reflections on the value and limits of a
   metaphorical model.}},

Abstract = {{Catalase is a marker for peroxisomes, which are ubiquitous cytoplasmic
   organelles. Although the distribution and features of peroxisomes are
   well known in liver and kidney, these organelles have been rarely
   studied in neural tissues. Catalase is an important scavenging enzyme
   against reactive oxygen species, as it removes H2O2 produced during
   metabolic processes. Reactive oxygen species are involved in a number of
   brain lesions and in brain aging, We investigated the distribution of
   catalase in rat central nervous system by means of a newly developed
   immunocytochemical procedure for signal enhancement, using an
   affinity-purified polyclonal antiserum. The data show that catalase
   immunoreactivity is present in all neural cells, both neuronal and
   glial, albeit at different concentrations. Among glial cells, ependymal
   cells and tanycytes of the third ventricle and the median eminence show
   the most intense immunoreaction; positivity is also found in
   oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. In general, neurons in the brainstem
   are relatively more immunoreactive than those in the forebrain although,
   within these respective brain regions, there ate areas with low and high
   staining intensity. Moreover, within the same area, certain types of
   neuron appear more immunoreactive than others. The cell bodies in the
   septal nuclei, pallidum, reticular thalamic nucleus, mesencephalic
   nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, Deiter's nucleus, locus ceruleus,
   cranial and spinal motor nuclei, and the Golgi cells of the cerebellar
   cortex are among the most densely stained neurons. Catalase
   immunoreactivity of the cell bodies, which presumably is proportional to
   catalase content, appears to be only partially correlated with cell size
   or type of neurotransmitter used in the nerve endings; it is likely that
   other unknown parameters regulate the abundance of the enzyme. In many
   cases, highly immunoreactive cells correspond to neurons known to be
   resistant to ischemia-reperfusion injury, whereas weakly stained cells
   correspond to neurons that are more susceptible to ischemic damage. The
   amount of catalase may be critical for a protective effect against
   oxidative stress under pathological conditions, such as
   ischemia-reperfusion injury.}},

Abstract = {{The invention of the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) in the early
   1980s revolutionized the field of microscopy. The STM is the first of a
   growing family of probe microscopes which image surfaces by scanning
   them with a sharp probe, measuring some form of interaction between the
   probe and the surface. The invention of the STM was closely followed by
   the development of the scanning force microscope (SFM). Since their
   inception, scanning probe microscopes have had an obvious appeal to
   biologists and biophysicists. Both techniques are capable, under
   appropriate conditions, of obtaining atomic resolution images of
   suitable surfaces. Images can be obtained under gaseous or liquid
   environments, offering the prospect for studying biological systems
   under `native' or `physiological' conditions. Because of its detection
   mechanism the STM is largely restricted to the study of interfaces or
   individual biopolymers and their interactions. However, the potential
   magnification range achievable with the SFM spans the ranges covered by
   both light and electron microscopes. Examples of the use of scanning
   probe microscopes will be given in areas relevant to food and
   agriculture, and potential applications of the microscopes will be
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose. The purpose of this study was to characterize
   the health status of individuals upon initiation of treatment in
   outpatient physical therapy clinics. Subjects. Six outpatient clinical
   sites participated in the study. Three clinics were hospital based and
   three clinics were privately, owned by, physical therapists. Patients
   who were referred with muscular, skeletal, or peripheral nerve
   involvement and who were not postoperative were included in the study.
   Methods. One hundred nine patients completed the SF-36 health status
   questionnaire, which assessed eight health concepts: physical function,
   role physical tie, limitations in role functioning such as duties in the
   home or at work due to physical problems), bodily pain, vitality, social
   function, role emotional (ie, limitations in role functioning role to
   emotional problems), mental health, and general health. Results.
   Patients referred for treatment to hospital-based or privately owned
   clinics had similar ages and diagnoses. No differences in health status
   were found between patients to be treated at hospital-based clinics and
   those to be treated at privately owned clinics, or between male and
   female patients. Only physical functioning scores were lower In patients
   with lower-quarter (lumbar or lower-extremity disorders versus patients
   with upper-quarter (cervical or upper-extremity) disorders. All health
   concept scores, except general health, were found to differ from
   previously published normative data on the US population. Conclusion and
   Discussion. A subgroup of patients seeking outpatient physical therapy
   had lower health concept scores than did the general population in not
   only the Physical domain of health but also the psychological and social
   domains. These data reinforce the concept that physical impairment
   interacts with the emotional and social aspects of health. In addition,
   the health concept scores of our sample as compared with other patient
   groups who have responded to the SF-36 revealed some similarities and
   some marked differences. The results suggest that these types of data
   will provide practicing clinicians as well as thirty-party payers
   policy-makers with a greater understanding of the severity of the
   patient's condition. Because the SF-36 provides information on health
   not routinely, assessed by, physical therapists, it may be a useful
   screening tool.}},

   and education. The aphasia and apraxia groups were chosen to control for
   lesion size and scores on Kimura's recurring figure test, the Token
   test, and intelligence. The mirror-aiming test was performed and the
   learning effect in terms of decreases in total time, the number of
   errors, and the times for errors were examined. There was no
   statistically significant difference between the learning effect of the

   of errors, and the times for errors; however, there were group
   differences on each trial for number of errors and the times for errors.

Abstract = {{Buildings in tropical regions and elsewhere are built using comfort
   design criteria from the industrialized countries with temperate
   climates. However, conditions are so different in most developing
   countries in terms of race, age distribution, experience of the heat,
   and perhaps expectations, that these criteria may be inappropriate.
   This study defines the conditions of thermal comfort in naturally
   ventilated buildings in the Ivory Coast. Also investigated are the
   limits of tolerance or acceptability of these conditions as a function
   of the climatic area, people's gender, age and occupation.
   A survey of 1384 people (173 office workers and 1211 students) was
   performed A questionnaire was used and simultaneously physical
   measurements were taken. The methods used for gathering and processing
   the data are presented.
   The results show that in Naturally Ventilated buildings there is higher
   tolerance of thermal environmental factors such as temperature and
   humidity.
   Three comparisons were made. Firstly, our results were in agreement with
   work done by other researchers in tropical countries. Secondly, data on
   several subjective rating scales comparisons were made within different
   subgroups such as people's gender, occupation and climatic area.
   Finally, these results were compared with international standards. It
   was found that it is necessary to adapt the international standards to
   tropical climates.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in processing of superconductors has demonstrated that ceramic
   powders with exact composition, super-homogeneity, and extremely fine
   particle size can be prepared by chemical processing to achieve high
   density and uniform microstructure. The chemical processing routes have
   great advantage in preparing powder with high reactivity thus promoting
   solid state reactions required to produce `purer' superconducting phase.
   We have studied extensively the coprecipitation technique for the
   preparation of superconducting ceramic powders. Chemical solution
   methods have been used in order to model several superconducting systems
   and to predict optimum conditions for obtaining exact composition.
   Several improvements on the control of precipitation reaction have been
   implemented in order to obtain powders of few nanometers in size. This
   has been done by carrying out the reaction in the bulk of a solution or
   in microemlusion systems. The corecipitated precursor powder has been
   used for production of 20-30 meter long Ag-clad tapes. These tapes
   require considerably reduced processing times. By controlled heat
   treatment conditions, these tapes have been processed to carry transport
   critical current density, J(c) > 4 x 10(4) A/cm(2) at 77K in zero

   in toluene and THF. Differential scanning calorimetry as well as high
   temperature calorimetry have been performed on the dimerization and

Abstract = {{Many cytokines and soluble cytokine receptors are generated by limited
   proteolysis of membrane-bound precursors. We have examined the ability
   of the recently described metalloprotease inhibitor, TNF-alpha protease
   inhibitor (TAPI), and other protease inhibitors to modulate shedding.
   The membrane-bound forms of the ligands TNF-alpha and CSF-1, the p60
   TNFR and the IL-6R, were expressed in COS-7 cells. As expected, TAPI
   blocked the spontaneous and PMA-induced release of TNF-alpha from
   transfected cells. Interestingly, TAPI also inhibited the release of
   soluble forms of p60 TNFR and IL-6R in COS-7 cells. However, the
   processing of CSF-1, which also requires proteolytic cleavage of a
   membrane protein, was not affected. The ability of TAPI to inhibit
   shedding was unique, since several other classes of protease inhibitors,
   including three other metalloprotease inhibitors, did not inhibit
   shedding of IL-6R. To determine whether TAPI would prevent shedding
   under more physiologic conditions, we demonstrated that TAPI was able to
   prevent unstimulated and PMA-induced release of the soluble forms of
   TNF-alpha, p60 TNFR, and IL-6R from the monocytic cell line, THP-1, and
   from human peripheral blood monocytes. In addition, TAPI was able to
   inhibit LPS-induced shedding of the p60 TNFR and TNF-alpha from
   monocytes. In summary, our results indicate that a metalloprotease or
   group of related metalloproteases is responsible for the
   proteolytic-cleavage of several cell surface proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Based on a previous study with 8 chemicals (Muller et al., 1993) the
   applicability of the in vitro rat hepatocyte micronucleus assay was
   evaluated by testing a further 21 compounds of different chemical
   classes. The obtained results are in good agreement with the known
   genotoxic profiles of about 90\% of the in total tested compounds.
   Several known mutagens and carcinogens, i.e., alkylating agents,
   aromatic amines, nitrosamines, nitro compounds, cross-linking agents,
   and pyrrolizidine alkaloids gave clear positive results in this assay,
   whereas all of the tested non-carcinogens were negative. The hepatocyte
   micronucleus assay was shown to distinguish between
   carcinogenic/non-carcinogenic isomers, such as 2- and
   4-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and 2- and 1-nitropropane (NP). Furthermore,
   the non-genotoxic nature of several hepatocarcinogens, i.e., the
   peroxisome proliferating agents fenofibrate, nafenopin, Wy-14,643,
   diethyl(hexyl)phthalate (DEHP), and the sedative phenobarbital, could be
   confirmed in this assay. The hepatocarcinogen coumarin exerted mitogenic
   but no mutagenic properties in the rat hepatocyte micronucleus assay.
   This compound may act as a liver tumor promoter. Benzo{[}a]pyrene
   (B{[}a]P) and 7,12-dimethylbenzanthacene (DMBA), both belonging to the
   group of known carcinogenic and mutagenic polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons, failed to induce micronucleus formation in rat
   hepatocytes. The high susceptibility of in vitro proliferating
   hepatocytes to mitotic inhibition, exerted by the strong cytotoxic
   actions of these compounds, seems to be responsible for these negative
   results. A strongly reduced mitotic activity can prevent the formation
   of micronuclei, even when clastogenic effects may have occurred. In the
   present stage, the in vitro rat hepatocyte micronucleus assay cannot be
   recommended for screening genotoxicity testing. It should rather be used
   for special purposes, e.g., when liver-specific mutagenic effects are
   expected.}},

Abstract = {{To miniaturize the hybrid-ring, a design method is presented herein for
   the circuit in which there is an electromagnetic coupling between the
   transmission lines in folded transmission lines. A 3-dB branch-line
   hybrid-ring is treated. Analysis is carried out for the two cases of
   homogeneous and inhomogeneous circuit configurations in which each
   section has only one coupled line. It is found that in the circuit with
   a homogeneous configuration, perfect match and complete isolation hold
   at the center frequency as in the conventional type; additionally, the
   bandwidth becomes narrower as the coupling becomes stronger. In the
   inhomogeneous structure where the phase velocities of the even and odd
   modes are different, there is a shift in characteristics. An equal power
   division can still be accomplished if the degree of coupling and the
   phase shift in the coupled lines are appropriately chosen. The overall
   characteristics differ little from the conventional type. To confirm
   these findings, an inhomogeneous circuit is constructed and the results
   are found to agree with the theory.}},

Abstract = {{In the axonemes of Tetrahymena cilia, beta-tubulin was digested more

   Among alpha-tubulin isotypes within the axonemes, alpha 5-tubulin was
   more rapidly digested by chymotrypsin than other alpha-tubulin isotypes.
   The addition of ATP and vanadate (Vi) to the axonemes significantly
   protected the alpha 5-isotype from chymotryptic proteolysis. These
   tendencies could not be observed in tubulins solubilized from axonemes.
   Based on the case of the alpha 5-tubulin isotype, it is possible to
   negate the idea that all tubulin isotypes are distributed homogeneously

Abstract = {{Voltage-activated sodium channels and GABA(A) receptor-chloride channel
   complex are among the most important target sites of various
   environmental neurotoxicants. Pyrethroids keep the sodium channels open
   for prolonged periods of time leading to hyperexcitation of the entire
   nervous system. In rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons and dorsal root
   ganglion neurons, only about 1\% of sodium channel population needed to
   be modified by the pyrethroid tetramethrin to increase the depolarizing
   after-potential to the level of the threshold membrane potential for
   generation of repetitive after-discharges. This concept of toxicity
   amplification is applicable to other chemicals that go through a
   threshold phenomenon to exert their effects. The potency of pyrethroids
   on neuronal sodium channels increased with lowering the temperature with
   a Q(10) value of 0.2. The selective pyrethroid toxicity between mammals
   and insects can be quantitatively explained on the basis of the
   differences in 5 factors, i.e. the intrinsic sodium channel sensitivity,
   the sodium channel modification due to temperature difference, the
   reversibility of sodium channel, the detoxication of pyrethroids, and
   body size. These 5 factors are multiplied to approximately 2000 which is
   in the same order of magnitude as that of the difference in LD(50).
   Dieldrin had a dual action on the GABA(A) receptor-chloride channel
   complex of rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. The initial transient
   potentiation of GABA-induced currents after application of dieldrin was
   followed by a suppression. Dieldrin-induced potentiation of current was
   observed only when the gamma(2) subunit was present in embryonic kidney
   cells (HEK-293) transfected with GABA receptor subunits.
   Dieldrin-induced suppression was observed in the presence and absence of
   the gamma(2) subunit. The dieldrin suppression of GABA-induced currents
   is deemed directly responsible for hyperactive symptoms of poisoning in
   animals.}},

Abstract = {{Our previous observations on the toxic effects of hydroxyurea (HU) in
   adrenalectomized (ADX) rats prompted us to suggest that these effects
   might be mediated by an increased synthesis of proinflammatory
   cytokines. This study was conducted to determine whether HU stimulates
   cytokine gene expression in vivo. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   technique was used to assess levels of mRNA for interleukin-1 alpha
   (IL-1 alpha), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) in
   spleen cells from intact and ADX rats treated with HU or vehicle. In ADX
   rats, expression of proinflammatory-cytokine mRNA was markedly increased
   by HU, but no expression of these genes was seen in intact animals after
   treatment. In the latter rats, cytokine-gene expression seemed to be
   down-regulated by HU-induced elevations in plasma corticosterone levels,
   since IL-1 alpha and TNF transcripts could be detected only after
   corticosterone levels had returned to normal (24 h after treatment).
   Interestingly, IL-4 mRNA could not be detected in either treated or
   untreated ADX rats, indicating that expression of this gene is closely
   related to circulating levels of corticosterone. These findings strongly
   suggest that the increased toxicity displayed by HU in ADX animals is
   mediated by stimulation of cytokine synthesis in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Potted Lilium Asiatic hybrids `Aristocrat', `Horizon', and `Polka' were
   evaluated following 3, 6, or 9 days of transport at 2, 7, or 13C.
   `Aristocrat' and `Horizon' withstood transport with little or no effect
   on floral bud opening. `Polka' was the most sensitive cultivar to
   transport, where bud opening decreased 33\% when transported at 13C for
   9 days. Most floral buds opened on `Aristocrat' (90\% to 98\%), while
   fewer buds opened on `Horizon' (37\% to 56\%) and `Polka' (52\% to
   90\%). Individual flower longevity and diameters were largely unaffected
   by transport. Plant longevity was reduced 4 to 7 days when transported
   for 9 days at greater than or equal to 7C or for >3 days at 13C. Plant
   longevity averaged 16 days for `Aristocrat' and `Polka' and 12 days for
   `Horizon'. `Aristocrat' and the Oriental potted hybrid lily `Star Gazer'
   were maintained at postproduction conditions of 18, 21, or 24C at 7 or
   14 mu mol . m(-2). s(-1) after being commercially transported for 4 days
   at 5 +/-2C. Postproduction conditions had no effect on floral bud
   opening of `Aristocrat' (98\% to 99\%), while bud opening of `Star
   Gazer' was reduced 17\% at 24C compared to 18C. Plants lasted 4 and 9
   days longer at 18C than at 21 or 24C, respectively. Foliar discoloration
   was greatest at 24C. Irradiance level had no effect on the variables
   evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{The electrosensory system of elasmobranchs is extremely sensitive to
   weak electric fields, with behavioral thresholds having been reported at
   voltage gradients as low as 5 nV/cm. To achieve this amazing
   sensitivity, the electrosensory system must extract weak extrinsic
   signals from a relatively large reafferent background signal associated
   with the animal's own movements. Ventilatory movements, in particular,
   strongly modulate the firing rates of primary electrosensory afferent
   nerve fibers, but this modulation is greatly suppressed in the medullary
   electrosensory processing nucleus, the dorsal octavolateral nucleus.
   Experimental evidence suggests that the neural basis of reafference
   suppression involves a common-mode rejection mechanism supplemented by
   an adaptive filter that fine tunes the cancellation. We present a neural
   model and computer simulation results that support the hypothesis that
   the adaptive component may involve an anti-Hebbian form of synaptic
   plasticity at molecular layer synapses onto ascending efferent neurons,
   the principal output neurons of the nucleus. Parallel fibers in the
   molecular layer carry a wealth of proprioceptive, efference copy, and
   sensory signals related to the animal's own movements. The proposed
   adaptive mechanism acts by canceling out components of the
   electrosensory input signal that are consistently correlated with these
   internal reference signals.}},

Abstract = {{A hedonic price function for wine is estimated using Swedish data,
   1989-91. Implicit prices for quality attributes are determined not from
   a regression of variety price on a vector of quality attributes, but
   rather from a regression of quantity sold (adjusted for weeks of
   availability) on price and quality attributes. Such a `reduced form' is
   justified by the assumption that prices and attribute contents can be
   taken as exogenous to the Swedish consumer. Price elasticity is
   estimated to be about -1.65 holding quality constant, showing that
   Swedish consumers are highly sensitive to price. Estimates of the
   implicit valuations of quality attributes are shown to differ greatly
   from those obtained from the more usual hedonic regression with price as
   the dependent variable.}},

   ionosphere. For the acceleration region above the ionosphere the
   magnetic field is determined by the solution of a Grad-Shafranov
   equation, whereas the flow field and the electric field are determined
   by a set of integrals along the magnetic field lines. At ionospheric
   heights the dissipative interaction of the plasma with the neutral gas
   is included. We show that the problem may again be reduced, in this case
   to a coupled system of two nonlinear differential equations plus the
   continuity equation. Within this theory, simple examples of solutions
   are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the model.}},

Abstract = {{Familial HDL deficiencies are associated with variable susceptibility to
   premature coronary heart disease, but the mechanism underlying this
   association remains poorly understood. Three homozygotes with isolated
   complete ape A-I deficiency caused by an autosomal codominant apo A-I
   Q{[}-2]X mutation and one heterozygote developed coronary heart disease
   before age 40 years. We characterized the effects of this mutation on
   lipoprotein metabolism. LDL FC, phospholipid, and apo B were all
   significantly higher in homozygotes than in heterozygotes. The HDLs of
   the heterozygotes were apo A-I poor relative to ape A-II.
   Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity was 59\% lower in
   homozygotes than in normal subjects or heterozygotes. Cholesteryl ester
   transfer activity was increased in a homozygote compared with a
   normolipidemic control subject. Postprandial lipid metabolism was
   studied in one homozygote and one heterozygote. Post-prandial TG
   response in the homozygote was significantly exaggerated, while residual
   plasma HDL level remained unaffected. The homozygote also had delayed
   clearance of retinyl ester, a marker of chylomicron remnant metabolism.
   Thus, homozygosity and heterozygosity for apo A-I Q{[}-2]X are
   associated with qualitative, as well as quantitative, disturbances in
   plasma HDLs, LDLs, lipid-modifying enzyme activities, and postprandial
   retinyl ester metabolism. The observed elevation of atherogenic
   lipoproteins and reduction in antiatherogenic lipoproteins in the
   affected members of the apo A-I Q{[}-2]X kindred are consistent with the
   primary deficiency in ape A-I having pleiotropic effects that markedly
   enhance susceptibility for coronary heart disease.}},

   Endotoxin was detectable in 34 of 38 patients with culture positive

Abstract = {{In the present work, we have numerically investigated the effects of the
   rotation on the hydrodynamic and thermal fields inside a germanium float
   zone under microgravity conditions. The melting liquid is assumed
   viscous and incompressible, with constant physical properties; both the
   flow and the thermal field are considered axisymmetric. The system of
   governing equations subjected to appropriate boundary conditions has
   been successfully solved by using the modified SIMPLE method. Numerical
   results have shown that the flow structure may become rather complex
   with the presence of the imposed rotation. An exhaustive study on the
   effects of rotation has been carried out for several rotational
   configurations: one end rotating and the other end fired co rotation of
   both ends, and counterrotation. In general, it has been found that
   rotation produces beneficial effects in the reduction of the Marangoni
   convection flow. The co-rotation from both ends has been found to be the
   most efficient means to obtain this objective. On the other hand, exact
   counterrotation, although it can be used to reduce the intensity of the
   thermocapillary flow, is not recommended because it may conduct to a
   nonsymmetric (i.e., unstable) flow structure within the zone.}},

Abstract = {{Problems with long-term monitoring of various extreme meteorological
   events (including tropical and extratropical cyclones, extreme winds,
   temperatures and precipitation, and mesoscale events) are examined. For
   many types of extreme events, the maintenance of long-term homogeneity
   of observations is more difficult than is the case for means of
   variables. In some cases, however, a strategy of using more than a
   single variable to define an event, along with the careful elimination
   of biases in the data, can provide quantitative information about
   trends. Special care needs to be taken with extreme events deduced from
   meteorological analyses, because changes in analysis and observation
   systems are certain to have affected extremes. Also, compositing of
   observations from more than one station, using differences in means (of
   temperature for instance) to produce a single long-term site, may not
   remove the biases in the extremes. These problems, along with
   ambiguities in defining extreme events, and difficulties in combining
   different analyses from different sites, complicate (and perhaps
   invalidate) attempts to determine whether extreme weather is becoming
   more frequent. The best that is likely to be achieved, even with
   increased emphasis on attaining the high-level of homogeneity necessary
   in the observations, is to monitor long-term variations in certain
   important extreme events, in select locations with high-quality data.
   Regional indices of important extreme events, selected on the basis of
   their damage potential and capable of adequate monitoring, may be
   established. If, in the future, we are to answer the question `'Are
   extreme weather events becoming more frequent?'', we must establish and
   protect high-quality stations capable of monitoring the most important
   extreme events (perhaps with such regional indices), and ensure that
   changes affecting the recording of extreme events (e.g., changes in
   exposure) are meticulously documented.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to examine the hematopoietic cell
   proliferation and differentiation potential of growth factors produced
   by chicken macrophages. Bone marrow (BM) cells (25 x 10(3)) from newly
   hatched (BB15)-B-15 K-strain Leghorn chicks were seeded in .5 mt
   serum-free semi-solid culture supplemented with 10\% (vol/vol) of a
   conditioned medium (CM) from a chicken macrophage cell line, MQ-NCSU.
   The conditioned medium was obtained by culturing MQ-NCSU cells either in
   LM-HAHN (CMI) or RPMI-1640 (CMII) growth medium. The control cultures
   contained only LM-HAHN or RPMI medium. Bone marrow cells in the presence
   of CMI differentiated predominately into granulocyte colonies
   (Experiment 1 = 84 +/- 9.2; Experiment 2 = 105 +/- 5). No colonies were
   observed in,the control cultures. Stimulation of MQ-NCSU cells with
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produced a CM that differentiated BM cells
   predominantly into macrophage colonies (122 +/- 16.3 in CMI and 92 +/-
   5.6 in CMII). These data suggest that MQ-NCSU cells spontaneously
   secrete a factor with the potential to promote granulocyte
   differentiation. However, upon stimulation with LPS, the factor secreted
   had macrophage colony stimulation potential (M-CSF), which was similar
   in activity when compared with the activity of recombinant chicken
   myelomonocytic growth factor (r-cMGF). Another CM from chicken
   fibroblasts (FCM) was tested on BM cells from K-strain Leghorns and
   Arbor Acres x Arbor Acres broiler chicks. Data from three experiments
   showed that 25 x 10(3) BM cells from K-strain chicken yielded more
   macrophage and granulocytes colonies (82 +/- 14) than those from
   broilers (56 +/- 12). This study suggests that avian cytokines exhibit
   progenitor cell differentiation potential and that this activity is
   dependent upon the source of cytokines and their targets.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of amino acid sensors sensitive to arginine, alanine,
   leucine and glycine in the hepato-portal region was previously reported
   based on recording of the afferent signals from the hepatic branch of
   the vagus nerve. The present study was carried oat to investigate the
   effects of fifteen different amino acids on the activity of the vagal
   hepatic afferents. Intraportal administration (10 mM, 0.1 mL) of
   alanine, arginine, histidine, leucine, lysine, serine, tryptophane and
   valine increased vagal afferent discharge rate, and that of cysteine,
   glycine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline and threonine
   suppressed it.
   The results indicate the existence of two groups of amino acids sensors
   which exhibit excitatory or inhibitory effect on the afferent activity
   of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve. The change in afferent
   activity to the hypothalamus may affect reflex regulation of the

Abstract = {{Coeliac disease is precipitated in susceptible subjects by ingestion of
   wheat gluten or gluten related prolamins from some other cereals. The
   disease is strongly associated with certain HLA-DQ heterodimers, for
   example, DQ2 (DQ alpha 1 star 0501, beta 1 star 0201) in most patients
   and apparently DQ8 (DQ alpha 1 star 0301, beta 1 star 0302) in a small
   subset. Gluten specific T cell clones (TCC) from coeliac intestinal
   lesions were recently established and found to be mainly restricted by
   HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8. Antigen induced production of cytokines was studied
   in 15 TCC from three patients, 10 being DQ2 and five DQ8 restricted.
   Cell culture supernatants were prepared by stimulation with gluten
   peptides in the presence of DQ2(+) or DQ8(+) Epstein-Barr virus
   transformed B cells as antigen presenting cells (APC). Supernatants were
   analysed for cytokines by bioassays, ELISA, and CELISA. Cellular
   cytokine mRNA was analysed semi-quantitatively by slot blotting and
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All TCC were found to secrete
   interferon (IFN) gamma, often at high concentrations (>2000 U/ml); some
   secreted in addition interleukin (IL) 4, IL 5, IL 6, IL 10, tumour
   necrosis factor (TNF), and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta. The
   last TCC thus displayed a Th0-like cytokine pattern. However, other TCC
   produced IFN gamma and TNF but no IL 4, or IL 5, compatible with a
   Th1-like pattern. In conclusion, most DQ8 restricted TCC seemed to fit
   with a Th0 profile whereas the DQ2 restricted TCC secreted cytokines
   more compatible with a Th1 pattern. The TCC supernatants induced
   upregulation of HLA-DR and secretory component (poly-Ig receptor) in the
   colonic adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29.E10, most probably reflecting
   mainly the high IFN gamma concentrations. This cytokine, particularly in
   combination with TNF alpha, might be involved in several pathological
   features of the coeliac lesion. The characterised cytokine profiles thus
   support the notion that mucosal T cells activated in situ by gluten in a
   DQ restricted fashion play a central part in the pathogenesis of coeliac
   disease.}},

   indirect histamine immunocytochemistry. Northern blot analysis revealed
   the appearance of a major (2.6 KB) HDC mRNA species in liver on
   embryonic Day 14. Its hybridization level peaked on Day E18, when two

   2.6 KB mRNA species was expressed at a low level on postnatal Day P1.
   The embryonic liver expressed HDC on days E14-E20. On days E18 and E20,
   the periosteum and the epiphyseal growth plates of the endochondrally
   ossificating bones, and some striated muscle cells, showed hybridization

   epithelial and neuronal cell types during embryogenesis. An intense
   histamine immunoreaction appeared first in essentially all cells of the
   liver parenchyma on day E12, This parenchymal histamine immunoreactivity
   disappeared by birth, after which this immunofluorescence in liver was
   restricted to a few scattered mast cells until adulthood. Some neurons
   in the peripheral sensory, sympathetic and cranial nerve ganglia were
   histamine-immunoreactive from day E16 to birth. In addition, many
   immunoreactive nerve fibers were detected in the gastrointestinal
   muscularis externa, mesentery, salivary glands, kidney, lung, and muscle
   tissue. We conclude that during rat embryogenesis histamine is produced
   and stored transiently by cells in liver, developing bone, and a few
   striated muscle cells, in addition to previously reported neurons in rat
   brain. Many peripheral neurons; epithelial cells, and mast ails display
   histamine immunoreactivity during rat embryogenesis but are devoid of
   detectable HDC mRNA with the current method. It remains possible that
   histamine is formed by another enzyme or is taken up from the
   extracellular space. The results support the concept that a significant
   proportion of histamine is formed and stored by embryonic cells other
   than mast cells.}},

Abstract = {{Following a baseline night recording, 9 narcoleptic subjects and 9 sex-
   and age-matched control subjects were maintained on 16 h of diurnal
   sleep deprivation. Thereafter subjects were submitted to a 32 h bed rest
   protocol in a sound- and light-attenuated room. The EEG was recorded and
   processed by a Fast Fourier Transform. Narcoleptics did not differ from
   controls in total sleep time over the whole 32 h, but spent more time
   sleeping during the daytime (DT). In both groups slow wave activity
   (SWA) showed an exponential decaying trend during the first night (N1);
   a similar exponential trend during the second night (N2) was evident
   only in controls. In controls SWA showed a circadian-circasemidian
   distribution that was hardly detectable in narcoleptics, Narcoleptics
   showed an ultradian distribution of SWA with periodic emergence every 4
   h during DT and N2. Our data confirm that a homeostatic mechanism is
   evident in narcoleptics when stimulated by diurnal sleep deprivation,
   while circadian and circasemidian mechanisms are less evident during DT
   and N2. These findings suggest a different coupling between homeostatic
   sleep regulating processes and circadian drives to sleep in
   narcoleptics. Ultradian drives to sleep seem to be predominant in these
   patients, thus probably acting as a means for the avoidance of stressful
   attempts to counteract a weaker waking state maintenance mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists, clonidine, tizanidine and
   UK-14304 on a, adrenoceptor-mediated contractile responses were studied
   in isolated tail arteries and thoracic aorta of the rat. When applied
   during sustained contractile responses to almost maximum concentration
   (10 mu M) of phenylephrine, clonidine (0.3 mu M to 100 mu M) produced
   concentration-dependent relaxations in both tissues. The maximum
   relaxation was smaller in tail arteries than in thoracic aortal
   Clonidine up to 100 mu M failed to relax both tissues precontracted with
   KCl (60 mM) or U-46619 (1 mu M), a thromboxane mimetic. The
   clonidine-induced relaxation in tail arteries, was reversed by
   alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists, yohimbine and idazoxane. Effects of
   the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists were concentration-dependent (0.1
   mu M to 1 mu M), but not in a competitive manner. On the other hand, the
   relaxation in thoracic aorta was not significantly antagonized by these
   alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists. Tizanidine and UK-14304 also relaxed
   both tail arteries and thoracic aorta precontracted with phenylephrine.
   The characteristics of the relaxation and their antagonism by yohimbine
   in both arteries were similar to those induced by clonidine. In tail
   arteries, N-G-nitro-L-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, at a
   concentration that completely inhibited acetylcholine-induced
   relaxations did not significantly affect the relaxation induced by
   clonidine. In contrast, the relaxation of thoracic aorta in response to
   clonidine was partly reduced in the presence of N-G-nitro-L-arginine.
   These results indicate that the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists
   selectively inhibit the contractions induced by phenylephrine in both
   tissues. Regional differences in the modes of the inhibition by the
   alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists exist.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine the long-term functional and structural outcomes
   in patients treated with trabeculectomy for primary open-angle glaucoma.
   Methods: Records of 78 consecutive patients (78 eyes) who had their
   first trabeculectomy were studied retrospectively (duration of
   follow-up, 25 to 112 months), Serial automated perimetry and
   stereoscopic optic disc photographs were used to assess the long-term
   efficacy of trabeculectomy to prevent progressive glaucomatous damage.
   Stereoscopic optic disc photographs were available for 29 eyes (38\%).
   Criteria for intraocular pressure control were a minimum intraocular
   pressure reduction of 20\% and intraocular pressure at or below 20 mmHg.
   Results: There was no evidence of progression of glaucomatous damage in
   81\% and 65\% of the eyes after 3 and 6 years, respectively, The visual
   field deteriorated in 16 eyes (21\%) and progressive structural optic
   nerve damage occurred in 4 eyes (5\%) during follow-up. Deterioration of
   the optic nerve head in the absence of visual field progression was
   detected in three (4\%) of those eyes. In 19 eyes (25\%), further
   glaucoma surgery was performed. The probability of successful
   intraocular pressure control after a single operation was 48\% and 40\%
   at 3 and 5 years, respectively.
   Conclusion: Progressive glaucomatous damage occurs in about one third of
   eyes with moderate to severe primary open-angle glaucoma over a 6-year
   follow-up after trabeculectomy.}},

Abstract = {{The functional relationship between three Dictyostelium myosin Is, myoA,
   myoB, and myoC, has been examined through the creation of double
   mutants. Two double mutants, myoA(-)/B- and myoB(-)/C-, exhibit similar
   conditional defects in fluid-phase pinocytosis. Double mutants grown in
   suspension culture are significantly impaired in their ability to take
   in nutrients from the medium, whereas they are almost indistinguishable
   from wild-type and single mutant strains when grown on a surface. The
   double mutants are also found to internalize gp126, a 116-kD membrane
   protein, at a slower rate than either the wild-type or single mutant
   cells. Ultrastructural analysis reveals that both double mutants possess
   numerous small vesicles, in contrast to the wild-type or myosin I single
   mutants that exhibit several large, clear vacuoles. The alterations in
   fluid and membrane internalization in the suspension-grown double
   mutants, coupled with the altered vesicular profile, suggest that these
   cells may be compromised during the early stages of pinocytosis, a
   process that has been proposed to occur via actin-based cytoskeletal
   rearrangements. Scanning electron microscopy and rhodamine-phalloidin
   staining indicates that the myosin I double mutants appear to extend a
   larger number of actin-filled structures, such as filopodia and crowns,
   than wild-type cells. Rhodamine-phalloidin staining of the F-actin
   cytoskeleton of these suspension-grown cells also reveals that the
   double mutant cells are delayed in the rearrangement of cortical
   actin-rich structures upon adhesion to a substrate. We propose that
   myoA, myoB, and myoC play roles in controlling F-actin filled membrane
   projections that are required for pinosome internalization in
   suspension.}},

Abstract = {{Exploiting the differential expression of genes for Calvin cycle enzymes

   5.1.3.1), with the help of which several full-size cDNAs were isolated
   from spinach. Functional identity of the encoded mature subunit was
   shown by R5P3E activity found in affinity-purified glutatione
   S-transferase fusions expressed in Escherichia coli and by three-fold
   increase of R5P3E activity upon induction of E. coli overexpressing the
   spinach subunit under the control of the bacteriophage T-7 promoter,
   demonstrating that we have cloned the first functional
   ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase from any eukaryotic source. The
   chloroplast enzyme from spinach shares about 50\% amino acid identity
   with its homologues from the Calvin cycle operons of the autotrophic
   purple bacteria Alcaligenes eutrophus and Rhodospirillum rubrum. A
   R5P3E-related eubacterial gene family was identified which arose through
   ancient duplications in prokaryotic chromosomes, three R5P3E-related
   genes of yet unknown function have persisted to the present within the
   E. coli genome. A gene phylogeny reveals that spinach R5P3E is more
   similar to eubacterial homologues than to the yeast sequence, suggesting

   N-methylhydantoin amidohydrolase and N-carbamoylsarcosine
   amidohydrolase, as key enzymes, coupled,vith a colorimetric procedure
   for hydrogen peroxide detection, the creatinine level can be measured.
   The results obtained for human serum and urine show good correlation
   with those obtained by a standard chemical method based on the Jaffe
   reaction. The new method is simple and specific, and shows excellent

Abstract = {{Bathyal benthic foraminifera and stable isotopes from the Caravaca and
   Zumaya sections of Spain, indicate that the mass extinction near the
   Paleocene/Eocene (P/E) boundary (upper planktic foraminiferal Zone P6a)
   was rapid, coinciding with a negative delta(13)C-shift of 2-4 parts per
   thousand, the onset of dark grey shale deposition and increased
   carbonate dissolution. Prior to the extinction event, diverse benthic
   foraminiferal assemblages and high delta(13)C values suggest the
   presence of a stable intermediate-deep watermass rich in oxygen and
   saturated in calcium carbonate in both Caravaca and Zumaya sections.
   After the extinction event, small finely agglutinated (Haplophragmoides,
   Glomospira) and thin-walled epifaunal taxa (Nuttallides truempyi)
   dominate in the North Atlantic, Zumaya section. This assemblage
   indicates sluggish circulation, bottom waters undersaturated in calcium
   carbonate and dysaerobic conditions. Low oxygen conditions prevailed for
   the succeeding 400 kyr and are characterized by 1-2 parts per thousand
   fluctuations in benthic delta(13)C. In the western Tethys, Caravaca
   section, infaunal taxa (''buliminids'') dominate after the extinction
   event and prevailed through the succeeding 400 to 450 kyr of decreased
   delta(13)C values, indicating low oxygen conditions.
   Despite these common features, benthic foraminiferal assemblages from
   these two sections exhibit significant differences during the extinction
   event. At the Zumaya section, the extinction event occurred over less
   than 50 kyr and resulted in a sudden reduction in species richness after
   the delta(13)C-shift. In contrast, at the Caravaca section species
   diversity declined gradually, beginning prior to and in concert with the
   gradually declining delta(13)C values. This gradual change occurred over
   a period of 250 kyr and culminated in a 4 parts per thousand
   delta(13)C-shift. These differences in delta(13)C values and benthic
   assemblages between Caravaca and Zumaya, suggest that the P-E
   oceanographic changes that triggered the benthic foraminiferal mass
   extinction, exhibited its first manifestation in the Tethys region.}},

Abstract = {{The practical success of the wind chill index has often been vaguely
   attributed to the effect of wind on heat transfer from bare skin,
   usually the face. To test this theory, facial heat loss and the wind
   chill index were compared. The effect of wind speed on heat transfer
   from a thermal model of a head was investigated in a wind tunnel. When
   the thermal model was facing the wind, wind speed affected the heat
   transfer from its face in much the same manner as it would affect the
   heal transfer from a small cylinder, such as that used in the original
   wind chill experiments carried out in Antarctica fifty years ago. A
   mathematical model of heat transfer from the face was developed and
   compared to other models of wind chill. Skin temperatures calculated
   from the model were consistent with observations of frostbite and
   discomfort at a range of wind speeds and temperatures. The wind chill
   index was shown to be several times larger than the calculated heat
   transfer, but roughly proportional to it. Wind chill equivalent
   temperature were recalculated on the basis of facial cooling. An
   equivalent temperature increment was derived to account for the effect
   of bright sunshine.}},

   in control medium to which 0, 10 or 300 ng/ml retinoic acid (RAc), which
   depletes the cartilage matrix of proteoglycans, had been added, Two were
   then cultured for another week in control medium. During the last week,
   one of the two was subjected to a cyclic load (1 MPa, 0.2 Hz). Following
   treatment with RAc, glycosaminoglycan content and synthesis were
   significantly decreased, as confirmed by safranin 0 staining and
   autoradiography. They were further diminished by loading during the
   second week of culture. Increased amounts of 3-B-3(-) epitope were found
   in cartilage that had been treated with 300 ng/ml RAc and then loaded.
   While loading cartilage matrix that was only slightly degraded proved to
   be damaging, loading severely degraded cartilage matrix apparently

   a past reproduction of the target-person. A higher expected investment
   should lower the person's value on the partner market. To test these
   assumptions, scenarios were generated in which an imagined partner
   already has a child (vs. not) and whether if this child is living
   together with the imagined partner (vs. not). The dependent variable was
   the judged attractivity under different conditions of this person as a
   mating partner (of having a family with this imagined partner). The
   results of N=203 students support the assumptions in general with partly
   different effects for men and women. tow-cost-conditions (e.g. child is

Abstract = {{When Ophiostoma ulmi or Ophiostoma novo-ulmi are,grown on either 0.22-
   or 0.45-mu m millipore filter membranes placed on impoverished agar
   medium, the fungus grows through these membranes and takes on various
   irregular pleomorphic growth forms (P-forms). Links of continuity
   between these forms and the more regular ones have been shown using
   light, confocal, and transmission electron microscopy. Tests with
   labelled probes, such as gold-complexed wheat germ agglutinin for chitin
   and beta-exoglucanase for cellulosic beta-1,4-glucans, have indicated
   that in P-forms deposition of chitin is much altered but is less so in
   the case of cellulosic glucan. The cytology of these forms compared with
   the regular fungal ones is also very different, particularly with
   reference to mitochondria and nuclei. Also, numerous vesiculate
   structures were noted in the rarely septate P-forms. Similar irregular
   forms with opaque contents were produced by these fungi when they were
   grown on sterilized elm wood sections. When these latter samples were
   fixed by high-pressure freezing, the following main features were noted:
   fungal cells with a very thin wall, slightly labelled for chitin but
   more intensely for cellulosic glucans; well-preserved structures, such
   as plasmalemma and endoplasmic reticulum; and a slightly opaque,
   fibril-containing extracellular sheath. Differences in labelling for
   galactose, whether of wall layers or cell contents, were also observed
   in regular and P-forms. Electron opaque bodies that labelled strongly
   for galactose were also numerous in P-forms in some samples.}},

Abstract = {{Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-associated antigen
   presentation is mainly linked to processing of exogenous antigens upon
   cellular uptake by endocytosis, but has also been observed for
   endogenously sythesized antigens. We have studied the MHC class
   II-associated presentation of the endogenously synthesized membrane
   associated glycoprotein (GP) and the cytosolic nucleoprotein (NP) of
   lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in professional antigen
   presenting cells (APC) of mice. Since LCMV is a noncytopathic virus and
   minimally affects cellular protein synthesis, it is a convenient virus
   for the study of antigen presentation. In contrast, most other studies
   assessing class II-associated presentation of endogeneously synthesized
   viral antigens used cytolytic viruses such as vaccinia, measles and
   influenza virus, which drastically interfere with host cell functions.
   In addition, most studies were performed using non-professional APC. We
   found that class II-associated presentation of endogenously synthesized
   membrane associated LCMV-GP was efficient and could not be inhibited by
   chloroquine or leupeptin. Neither the transporter associated with
   professing (TAP) system nor the invariant chain (Ii) were significantly
   involved in this process. In contrast, MHC class II-associated
   presentation of endogenously synthesized cytosolic LCMV-NP was not
   observed even in Ii-deficient APC. Thus, MHC class II loading of
   endogenously synthesized LCMV-GP apparently does not require processing
   in acidic endosomal compartments as defined by chloroquine and leupeptin
   insensitivity Furthermore, although the TAP molecules transport peptides
   of up to 15 amino acids in length, which potentially could bind to MHC
   class II molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum, such a process
   apparently does not occur for either the glycoprotein or the
   nucleoprotein. Therefore, the subcellular localization of an
   endogenously synthesized protein influences crucially whether or not MHC
   class II loading can occur independently of the acidic compartments
   usually involved in MHC class II loading.}},

Abstract = {{Herpes tester (HZ) is a localized disease that results from reactivation
   of an endogenous varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection that has
   persisted in latent form within sensory ganglia following an earlier
   attack of varicella. The incidence and the severity of HZ and its
   complications increase with advancing age, and this is temporally
   associated with an age-related decline in cell-mediated immunity (CMI)
   to VZV. Information on the cellular site and mechanism of VZV latency
   and on the events that follow reactivation appears to explain many of
   the clinical features of HZ and to provide a pathophysiologic basis for
   the presumption that immunity to VZV plays a critical role in limiting
   the frequency and consequences of VZV reactivation. The close temporal
   correlation between the decline in VZV-specific CMI and the increased
   frequency and severity of HZ and its complications in older individuals
   suggests that HZ may actually develop because VZV-specific CMI falls
   below some critical threshold. The development of a live attenuated
   varicella vaccine provides a means of stimulating VZV-specific CMI and
   thus of determining its role in the pathogenesis of HZ. Levin and his
   colleagues have demonstrated that waning VZV-specific CMI in elderly
   persons can be stimulated by varicella vaccine to levels typical of
   those observed in younger persons, in whom the incidence and severity of
   HZ are much reduced. Thus the stage is set for a large
   placebo-controlled clinical trial that will test directly the hypothesis
   that restoration of waning CMI to VZV will reduce the frequency and
   severity of HZ and its complications in the elderly.}},

Abstract = {{Recent deep-towed, high resolution sidescan sonar records and seismic
   profiles have been collected on the lower Valencia Fan (Northwestern
   Mediterranean). Three morphological zones, channelled, transition and
   unchannelled, have been recognized in the Valencia Channel mouth.
   Sonographs from the transition zone show a progresive transversal
   gradation from depositional to erosional bedforms. This asymmetry may be
   due to the lateral inputs of sediment flows from the Rhone deep-sea fan
   and to the effect of the Coriolis force, which could have diverted the
   flows to the southwest. Bedforms recorded in the study area include
   trains of starved ripples and dunes, sand ribbons, and fields of
   elongated scours. Most morphological features, bedforms and seismic
   characteristics of the Valencia Channel mouth are typical of
   channel-lobe transition zones.}},

Abstract = {{The Cobas (R) Integra from Poche Diagnostic Systems is a new clinical
   laboratory analyzer with continuous and random-access features for
   routine chemistries, specific proteins, electrolytes, hormones,
   therapeutic drugs, and drugs of abuse. The system maintains 68
   test-specific reagent cassettes on board, along with multiple
   ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) for electrolyte determinations. This
   gives the Cobas Integra the capability of analyzing as many as 72
   analytes without having to load additional reagents. We describe the
   basic-analyzer configuration and the subsystems for absorbance,
   fluorescence polarization, and ISE measurements. Performance
   characteristics for precision, methods comparison, and on-board
   stability are given for assays representative of the various test
   groups. The 29 Cobas Integra tests evaluated in the present study show
   good agreement (r greater than or equal to 0.98 and slopes generally
   0.90 to 1.12) with the respective methods available on either the
   Olympus AU5000, Hitachi 911 or 717, Behring BNA, or Abbott TDx (R)
   systems. Total assay precision (CV) ranged from 0.8\% to 8.5\%, and
   calibration curves were stable for as long as 20 weeks. Test throughput,
   which is dependent on pipetting sequence, was determined to be up to 600
   tests per hour without ISE and up to 750 tests per hour with ISE; the
   time to first result was 2.0-10.0 min.}},

Abstract = {{Protein sequences are believed to have been selected to provide the
   stability of, and reliable renaturation to, an encoded unique spatial
   fold. In recently proposed theoretical schemes, this selection is
   modeled as `'minimal frustration,'' or `'optimal energy,'' of the
   desirable target conformation over all possible sequences, such that the
   `'design'' of the sequence is governed by the interactions between
   monomers. With replica mean field theory, we examine the possibility to
   reconstruct the renaturation, or freezing transition, of the
   `'designed'' heteropolymer given the inevitable errors in the
   determination of interaction energies, that is, the difference between
   sets (matrices) of interactions governing chain design and
   conformations, respectively We find that the possibility of folding to
   the designed conformation is controlled by the correlations of the
   elements of the design and renaturation interaction matrices; unlike
   random heteropolymers, the ground state of designed heteropolymers is
   sufficiently stable, such that even a substantial error in the
   interaction energy should still yield correct renaturation. (C) 1995

Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{The anticancer agent mitoxantrone is readily oxidized by the human haem
   enzyme myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide. Intercalation of
   mitoxantrone with DNA inhibited oxidation of the drug by
   myeloperoxidase. However, at a physiological ionic strength, significant
   oxidation of the drug was evident. At a H2O2:mitoxantrone ratio of 1.0,
   myeloperoxidase oxidized mitoxantrone to a metabolite (product B) which
   associated reversibly with DNA. At greater hydrogen peroxide
   concentrations, two further metabolites were produced (products C and
   D), neither of which associated reversibly with DNA, as indicated by the
   absence of any spectral change in the presence of DNA. Long exposure of
   the products derived from the oxidation of {[}C-14]mitoxantrone by
   myeloperoxidase resulted in a time-dependent covalent binding of the
   activated drug to both DNA and RNA. The amount of DNA adduct increased
   linearly with the extent of oxidation of mitoxantrone (up to a H2O2:
   mitoxantrone ratio of 5.0). No adducts resulted from exposure of the
   oxidized product B to DNA, but adducts formed following further
   oxidation of B by myeloperoxidase. The myeloperoxidase-catalysed
   oxidation of mitoxantrone to products capable of interacting covalently
   and non-covalently with nucleic acids may represent an important mode of
   action of mitoxantrone against acute myeloid leukaemias since these
   cells (including neutrophils, monocytes and their precursors) contain
   high levels of myeloperoxidase.}},

   m-radiotelescope POM-2 located at Plateau de Bure (Lat. 44:38:02.00 N,
   Long. 5:54:28.50 E, Alt. 2550 m) in the French Alps. These spectra
   clearly show a Zeeman substructure over a +/-2.5 MHz range from the line
   centre. The central frequencies for each peak would indicate local mean
   values of the geomagnetic field over Plateau de Bure for the altitude
   range 2.5-130 km of around 40 mu T that is a slight, but measurable,
   difference with respect to a standard geomagnetic model based on
   measurements carried out in 1980, that gives values around 44 mu T.
   Depending on the direction and polarization we see 2, 4, or 6 peaks that
   are identified as pi (Delta M = 0) or sigma +/- (Delta M = +/- 1)
   components. This effect cannot be seen from ground-based measurements in
   the millimetric lines of the main isotope O-16(2) for which very broad
   emission and high opacity of low layers eliminate any structure, but it
   must be taken into account for atmospheric temperature soundings from
   satellite at frequencies close to these O-16(2) resonances.}},

Abstract = {{Jak3 is a tyrosine kinase mediating cytokine receptor signaling through
   the association with the common gamma chain of the cytokine receptors
   such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. Unlike other members of the
   Jak family, the expression of Jak3 is highly restricted in hematopoietic
   cells. To elucidate in vivo function of Jak3, Jak3-deficient mice were
   generated by homologous recombination. Mice homozygous for Jak3 null
   mutation showed severe defects, specifically in lymphoid cells. B cell
   precursors in bone marrow, thymocytes, and both T and B cells in the
   spleen drastically decreased, although these defects were significantly
   recovered as aging occurred. Peripheral lymph nodes, NK cells, dendritic
   epidermal T cells, and intestinal intraepithelial gamma delta T cells
   were absent. Normal number of hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow
   from Jak3-deficient mice and the similar capability to generate myeloid
   and erythroid colonies as wild-type mice indicated specific defects in
   lymphoid stem cells. Furthermore, the abnormal architecture of lymphoid
   organs suggested the involvement of Jak3 in the function of epithelial
   cells. T cells developed in the mutant mice did not respond to either
   IL-2, IL-4, or IL-7. These findings establish the crucial role of Jak3

Abstract = {{In the ambient thermal zone for the vasomotor regulation of body

   blood temperature are efficiently buffered, at a low energetic cost, by
   the thermal inertia of the mass of body water. Thus, the oscillations in
   hypothalamic temperature are maintained within a width of a few tenths
   of a degree and are so small as to be subliminal as thermal feedback
   stimuli for thermoregulatory responses. This passive hypothalamic
   homeothermy would support the hypothesis that a phylogenetic pressure
   was operative early on in mammals in order to limit the duration of the
   ultradian sleep cycle so as to fit the thermal inertia of the different
   masses of body water in mammals of different sizes.}},

Title = {{Seasonal studies of seston lipids in relation to microplankton species

Abstract = {{The concentration and nutritional quality of suspended particulate
   matter at an experimental scallop aquaculture site on the east coast of
   Newfoundland, Canada, was determined at 3 depths over an 8 mo sampling
   period. Lipid classes and fatty acids were measured chromatographically
   and the seston components were identified and quantified by microscopy.
   These measurements were correlated and then related to the growth of
   juvenile scallops Placopecten magellanicus introduced to the site. The
   low seston concentrations observed throughout the year were punctuated
   by 4 large inputs: the spring diatom bloom, a resuspension event, a
   summer microzooplankton and nanoflagellate bloom, and a fall increase in
   zooplankton faecal pellet and heterotrophic dinoflagellate
   concentrations. The largest inputs of lipids were associated with the
   resuspension event and the summer bloom. The resuspended particles
   included the benthic pennate diatom Gyrosigma spp, which contained large
   lipid globules. High concentrations of polyunsaturated triacylglycerols
   occurred at this time; more saturated triacylglycerols were prominent in
   the summer. The acyl lipids contained unusually high proportions of the
   long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid 20:4 omega 5 which was correlated
   (p < 0.05) with the proportion of microzooplankton in the seston. The
   C-16 fatty acid ratio 16:1 omega 7/16:0, used previously as a diatom
   biomarker, was strongly correlated (p < 0.01) with the proportion of
   centric diatoms. Scallop growth appeared to be related less to the major
   inputs of total lipids to the water column and more to the proportion of
   the essential fatty acid 22:6 omega 3 in the acyl Lipids. This fatty
   acid was associated principally with cryptophytes (p < 0.02).}},

Abstract = {{An ultrasonic, nondestructive contact measurement technique was employed
   to detect and characterize the elastic anisotropy of a free-standing,
   plasma-sprayed alumina coating, Following this initial evaluation, a
   computer-assisted, ultrasonic anisotropic test bed was used to determine
   the anisotropic elastic stiffness constants of coatings produced by
   plasma gun currents of 600 and 400 A, The results showed that the
   plasma-sprayed alumina coatings are transversely isotropic; i.e.,
   isotropic in the spraying direction, These coatings were characterized
   by five independent elastic stiffness constants, Coatings produced at
   600 A plasma gun current showed higher elastic stiffness constants than
   those produced at 400 A plasma gun current. This increase appeared to be
   related to a decrease in the porosity content of the coatings produced
   at the higher plasma gun current.}},

Abstract = {{The acute organ-specific and metabolic actions of Insulin-like Growth
   Factor-I (IGF-I) and Growth Hormone (GH) were investigated in normal
   rats. Rats received a single subcutaneous injection of IGF-I (100 mu g),
   GH (100 mu g) or a combined treatment with IGF-I (100 mu g) plus GH (100
   mu g) following a 2(2) factorial design. The acute treatment with IGF-I
   produced an increase in its plasma concentration along with a reduction
   in insulin levels. Plasma glucose and total cholesterol decreased in all
   treated groups as well as triglycerides in IGF-I treated animals as
   compared to controls. The rates of protein synthesis, measured by amino
   acid incorporation were not affected by any of these treatments in
   muscle or liver. However, GH treatment raised the rate of protein
   synthesis in the jejunum, while IGF-I treatment produced an increase in
   tibia protein synthesis rate. Negative interactions between GH and IGF
   were noted concerning tibia and jejunum protein formation. Thus, GH
   appeared to inhibit the response to IGF;I in bone, while IGF-I inhibited
   the response of the jejunum to GH administration. Also, liver cathepsin
   activity was reduced, while bone alkaline phosphase was increased by the
   GH treatment. Therefore, these results have demonstrated some acute
   organ-specific anabolic effects and interactions of IGF-I and GH on
   different aspects of metabolism in normal rats.}},

   an agent acting as an antagonist on the glycine site of the NMDA
   receptor is effective. Blockade of nitric oxide synthase has similar
   effects on opioid tolerance, preventing morphine and delta tolerance but
   not that of kappa drugs. Even methylene blue, which can inhibit guanylyl
   cylase activity, is effective, presumably by blocking cGMP formation

Abstract = {{This article addresses the role of nuclear taboo or the tradition of
   nonuse of nuclear weapons in limited wars involving a nuclear- and a
   nonnuclear-weapon state and the importance of this prohibitionary norm
   to deterrence theory. It explores nonnuclear states' strategic
   calculations before launching wars against nuclear-armed states. It
   discusses the historical, moral, normative, and rational bases of the
   taboo and explains why nuclear states have refrained from using their
   capability vis-a-vis nonnuclear challengers. Two cases of nonnuclear
   states initiating wars-the 1973 Egyptian offensive against Israel and
   the 1982 Argentine invasion of the British Falkland Islands-and the
   calculations of these states' decision makers on their adversaries'
   nuclear capability are addressed. The article concludes by discussing
   the implications of nuclear taboo for deterrence theory and regional
   conflicts, the conditions under which it could be broken, and the likely
   consequences of its infraction.}},

Abstract = {{Proto-oncogenes, growth factors/receptors, and tumour suppressor genes

   strong reaction for insulin. Benign insulinomas were slightly or
   moderately positive for transforming growth factor a (TGF alpha), weakly
   positive for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), and strongly
   positive for c-myc and insulin. In malignant insulinomas, besides a
   strong immunoreaction for c-myc and TGF alpha, activation of c-K-ras and
   overexpression of p53 protein were found. Insulin reaction was moderate
   or strong. Three out of six malignant insulinomas displayed a c-g-ras
   point mutation at codon 12. All mutations were guanine to cytosine
   transversion, resulting in amino acid substitution, glycine to arginine.
   Mutations were present in metastatic insulinomas only. Patients with

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the developmental toxicity and placental transfer
   of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were given
   0-2.4 mmol DCE kg(-1) day(-1) by gavage, or were exposed for 6 hr per

   Maternal toxicity was observed after inhalation exposure to 300 ppm DCE
   and oral administration of 2.0 or 2.4 mmol DCE kg(-1). There was no
   evidence of altered growth nor teratogenic effects after either
   inhalation or oral administration of DCE at any concentration tested.
   The time course disposition of C-14 was examined over a 48-hr period in
   12- and 18-day pregnant rats after a single oral dose of 1.6 mmol
   {[}C-14]DCE kg(-1). Peak concentrations of radiocarbon occurred between
   2 and 4 hr postdose. Conceptus (Day 12) and fetal (Day 18) tissues
   accounted for 0.06 and 0.4\% of the administered dose, respectively. Up
   to 4 hr, levels of radiocarbon in placenta and fetus were slightly less
   than in maternal plasma of 18-day pregnant rats and were two to five
   times higher at later periods. At 2 hr, unchanged DCE accounted for most
   of radioactivity (78-86\%) recovered in maternal plasma, placenta, and
   fetus. Acidic metabolites and radioactivity bound to macromolecules
   increased up to 24 hr (0.01 mu mol-eq DCE g(-1)) in either placental or
   fetal tissues. Thereafter, their levels declined more slowly than those
   in the maternal plasma. Results from this developmental toxicity study
   in rats confirm embryonic exposure to radiocarbon associated with
   {[}C-14]DCE and/or its metabolites and has demonstrated the lack of
   observable teratogenic effects. (C) 1995 Society of Toxicology}},

Abstract = {{Multipolar magnetic fields, used for the production of large areas of
   low pressure, high density plasmas at electron cyclotron resonance, can
   also be employed favourably to scale-up plasma sources at any given
   excitation frequency. Since fast electrons responsible for plasma
   excitation undergo a drift motion perpendicular to the static magnetic
   field of a multipolar structure, plasma production along such a
   structure will be uniform when the amplitude of the electric field.
   which accelerates the electrons, is constant along the structure and the
   loss of energetic electrons al the extremities of the magnets is avoided
   by closing the magnetic structures onto themselves according to
   magnetron-like configurations. The limitations to the scaling-up of
   sources are derived in terms of the wave propagation, wavelength, source
   dimensions and mean free path of the fast electrons. Other requirements
   in the process scale-up concern the uniform distribution of process
   parameters, such as gas feeding, pumping, substrate biasing and
   substrate heating. The use of three-dimensional magnetron structures
   satisfies the explicit requirements, in particular the distribution of
   gas supply and pumping through the excitation structure. Two examples of
   novel reactor configuration, designed for chemical processing and
   sputtering, illustrate the new concepts developed in this work.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of intrachromosomal transpositions has until now been
   primarily cytological and has been limited to Drosophila and to humans,
   in both of which segmental shifts can be recognized by altered banding
   patterns. There has been little genetic information. In this study, we
   describe the genetic and cytogenetic properties of a transposition in
   Neurospora crassa. In Tp(1R --> IL)T54M94, a 20 map unit segment of
   linkage group I has been excised from its normal position and inserted
   near the centromere in the opposite arm, in inverted order. In crosses
   heterozygous for the transposition, about one-fifth of surviving progeny
   are duplications carrying the transposed segment in both positions.
   These result from crossing over in the interstitial region. There is no
   corresponding class of progeny duplicated for the interstitial segment.
   The duplication strains are barren in test crosses. A complementary
   deficiency class is represented by unpigmented, inviable ascospores.
   Extent of the duplication was determined by duplication-coverage tests.
   Orientation of the transposed was determined using Tp x Tp crosses
   heterozygous for markers inside and outside the transposed segment, and
   position of the insertion relative to the centromere was established
   using quasi-ordered half-tetrads from crosses x Spore killer. Quelling
   was observed in the primary transformants that were used to introduce a
   critical marker into the transposed segment by repeat-induced point
   mutation (RIP).}},

Abstract = {{Five cats were made anemic by one-time phlebotomy, and their
   reticulocyte responses were monitored daily for 20 days, using manual
   enumeration and a standardized feline reticulocyte protocol developed
   and validated in our laboratory. The reticulocyte responses of 38
   clinically normal client-owned cats also were analyzed manually and
   cytometrically to determine clinical reference ranges.
   Increases in the percentage of aggregate reticulocytes over the
   reference range were detected in 5 of 5 phlebotomized cats, using the
   cytometric protocol. Only 4 of the 5 cats had an increase by results of
   manual enumeration. Manual aggregate counts had considerable daily
   variation and often fluctuated in and out of reference range, whereas
   cytometric aggregate counts remained consistently increased for distinct
   periods. Increased numbers of gregate counts remained consistently
   increased for distinct periods. Increased numbers of aggregate cells
   could also be detected for longer periods when evaluated by now
   cytometry.
   Increased numbers of punctate reticulocytes were detected in 4 of 5
   cats, using the cytometric protocol. None of the cats had increased
   numbers of punctate cells when evaluated by use of the manual technique.
   Aggregate reticulocytes in the 38 clinically normal cats ranged from 0.1
   to 0.5\%, which corresponded to 8,487 to 42,120 cells/mu l. Punctate
   reticulocytes ranged from 2 to 17\%, which corresponded to 225,400 to
   1,268,584 cells/mu l.
   Flow cytometry, using a standardized analysis protocol, was a more
   reliable and sensitive technique for detection and evaluation of feline
   reticulocytosis than was manual enumeration. The sensitivity of the flow
   cytometer to small amounts of intracellular nucleoprotein makes this
   assay especially valuable for detection of punctate reticulocytosis and
   low degrees of aggregate reticulocytosis in cats.}},

Abstract = {{Previously we have shown that tamoxifen (TAM) induces morphological and
   biochemical changes typical of apoptosis in oestrogen receptor
   (ER)-positive MCF-7 or ER-negative MDA-231 human breast cancer cells. In
   this study the effects of TAM on expression of transforming growth
   factor beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) were correlated with the effects on cell
   cycle kinetics and apoptosis. TAM had similar biphasic effects on both
   cell lines. Short-term (<6 h) TAM incubation resulted in a slight
   decrease in TGF-beta(1) protein despite an increase in TGF-beta(1) mRNA
   and was associated with an increase in cells in S-phase. No apoptotic
   effects were noted. Longer (greater than or equal to 12 h) TAM
   incubation induced TGF-beta(1) protein (about 3-fold) and mRNA
   expression (about 2-fold) in both cell lines, and was associated with
   G(1)/G(0) blockade and induction of apoptosis. The accumulation of
   TAM-induced TGF-beta(1) mRNA was increased by cycloheximide, but was not
   affected by 17 beta-oestradiol. Long-term incubation with TAM had no
   significant effect on TGF-beta(1) gene copy number. TAM-induced
   internucleosomal DNA cleavage was inhibited in both cell lines by the
   addition of an anti-TGF-beta(1) antibody. TAM has dose- and
   time-dependent effects on TCF-beta(1) expression associated with changes
   in cell cycle kinetics. These effects are independent of ER status and
   may be the result of a direct regulatory effect of TAM on TGF-beta(1)
   transcription. It also appears that induction of TGF-beta(1) plays an
   important role in TAM-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{The product of the retinoblastoma-related human gene Rb2/p130 is highly
   homologous with the product of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene
   (pRb) and Rb-related p107. This homology is shared mainly in the pocket
   domain, a region that seems to play a key role in the functions of these
   proteins. Here we report the molecular cloning and initial
   characterization of the cDNA encoding the murine homologue of the human
   Rb2/p130 gene product. The 4.8-kb cDNA encodes a protein of 1125 amino
   acids that shows 90\% identity to that of the human protein. The
   Rb2/p130 mRNA is found to be expressed in all of the adult mouse tissues
   examined, with the highest revel being detected in kidney and skeletal
   muscle. For the protein characterization, we used a polyclonal antibody
   raised against the COOH terminus of the human Rb1/p130 protein that also
   recognizes the mouse protein. In developing mouse embryos, the Rb2/p130
   protein is expressed as early as day 10 of gestation and reached a peak
   of expression around day 13 of gestation, implying a developmental
   regulation of the R62/p130 gene in murine ontogeny.}},

   its extensions by the maximum-likelihood method, and provides the
   implied estimates for ultimate resource recovery and their associated
   standard errors. When economic factors are taken into account the
   estimates of ultimate resource recovery become state-dependent, and we
   find that in this case the estimates are higher than those obtained from
   the various specifications of Hubbert's original model. Although the
   accuracy of the estimates of ultimate recoverable reserves cannot be
   evaluated before oil reserves are actually exhausted, we examine how the
   various models estimated over the periods 1926-85 and 1948-85 perform in
   predicting oil production over the 1986-90 period.}},

Abstract = {{The high cost of health care and limited information regarding the
   effects of work hardening have prompted a need to further study work
   hardening programs. The purpose of this study was to determine the
   success oi a work hardening program that included physical,
   occupational, and psychological therapies, and to determine ii there are
   nonphysical factors associated with successful work hardening. One
   hundred medical records of injured workers with low back pain and other
   musculoskeletal disorders were retrospectively reviewed. Factors
   examined included months of injury, education level, sex, race, presence
   oi an attorney, prior surgery, pain behaviors, smoking, medication use,
   and diagnosis severity. Seventy-six percent of the subjects successfully
   completed the program, and 50\% of the subjects were returned to work at
   discharge. Nonphysical factors that limited successful work hardening
   were presence of pain behaviors (p<.01), attorney representation
   (p<.01), McAndrews score above 70 (p<.05), and education less than high
   school (p<.05). The author concludes that the return to work rate for
   injured workers in this study is comparable to rates of previous studies
   and that there are nonphysical factors associated with the success of
   work hardening.}},

Abstract = {{Since the Boulder conference on training in clinical psychology in 1949,
   at least 13 national conferences have been convened to examine issues in
   training for practice in psychology, all based on the assumption that
   extensive training is required to develop professional skills in
   psychotherapy, psychodiagnosis, and related professional functions. This
   assumption is challenged by a large body of research that fails to show
   any relationship between training and efficacy in common forms of
   practice. Educators of professional psychologists are urged to heed the
   challenge closely and examine its implications critically. At the same
   time, educators of researchers in psychology are encouraged to examine
   common assumptions about the nature of practice in psychology and to
   consider conceptions of professional work that emphasize reflection in
   action and disciplined inquiry, rather than psychotherapy and
   psychodiagnosis, as defining features. Education for practice is neither
   science nor art, but a profession in itself. When the educational
   process is approached from this vantage point, novel opportunities for
   systematic investigation emerge. Decisive studies of the appropriate
   kind have yet to be done.}},

Abstract = {{Inflammatory lung disease is associated with increased epithelial
   permeability, but it is unclear how inflammatory cells alter epithelial
   permeability. Neutrophils have azurophilic granules containing elastase,
   cathepsin G, and defensins which are released at sites of inflammation.
   Experiments using whole animals and cultured cells suggest that
   neutrophil elastase contributes to increased epithelial permeability.
   Using Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial (MDCK) monolayers, a
   well-described epithelial model, we asked whether neutrophil elastase
   directly affects epithelial permeability independent of cell death or
   cell detachment from the substratum. We measured permeability using
   H-3-mannitol. We found that neutrophil elastase increased epithelial
   permeability in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. Increased
   permeability required prolonged (greater than or equal to 6 h) exposure
   to elastase, but was not associated with cytolytic injury or cell
   detachment. These findings are potentially relevant to the lung because
   we found a similar time- and concentration-dependent effect when we
   added elastase to cultured human bronchial epithelial cells. In MDCK
   cells, permeability increased without alterations in cell actin at the
   light microscopic level. Interestingly, elastase-induced permeability
   was both prevented and reversed by serum, but not by serum albumin.
   Complete reversal occurred if serum was added up to 16 h after adding
   elastase. Proteolytic activity is important in HNE-induced epithelial
   permeability because soy bean trypsin inhibitor completely blocks the
   effect and alpha(1) proteinase inhibitor (alpha(1)PI) partially blocks
   the effect. Charge interactions also appear to be important because the
   polyanions heparin and sulfated dextran completely blocked increased
   permeability following elastase but only partially blocked elastolytic
   activity in isotonic solutions. In addition, other cationic neutrophil
   peptides, cathepsin G and defensins, acted cooperatively with elastase
   to increase permeability, These data provide direct evidence that
   neutrophil elastase alters normal epithelial barrier properties without
   killing the cells, and that elastase acts cooperatively with other
   soluble neutrophil mediators in causing target epithelial cell
   dysfunction. By altering epithelial permeability, elastase can
   contribute to the pathophysiology in many forms of inflammatory lung
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the applicability of a new technology in neonates.
   Transtracheal Doppler and extravascular Doppler determinations of stroke
   volume and cardiac output were compared with thermodilution measurements
   at various states of volume loading in an animal model.
   Design: Prospective, descriptive study.
   Setting: Animal research laboratory at; a university medical center.
   Subjects: Fourteen newly weaned piglets, weighing 2.8 to 6.5 kg.
   Interventions: Doppler probes were placed on the endotracheal tube tip
   (transtracheal Doppler) and directly on the aortic adventitia
   (extravascular Doppler). A 4-Fr thermodilution catheter was inserted in
   the pulmonary artery, Stroke volume and cardiac output determinations
   were recorded at baseline, after a 15-mL/kg volume load and after
   successive 15-mL/kg blood withdrawals to exsanguination or a systolic
   blood pressure of <20 mm Hg.
   Measurements and Main Results: Transtracheal and extravascular Doppler
   measurements of cardiac output were not significantly different from
   thermodilution at any physiologic state. These techniques were able to
   measure stroke volumes and cardiac outputs at the low levels seen in
   severe hemorrhagic shock.
   Conclusions: Transtracheal Doppler and extravascular Doppler
   measurements of cardiac output compare favorably with thermodilution.
   These methods effectively followed trends from alterations in
   intravascular volume, even at very high heart rates and small stroke
   volumes. Transtracheal Doppler and extravascular Doppler should yield
   useful information in critically ill neonatal patients, where data
   regarding stroke volume and cardiac output may be useful in clinical
   management.}},

   were concerned. Good school performance was associated with a good
   health index and a good social index. Regular physical exercise in
   adolescence is extremely important when considering the state of health
   in adulthood. The family background predicted the development of health.
   The mother's high educational level was associated with good health and
   social indices. The results also showed that living in a farming family
   and having mothers working at home seemed to be protective factors for
   good health. The binary regression model was applied to the factors
   predicting the health index and the social index in adulthood. A major
   concern in future research is how to explore factors which affect the

Abstract = {{The prime objective of the work is to predict the behaviour of voids in
   the steel slab during hot rolling and to assess the tendency of the void
   to closure, depending on the process parameters. The rigid-plastic
   thermal-mechanical finite-element program is used for the purpose. The
   model which simulates the general case of deformation of a single void
   In a matrix undergoing plastic deformation is developed. This model
   allows the investigation of the influence of the stress state on the
   void's behaviour. Finite element calculations carried out for the
   industrial hot plate rolling process supply information regarding the
   stress state during rolling depending on the process technological
   parameters. These data are used as boundary conditions in the void's
   closure model and, in consequence, allow the analysis of the influence
   of rolling technology on the void's behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To characterize abnormalities of brain function in patients
   with phenylketonuria (PKU) who had relaxed or stopped the dietary
   regimen and to test whether oral high-dose tyrosin (Tyr) supplementation
   has a beneficial effect.
   Design: Comparison with a control group; double-blind,
   placebo-controlled study comprising six times; crossover treatment
   groups; oral high-dose Tyr therapy (100 mg/kg body weight per day) or
   placebo administration for 4 weeks.
   Subjects: Twentry-four early-treated patients with PKU aged 20.8 (16 to
   25) years; 24 control subjects.
   Methods: Plasma concentrations of phenylalanine and Typ were monitored.
   Neuropsychologic tasks, visual evoked potentials, and spectral analysis
   of electro-encephalographic activity were used to evaluate brain
   function.
   Results: When patients with PKU were compared with control subjects,
   deficits in certain aspects of brain function were confirmed (i.e., a
   decreased ability to sustain attention, prolonged latencies of visual
   evoked potential peaks N1 and P2, and a reduced amount of fast-wave
   activity on the electroencephalogram). Baseline plasma phenylalanine and
   Tyr concentrations were in the typical range of adult patients with PKU.
   The plasma Tyr concentration increased approximately 200\% during Tyr
   supplementation, but no beneficial effects were observed.
   Conclusions: High-dose Tyr supplementation cannot be recommended as an
   `'alternative'' treatment for patients with PKU after relaxation or
   termination of strict dietary adherence.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic factors may be of importance in determining inter-individual
   susceptibility to alcoholic liver disease (ALD), Among the candidate
   genes which have been considered to be important are those which code
   for enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism, Cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1)
   metabolizes alcohol to acetaldehyde and the hydroxyethyl radical, and is
   also inducible by alcohol, A Rsa I restriction fragment length
   polymorphism (RFLP) in the 5'-flanking region of the CYP2E1 gene has
   been identified by other investigators, studies showing that the mutant
   allele (termed c(2)) shows greater transcriptional activity, higher
   protein levels and increased activity compared with the wild-type allele
   (c(1)), We have used PCR-RFLP analysis to determine whether the
   frequency of these alleles differed in 95 Caucasian patients with ALD
   compared with 205 control subjects (comprising 58 alcoholics with no
   liver disease, 47 patients with non-alcoholic liver disease and 100
   healthy volunteers), In controls, the frequency (0.024) of the c(2)
   allele was similar to that previously reported in other Caucasian
   populations. The c(2) allele frequency in patients with ALD (0.1),
   however, was significantly (p = 0.0003; odds ratio (OR) 4.5, 95\% CI
   1.9-10.9) higher than in control subjects, The findings indicate that
   Caucasians carrying the Rsa I c(2) allele of the CYP2E1 gene may be at
   higher risk of developing ALD if they abuse alcohol.}},

Abstract = {{Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B is a mitogen and chemoattractant
   for smooth muscle cells in vitro, and expression of a recombinant PDGF B
   gene in porcine arteries stimulates intimal thickening. To define the
   mechanisms by which PDGF B gene expression induces intimal thickening in
   vivo, we examined its effects on smooth muscle cell proliferation and
   migration, extracellular matrix synthesis, and inflammatory cell
   infiltration in intimal lesions of pig arteries after direct gene
   transfer of a recombinant PDGF B gene. PDGF B gene expression was
   associated with rapid formation of an intima, including 3- to 10-fold
   increases in intimal thickness and intima-to-media area ratio 4 to 21
   days after gene transfer compared with control transfected arteries.
   Intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation was detected at 2 days, peaked
   at 7 days (P<.01), and declined by 14 days, although the total number of
   intimal nuclei progressively increased to 21 days (P<.01). Calculations
   of expected-to-observed ratios of intimal cells, based on BrdC
   proliferation indexes, demonstrated that the increases in intimal cell
   number on days 2 through 7 could not be accounted for by proliferation
   alone, suggesting that recombinant PDGF BB acts to stimulate cell
   proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells into the intima.
   Extracellular matrix deposition and procollagen synthesis were observed
   after 7 days (P<.01) and were associated with a decline in cell density
   in the intima, suggesting that extracellular matrix synthesis may
   contribute to progressive intimal thickening in response to PDGF B gene
   expression. There was minimal accumulation of inflammatory cells,
   including macrophages and CD3(+) lymphocytes, in transfected arteries.
   These data suggest that PDGF B gene expression promotes intimal
   expansion by both proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells
   followed by synthesis of extracellular matrix and therefore acts through
   several mechanisms to play a role in the pathogenesis of intimal lesions
   in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Earlier work has identified a cell population that replicates HIV-1 in
   the absence of standard T cell stimuli. The system consists of dendritic
   cells and memory T lymphocytes that emigrate from organ cultures of
   human skin and together support a productive infection with HIV-1. These
   emigrants resemble cells that can be found in mucous membranes and that
   normally traffic in afferent lymph. Here, we report that a low level of
   infection in the dendritic cell can initiate extensive HIV-1 replication
   in cocultures with T cells. First we extended our earlier work to larger
   skin specimens from cadavers. As long as the organ cultures were set up
   within 36 h of death, the emigrant leukocytes were comparable to cells
   from fresh surgical specimens in number, phenotype, and function. These
   mixtures of dendritic cells and T cells provided the milieu for a
   productive infection with several virus isolates. When purified
   dendritic cells were separately pulsed with virus and then mixed with T
   cells that had not been pulsed with HIV-1, active infection ensued. The
   infectivity of HIV-pulsed dendritic cells persisted for at least 1.5 d
   in culture, but was blocked if AZT was added during that time to block
   reverse transcription in the dendritic cells. The number of copies of
   proviral DNA in the dendritic cells corresponded to <100 copies per 5 X
   10(4) cells, but upon mixing with T cells, >10(4) copies were found 5-7
   d later. By contacting syngeneic T cells, extralymphoid depots of
   dendritic cells-even with a low viral burden as has been reported in
   vivo-may contribute to chronic HIV-1 replication in infected
   individuals.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of bisoprolol 10 mg once daily, isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN)
   20 mg three times daily, or a combination of these drugs on ischemia
   during exercise testing and on the occurrence and the circadian
   variation of ischemia during ambulatory monitoring were evaluated in 23
   patients with stable angina pectoris. ISDN and bisoprolol monotherapies
   both significantly reduced the number of patients with angina pectoris
   and ST-depression during ergometry while lengthening the time to
   occurrence of 0.1-mV ST-depression. ISDN did not reduce the number of
   ischemic episodes measured by Bolter monitoring, although it did
   significantly reduce the duration of ischemia. Bisoprolol monotherapy
   and combination therapy significantly reduced the number of ischemic
   episodes as well as the duration of ischemia, total ischemic burden, and
   number of anginal attacks. The circadian variation of ischemia as
   measured by Bolter monitor was completely abolished by bisoprolol
   monotherapy and by combination therapy. ISDN monotherapy reduced the
   evening peak of ischemia but only shortened the morning peak. Both
   bisoprolol and ISDN reduced ischemia during formal exercise testing, but
   only bisoprolol effectively reduced the total amount of daily life
   ischemia as measured by ambulatory monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Mortality in insulin-dependent diabetes is markedly increased compared
   to the general population. Although strong associations have been found
   between renal disease and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) the
   interaction between these two factors is not well understood. This
   study, which addresses risk factors for mortality in IDDM with a
   particular focus on the renal-CVD link, is based on the prospective
   Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications study. Thirty-seven (mean age 36
   years, mean duration of IDDM 28 years at baseline) of the 658 IDDM
   individuals (mean age 28 years, mean duration of IDDM 20 years at
   baseline) have died in the first 4 years of follow up. A nested
   case-control study was performed, matching on sex and duration of
   diabetes. Twenty-two (59\%) of the deaths were attributed to coronary
   heart disease, with an additional 16\% attributed to diabetic coma. Only
   nine (41\%) of the 22 individuals who died from cardiovascular disease
   had clinical evidence of coronary heart disease when seen for their last
   biennial exam. However, 54\% of those who died of CVD without prior
   evidence did have evidence of lower extremity arterial disease. A strong
   link with renal disease was confirmed, with 81\% of those with a
   coronary artery disease death having renal disease. Multivariate
   analyses suggest that smoking history, triglycerides and total platelet
   count are independent predictors of mortality, while LDL cholesterol
   best predicted CVD mortality. These results suggest a need for more
   intensive screening for cardiovascular disease, and correction of
   cardiovascular risk factors, in order to reduce the increased rate of
   mortality in this population. Efforts to prevent or delay the onset of
   renal disease may also be of benefit.}},

Abstract = {{Human erythroid progenitor cells grown in a suspension culture system
   were used to study possible interactions between different guanine
   nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein)-coupled receptor-effector systems
   during normal cell differentiation. Agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase
   was not inhibited by any one of a panel of ligands (ADP, UTP,
   platelet-activating factor, thrombin, alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists,
   interleukin 8, lysophosphatidic acid) most of which are known, in other
   cells, to reduce cAMP formation by a G(i)-mediated, pertussis
   toxin-sensitive mechanism. ism. The first four of these ligands are also
   known to cause transient changes in intracellular {[}Ca2+] in erythroid
   cells. Rather than inhibiting, thrombin (but not ADP, UTP or PAF)
   specifically caused a fivefold increase in the maximum adenosine- or
   prostaglandin E(1)-stimulated cAMP formation, without any shift of the
   concentration/response curves. Thrombin did not enhance forskolin- and
   AlF4--stimulated cyclase activity and had only a marginal effect on
   isoprenaline-dependent stimulation. The effect of thrombin seemed to be
   unrelated to intracellular Ca2+ release but could be partially mimicked
   by phorbol ester (PMA)-induced stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) and
   was inhibited by staurosporin or by inactivation of PKC after long-term
   incubation with PMA. The activity of thrombin was restricted to
   proliferating, colony-forming progenitor cells while proerythroblasts
   were completely unresponsive. Our results suggest that the interaction
   of thrombin with G(s)-linked receptors requires phosphorylation of a
   target protein that is different from adenylyl cyclase, G(s) or G(i) but
   may be involved in the regulation of receptor desensitization.}},

Abstract = {{Sixteen planar coumarin type substrates and inhibitors of cytochrome

   Analysis (CoMFA) method {[}1]. The analysis was carried out using
   traditional steric and electrostatic fields, the energy of the lowest

   orbital (HOMO), dipole moment and LUMO as a 3-D field (square of the
   wave function). The highest cross-validated r(2)-value (q(2)), 0.741.
   was obtained (five PLS components) when steric and electrostatic fields
   were used together. However, when LUMO field or energy was included in
   the analyses, q(2)-values decreased (0.723 and 0.724, respectively) and
   the required number of PLS components also decreased to three. In this
   case the LUMO field most probably reflects structural information not
   shown in traditional fields. CoMFA contour maps emphasized the
   importance of the ligands' lactone structure, together with the methoxy
   group of methoxsalen, for high CYP2A5 binding affinity.}},

Abstract = {{beta or C-C chemokines including RANTES, MCP-3, MIP-1 alpha, and eotaxin
   have been implicated in the pathogenesis of eosinophilic inflammation.
   Two human beta chemokine receptors have been cloned and characterized:
   the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor or C-C chemokine receptor 1 (CCR-1) and
   the MCP-1 receptor or C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR-2). However, no
   murine beta chemokine receptors have thus far been reported. Molecular
   cloning from mouse genomic DNA and cDNA libraries yielded two murine
   beta chemokine receptors with 79\% and 65\% sequence identity with human
   CCR-1, and 50\% and 55\% with human CCR-2. COS cells transiently
   transfected with the murine homologue of human CCR-1 bind murine MIP-1
   alpha and human RANTES with K(d)s of 3.4 nM and 4.2 nM and murine MIP-1
   beta with an EC(50) of 8.9 nM. The other murine beta chemokine receptor,
   which we have designated murine CCR-3, also binds murine MIP-1 alpha.
   The mRNAs for both receptors are expressed in eosinophils from IL-5
   transgenic mice. The level of murine CCR-3 mRNA in these mouse
   eosinophils exceeds that of CCR-1 mRNA and approaches actin levels.
   Murine MIP-1 alpha was found to be a potent chemoattractant for murine
   eosinophils. Our findings suggest that the murine MIP-1 alpha
   ligand/receptor system is an important mediator of murine eosinophil
   trafficking.}},

Abstract = {{Mordacia mordax is one of the two anadramous parasitic lamprey species
   of the southern hemisphere family Mordaciidae. Its adults possess two
   lateral buccal glands and one central buccal gland. When the tongue-like
   piston is retracted, the buccal glands occupy much of the opening of the
   oral cavity at the rear of the buccal cavity. The glands contain
   numerous tube-like, ductless secretory units, which discharge directly
   into the buccal cavity. Their secretory epithelial cells contain
   numerous granules, some of which are zymogen-like, while others have a
   beaded, spiralled appearance, The similarity of the latter to mast cell
   granules suggests that they may likewise produce an anticoagulant, which
   would be valuable to a presumed blood feeder such as M. mordax. The
   mucus produced by these cells could act as a carrier for the secretions
   and as an adhesive for promoting retention of the secretions on the
   host's surface. When the young adult is transferred to salt water, the
   buccal glands increase their production and discharge of secretions.
   Since the glands are not enclosed in musculature, their secretions are
   probably discharged by mechanical pressure applied by the forward
   movement of the head of the tooth-bearing piston into the buccal cavity.
   An account is given of the way in which the location, number, glandular
   organization, secretory granules, and type of secretion of the buccal
   glands of M. mordax, and thus presumably also their mode of function,
   differ markedly from those of members of the other lamprey family found
   in the southern hemisphere, and of all holarctic lampreys. (C) 1995

   was mainly dependent on the matrix alloy. It was also found that the

   size and aspect ratio: large and elongated particulates oriented in the
   loading direction were more prone to fail than small, equiaxed ones.
   Finally, a significant fraction of the reinforcements in the cast

Abstract = {{How is it, that among the countless technological innovations in
   weaponry, chemical weapons stand out as weapons that carry the stigma of
   moral illegitimacy.  To provide an adequate account of the
   prohibitionary norm against chemical weapons use, one must understand
   the meanings that have served to constitute and delegitimize this
   category of weapons.  Such an account is provided by genealogy, a method
   that examines the interpretive practices around which moral orders are
   constructed and behaviors are defined as normal or unacceptable.  The
   genealogical method yields insights that illuminate neglected dimensions
   of the chemical weapons taboo:  namely, the roles that contingency,
   domination, and resistance have played in the operation of this norm as
   a symbol of `'uncivilized'' conduct in international relations.}},

Abstract = {{The usual two-solvent casting technique was used to prepare a series of
   poly(ethylene oxide), PEG, and poly(propylene oxide), PPO, electrolytes
   containing trivalent salts of Eu, Nd, and Pr with concentrations between
   n = 80 and n = 3 (n is the number of ether oxygen atoms in the polymer
   chain per lanthanide cation). The films were characterized by
   differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron
   microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis, and X-ray powder
   diffraction. The EU(3-) and pr(3-) electrolytes with n greater than or
   equal to 8 exhibit an endothermic peak around 65 degrees C, which is
   associated with the melting of crystalline PEG. Films with compositions
   16 greater than or equal to n greater than or equal to 7 showed, in
   addition, a smaller endotherm around 60 degrees C, which results from a
   eutectic phase of PEO and PEO/salt complex. The highly concentrated
   PEO(n)EuBr(3) films, n less than or equal to 6, are a glassy,
   transparent, and fragile materials when no traces of water are detected.
   The stoichiometry of the high-melting-point crystalline complex observed
   for these EU(3+) electrolytes appears to be close to an oxygen-cation
   ratio of 3:1. The morphology of the Nd3+ electrolytes was found to be
   independent of the salt concentration. These films are characterized by
   the presence of a crystalline PEO phase and, probably, a
   nonstoichiometric PEO-NdCl3 complex. PPO-EuBr3 electrolytes are
   predominantly amorphous and formation of a salt-rich complex phase was
   also observed at high salt concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To determine the characteristics of an aldosterone-producing
   adenoma (APA) as a cause of hypertension, its mode of presentation and
   investigation, as well as the outcome of surgical removal.
   Design. Retrospective survey with follow-up.
   Setting. Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town.
   Patients. 18 patients who had an APA removed between 1975 and 1993.
   Outcome measures. Clinical and biochemical features, morbidity and
   mortality rates associated with adrenalectomy, and the degree of
   amelioration of hypertension.
   Results. Eighteen of 41 patients with primary hyperaldosteronism had an
   APA. Features of symptomatic hypokalaemia (muscular weakness 9, fatigue
   7) were present for a mean of 60 (9 - 240) months. The mean systolic
   arterial pressure was 153 (117 - 200) mmHg. The mean potassium revel was
   2,2 mmol/l and the mean aldosterone level 1 639 (147-5 153) pmol/l,
   which, paradoxically, fell on ambulation in 12 patients. All renin
   levels were suppressed in the supine (mean 0,1 +/- 0,1 (0 - 0,6)
   ng/ml/h) and ambulatory positions (mean 0,4 +/- 0,5 (0 - 1,8) ng/ml/h).
   Each of 17 tomographic and 6 iodocholesterol scans correctly identified
   the lesion. There was no surgical mortality, and all patients became
   normokalaemic. At 1 month or at the time of discharge, 12 (66\%)
   patients were normotensive, 7 without medication. Age, length of
   history, severity of hypertension and evidence of target organ damage
   did not predict response to surgery.
   Conclusions. An APA is a rare cause of hypertension and hypokalaemia,
   but it is important to identify as surgery may be beneficial in most
   cases.}},

Abstract = {{Lactational and reproductive performance of 1580 dairy cows of five
   dairy breeds were analyzed to estimate the magnitude of effects on 20
   response variables of the sires of fetuses born to initiate lactation.
   Data were from a single herd. Represented were daughters of 410 sires;
   number of lactation records per response variable varied from 1994 to
   3776. Data were analyzed by method of ordinary least square analyses of
   variance in models which included random effects of sire of
   cow-year-season, sire of fetus in sire of cow, and a set of fixed
   effects, age of cow, length of record, sex of calf, days pregnant, birth
   weight and gestation length, acid presence or absence of metritis,
   dystocia and retained placenta. Sire of fetus effects were detected in
   16 response variables, accounting for 0 to 20.2\% of the phenotypic
   variance. These estimates represented upper limits of the magnitude of
   sire of fetus effects since they included interactions of such effects
   with other factors. Effects of sire of fetus' were not detected for
   uterine horn of pregnancy, retained placenta, stillbirth or death of
   calf prior to 30 days postpartum. Results thus confirm that sire of
   fetus effects exist for postpartum productive and reproductive
   performance of dairy cattle.}},

Abstract = {{Members of the genus Passiflora are reported to have evolved
   modifications which kill insects; they have however never been tested
   for carnivorous syndrome. The flowers of Passiflora foetida consists of
   highly reticulate bracts which cover and grow along with the buds and
   fruits. Removal of bracts from developing bud and fruit resulted in
   higher predatory damage compared to those where the bracts were intact.
   These bracts also possess a large number of minute glands which ooze
   sticky secretion. A variety of tiny insects were found trapped by the
   secretion of the bracts. The secretion of these glands show high
   proteases and acid phosphatase activity, two common digestive enzymes
   found in traps of true carnivorous plants. A high quantity of aminoacids
   were released from freshly freeze killed ants when incubated in buffer
   extract of bracts. {[}C-14]phenylalanine smeared on the glandular
   surface of bracts was recovered from ovules suggesting potential for
   absorption of aminoacids. These results suggest a novel role for bracts
   where primary function is to minimize predatory damage to developing
   flowers and fruits. The bracts serve as insect traps and also possess
   the mechanism to digest the trapped insects to obtain free aminoacids.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Serum carbohydrate deficient transferrin is a marker of
   chronic alcohol consumption; it increases above normal in healthy
   individuals after a daily alcohol intake of more than 60 g/d for more
   than 2 creeks. The influence of liver disease itself on carbohydrate
   deficient transferrin levels has not been sufficiently established.
   Methods: We investigated serum levels of carbohydrate deficient
   transferrin in 196 consecutive patients admitted to our Gastroenterology
   and Hepatology Unit and correlated this parameter with the patients'
   statements about alcohol intake during the previous 2 weeks and with
   other markers of chronic alcohol consumption.
   Results: In our patient population, carbohydrate deficient transferrin
   had the best overall performance with respect to sensitivity (88\%),
   specificity (82\%), and negative predictive value (98\%), as compared to
   other markers, although specificity was much lower than previously
   reported in patients without liver disease. In the group of
   patients,vith liver disease, sensitivity and specificity were 90\% and
   73\%, respectively, and in patients without liver disease, 80\%;, and
   88\%. The negative predictive value was excellent (96\% for patients
   with liver disease and 99\% for patients without liver disease).
   Conclusions: Thus, in a patient with a negative interview for chronic
   alcohol abuse and normal carbohydrate deficient transferrin level,
   alcohol is unlikely to be the cause of liver disease, and further
   investigations to establish the etiology of liver disease are warranted.
   An increased carbohydrate deficient transferrin level, however, cannot
   be regarded as reliable evidence for chronic alcohol abuse in patients
   with liver disease.}},

Abstract = {{The coastal waters of Sri Lanka have well-developed reefs; the majority
   are made up of sandstone and rocky habitats that form extensive reefs
   around the island, The greatest extent of true coral reefs is located in
   the Gulf of Mannar region off the northwestern coast of the island. For
   centuries coastal people have been dependent on the harvest of reef fish
   and other resources, Corals have been utilized in the production of lime
   that is used in the construction industry, The exports of spiny
   lobsters, sea cucumber and ornamental reef fish contribute significantly
   to the foreign-exchange earnings of the country, Tourism has also
   benefited from the aesthetic value of coral reefs, However, due to
   unmanaged resource utilization, reef habitats are being depleted at an
   alarming rate, Research has revealed that the status of coastal reefs is
   declining steadily due to various human activities such as destructive
   fishing, coral mining, overharvesting, unplanned development, and
   sedimentation due to land-use patterns. Although laws have been
   introduced to protect reefs, few have been implemented due to inadequate
   institutional cooperation and political considerations, There is also a
   lack of awareness and concern among the general public, This paper
   reviews the status of coastal reefs in Sri Lanka; major disturbance
   factors are described and management issues are discussed, Research
   conducted on coral reefs in Sri Lanka is also reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of different crop combinations on root growth and nodulation
   of cowpea {[}Vigna unquiculata (L.) Walp.] were investigated on a soil
   under continuous cropping. Fertilizer application significantly
   increased nodule counts at 10 weeks after planting in cowpea sole and in
   cowpea-okra (Hibiscus esculentus L.)-tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum
   Mill. nom, cons.) and in cowpea-maize (Zea mays L.)-okra-tomato
   intercropping systems. Cowpea in cowpea-okra-tomato intercropping had
   the highest nodule weight at 10 weeks. The lowest weight was obtained
   from sole cowpea without fertilizer. Fertilizer significantly increased
   root weight in sole and intercropped cowpea.
   Soils carrying sole okra and tomato, including their combinations with
   1,2 or 3 crops possessed reduced microbial populations due to fertilizer
   application, except cowpea-maize-tomato and maize-tomato. Fertilized and
   unfertilized tomato soils contained the highest microbial population,
   while soils carrying 4 crop combinations had the lowest.
   Simple correlation analysis indicated that cowpea yield, root weight,
   nodule count and nodule weight were highly and positively correlated and
   the correlation was highest at 10 weeks after planting. Nodule counts
   and weight were highly significantly correlated at each sampling stage.
   Fertilizer application increased greater nodulation in the intercrops
   but resulted in a lower seed yield of cowpea.}},

Volume = {{65}},

Pages = {{765-770}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To incorporate kenaf fibers into textiles, it is important to establish
   uniformity of fibers extracted from the base to the tip of the plant.
   East fiber quality depends on both physical (crystallinity, crystallite
   size, and orientation) and chemical (lignin, gum, and hemicellulose)
   properties. Therefore, the first objective is to determine fiber
   uniformity, evaluating the effect of processing on tenacity, elongation,
   crystallinity, crystallite size, and chemical composition of fibers
   extracted from base to tip of the stalk. Second, to make fibers
   spinnable, the effect of various softeners is evaluated. Decorticated
   kenaf stems (variety E41) have been retted chemically and bacterially to
   extract fibers. Fiber bundle strength ranges from 22-30 g/tex. Gum
   content decreases from 20-10\% with the initial chemical processing;
   later degumming does not reduce gum levels. Initial gum removal
   increases crystallinity by 3-5\% and crystallite size by 20-25\%.
   Physical and chemical properties of kenaf fibers are uniform along the
   whole length of the native stalks. Alkali treatment with 1\% NaOH is not
   sufficient to impart noticeable stretch. Enzyme and degumming treatments
   weaken the fibers significantly (30-45\%). The commercial softener makes
   fibers too sticky, and they stick to the carding equipment. Bending
   rigidity and hysteresis (recovery after repeated bending) do not
   significantly improve for the softened fibers. Degummed fibers are the
   strongest, most pliable, with least hysteresis and lowest residual gum
   content, and are spinnable.}},

Abstract = {{General anesthetic agents often affect the biochemical and physiologic
   changes triggered by cerebral ischemia. This study examined the regional
   activities of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in gerbils subjected to 5
   min of bilateral carotid occlusion without anesthesia. At 2, 4, and 6 h
   of reperfusion, significant ODC activity was observed in both the colter
   and the hippocampus. Pretreatment with cr-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)
   significantly blocked the ODC activity at 2, 4, and 6 h. Significant
   edema formation was found at 2, 4, and 6 h. At 2 h, edema formation was
   unaffected by administration of DFMO. However, DFMO treatment reduced
   later edema formation at 4 and 6 h. These results demonstrate that ODC
   activity and edema formation are delayed in gerbils after the induction
   of transient ischemia even with the removal of anesthetic agents and
   their potentially protective effects. These findings suggest that ODC
   activity and ifs induction of delayed cerebral edema are specific to
   cerebral ischemia and not to an anesthetic effect. DFMO treatment
   reduced both the ODC activity and edema formation, indicating a role for
   polyamines in postischemic edema formation.}},

Volume = {{98}},

Abstract = {{Alzen et al. found that of 2,006 X-rays taken to identify fractures in
   childhood, only 345 fractures could be verified. To minimize this
   discrepancy, the traumatology department at the RWTH in Aachen prefers
   performing ultrasound before taking an X-ray. We call this procedure
   `'osteosonography''. If one uses osteosonography, fractures can be
   recognized, interpreted and, in some cases, immediately treated without
   taking additional X-rays. Furthermore, it is then possible not to have
   to X-ray the extremities, resulting in a reduction in the amount of
   radiation to the gonads and epiphyses. Other advantages of
   osteosonography are that it is then possible to compare examinations of
   the contralateral side, interprete bone and tissue at the same time, and
   do the examination in the presence of the parents. After 180 children
   had been examined, it became apparent that in 53.3\% of all children,
   the X-ray could be replaced by osteosonography. On the one hand, we had
   children with no ultrasonographic suggestion of fractures and, on the
   other, we had fractures with no indications for repositioning or
   operating (e.g. `'bulge fractures''); these could be treated at once
   with cast. We are of the opinion that our experience with
   osteosonography justifies generally making this the first diagnostic
   measure before X-raying children during the growth phase. A this way,
   radiation can be minimized, resulting in a reduction in X-ray-induced
   damage.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous study we have shown that monoclonal antibody F1 (MoAb F1),
   directed against an epitope on the heavy chain of factor XII distinct
   from the binding site for anionic surfaces, is able to activate factor
   XII in plasma (Nuijens JH, et al: J Biol Chem 264; 12941, 1989). Here,
   we studied in detail the mechanism underlying the activation of factor
   XII by MoAb F1 using purified proteins. Formation of factor XIIa was
   assessed by measuring its amidolytic activity towards the chromogenic
   substrate H-D-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA (S-2302) in the presence of soybean
   trypsin inhibitor and by assessing cleavage on sodium dodecyl
   sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Upon incubation
   with MoAb F1 alone, factor XII was auto-activated in a time-dependent
   fashion, activation being maximal after 30 hours. Factor XII incubated
   in the absence of MoAb F1 was hardly activated by kallikrein. whereas in
   the presence of MoAb F1, but not in that of a control MoAb, the rate of
   factor XII activation by kallikrein was promoted at least 60-fold.
   Maximal activation of factor XII with hallikrein in the presence of MoAb
   F1 was reached within 1 hour. This effect of hallikrein on the cleavage
   of factor XII bound to MoAb F1 was specific because the fibrinolytic
   enzymes plasmin, urokinase, and tissue-type plasminogen activator could
   not substitute for kallikrein. Also, trypsin could easily activate
   factor XII. but in contrast to kallikrein, this activation was
   independent of MoAb F1. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the appearance of
   amidolytic activity correlated well with cleavage of factor XII. MoAb
   F1-induced activation of factor XII in this purified system was not
   dependent on the presence of high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK), in
   contrast to the activation of the contact system in plasma by MoAb F1.
   Experiments with deletion mutants revealed that the epitopic region for
   MoAb F1 on factor XII is located on the kringle domain. Thus, this study
   shows that binding of ligands to the kringle domain. which does not
   contribute to the proposed binding site for negatively charged surfaces,
   may induce activation of factor XII. Therefore, these findings point to
   the existence of multiple mechanisms of activation of factor XII. (C)

Abstract = {{In this comment, we argue that although Farmer and Klein (1995) have

   one possible cause of dyslexia is somewhat vague. We argue that
   `'temporal processing deficit'' is never clearly defined. Furthermore,
   we question some of their assumptions concerning an auditory temporal
   processing deficit related to dyslexia, and we present arguments and
   data that seem inconsistent with their claims regarding how a visual
   temporal processing deficit would manifest itself in dyslexic readers.
   While we agree that some dyslexics have visual problems, we conclude
   that problems with reading caused by the visual mechanisms that Farmer
   and Klein postulate are quite rare.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical and optical properties of FeSi2 structures produced by
   ion beam synthesis (IBS) are investigated. Above 150 K both alpha and
   beta FeSi2/n-Si structures display good Schottky diode characteristics.
   beta FeSi2/n-Si exhibits a low reverse leakage current up to - 20 V
   after which abrupt avalanche breakdown occurs. As expected, the reverse
   leakage current of alpha FeSi2/n-Si for the same diode area, is an order
   to magnitude higher than that for the beta FeSi2/n-Si diodes and the
   breakdown is less abrupt. The characteristics of both types of diode
   suggest that thermionic emission is the main conduction mechanism across
   the barrier. For samples implanted with higher doses of Fe, where a
   continuous layer of beta FeSi2, is produced, the photoluminescence (PL)
   signal is indistinguishable from the background noise at 80 K. However,
   for lower dose samples (in the dose range 5x10(15)-1x10(17) Fe cm(-2))
   although the peak position remains the same the signal intensity is
   significantly increased and is visible at 80 K. Cross-sectional
   transmission electron microscopy (XTEM) results from these samples show
   precipitates with diameters of 400-600 Angstrom at the surface and
   smaller precipitates < 50 Angstrom in diameter around the projected
   range of the implant. For even lower dose samples (1 x 10(14) Fe cm(-2))
   no PL signal is observed which correlates to the lack of beta FeSi2
   precipitates in the XTEM micrographs.}},

Abstract = {{The regulation of cross-bridge transition from weakly attached to

   fibers by measuring the rate of force development after a quick
   release-restretch cycle (k(tr)), the rate of force decline (K-Pi) after
   photogeneration of P-i from caged P-i, and stiffness in the presence and
   absence of an inhibitor of strong cross-bridge formation,
   2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM). Both BDM and P-i suppressed force more
   than stiffness. However, reduction of Ca2+ suppressed farce and
   stiffness in a parallel fashion. Both k(tr) and k(Pi) were reversibly
   reduced (by 30-35\%) in 3 mM BDM, but both were increased by increasing
   P-i concentration. Reduction of Ca2+ concentration to match the force
   seen in 3 mM BDM had no effect on k(Pi) but decreased k(tr) by 85\%.
   These results are inconsistent with cross-bridge models undergoing the
   transition from a weakly bound to a force-generating state in a single
   step but are consistent with a model having two steps, one of which is
   controlled by pCa.}},

Abstract = {{DNA in situ hybridization with human chromosome specific DNA libraries
   was applied to compare the karyotypes of humans (Homo sapiens, 2n = 46)
   and cats (Felis catus, 2n = 38). For the autosomes alone, 30 segments of
   conserved synteny were revealed. The arrangement of these segments in
   the feline karyotype differs by only seven single chromosome breaks and
   one intrachromosomal inversion from their arrangement in humans.
   Comparison of these data with those recently obtained for pig and those
   available from conventional gene mapping studies in mice and cattle has
   allowed us to develop a model of karyotype evolution in mammals. The cat
   and human karyotypes, with 36 and 44 autosomes respectively, were found
   to be very similar to a putative ancient mammalian founder karyotype. It
   would appear that during evolution to the human karyotype the status quo

   been no need to alter the well-balanced gene arrangement of the

Abstract = {{Freshwater sponges in the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence River system
   overgrow and kill introduced zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga
   mussels (Dreissena bugensis) on solid substrates. Sponges overgrow and
   smother mussel siphons, thereby interfering with normal feeding and
   respiration. We tested the significance of sponge-enhanced mussel
   mortality by repeated sampling at several sites where both organisms
   were abundant in the upper St. Lawrence River and on an artificial reef
   in central Lake Erie. A small proportion (<10\%) of the dreissenid
   population at each site was overgrown by sponge. Mussel colonies that
   were completely overgrown for 1 or more months invariably contained a
   significantly greater proportion of dead mussels than local uncovered
   populations. Mussels that survived prolonged periods (4-6 months) of
   overgrowth suffered significant tissue weight losses. Laboratory
   experiments and field observations suggest that dreissenids are not able
   to colonize sponges; therefore, sponges should always dominate
   competitive overgrowth situations. The overall impact of sponges on
   dreissenid populations in the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence River system
   will probably be negligible because of the high rate of mussel
   recruitment and the environmental constraints on sponge growth; however,
   our results suggest that sponges may control mussel abundance locally.}},

Abstract = {{Investigated are PID-type controllers that use noncollocated sensory
   feedback for damping vibrations of elastic structures with high friction
   in the actuators. Based on a two-degree-of-freedom spring-mass system,
   it is demonstrated how the controllability of such systems can be
   considerably improved by feedback of noncollocated measurements.
   Friction in the actuators leads to undamped residual vibrations that
   cannot be controlled because the occurring forces do not suffice to
   overcome static friction. The boundaries of this uncontrollable domain
   are derived in the state space. A positive feedback of noncollocated
   sensory signals renders a stronger coupling of the motions of the
   actuators to structural deformations, resulting in a considerable
   reduction. of the amplitudes of uncontrollable vibrations. Additionally,
   steady state errors can be significantly reduced because higher
   controller gains can be realized. It is shown that the ti,ne behavior of
   the deformations of an elastic structure can be predicted in good
   approximation by a linear model that neglects friction if the proposed
   controller is used.}},

   treated. Twenty-six of these were suffering from recurrent disease;
   their tumors relapsed within 9 months (median) after treatment, The
   remaining 24 cases had a newly diagnosed tumor, and local
   radioimmunotherapy OUT) was given immediately after surgery and
   radiochemotherapy. All efforts were made to reduce the tumor before the
   infusion of the radiopharmaceutical, Therefore, 22 cases with relapsing
   glioma underwent additional debulking surgery, which led to total or
   subtotal removal of tumor in 9 of the patients. Altogether, 28 patients
   had intralesional RIT when the disease was minimal or microscopic,
   Conversely, 22 cases underwent local RIT with a tumor the diameter of
   which was >2 cm, In many cases, the infusions were repeated up to six
   times to achieve complete destruction of the neoplastic tissue. The
   local treatment did not give rise to systemic or to cerebral adverse
   effects, The labeled monoclonal antibodies, given directly in the site
   of the lesion, concentrated in very high amount in the neoplastic tissue
   and remained fixed in the target for a long period of time, For these
   reasons, the radiation dose to the tumor was remarkable (on average
   >30,000 cGy/cycle) and consequently led to promising results. The median
   survival was, in total, 20 months (18 in recurrent tumors and 23 in
   newly diagnosed lesions), Moreover, median survival was 17 months in
   patients with bulky tumors (both recurrent and newly diagnosed tumors)
   and 26 months in patients with minimal or microscopic disease, The
   median time to progression was 3 months in recurrent and 7 months in
   newly diagnosed gliomas, Finally, RIT produced 3 CRs (all in recurrent
   tumors), 6 PRs (4 in recurrent and 2 in newly diagnosed), and 11
   stabilizations of disease (4 in recurrent and 7 in newly diagnosed), In
   19 cases (13 recurrent and 6 newly diagnosed) the progression of tumor
   was recorded.
   Eleven patients (2 recurrent and 9 newly diagnosed) who were treated by
   RIT when their disease was minimal and nondetectable by radiological
   methods remained disease-free and were classified as NED, The overall
   response rate (NED plus CR plus PR) was 40\% (34.6\% recurrent and
   45.8\% newly diagnosed), These data provide evidence for the capability
   of this new therapeutic technique to achieve, in a significant number of
   cases, lasting control of malignant gliomas and suggest the opportunity
   to apply this treatment in an adjuvant setting.}},

   initial tests to determine the EPID response specific to compensator
   situations. The tests determined EPID response to variable patient SSDs,
   different gantry angles, positions of an inhomogeneity within a phantom,
   and the sensitivity variation of different parts of the imager. After
   these tests, we determined the attenuation functions relating EPID
   response to phantom thickness for various phantom materials. With these
   functions, we tested simple compensation situations to demonstrate that
   missing tissue compensators can both be designed and verified using
   EPIDs.}},

Abstract = {{New reductions of Schmidt plate measurements have been performed, using
   preliminary Hipparcos and Tycho data for the astrometric reference
   stars. The measurements reported here have been obtained with the
   MAMA(1) automatic measuring machine of the Centre d'Analyse des Images
   in Paris.
   The Hipparcos data considered, the `combined 30-month solution', or
   `H30', is a preliminary catalogue derived from the analysis of the first
   30 months of data (out of a total of 37 months), and represent the
   merging of the intermediate FAST and NDAC Consortia's sphere solutions.
   The Tycho data considered here, referred to as `T30d', are derived from
   the preliminary analysis of the first 30 months of Hipparcos star mapper
   data.
   The preliminary Hipparcos and Tycho data are of unprecedent accuracy,
   and have been used to show that the ultimate accuracy which can be
   obtained on positions derived from Schmidt plates measurements is about
   0.07 arcsec, compared with errors of at best 0.15 arcsec but more
   typically about 0.3 arcsec obtained on the basis of previously-available
   catalogues. The best accuracy is obtained using Tycho stars which,
   although of lower individual accuracy than the Hipparcos positions, are
   very numerous (the Tycho Catalogue will include about one million stars)
   and thus allow a very good modelling of Schmidt plate field distortions.
   This accuracy is attainable for plates taken at epochs close to the
   Hipparcos mid-mission epoch. Plans to determine accurate proper motions
   for Tycho Catalogue stars using Tycho positions and, for example,
   Astrographic Catalogue data, will allow an extension of this possibility
   to a much wider range of plate epochs.}},

Abstract = {{Calnexin is a resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that
   associates with nascent protein chains. Among the newly synthesized
   integral membrane proteins known to bind to calnexin is invariant chain
   (Ii), and Ii release from calnexin coincides with proper assembly with
   major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II heterodimers. Although
   calnexin association with several membrane glycoproteins depends on
   interactions involving N-linked glycans, we previously reported that a
   truncation mutant oi mouse Ii (mIi1-107) lacking both N-glycosylation
   sites was highly effective in associating with MHC class II heterodimers
   and escorting these dimers through the secretory pathway. This could
   indicate that calnexin, despite binding to both Ii and class II, is not
   necessary for the proper interaction of these proteins, or that in
   contrast to most membrane glycoproteins, the N-linked glycans of Ii are
   not critical to its interaction with this chaperone. To examine this
   issue, we have directly explored the binding of calnexin to both Ii
   truncation mutants lacking the typical sites of N-glycosylation or Ii
   produced in cells treated with tunicamycin to prevent glycan addition.
   These experiments revealed that either method of eliminating N-linked
   carbohydrates on Ii also inhibited association with calnexin. A
   lumenally truncated form of Ii (mIi1-131) that still has N-linked
   carbohydrates showed a decreased affinity for calnexin compared with
   intact Ii, however, indicating that calnexin-Ii binding is not
   determined solely by the sugar moieties. All forms of Ii lacking
   N-linked sugars and showing defective association with calnexin also had
   enhanced rates of preendosomal degradation. Despite this effect on
   degradation rate, tunicamycin treatment did not inhibit the association
   of class II with glycan-free Ii. These data support the view that
   calnexin is not an absolute requirement for the proper assembly of class
   II-Ii nonamers, but rather acts primarily to retain Ii in the ER and to
   inhibit its degradation. These two properties of calnexin-Ii interaction
   may help ensure that sufficient intact Ii is available for efficient
   inactivation of the binding sites of newly synthesized class II
   molecules, while limiting the ability of excess free Ii to alter the
   transport properties of the early endocytic pathway.}},

   other reference group. The deaf community is used as a case in point to
   illustrate the development and formation of a politically conscious and

   inequities in resource distribution on intergroup relations between deaf
   and nondeaf members of these two communities are analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical material from the psychoanalysis of a 6-year-old boy is
   presented which manifests the creation of an anal psychic world-a
   psychic world which is blatantly anal in content and characterised by
   the formal qualities of de-differentiation and interchangeability, which
   are linked to anal experience and the level of cognitive maturation
   typical during the anal phase. This case demonstrates the existence at
   an earlier developmental level of perverse qualities which have
   previously been identified in adults. In particular, similarities are
   noted with the fantasies of adult perverts and the Marquis de Sade.
   Psychodynamic antecedents which have previously been extrapolated from
   investigation of these adults are confirmed in statu nascendi in this
   child. Like adult perverts, this boy appears to have created his anal
   world to defend against acknowledgement of sexual and generational
   differences. His anal world play is conceptualised as an example of a

Abstract = {{Obesity has emerged as a major public health problem in the
   African-American community and its determinants are poorly understood,
   The purpose of this study was to examine familial patterns of the degree
   of heaviness and of regional fat deposits. Seven anthropometric
   measurements (height, weight, body mass index {[}BMI], waist and hip
   circumferences, waist-to-hip ratio and arm circumferences) were examined
   in a population sample of African-American nuclear families recruited
   from the Chicago area, Participants included 162 parent pairs and 114
   sets of siblings (a total of 295 sons and daughters), Adjustments to
   correct for the effect of age and sex were performed separately for
   parents and siblings and the residuals were transformed to normalized
   z-scores to calculate intraclass correlations between family members.
   With the exception of waist-to-hip ratio, all variables showed positive
   familial resemblance, although the degree and level of statistical
   significance varied by type of relationship, Significant familial
   resemblance was observed for peripheral fat deposit, as measured by hip
   and arm circumferences (range: 0.04 for spouse pairs to 0.42 for
   daughter pairs), and obesity, as measured by BMI (range: 0.12 for
   spouses to 0.33 for mother-daughter comparison), Significant sex and
   generation differences were observed for height and hip, We conclude
   that African Americans exhibit significant familial resemblance for
   stature, degree of heaviness and regional fat deposits, Understanding
   the relative contributions of shared genes and shared environmental
   factors to the observed familial patterns could yield important insights
   into the origins of obesity in this high risk population.}},

Abstract = {{We show how twister Hamiltonian methods, that were originally devised
   for solving the Lorentz force and geodesic equations in impulsive wave
   backgrounds when such waves are (limiting cases of) free fields, may be
   used in problems where the impulsive wave is generated by a source
   moving with the speed of light. The equations of motion are written in
   Hamiltonian form on the symplectic manifold of null twisters. Properties
   of the scattering transformation are examined, with particular emphasis
   on the asymptotic behaviour of the dynamics in the presence of
   long-range potentials.
   Certain sourced fields in Minkowski space are known to give rise to
   infrared-divergent one-photon states in QED. We calculate an explicit
   example of such a field using the twister description of fields with

Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of thin films may highly differ from those of
   chemically identical bulk materials. Their knowledge is of paramount
   importance for coatings manufacturers. In this paper, attention is paid
   on Young's modulus measurements of PVD magnetron sputtered thin films on
   metallic substrates. The method is based on the three-point bending test
   of partially coated stainless steel or titanium alloy substrates. After
   derivation of the corresponding equations, the method and its accuracy
   according to qualification tests are first described. Results are then
   presented for coatings as varied as C, W, Cr(C), and TiN with
   thicknesses spanning 0.5-10 mu m, and deposited under different
   sputtering conditions. It is first seen that the Young's modulus highly
   depends on the deposition parameters, varying from the bulk values down
   to the fourth of this value. In the case of reactive sputtering, the
   evolution of the modulus with the gas flow is also presented and a
   correlation with phases or microstructure is observed. It is finally
   concluded that this kind of test, owing to its simplicity and its
   reliability, may help on a scientific point of view towards
   understanding the influence of morphology on mechanical properties, and
   on a practical basis for ensuring a control quality reference when
   performed systematically after deposition. Some foreseen extensions of
   this work to adhesion measurements will be mentioned shortly.}},

   until intake had stabilized (3 days with less than 10\% variation across
   days). Rats were first administered saline or one of five doses of
   either cocaine (2.0-32 mg/kg, i.p.) or heroin (0.4-3.2 mg/kg, i.p.) 15
   min prior to milk access. The dose-response function for cocaine was
   then determined in combination with either 0.8 mg/kg or 1.6 mg/kg
   heroin. Both cocaine and heroin administered alone produced
   dose-dependent decreases in milk drinking. Combination with 0.8 mg/kg
   and 1.6 mg/kg heroin resulted in parallel shifts to the left in the
   cocaine dose-response function. Isobolographic analysis of these
   dose-response functions using ED(50) and ED(75) values revealed that the
   combinations of cocaine and heroin were dose-additive, except at the
   cocaine plus 1.6 mg/kg heroin combination, which was infra-additive.
   Redetermination of the cocaine-only and heroin-only dose-response
   functions revealed no significant difference from the first
   determination. To assess the effects of naltrexone on cocaine- and
   heroin-induced suppression of milk drinking, rats were first
   administered four doses of naltrexone (0.1-0.8 mg/kg, i.p., 15 min
   pretreatment). Then, naltrexone doses were combined with a dose of
   heroin or cocaine that suppressed milk drinking (3.2 and 16 mg/kg,
   respectively), Naltrexone alone produced modest, but not dose-related,
   suppression of milk drinking, and had no reliable effect on suppression
   of milk drinking produced by 16 mg/kg cocaine. In contrast, naltrexone
   dose-dependently blocked heroin-induced suppression of milk drinking
   and, at naltrexone doses that had no effect on milk drinking when
   administered alone, produced a parallel shift to the right in the heroin
   dose-response function. In vivo apparent pK(B) analyses revealed that
   naltrexone antagonism of heroin-induced suppression of milk drinking
   involved mu-opioid receptors. Taken together, these results suggest that
   the effects of cocaine and heroin on milk drinking are either
   dose-additive or infra-additive and that cocaine-induced suppression of
   milk drinking does not directly involve the mu-opioid receptor system.}},

Abstract = {{Three main factors constrain life, including health matters, on a small
   island: scale, isolation and access to finance and development. Island
   populations may have a restricted gene pool, with potential problems of
   inbreeding and/or minimal resistance to introduced diseases. Regarding
   health service provision, population mass can be insufficient for high
   order services to be provided, whilst isolation leads to high costs for
   on-island services and in taking patients to off-island facilities. This
   paper deals with these issues for islands at the extreme end of the
   continuua of scale and isolation by considering the mid-oceanic islands
   of the South Atlantic. In financial terms, the islands vary from the
   comfortable, potentially wealthy Falkland Islands, to aid-dependent St
   Helena. The effects of aid-dependency are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{It was proposed that the interaction between the constructs of emotion
   regulation and social interaction would predict social adaptation in
   preschoolers. Ninety-six 4-year-olds were observed in quartets of
   unfamiliar same-sex peers. Based on parent temperament ratings and
   observed free play behaviors, 68 children from the original sample were
   classified as: low social interaction, good emotion regulators; low
   social interaction, poor emotion regulators; high social interaction,
   good emotion regulators; high social interaction, poor emotion
   regulators; or average. The results indicated that the low social
   interaction children who were poor regulators displayed more wary and
   anxious behaviors during free play and other episodes, and were rated as
   having more internalizing problems than both the low social interaction
   children who were good regulators and the average group. The high social
   interaction children who were poor regulators were rated as having more
   externalizing problems than either the high social interaction children
   who were good regulators or the average group. Thus, it seems as if
   emotion dysregulation is associated with psychological maladaptation,
   but that this association is tempered by the degree to which children
   engage in social interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Low frequency {[}(300 kHz) results for the nonlinear dielectric effect
   (NDE)] (variation in electric permittivity of liquids induced by a
   strong, steady electric field) in a critical, binary solution have been
   obtained. Their comparison with NDE measurements for 9 and 6 MHz
   indicate that the appearance of a mean-field region near the critical
   consolute temperature (T-c) and the crossover to the nonclassical
   behavior remote from T-c could be associated not only with the degree of
   elongation of critical fluctuations but also with the time scale
   involved. This behavior is possibly due to the correlation between the
   relaxation time of critical fluctuations and the measurement frequency.
   The result obtained supplements the analysis given in Phys. Rev. E 48,

Abstract = {{The larger pine shoot beetle Tomicus piniperda, a native bark beetle of

   one Canadian province. The first natural area where Tomicus was found to
   be established was at the Indiana Dunes State Park, in northwestern
   Indiana near the Lake Michigan shoreline. Pine stands were surveyed for
   fallen shoots to determine the extent and range of shoot feeding in the
   park. Within the study area adult Tomicus fed on the shoots of all
   native pines (Pinus banksiana, P. resinosa, and P. strobus.) as well as
   the European species (P. sylvestris). More fallen shoots were collected
   from both P. resinosa and P. sylvestris than expected from their basal
   areas in the sampled stands. This contrasted with P. banksiana and P.
   strobus whose shoots were underrepresented relative to their basal
   areas. The relatively high numbers of fallen shoots found for P.
   resinosa suggests that red pines in the Great Lakes region will easily
   support populations of ir: piniperda.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of peroxisome proliferation is poorly understood. Candida
   boidinii is a methylotrophic yeast that undergoes rapid and massive
   peroxisome proliferation and serves as a good model system for this
   process, Pmp30A and Pmp30B (formerly designated Pmp31 and Pmp32,
   respectively) are two closely related proteins in a polyploid strain of
   this yeast that are strongly induced by diverse peroxisome proliferators
   such as methanol, oleate, and D-alanine. The function of these proteins
   is not understood. To study this issue, we used a recently described
   haploid strain (S2) of C. boidinii that can be manipulated genetically,
   We now report that strain S2 contains a single PMP30 gene very similar
   in sequence (greater than 93\% identity at the DNA level) to PMP30A and
   PMP30B. When PMP30 was disrupted, cell growth on methanol was greatly
   inhibited, and cells grown in both methanol and oleate had fewer,
   larger, and more spherical peroxisomes than wild-type cells, A similar
   phenotype was recently described for Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultured
   on oleate in which PMP27, which encodes a protein of related sequence
   that is important for peroxisome proliferation, was disrupted, To
   determine whether Pmp27 is a functional homolog of Pmp30, genetic
   complementation was performed, PMP30A was expressed in the PMP27
   disruptant of S. cerevisiae, and PMP27 was expressed in the PMP30
   disruptant of C. boidinii S2. Complementation, in terms of both cell
   growth and organelle size, shape, and number, was successful in both
   directions, although reversion to a wild-type phenotype was only partial
   for the PMP30 disruptant. We conclude that these proteins are functional
   homologs and that both Pmp30 and Pmp27 have a direct role in
   proliferation and organelle size rather than a role in a specific
   peroxisomal metabolic pathway of substrate utilization.}},

   diagnose preoperatively manifesting themselves usually by acute rupture.
   We report our experience in both diagnosis and surgical treatment of 3
   cases. The selective angiograph of the celiac tripod and of superior
   mesenteric artery, is an indispensable means able, not only to put
   forward a certain diagnosis, but also to supply precious notions on the
   possibilities of compensation on the side of the collateral circle and
   of consequence, to suggest operative tactics. Surgical management may
   range from the simple binding to the reconstruction of the hepatic
   arterial axis by means of prosthesis grafts and if possible to the
   simple excision and termino-terminal regraft.}},

Abstract = {{A major, abrupt, southward decline in elevation (similar to 800 m) with
   an accompanying increase in Bouguer gravity anomaly (similar to 80 mGal)
   crosses a seismically active region of southern Nevada at about 37
   degrees N. The steepness of the gravity gradient requires significant
   crustal density contrast, some of which is probably caused by the
   plutonic roots of voluminous Tertiary volcanism to the north, but the
   amplitude of the anomaly requires additional contrast within the mantle.
   The topographic step probably developed in mid-Miocene time, coincident
   with the arrival of the starting head of the Yellowstone thermal plume
   at the base of the lithosphere. A plausible combination of crustal and
   deep buoyancy sources, related to the heat and melt input of an
   anomalously hot asthenospheric source, is consistent with gravity,
   seismic, heat flow, and isotopic observations and explains the origin of
   the topographic step.}},

Abstract = {{The theoretical basis of Seyfarth's priority of access model of female
   cercopithecine grooming was critically examined and alternative models
   suggested. These models, named `engagement', `interference' and `rank
   difference', generated different predicted grooming distributions by
   assuming the operation of different constraints. These constraints were,
   respectively, the time available for grooming, active interference on
   the part of higher ranked animals and a depression of grooming relations
   as rank difference between animals grew. These priority of access models
   were compared with observed grooming patterns in two groups of
   free-ranging olive baboons, Papio cynocephalus anubis: one large, one
   small. The fit of these models was poor. An alternative method of
   examining the effects of rank on grooming behaviour using multiple
   regression was successful. In the small troop the rank of the groomee
   explained a significant amount of the variance in grooming whilst the
   rank distance between groomer and groomee did not. In the large troop
   the opposite effect was found. In the light of these results the merits
   of bottom-up modelling versus top-down description are discussed. The
   question of group Size in primates and its relationship to social
   complexity are addressed. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Conventional detection and demodulation rules are not ideally suited for
   use with discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based narrow-band interference
   suppression, if the DFT incorporates time-weighting to localize the
   interference spectrally. Detection rules which are adapted to the
   time-weighting are introduced here and shown to offer significant
   improvements in performance, but their implementation is complex. It is
   found that if a spectrally-contained orthogonal transform (SCOT) is
   employed in place of the windowed DFT however, the conventional
   detection rules have a level of performance comparable to that obtained
   with DFT based suppression and the adapted rules. In addition to
   yielding good interference localization, SCOTs benefit from the fact
   that they provide a Karhunen-Loeve like transform for each component of
   the observation. The primary focus of the paper is the application of
   interference suppression for the detection of the presence of covert
   signals; however, it is also demonstrated that SCOT based suppression is
   potentially better suited than DFT based suppression for data
   demodulation in commercial code-division multiple-access (CDMA) network

   isoforms of Fc gamma R become internalized and will recycle back to the
   cell surface. This mechanism may be important in signal transduction
   pathways. In this study we have shown that a particular type of Fc gamma
   R (CD32), which is normally expressed on the surface of B cells, can be
   detected by flow-cytometry within the cytoplasm of up to 90\% of normal

Abstract = {{Axonal branching patterns of single inspiratory (I) neurons of the
   nucleus retroambigualis (NRA) were studied electrophysiologically in cat
   phrenic nucleus (C4-C6). Experiments were performed on Nembutal
   anesthetized, artificially ventilated cats, and extracellular spikes of
   I neurons were recorded. The cervical spinal gray matter was
   microstimulated from dorsal to ventral sites at 100 mu m intervals with
   an intensity of 150-250 mu A using a glass insulated tungsten
   microelectrode. The stimulations were made at 1 mm intervals
   rostrocaudally along the spinal cord, and effective stimulating sites of
   antidromic activation in axonal collaterals were systematically mapped.
   I neurons examined (n = 8) descending contralaterally distributed
   multiple collaterals in the phrenic nucleus. These collaterals were
   found throughout the rostrocaudal phrenic nucleus. An I neuron (n = 1)
   descending ipsilaterally also distributed collaterals in the ipsilateral
   phrenic nucleus. Axonal collaterals in the contralateral phrenic nucleus
   occupied 44.2\% of the total length of the cervical spinal cord
   examined. To determine the detailed trajectory of collaterals in the
   cervical gray matter, microstimulation was performed in and around the
   collateral arborizations at the maximum intensity of 50 mu A. The
   descending stem axons could be localized in the lateral funiculus in
   four I neurons and in the ventral funiculus in one I neuron. I neurons
   distributed axonal collaterals within the phrenic nucleus. Some part of
   the collaterals ran to the medial region of the gray matter, re-crossed
   the midline under the central canal and reached the phrenic nucleus
   ipsilateral to the I neuron. Re-crossed collaterals arborized in the
   phrenic nucleus, but did not extend to the gray matter more lateral than
   the phrenic nucleus. Rostrocaudal extension of the re-crossed
   collaterals was found to be narrow.}},

Abstract = {{The electrochemical behaviors of cytochrome c at gold electrodes
   modified in solution containing the mixture of bis(4-pyridyl) disulfide
   and alkanethiol having various chain length were investigated. The redox
   peak currents of cytochrome c decreased with increasing the ratio of
   alkanethiol in the modification solution. The addition of alkanethiol
   with shorter chain was more effective for reducing the peak currents.
   These results suggest that the patched domains of pyridyl thiolate
   monolayer is formed in the case of alkanethiol with long chain being
   used, whereas a well-mixed monolayer is formed by using alkanethiol with
   short chain. The electrochemical behavior of Fe(CN)(6)(4-/3-) at the
   modified electrodes with mixed monolayer supported the above
   consideration. The comparison of the electrochemical behavior of
   cytochrome c and Fe(CN)(6)(4-/3-) showed that minimum domain size for
   achieving the electron transfer of cytochrome c was larger than that for
   Fe(CN)(6)(4-/3-).}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Pulse measurements on the silicon/electrolyte interface have been used
   to study space-charge layers and surface states on the (100) and (111)
   faces of silicon. The techniques used enable both the creation and study
   of space-charge layers at the semiconductor surface, ranging from
   large-depletion to strong-accumulation conditions. What is more
   important, they permit a straightforward separation of the different
   components of the induced charge at the silicon/electrolyte interface,
   so as to yield the variation of both the free-electron density in the
   space-charge layer and the density of occupied surface states with
   barrier height. The measured space-charge characteristics are in very
   good agreement with theory. The data in strong-accumulation layers
   indicate the presence of an insulating buffer layer (such as an oxide),
   1-2 monolayers thick. As to surface states, we find that for CP-4 etched
   silicon, a discrete distribution of shallow states exists, located 0.1
   eV on the (100) face and 0.14 eV on the (111) face below the
   conduction-band edge, with a total density of similar to 6 x 10(12)
   cm(-2). Furthermore, except for a very low continuous background, deeper
   surface states are absent over most of the energy gap. Addition of a
   minute amount of hydrofluoric acid to the indifferent electrolyte used
   reduces the density of the surface states by nearly two orders of
   magnitude. The distribution of the shallow states remains discrete but
   their energy position becomes somewhat deeper. It appears that Si-H
   bonds are formed at the Si/electrolyte interface, just as has been
   reported for the HF-treated free Si surface. It is very likely that the
   formation of such bonds leaves, on both types of surface, considerably
   fewer dangling bonds and hence considerably fewer surface states.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation of the thyroid gland to the Antarctic environment was studied
   in nine healthy euthyroid tropical men of the Sixth Indian Antarctic
   Expedition during 1 year of their residence at polar latitudes.
   Circulatory concentrations of thyroid hormones, total T-4 (TT4), total
   T-3 (TT3), free T-4 (FT4)), free T-3 (FT3), reverse T-3 (rT(3)),
   thyroxine binding globulin (TBG), T-3 uptake and thyroid stimulating
   hormone (TSH) were estimated in New Delhi and during the first week of
   each month of the stay in Antarctica. At the end of the Austral summer
   in March, the TT3 concentrations were found to be significantly lower (P
   < 0.01) compared to values recorded in New Delhi and showed a
   significant increase (P < 0.05) during the Austral winter in August. The
   mean TT3 concentrations from May to December were found to be
   significantly higher than the March or April values. Plasma TT4 and
   rT(3) concentrations tended to decline in March but remained unaltered
   during the entire period in Antarctica. The FT4, FT3, TBG and T-3 uptake
   did not show any appreciable change. Though, the TT3:TT4 ratio tended to
   decline in March and April suggesting decreased peripheral conversion of
   T-4 to T-3 as the possible mechanism for a decline in TT3 in March,
   physical exertion and prolonged exposure to extreme cold appeared to be
   the major contributory factors. The TSH concentration in March, April,
   November and December were found to be significantly higher than the New
   Delhi values. The morning as well as evening cortisol concentrations
   during the Austral winter were higher than the March values suggesting
   that cortisol rhythmicity was well maintained in Antarctica, albeit at a
   higher level. These observations indicated that the subtle changes in
   thyroid hormones during a prolonged stay at polar latitudes are related
   not only to the extreme cold but also to other factors such as physical
   activity, polar days and polar nights.}},

Abstract = {{Periaxin is a newly described protein that is expressed exclusively by
   myelinating Schwann cells. In developing nerves, periaxin is first
   detected as Schwann cells ensheathe axons, prior to the appearance of
   the proteins that characterize the myelin sheath. Periaxin is initially
   concentrated in the adaxonal membrane (apposing the axon) but, during
   development, as myelin sheaths mature, periaxin becomes predominately
   localized at the abaxonal Schwann cell membrane (apposing the basal
   lamina). In permanently axotomized adult nerves, periaxin is lost from
   the abaxonal and adaxonal membranes, becomes associated with
   degenerating myelin sheaths and is phagocytosed by macrophages. In
   crushed nerves, in which axons regenerate and are remyelinated, periaxin
   is first detected in the adaxonal membrane as Schwann cells ensheathe
   regenerating axons, but again prior to the appearance of other myelin
   proteins. Periaxin mRNA and protein levels change in parallel with those
   of other myelin-related genes after permanent axotomy and crush. These
   data demonstrate that periaxin is expressed by myelinating Schwann cells
   in a dynamic, developmentally regulated manner. The shift in
   localization of periaxin in the Schwann cell after completion of the
   spiralization phase of myelination suggests that periaxin participates
   in membrane-protein interactions that are required to stabilize the
   mature myelin sheath.}},

Abstract = {{Grain samples of two winter wheat cultivars have been harvested in
   different stages of maturity. For characterizing the
   Starch/Amylase-Complex the meals from these grains have been tested in a
   BRABENDER-Amylograph for their viscose properties by carrying out three
   types of amylograms: Amylogram I (Normal amylogram). Amylogram II
   (amylase inactivated), Amylogram III (amylase inactivated and protein
   hydrolized enzymatically).
   The following results have been obtained:
   1. If amylase is active (Normal amylogram respectively Amylogram I) the
   gelatinization maximum and the temperature maximum was found to be much
   lower in the earlier stages of grain development than in the full ripe
   grain.
   2. If amylase is inactivated (Amylogram II) the gelatinization maxima
   were found - as expected - to be much higher and even show higher values
   in the earlier than in the later stages of grain development.
   3. If amylase is inactivated and in addition protein is hydrolized
   (Amylogram III) the gelatinization maxima were found to be distinctly
   lower than in Amylogram II; nevertheless the temperature maxima are
   higher than in Amylogram II. The tendency for higher gelatinization
   maxima in the earlier stages of grain development is always the same.
   4. The beginning of the initial rise of viscosity shows differences in
   dependence on the ripening stage of the grain on the one hand and on
   amylase activity and protein hydrolize on the other hand. If protein is
   hydrolized the amylogram curve is another one and corresponds with the
   amylogram curve of pure wheat starch.}},

   quantified by measuring Ca-45(++) transport from lumen to blood in an
   intestinal segment (duodenum and 20 cm of the proximal jejunum) perfused
   by both intraluminal and vascular routes in anesthetized rats. When
   administered i.v. as bolus injections, N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester
   (L-NAME, 10 mg . kg(-1)), an inhibitor of NO biosynthesis, decreased
   calcium absorption with a concomitant increase in blood pressure and a
   decrease in mesenteric blood flow. Conversely, the nitrovasodilators
   3-morpholinosydnonimine (2 mg . kg(-1)) and
   S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (10 mu g . kg(-1)), which generate NO
   spontaneously, both increased calcium absorption with no change in
   mesenteric blood flow. When infused i.v., L-NAME (3 mg . hr(-1). kg(-1)
   for 40 min) induced a decrease in calcium absorption that was reversed
   by the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (1.5 mg . hr(-1). kg(-1) when
   infused for the last 20 min of the 40-min L-NAME infusion). Sodium
   nitroprusside infusion (1.5 mg hr(-1). kg(-1)) caused an increase in
   calcium absorption that was not reversed by L-NAME (3 and 30 mg .
   hr(-1). kg(-1)). The present findings suggest that NO is involved in
   basal calcium absorption in rat small intestine in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Nonstationary behavior in regional economies must be recognized and
   categorized before activity indicators can be properly used in analyses.
   The nonstationary behavior of gross product by one-digit industry and
   personal income from all of the 50 states is examined.  Tests to
   discriminate between stochastic and deterministic trends are pursued and
   the results indicate that the former dominate the latter.  State-nation
   linkages in the presence of stochastic trends are explored and it is
   shown that stable, long-term relationships between nonstationary state
   and national outputs are rare at both the industry and aggregate levels.}},

Abstract = {{Ten asymptomatic individuals who had experienced only limited CD4(+)
   cell loss after prolonged infection with HIV-1 were studied. These
   individuals had a mean CD4(+) cell count of 674 x 10(6) cells/L and a
   mean duration of infection of 8.5 years, Also included were 10
   asymptomatic HIV-1-infected individuals who, over a similar period of
   infection (7.5 years), had experienced a profound loss of CD4(+) cells
   (mean CD4(+) cell count, 54 x 10(6) cells/L). Proviral load was
   determined using a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction and was
   significantly lower in the subjects with slowly progressing infection
   (SPI) than in subjects with rapidly progressing infection (RPI) (4,000
   vs. 40,000 proviral copies/10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells; p =
   0.0089), Isolation of virus was attempted in all individuals but
   succeeded only in 6 of 10 individuals with SPI versus all 10 individuals
   with RPI. Four of six virus isolates obtained from individuals with SPI
   and 6 of 10 obtained from individuals with RPI were of the
   syncytia-inducing phenotype. We determined the neutralizing activity of
   serum against HIVMN, HIVIIIB, and the contemporaneous autologous isolate
   when available. Serum from individuals with SPI generally neutralized
   the contemporaneous isolate, whereas serum from individuals with RPI did
   not {[}geometric mean antibody titer (GMT), 45 vs, 3; p = 0.0047]. There
   was no difference in neutralizing ability against HIVMN (GMT,2,593 vs.
   2,263; p = 0.74) and only a small difference against HIVIIIB (GMT, 115
   vs. 50; p = 0.075). Our results indicate that individuals with SPI are
   characterized by an ability to neutralize their own HIV strain. In
   contrast, neutralizing activity against HIVMN and HIVIIIB did not
   distinguish individuals with SPI from individuals with RPI.}},

Abstract = {{Stereoselective radical cyclizations to the enamide double bond have
   excellent potential for utilization in alkaloid and related nitrogen
   heterocycle synthesis. Complete facial selectivity has been found for
   radical cyclizations of chiral substrates 1a --> 2, 7 --> 8, 11 --> 12 +
   13, 15 --> 16 + 17, and 19 --> 20. The stereoselectivity for reduction
   of the intermediate tertiary radicals with Bu(3)SnH correlates with
   product stability. For example, 7 gives cis-dihydro 8 with no trace of
   the trans-dihydro isomer 9, 3.6 kcal/mol less stable than 8. Radical
   cyclization of 11 gave a 1:1 mixture of the six-membered ring lactam 12
   and the spirocyclic lactam 13. Diastereomers 12 and 14 have near
   equivalent stabilities, but radical reduction from the beta-face is
   blocked by the presence of the adjacent benzyloxycarbonyl substituent.
   The formation of 20 from 19, by way of a disfavored 5-endo-trig
   cyclization pathway may have value as a model for synthesis of
   kopsinine-type alkaloids. The conversion of 8 to the functionalized
   hexahydrojulolidine 23 also is described.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the effect of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) on
   platelet-activating factor (PAF)induced alterations of the gastric
   microcirculation. In separate experiments using an ex vivo canine
   gastric segment, changes in vascular resistance, filtration, and
   circulating neutrophil counts were measured during intra-arterial
   infusion of PAF (0.12 to 150 nM = 6) alone and with SOD (10 U/ml, n =
   5). PAF produced dose-related increases in vascular resistance and
   filtration, SOD pretreatment attenuated changes in these measurements in
   response to 9 and 38 nM PAF. PAF also produced dose-related increases in
   the difference between arterial and venous neutrophil counts across the
   gastric segment. SOD significantly reduced this neutrophil flux at 0.5,
   2, 9, and 38 nM PAF. Our results suggest that PAF causes both mucosal
   ischemia due to increased vascular resistance and microvascular injury
   as evidenced by increased filtration, as well as enhanced neutrophil
   adhesion to the microvasculature. The protective effects of SOD suggest
   that these responses to PAF involve the generation of oxygen-derived
   free radicals. In addition, these responses to PAF appear to be
   dependent upon circulating neutrophils. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

   Amongst the agents that are effective in producing rodent liver tumours

   of these chemicals, such as dibenzo-p-dioxins and certain PCBs, have

   receptor binding appears crucial for their tumourigenic activity.
   Enzyme-altered foci in rat liver may serve as a sensitive means to

Abstract = {{After unilateral ablation of the avian cranial neural folds, the
   remaining neuroepithelial cells are able to replace the missing neural
   crest population (Scherson ct al., 1993), Here, we characterize the
   cellular and molecular nature of this regulative response by defining:
   (1) the time and location of neural crest cell production by the
   neuroepithelium; (2) rostrocaudal axial differences in the regulative
   response; and (3) the onset of expression of Slug, a transcription
   factor present in premigratory and migrating neural crest cells, Using
   DiI and HNK-1 antibody labeling techniques, we find that neural crest
   regeneration occurs only after apposition of the remaining
   neuroepithelium with the epidermis, suggesting that the developmental
   mechanism underlying regeneration of the neural crest may recapitulate
   initial generation of the neural crest, The regulative response occurs
   maximally at the 3-5 somite stage, and slowly declines thereafter,
   Surprisingly, there are profound regional differences in the
   regenerative ability, Whereas a robust regulation occurs in the caudal
   midbrain/hindbrain, the caudal forebrain/rostral midbrain regenerates
   neural crest to a much lesser extent, After neural fold removal in the
   hindbrain, regenerated neural crest cells migrate in a segmental pattern
   analogous to that seen in unablated embryos; a decrease in regulative
   response appears to occur with increasing depth of the ablation,
   Up-regulation of Slug appears to be an early response after
   ablation,,vith Slug transcripts detectable proximal to the ablated
   region 5-8 hours after surgery and prior to emergence of neural crest
   cells, Both bilateral and unilateral ablations yield substantial numbers
   of neural crest cells, though the former recover less rapidly and have
   greater deficits in neural crest-derived structures than the latter,
   These experiments demonstrate that the regulative ability of the cranial
   neuroepithelium to form neural crest depends on the time, location and
   extent of neural fold ablation.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the acute effects of dividing food intake into 3, 6, 9 or
   12 meals on postprandial glucose and insulin responses, 9 subjects with
   Type II diabetes were assigned in random order to four 12-hr observation
   periods after an overnight fast. They received identical isocaloric
   diets, except divided into 3, 6, 9 or 12 meals. Venous blood was
   obtained hourly throughout the observation period for plasma glucose:
   insulin, nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), triglyceride (TG), and
   glycerol concentrations. Meal frequency did not significantly affect the
   mean day-long concentration of plasma glucose. However: the incremental
   area under the glucose response curve (AUG) over the whole day was
   inversely related to the number of meals (r = -0.9955, p = 0.0045) with
   the AUC for 12 meals: 44.3 +/- 10.6 mmol . hr/l, being significantly
   less than for 3 meals, 60.8 +/- 11.7 mmol hm (p < 0.05). The reduction
   in plasma glucose AUC with increased meal frequency was significantly
   less in the 3 subjects treated with metformin than in the other 6
   subjects. Mean day-long plasma insulin concentration for 6 meals, 133
   +/- 27 pmol . hr/l, was less than that for 3 meals, 154 +/- 28 pmol .
   hr/l (p = 0.0062) with no further reduction for 12 meals (139 +/- 29
   pmol . hr/l). The NEFA, TG, and glycerol responses were similar for the
   four treatments. We conclude that increased meal frequency acutely
   flattened postprandial plasma glucose responses and reduced day-long
   plasma insulin concentrations. The long-term effects of increased meal
   frequency are not known. A meal frequency of 6 to 9 meals per day may
   warrant further long-term investigation in subjects with Type II
   diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{This essay considers decision-theoretic foundations for robust Bayesian
   statistics. We modify the approach of Ramsey, de Finetti, Savage and
   Anscombe and Aumann in giving axioms for a theory of robust preferences.
   We establish that preferences which satisfy axioms for robust
   preferences can be represented by a set of expected utilities. Tn the
   presence of two axioms relating to state-independent utility, robust
   preferences are represented by a set of probability/utility pairs, where
   the utilities are almost state-independent (in a sense which we make
   precise). Our goal is to focus on preference alone and to extract
   whatever probability and/or utility information is contained in the
   preference relation when that-is merely a partial order. This is in
   contrast,vith the usual approach to Bayesian robustness that begins with
   a class of `'priors'' or `'likelihoods,'' and a single loss function, in
   order to derive preferences from these probability/utility assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To study the short- and long-term outcomes in patients with
   Crohn's disease who have undergone strictureplasty.
   DESIGN: A retrospective review with a prospective follow-up (mean 54.4
   months {[}range from 4 to 108 months]).
   SETTING: The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centre at Mount Sinai Hospital
   in Toronto.
   PATIENTS: Forty-three patients (29 men, 14 women) who underwent 154
   strictureplasties for Crohn's disease. The mean age of the patients was
   32.5 years (range from 17 to 55 years).
   INTERVENTION: Strictureplasty by either the Heineke-Mikulicz (145
   strictureplasties) or the Finney (9 strictureplasties) technique in the
   duodenum, small intestine and at the site of the previous anastomosis.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Factors studied for symptomatic recurrence
   included the type of procedure previously performed, the type of
   strictureplasty, the number of previous operations and the site of the
   disease.
   RESULTS: There were no deaths. There was one documented leak. Twenty-six
   patients remained symptom free during the follow-up period. Fourteen
   patients required reoperation for progressive obstructive disease. None
   of the differences in the variables studied was statistically
   significant when related to the symptomatic recurrence rate. However,
   only 2 of 11 patients who had strictureplasty as the only procedure have
   required reoperation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Strictureplasty is a safe and useful procedure in the
   management of extensive obstructive Crohn's disease. Strictureplasty
   does not seem to alter the natural history of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{Study objective: To assess the usefulness of noninvasive nasal mask
   ventilation (NMV) in the treatment of an exacerbation of chronic
   respiratory insufficiency in patients stable enough to be admitted to a
   non-ICU ward.
   Design: A prospective study in which the beneficial effect of NMV was
   compared with conservative treatment.
   Setting: A ward of respiratory medicine of a tertiary-referral teaching
   hospital.
   Patients: The study group included 15 patients with acute respiratory
   acidosis. These patients had pH less than 7.35 and PaCO2 more than 60 mm
   Hg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths or less per minute, hemodynamic
   stability, and alertness and willingness of cooperation with the NMV
   treatment. The control group consisted of 16 patients who fulfilled the
   same arterial blood gas requirements, retrospectively selected from the
   discharge forms of the ward of respiratory medicine for the year 1993.
   Interventions: Patients underwent NMV for two sessions per day (one in
   the morning and one in the afternoon), each session lasting 4 h. A
   volumetric respirator (Monnal D; Taema; Paris, France) was used in four
   patients with restrictive disease. A positive-pressure ventilator (DP90;
   Taema; Paris, France) was used in 11 patients with obstructive disease.
   Control patients received standard medical, oxygen, and chest physical
   therapy.
   Results: As compared with pre-NMV values, mean pH was significantly
   higher at 4 h of NMV after the patient's ventilatory adaptation
   (t=8.814, p<0.001) and at the end of NMV (t=12.06, p<0.001). Ventilatory
   support also produced a significant improvement in hypercapnia (pre-NMV
   vs NMV after the patient's ventilatory adaptation, t=6.675, p<0.001;
   pre-NMV vs post-NMV, t=6.976, p<0.001). Posttreatment pH and PaCO2
   values mere significantly higher and lower, respectively, in NMV-treated
   patients than in controls. At the end of treatment, a significantly
   higher PaO2/FIo(2) ratio was documented in the study group than in
   controls (post-NMV vs posttreatment, t=2.846, p<0.01).
   Conclusions: NMV associated with standard treatment may be more
   beneficial than conservative treatment alone for improving blood gas
   exchange in patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency admitted to
   the hospital (but not the ICU) for an episode of acute decompensation
   and respiratory acidosis.}},

Abstract = {{The functionality and robustness of implicit (standard) FE codes are now
   such that, with sufficient skill and proper use, the technique can not
   only deepen present understanding of many mechanical and physical
   processes, but can also be used to simulate fairly complex forming
   problems such as rolling, bending, stretching, extrusion, deep drawing,
   bulging, complex asymmetric shaping, wire-drawing, etc. In this paper a
   number of examples are selected to demonstrate this flexibility and its
   application to teaching and to manufacturing generally. Further, by
   using the explicit codes the use of the method is extended to examine
   the collision of multiple rigid bodies during the collapse of a
   triangularly-packed stack of pipes, and the simulation of the successive
   collisions between pins during ten-pin bowling. Two problems are used to
   illustrate the use of the method for teaching: these are the multiple
   inversion of a solid toroidal ring and the behaviour of a rubber strip
   matrix reinforced by steel wire. In the case of the rubber strip, the
   reinforcing wires are arranged such that a direct force applied at one
   end in a direction parallel to the length of the strip and with the
   other end appropriately fixed, causes the strip to twist. This is a good
   example of how two isotropic materials can be combined together in such
   a way as to produce the load-deflection characteristics of an
   anisotropic material.
   Two simulations of manufacturing processes are presented also. Firstly,
   the quasi-static forming of an aluminium tube into a cylindrical-conical
   rigid die is described, whilst the second example is a simulation of the
   production of a spherical vessel by using a pressure pulse generated by
   an explosion to form a system of fabricated conical sections inscribed
   within a sphere.
   Finally the FE explicit code is used to examine at first the collapse of
   a triangularly-packed stack of pipes under gravity. The same technique
   and procedure is then adopted in the study of the multiple successive
   collisions ensued subsequent to the impact of a ball with a pin in a
   ten-pin bowling simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Antimicrobial susceptibility of 50 local isolates of Helicobacter pylori
   from patients with acid peptic diseases was investigated to commonly
   used antibiotics. The maximum resistance was (66\%) detected to
   metronidazole (MIG > 8 mu g/ml). The frequency of resistance to
   ampicillin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin was in the range of 20-28 per
   cent; least resistance was observed to tetracycline (10\%). The gradient
   disc diffusion method was found to give reproducible results and also
   correlated with agar dilution method for minimum inhibitory
   concentration (MIG). Study of the enzymatic activity of H. pylori
   isolates showed that all isolates had urease, catalase, oxidase,
   esterase-lipase, and naphthol-AS-beta-1-phosphohydrolase enzymes and
   were consistently negative for ten other enzymes tested. Majority of the
   Isolates expressed alkaline phosphatase (17/18), esterase (17/18) and
   acid phosphatase (14/18). The acid phosphatase had the maximum mean
   enzymatic activity, There was no difference in enzymatic activity
   between H. pylori isolates from ulcer and gastritis patients. H. pylori
   isolates could be typed into five biotypes. Type III was found to be
   more common (44.4\%). This study supports the existence of the strain
   variations among H. pylori on the basis of the enzymes profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of the boundary of the geographic distribution of gypsy moth,
   Lymantria dispar (L.), populations is important for monitoring and
   controlling the spread of this species in North America. In this study,
   gypsy moth population boundaries were estimated from male moths counts
   in pheromone-baited traps and from egg mass counts in a 5.18-million-ha
   area in northwestern Virginia and southeastern West Virginia. Population
   boundaries were estimated for 5 yr (1988-1992) and for different
   population density thresholds using the following 3 methods: (1) best
   classification (minimizing the number of grid cell misclassifications),
   (2) 1st occurrence method, and (3) logistic regression of log population
   counts versus distance perpendicular to population boundary. All 3
   methods generated similar boundaries for male moth counts, and
   boundaries obtained with the first 2 methods were most correlated. The
   regression method failed to estimate boundaries of egg mass populations
   because of their irregular spatial distribution. However, the 2 other
   methods were successful and yielded similar results. The average gypsy
   moth spread rate estimated using male counts was 10.7-11.9 km/yr. The
   minimum spread rate was 3.8-4.9 lan in 1991, and the maximum rate was
   19.4-22.6 lan in 1989.}},

Abstract = {{A RFLP map of Brassica napus, consisting of 277 loci arranged in 19
   linkage groups, was produced from genetic segregation in a combined
   population of 174 doubled-haploid microspore-derived lines. The
   integration of this map with a B. napus map derived from a resynthesized
   B. napus X oilseed rape cross allowed the 10 linkage groups of the B.
   napus A genome and the 9 linkage groups of the C genome to be
   identified. Collinear patterns of marker loci on different linkage
   groups suggested potential partial homoeologues. RFLP patterns
   consistent with aberrant chromosomes were observed in 9 of the 174
   doubled-haploid lines. At least 4 of these lines carried nonreciprocal,
   homoeologous translocations. These translocations were probably the
   result of homoeologous recombination in the amphidiploid genome of
   oilseed rape, suggesting that domesticated B. napus is unable to control
   chromosome pairing completely. Evidence for genome homogenization in
   oilseed rape is presented and its implications on genetic mapping in
   amphidiploid species is discussed. The level of polymorphism in the A
   genome was higher than that in the C genome and this might be a general
   property of oilseed rape crosses.}},

Abstract = {{Two reports have shown a Japanese preparation of botulinum toxin type F
   (BTX-F) to be an effective alternative for patients with torticollis who
   develop clinical resistance to botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A). A group
   of patients with torticollis, comprising five secondary non-responders
   and one primary nonresponder, were treated with a preparation of BTX-F
   produced in the UK (Speywood Pharmaceuticals). A low dose of BTX-F (220
   mouse units (MU) in total) was given into clinically affected neck
   muscles, followed six weeks later by an injection of a total of 520 MU.
   Antibodies to BTX-A (mouse protection assay) were present in all
   secondary non-responders but not in the primary non-responder. No
   patients developed atrophy after injection of Dysport BTX-A (40 MU) into
   the left extensor digitorum brevis muscle whereas pronounced atrophy
   occurred in all patients after injection of 40 MU of BTX-F into the
   right extensor digitorum brevis muscle. Three patients improved
   subjectively after treatment with 220 MU BTX-F and five (all secondary
   nonresponders) after the subsequent dose of 520 MU (two considerably),
   with reduced Tsui scores, but group scores were only significantly
   changed after the higher dose. The primary non-responder remained
   unchanged after both doses of BTX-F. One patient reported mild dysphagia
   with 520 MU BTX-F. Mean duration of improvement with 520 MU BTX-F was
   five (range 4-6)weeks. Thus BTX-F provides benefit for BTX-A
   non-responders with few side effects but for a shorter period than
   BTX-A, possibly due to relative underdosing. As with BTX-A, biological
   sensitivity to BTX-F does not necessarily predict a clinical response.}},

Abstract = {{The author has not attempted a complete exposition of the meaning of
   rings-which can refer to and symbolise many aspects of relationships
   with other human beings from `transitional objects' of early development
   (Winnicott) to all sorts of bonds of loyalty, friendship, and love in
   the life of the child and the adult. He stresses the meanings of the
   ring from the point of view of early narcissistic development-the `body
   ego' time of early development in which symbolism (in Freud's sense)
   develops. The clinical and literary examples therefore illustrate the
   use of rings as magical narcissistic symbols-part subject and part
   object-derived developmentally from the body ego and ultimately from the
   body sphincters. Endowed with these regressive primitive meanings, rings
   are felt to have magical powers that can either preserve or destroy, and
   that can control emotions in the self and in others In the course of
   ordinary or pathological narcissistic regressions, rings (consciously
   associated with many positive feelings and achievements) also partake,
   in so far as they are `Freudian' symbols, of qualities associated with
   developmentally early defensive mechanisms and modes of psychic
   functioning (projection, introjection; idealisation, devaluation). In
   the cases cited, rings seemed specifically associated with (and to
   symbolise)(1) sphincteric (largely anal) narcissistic defensiveness-the
   mind functioning as an emotional sphincteric counterpart primarily
   deadening and distancing affect but intermittently letting through
   primitive rage and primal polymorphous perverse sexual impulses.}},

Abstract = {{Fusobacterium nucleatum has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
   several diseases, including urinary tract infections, bacteremia,
   pericarditis, otitis media, and disorders of the oral cavity such as
   pulpal infections, alveolar bone abscesses, and periodontal disease, We
   have previously demonstrated that sonic extracts of F. nucleatum FDC 364
   were capable of inhibiting human T-cell responses to mitogens and
   antigens. In this study, we have further characterized this
   immunosuppressive protein (FIP) and initiated experiments to determine
   its mode of action, The purified FIP has an apparent molecular mass of
   90 to 100 kDa; sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
   indicates that the FIP is actually composed of two subunits with
   molecular masses of 48 and 44 kDa. Purified FIP retained its biological
   activity and was capable of inhibiting mitogen-induced proliferation of
   human T cells. Inhibition was dose dependent, and the FIP exhibited a
   specific activity approximately 250-fold greater than that of the crude
   extract, Cell cycle analysis indicates that FIP-treated cells were
   prevented from exiting the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle, However,
   FIP did not alter the expression of activation markers (CD69, CD25, and
   CD71) or interleukin-2 secretion, The latter observations suggest that
   the T cells did indeed become activated and had entered the G(1) phase
   of the cell cycle. Analysis of the expression of cyclins indicates that
   the phase of the cell cycle that is FIP sensitive resides somewhere
   beyond the restriction point of cyclin D2 (early to mid-G(1)) but prior
   to that of cyclins D3 and E (mid- to late G(1)). Finally, analysis of
   the expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen indicates that
   this is the earliest detectable defect in T cells exposed to FIP. We
   propose that if a block in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle occurs in
   vivo in lymphocytes, it may result in a state of local and/or systemic
   immunosuppression. These suppressive effects could alter the nature and
   consequences of host-parasite interactions, thereby enhancing the
   pathogenicity of F. nucleatum itself or that of some other opportunistic
   organisms.}},

   and Teshio (TS) in Hokkaido, northern Japan.
   Weighted mean races of H+ input as act deposition at TK and TS were
   estimated in che range from 0.3 to 1.0 and 0.4-0.6 kmol, ha(-1) y(-1),
   respectively. While the net H+ flux was reduced significantly by the
   forest canopy, net fluxes of other ions by throughfall, especially for
   Na+, Cl-, and SO42-, were apparently greater than those by
   precipitation. The canopy modification of the H+ flux was more
   remarkable under deciduous stands than under coniferous stands,
   suggesting that the efficiency of conifers as the collectors of dry
   deposition is greater than that of deciduous ones. More than 50\% of H+
   flux due to throughfall was absorbed by the organic horizons and the
   weighted mean pH of Lo al TK and TS was in the range from 4.9 to 5.5 and

Abstract = {{RS7, a murine IgG1 antibody raised against human lung carcinoma,

   RS7 has been demonstrated previously in animals bearing Calu-3 (an
   adenocarcinoma of the lung) xenografts, In this study, the efficiency of
   tumor targeting and the efficacy of therapy of this antibody in nude
   mice bearing the MDA-MB-468 human breast carcinoma were evaluated. The
   tumor:nontumor ratios of RS7 were 1.9-2.1 times higher than those for
   Ag8 (the control antibody) an day 14, except for the heart, These values
   were similar to that of RS7 in the Calu-3 xenograft model,
   Radioimmunotherapy using 250 mu Ci of I-131-labeled RS7 in animals
   bearing similar to 0.1 cm(3) tumors (similar to 10 days old) caused the

   Treatment that used 275 mu Ci of I-131-labeled RS7 in animals carrying
   established tumors (1 month old, similar to 0.2-0.3 cm(3)) showed that
   this antibody is effective in controlling the growth of this tumor.
   Tumors in the treatment group began to disappear between the second and
   third weeks after the injection of the radiolabeled antibody, Seven of
   10 animals remained tumor free at 15 weeks after the injection, Tumors
   in animals that received an equal dose of control antibody persisted but
   grew at a slower pace compared to the untreated group, No systemic
   toxicity was observed.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive bifurcation analysis of a low-order atmospheric

   codimension-2 saddle-node-Hopf bifurcation. The principal mechanisms

   are described and various routes to chaotic behavior are identified,
   such as the transition through the period doubling cascade, the
   breakdown of an invariant torus and homoclinic bifurcations of a
   saddle-focus. Non-trivial limit sets in the form of a chaotic attractor
   or a chaotic repeller are found in some parameter ranges. Their presence
   implies an enhanced unpredictability of the system for parameter values
   corresponding to the winter season.}},

Abstract = {{The involvement of ovine prolactin (oPRL), bovine growth hormone (bGH),
   and triiodothyronine (T-3) in otolith and scale calcification was
   examined using hypophysectomized goldfish Carassius auratus.
   Hypophysectomized fish received three intraperitoneal injections of
   either oPRL, bGH, or T-3 every other day, and were kept in water
   containing Ca-45 during the last 3 days. Otoliths (asterisci) and scales
   were dissected and the rate of calcium incorporation into these tissues
   was determined. Plasma calcium and sodium concentrations were also
   measured.
   Hypophysectomy resulted in hypocalcemia and hyponatremia, which were
   corrected by oPRL replacement therapy. T-3 was effective in correcting
   only the hypocalcemia. Therapy with bGH induced a further reduction in
   plasma calcium concentrations below the level of the hypophysectomized
   control. Calcium incorporation into otoliths and scales was also
   markedly reduced after hypophysectomy. oPRL was ineffective in stopping
   this reduction. T-3 corrected the reduction in scales, but not in
   otoliths. Therapy with bGH completely counteracted the reduction in
   otoliths and scales and even exceeded the respective sham levels. These
   results suggest that pituitary hormones, particularly GH, are relevant
   to otolith and scale calcification, possibly via matrix-related
   sequences.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrophilic bulky proteins with molecular weights larger than 60 kDa,
   such as catalase, beta-galactosidase, BSA and hemoglobin, can be easily
   solubilized into a micro water pool of AOT reverse micelles by the
   injection method. Those proteins and enzymes solubilized into reverse
   micelles maintain their activities and native structures, and can be
   back-extracted effectively to a new aqueous phase when the system pH is
   kept higher than their isoelectric points, pi, with low salt
   concentration, i.e. high water content. The back-extraction of
   hemoglobin is also partially achieved under these conditions. The
   efficiency of back-extraction is strongly influenced by the pH values in
   the feed protein solution and in the aqueous solution used for
   back-extraction, as well as KCI concentration in the solution. The pH
   values of both solutions should be higher than the protein pI together
   with high Wo or low salt concentration to preserve native structures and
   activities, since monomers and oligomers with relatively large molecular
   weight are likely to be denatured by association with ionic surfactant
   mediated by salt. In this case, both steric and electrostatic
   interactions between bulky proteins and micelles play dominant roles in
   the separation. By reducing interactions with micelles or surfactants,
   proteins solubilized in micelles can be effectively stabilized, and
   easily back-extracted to the aqueous phase without inactivation. The
   present method suggests an another way for the effective bioseparation
   of bulky proteins with high yields of activity.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of high-speed digital communications, e.g., optical
   fiber communications, smaller, faster, retiming devices are being
   required. The phase-locked loops (PLLs) are suited to an integration
   compared to surface acoustic wave (SAW) or liquid crystal (LC) passive
   filters. Therefore, PLLs have been put to use gradually as clock
   extraction devices in any frequency range over 100 MHz. The authors have
   developed the previously reported PLL with frequency difference detector
   (FDD) to provide a new function, which is useful to overcome the
   pseudo-lock problem in conventional retiming PLLs and also improved
   performance of the FDD. The proposed PLL has been constructed with
   ECL-IC, PLA and other discrete parts. It has been evaluated
   experimentally and the PLL designed with a 0.8-mu design-rule bipolar
   transistor has been evaluated by simulation to confirm the following
   characteristics.
   1. The PLL can detect an initial unlock state and pseudo-lock state
   within almost the same time as FDD sampling time and can recover
   rapidly.
   2. The jitter transfer function is almost equal to the usual first-order
   PLL and is independent of input data patterns.
   3. The FDD frequency detecting range, corresponding to the PLL lock-in
   range, is more than four times that of the previously proposed FDD-PLL.}},

Abstract = {{With the growing demand for high-speed transmission of digital data,
   there is a challenge for utilizing the existing copper plant as the
   transmission medium, especially for short-hop links. This medium offers
   a lower cost to a fiber medium, but requires more sophisticated
   electronics to account for electromagnetic emissions, cross-talk, and
   cable loss. These include pulse shaping filters, cross-talk cancelers,
   and equalizers. To maintain system cost at a minimum, analog solutions
   are preferred. In this paper a continuous-time tunable biquad
   implemented in a 0.8 mu m BiCMOS process and configured as an adaptive
   pulse-shaping filter is described. The biquad is tunable over the range
   10-230 MHz with variable Q factors. It is composed of five
   transconductance-C integrators each dissipating a static power of 10 mW
   at 5 V. A method for adapting the filter's pole-frequency and Q-factor

Abstract = {{T cells can be divided into two groups on the basis of the expression of
   either alpha beta or gamma delta T-cell receptors (TCRs), Because the
   TCR delta chain Locus lies within the larger TCR alpha chain locus,
   control of the utilization of these two receptors is important in T-cell
   development, specifically for determination of T-cell type:
   rearrangement of the a locus results in deletion of the delta coding
   segments and commitment to the alpha beta lineage. In the developing
   thymus, a relative site-specific recombination occurs by which the TCR
   delta chain gene segments are deleted. This deletion removes all D
   delta, J delta, and C delta genes and occurs on both alleles, This delta
   deletional mechanism is evolutionarily conserved between mice and
   humans. Transgenic mice which contain the human delta deleting elements
   and as much internal TCR delta chain coding sequence as possible without
   allowing the formation of a complete delta chain gene were developed,
   Several transgenic lines showing recombinations between deleting
   elements within the transgene were developed. These lines demonstrate
   that utilization of the delta deleting elements occurs in cup T cells of
   the spleen and thymus. These recombinations are rare in the gamma delta
   population, indicating that the machinery for utilization of delta
   deleting elements is functional in alpha beta T cells but absent in
   gamma delta T cells. Furthermore, a discrete population of early
   thymocytes containing delta deleting element recombinations but not V
   alpha-to-J alpha rearrangements has been identified. These data are
   consistent with a model in which delta deletion contributes to the
   implementation of a signal by which the TCR or chain locus is rearranged
   and expressed and thus becomes an alpha beta T cell.}},

Abstract = {{Deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and spin-lattice
   relaxation times (T-1) are used to investigate the dynamics of the guest
   molecule, acetone, in tris(5-acetyl-3-thienyl)methane (TATM) and
   cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) inclusion compounds. C-13 CPMAS powder NMR
   spectra were obtained for each clathrate, to verify inclusion. In
   acetone: TATM, the guest molecule is undergoing twofold reorientation
   about the CO bond, exchanging the two methyl groups. An activation
   energy of 20.8 (+/- 1.4) kJ/mol, for the two-site jump motion, was
   found, independently, from deuterium NMR spectra and T-1 measurements.
   Acetone in CTV performs the same type of motion as acetone in TATM.
   Activation energies of 25.0 (+/- 3.2) kJ/mol and 24.1 (+/- 0.5) kJ/mol
   were determined using the same two techniques. In both inclusion
   compounds, the rate of methyl rotation within the acetone molecule is
   greater than 10(8) Hz even at the lowest temperature measured (84 K).
   Analytical expressions for the spin-lattice relaxation time (T-1), for a
   twofold jump, were derived. Calculated values of the effective
   quadrupolar coupling constant and T-1min for the guests agree very well
   with the experimental data. The 84 K spectrum of acetone:TATM
   unexpectedly shows some asymmetry, the origin of which is discussed.
   Finally, these two clathrates are compared to the recently examined
   acetone:tri-ortho-thymotide inclusion compound.}},

Abstract = {{Two distinct backscatter regimes are seen on a European remote sensing
   satellite ERS-1 C-band (5.6 cm) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image of
   the sea surface during a time of fair synoptic-scale weather conditions.
   One backscatter regime is mottled. In contrast to that, the second
   backscatter regime is marbled.
   The authors hypothesize that the mottled backscatter pattern is a
   characteristic SAR backscatter pattern linked to the presence of the
   convective (i.e., statically unstable/convective-eddy containing) marine
   atmospheric boundary layer (CMABL) and can be used to help determine
   CMABL structure {[}convective-eddy type (cellular convection versus
   longitudinal rolls), eddy wavelength, and CMABL depth (via mixed-layer
   similarity theory for aspect ratio)]. The hypothesis linking the
   presence and structure of the CMABL to the mottled backscatter pattern
   on SAR imagery is validated by analyzing data from a number of sources
   gathered in the vicinity of the boundary between the mottled and marbled
   regimes on the SAR image.}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed the occupational interests and academic skills of 50
   patients of a center for addiction and pregnancy. Patient ratings of 31
   occupations showed that a subset of ten occupations (telephone operator,
   cosmetologist, mail clerk, data entry operator, child care worker,
   receptionist, office clerk, word processor, billing clerk, secretary)
   were of interest to significantly more subjects than other occupations
   (P less than or equal to 0.05). Most of the desired occupations were
   office jobs requiring basic skills not possessed by most study
   participants. Although participants had completed a mean (range) of 11
   (8-15) years of education, their mean (range) grade levels of reading,
   spelling and arithmetic were estimated at 6.9 (0.8-12), 6.8 (1-12), and
   5.7 (2-11.8) years, respectively. These data suggest that the study
   participants will need basic skills training to achieve their
   occupational goals. Importantly, patient ratings also indicated that
   most participants were interested in receiving the needed training.
   Overall, the study suggests that provision of basic academic skills
   training may improve the long-term employment outcomes of these drug
   abusing women.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In view of the rapid increase in the prevalence of coronary
   artery disease (CAD) in developing countries, our aim was to determine
   the prevalence of CAD and its risk factors and lifestyle factors in an
   elderly population from north India.
   Methods: A random sample of 595 elderly subjects between 50 to 84 years
   of age was obtained from the urban population of Moradabad. The response
   rate was 90.1\%. The survey methods included a questionnaire containing
   information on 7-day food intake, other lifestyle factors, Rose
   questionnaire for diagnosis of angina pectoris, a standard 12-lead
   electrocardiogram, blood pressure measurements and blood examination.
   Results: The total prevalence of CAD based on clinical history and
   electrocardiogram was 121/1000 (95\% Cl 72 to 165). The prevalence rate
   was slightly higher in males (130/1000) than in females (110/1000). The
   prevalence of CAD based on the Rose questionnaire was 57/1000 and based
   on electrocardiogram in 561 asymptomatic subjects was 67/1000. CAD was
   significantly higher in the elderly (65 to 84 years) group than in the
   middle-aged (50 to 64 years) group (168 vs. 97 per 1000), respectively.
   While the prevalence of hypertension was significantly higher in the
   elderly than middle-aged group respectively (214 vs. 168 per 1000), the
   prevalence of central obesity was significantly higher in the
   middle-aged than elderly group (674 vs. 632 per 1000). Other risk
   factors including smoking were comparable in the two subgroups.
   Prevalence of major risk factors and central obesity were significantly
   higher among patients with CAD than in the rest of the subjects.
   Prevalence of CAD was significantly higher in the middle and higher
   socio-economic groups compared to the lower income group. These higher
   income groups were also eating significantly higher amounts of visible
   fat and had a higher prevalence of physical inactivity (93.3\%) compared
   to the lower income group.
   Conclusions: CAD and its risk factors such as hypertension,
   hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and central obesity are of sufficient
   magnitude in the elderly population of India to be a major public health
   problem. The findings also indicate that CAD is more commonly associated
   with middle and higher socio-economic status which may be due to greater
   consumption of dietary fat and more sedentariness compared to lower
   socioeconomic groups.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To understand the characteristics and physiological sexual
   responses of women with spinal cord injuries (SCI) during orgasm.
   Design: Controlled laboratory-based analysis of women's physiological
   and subjective responses during a single session in which they attempted
   to perform stimulation to orgasm.
   Setting: The sexual physiology laboratory at our free-standing
   rehabilitation hospital.
   Participants: A volunteer sample of 25 women with SCI and 10 able-bodied
   control subjects, matched for age.
   Intervention: A 75-minute protocol designed to obtain information on the
   physiological events accompanying orgasm.
   Dependent Variables: Included vaginal pulse amplitude, heart rate,
   respiration rate, blood pressure, subjective arousal and subscores on
   the Derogatis Sexual Functioning Inventory (DSn>.
   Results: Data were analyzed both within and across neurological groups:
   complete SCI, incomplete SCI, and able-bodied controls, All able-bodied
   subjects achieved orgasm whereas 52\% of SCI subjects achieved orgasm.
   Degree and type of SCI did not significantly relate to subjects' ability
   to achieve orgasm. Subjects with no lower extremity function took
   significantly longer than able-bodied subjects to achieve orgasm.
   Differences between baseline and orgasm readings are described for each
   of the major physiological measures. Results of DSFI revealed that
   able-bodied subjects acknowledged greater sexual satisfaction than SCI
   subjects. Subjects who achieved orgasm scored higher on sexual
   information and sex drive.
   Conclusion: Results support previous self-report studies, in that a
   large percentage of SCI women achieved orgasm regardless of pattern or
   degree of neurological injury. No consistent characteristics were
   identified that would allow prediction of which women with SCI would be
   able to experience orgasm. However, subjects who achieved orgasms had a
   higher sex drive and greater sexual knowledge. Implications for sex
   therapy treatment programs with spinal cord injured women are discussed.

Abstract = {{This study is a replication and extension in Canada of a previous study
   in the United States in which toxicologists and members of the public
   were surveyed to determine their attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions
   regarding risks from chemicals. This study of `'intuitive vs. scientific
   toxicology'' was motivated by the premise that different assumptions,
   conceptions, and values underlie much of the discrepancy between expert
   and lay views of chemical risks. The results showed that Canadian
   toxicologists had far lower perceptions of risk and more favorable
   attitudes toward chemicals than did the Canadian public. The public's
   attitudes were quite negative and showed the same lack of dose-response
   sensitivity found in the earlier U.S. study. Both the public and the
   toxicologists lacked confidence in the value of animal studies for
   predicting human health risks. However, the public had great confidence
   in the validity of animal studies that found evidence of
   carcinogenicity, whereas such evidence was not considered highly
   predictive of human health risk by many toxicologists. Technical
   judgments of toxicologists were found to be associated with factors such
   as affiliation, gender, and worldviews. Implications of these data for
   risk communication are briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The possible causal association of human papilloma virus (HPV) with
   transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder in Israeli
   Jewish patients was assessed. One hundred and ten histopathological TCC
   sections were examined by peroxidase anti-peroxidase (PAP) method. HPV
   capsid antigen was demonstrated in 19 out of 110 cases (17.3\%). HPV-DNA
   sequences, determined by in situ DNA-DNA hybridization at high
   stringency wash were present in 24 cases (21.8\%): 16 (14.5\%) cases
   proved to be HPV6/11 and 8 (7.3\%) were HPV 16/18 positive. Four (3.6\%)
   of the HPV 6/11 positive specimens cross hybridized with HPV 31/33/35 at
   low stringency conditions. Sixteen samples known to be positive by in
   situ hybridization were reconfirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
   When the PCR was performed on the 43 negative cases, an additional
   4(9.3\%) HPV positive cases were revealed: two proved to be HPV 6/11 and
   two HPV 16/18. Comparison of the different methods for HPV detection in
   59 TCC histopathological samples, showed good correlation; an overall
   positivity of 33.9\% by PCR, 27.1\% by in situ hybridization and 25.4\%
   by PAP was observed. Forty one samples from nontumoral material of the
   bladder or post mortem specimens served as controls and 4.8\% HPV DNA
   was present in only two cases: one HPV 6/11 and one 16/18. Hence, HPV in
   TCC of the bladder is detected at a relatively high frequency and might
   be involved in the pathogenesis of this tumor among Jewish population in
   Israel.}},

Abstract = {{Alfven waves with periods from < 1 to > 10 hours are shown to be
   continuously present in the sun's south and north polar regions. Below
   approximate to 30 degrees latitude, as revealed by the rapid traversal
   of the equatorial region by Ulysses, the wave power averaged over a
   solar rotation decreases abruptly. The correlations between magnetic
   field and solar wind velocity fluctuations, upon which the wave
   identification is based, indicate outward propagation in both
   hemispheres. The Ulysses observations are consistent with many of the
   properties of Alfven waves seen in the ecliptic in association with high
   speed streams. Some implications of the waves in the polar regions are
   explored. Because of the long wavelengths, which reach approximate to
   0.3AU, the waves resonate with 10-10(3)MeV/nucIeon galactic cosmic rays
   and oppose their entry into the polar caps. The wave amplitudes imply a
   contribution to the acceleration of the high latitude wind due to
   momentum transfer of only a few percent.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides the first evidence that treatment of human
   pancreatic adenocarcinoma is markedly improved by the intratumoral
   administration of chemotherapeutic agents in a novel drug delivery
   system. The effect of chemotherapeutic agents delivered in a
   sustained-release, protein-based, injectable gel was evaluated on the
   growth of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line, BxPC-3, In vitro
   chemosensitivity of BxPC-3 cells exposed for 24 or 72 h to fluorouracil
   (0.01-5 mM), cisplatin or doxorubicin (0.1-50 mu M) and floxuridine,
   vinblastine, mitomycin or paclitaxel (1.0-100 mu M) was compared with
   that of untreated cells. In vitro chemosensitivity was also studied with
   fluorouracil and mitomycin in the poorly differentiated PANC-1, human
   pancreatic cancer cell line. Survival was determined after 7-10 days.
   All drugs decreased cell growth in a dose-dependent fashion. The
   efficacy of fluorouracil, cisplatin and doxorubicin increased with
   prolonged exposure, rendering these drugs most appropriate for a
   sustained-release preparation. For in vivo studies, athymic nude mice
   bearing BxPC-3 xenografts were treated either with fluorouracil,
   cisplatin or doxorubicin in the therapeutic injectable gel containing
   epinephrine or with vehicle alone administered intratumorally on days 1
   and 4, After 28 days, the mice were sacrificed and tumors dissected and
   weighed. Tumors in mice treated with the injectable gel decreased in
   size by 72-79\% compared with tumors in untreated controls and tumors
   treated with vehicle alone. Intratumoral injection of drug solution and
   intraperitoneal injection of drug in the injectable gel did not change
   tumor size compared with controls. In a drug-retention study, mice were
   injected intratumorally with {[}H-3]fluorouracil either in the
   injectable gel or in solution, Sustained radioactivity was observed in
   tumors injected with the gel, and, conversely, greater radioactivity was
   detected In the liver and kidneys in mice receiving the radiolabeled
   solution. hese results suggest that the therapeutic injectable gel
   chemotherapy, when given intratumorally, may improve tumor response with
   less systemic toxicity in comparison with conventional systemic
   chemotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{Based on a longitudinal survey performed in 1982-1983, a vector control
   strategy was implemented from 1985 onwards in a malarial-dense area of
   Burundi. One annual round of indoor spraying with malathion greatly
   reduced both the parasite load and the parasite rate in the population
   until 1989. However, from 1990 to 1993, a progressive resurgence of
   malaria was observed in most villages. For the present study, two
   villages were selected on the basis of their differential response to
   house spraying. In the village of Mulira surrounded by rice fields, the
   excellent results observed in the past have been followed by recent
   increases in parasite rates. In the village of Murengeza, also located
   in the rice growing area but near a river, the spraying had less impact.
   The inoculation rate was found to be similar in both villages, but the
   transmission peak occurred at the end of April in Mulira, and two months
   earlier in Murengeza. Indoor spraying with lambda-cyhalothrin was
   carried out on 26 April 1993, one month too late according to the
   strategy intended. As no sporozoite mosquitoes were observed during the
   six months following spraying, this strategy should be maintained but,
   in villages near rivers, the application should commence much earlier,
   in mid-January. Anopheles gambiae Giles sensu stricto (Diptera:
   Culicidae) and A. funestus Giles were found to be very endophilic
   species, whereas the dominant A. arabiensis Patton was highly exophilic.
   Therefore it is recommended that treatments should not only be applied
   to human dwellings but also to other structures such as animal sheds,
   kitchens, etc, shown by earlier studies to be resting sites of A.
   arabiensis. This study underlines the need for regular reassessment in
   vector control programmes.}},

   those highly uncertain parameters are necessary. The adjustments are
   discussed, and thereby also the question what might be regarded as good
   modelling-ethics. So is also the question; how to calibrate models with
   data which contain errors. In addition challenges related to the use of
   NuCM on this type of data are discussed. Model complexity (here number
   of parameters) is usually highly related to the amount of data available
   for the specific site the model was developed for. This study
   illustrates the uncertainty which appears when complex models are
   applied in studies with less extensive parameter collection.}},

Abstract = {{In closed-chamber fumigation experiments dry matter partitioning and
   chlorophyll fluorescence of wheat were studied, analysing the effects of
   ozone during different stages of plant development. Ozone causes
   enhanced leaf senescence, leading to a loss of green leaf area and,
   consequently to a decreased supply of assimilates, affecting (in
   increasing order of severeness) stem, ear and grain productivity because
   of reduced storage pools for translocation. Leaves of plants before
   shooting stage were most sensitive but the lack of green leaf area after
   ear emergence had the most pronounced effects on grain yield.
   Measurements of photochemical capacity showed that evidence for negative
   ozone effects could be found in changes of chlorophyll fluorescence
   parameters in leaf sections not yet showing visible ozone injury.
   Negative effects on photosynthesis were more distinct with increasing
   accumulated ozone dose, with increasing age of leaf tissue and with
   increasing ozone sensitivity of the cultivar. The changes in chlorophyll
   fluorescence are most likely to be explained by a decreased pool size of
   plastoquinones caused by ozone.}},

Abstract = {{Pattern reversal visual evoked potentials were recorded from 31 subjects
   who were occupationally exposed to lead and 54 non-exposed controls. No
   significant effects of lead were observed in the general subject
   population. However, when only non-smokers (17 lead-exposed and 27
   controls) were evaluated, significant effects were found. The P100, but
   not the N75, latency was significantly prolonged in the lead-exposed
   group, and this correlated with both blood lead level and age.
   Nevertheless, both the N75 and P100 latencies correlated with the
   concentration of delta-aminolevulinic acid (delta-ALA) in urine and age.
   This, at least in part, could be due to elevated delta-ALA levels
   competing at gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor neurons. This is
   consistent with the fact that GABA receptor neurons are involved along
   the entire length of the visual pathway. The results indicate that lead
   affects neural function even at permitted levels of exposure, and that
   this level should be reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Some peculiarities in the motion of retrograde satellites of Jupiter

   approximated solution of differential equations before transformation by
   the Zeipel's method. These orbits are non-keplerian ellipses. For their
   construction the secular motion of nodes, perijoves, and essential
   periodic perturbations were taken into account.
   The eccentricities and inclinations of all the retrograte satellites
   change in a large range. The motion may happen in a region, which is
   located very near to the limit cases of our theory. For some satellites
   the sign of the constant, which characterizes the type of orbit,
   librating or circular, may change. In some cases the value of this
   constant may be close to zero. Then the motion of the longitude of
   perijove will reduce the speed and in some moment the circular orbit may
   change its direction.}},

   Materials and Methods: Patients received 50 mg. bicalutamide daily in an
   open label multicenter North American trial.
   Results: The objective response rate (modified European Organization for
   Research in Cancer Therapy criteria) was 70\%. Of 150 patients 59 (39\%)
   met prostate specific antigen criteria for partial response, and 88
   (59\%) reached treatment failure end points and withdrew. Extent of
   disease was a significant predictor of response but baseline
   testosterone was not. Breast pain and gynecomastia developed in 76\% and
   60\% of patients, respectively. Mean drug plasma concentration was 8,528
   +/- 2,928 ng./ml.
   Conclusions: Bicalutamide (50 mg.) daily was well tolerated and
   efficacious, However, suboptimal effects on prostate specific antigen
   have led to additional trials to evaluate monotherapy at higher doses.}},

   failures and degradations. We compare the single source DF performance
   of this ARBF neural network, whose internal weights are computed using a
   modified gradient descent algorithm, with another radial basis function
   network, Linnet, whose weights are calculated using linear algebra. Both
   networks are compared to a traditional DF approach using monopulse.}},

   (R = CH(2)COOMe (4a), t-Bu (4b), Ph (4c), CH2CH2NC4H8O (4d)) with H(3)1.
   The crystal structure of complex 4b has been determined. 4b crystallizes
   with one molecule of CH2Cl2 per formula unit. Crystals of 4b . CH2Cl2,

Abstract = {{Contemporary dataflow analysis frameworks based on sparse evaluation
   techniques demand fast computation of program points where data flow
   information must be merged, the so-called phi-nodes. The original
   algorithm for computing phi-nodes has a worst-case quadratic time
   complexity. More recently, Cytron and Ferrante improved the worst-case
   behaviour of the original algorithm to O(E x alpha(E)), where E is the
   number of edges in the flowgraph, and alpha() is the slowly growing
   inverse-Ackermann function. The problem of finding an algorithm for
   computing phi-nodes for arbitrary sparse evaluation graphs in linear
   time remains open.(1) In this paper, we present an algorithm for
   computing phi-nodes that runs in linear time. This allows construction
   of a single sparse evaluation graph (SEG) in time O(E), based on which a
   wide range of dataflow problems raised in optimizing compilers can be
   solved. Furthermore, the algorithm is surprisingly simple. A novel
   program presentation is employed, called the DJ graph, by augmenting the
   dominator tree of a flowgraph with edges which may lead to a potential
   `merge' of dataflow information. In searching for phi-nodes an edge in
   the DJ-graph is never visited more than once.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal behavior of round and wagtail dancing honeybees (Apis
   mellifera carnica) gathering sucrose solutions of concentrations between
   0.5 and 2 mol . l(-1) was investigated under field conditions by
   infrared thermography (30-506 m flight distance). During the stay inside
   the hive thoracic surface temperature ranged from 31.4 to 43.9 degrees
   C. In both round and wagtail dancing honeybees the concentration of
   sucrose in the food influenced dancing temperature in a non-linear way.
   Average dancing temperature was 37.9 degrees C in foragers gathering a
   0.5 mol . l(-1) sucrose solution, 40.1 degrees C with a 1 mol . l(-1),
   40.6 degrees C with a 1.5 mol . l(-1) and 40.7 degrees C with a 2 mol .
   l(-1) solution. The variability of thoracic temperature was highest with
   the 0.5 mol . l(-1) and lowest with the 1.5 and 2 mol . l(-1)
   concentrations. Thoracic temperatures during trophallactic contact with
   hive bees were similar to dancing temperature at 1.5 mol . l(-1) but
   lower at the other concentrations. During periods of distribution of
   food to hive bees (trophallactic contact >2.5 s) the dancers' thorax
   cooled down by more than 0.5 degrees C considerably more frequently with
   the 0.5 mol . l(-1) solution (65\% of cases) than with the 1.5 mol .
   l(-1) solution (26\%). By contrast, heating the thorax up by more than
   0.5 degrees C was infrequent with the 0.5 mol . l(-1) solution (2\%) but
   occurred at a maximum rate of 26\% with the 1.5 mol . l(-1) solution.
   Bees gathering the 1 or 2 mol . l(-1) solutions showed intermediate
   behavior. Linear model analysis showed that at higher concentrations the
   dancers compensated better for variations of hive air temperature: per 1
   degrees C increase of hive temperature dancing temperature increased by
   0.34, 0.22, 0.12, and 0.13 degrees C with 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mol . l(-1)
   sucrose solutions, respectively. The results furnish evidence that
   dancing honeybees follow a strategy of `'selective heterothermy'' by
   tuning their thermal behavior to the needs of the behavior performed at
   the moment. Thoracic temperature is regulated to a high level and more
   accurately when fast exploitation of profitable food sources is
   recommended. Thoracic temperature is lowered when the ratio of gain to
   costs of foraging becomes more unfavorable.}},

Abstract = {{Even today, leprosy is a relatively frequently occurring disease,
   especially in tropical regions of the world. From the eleventh to
   thirteenth century, leprosy pandemics affected Europe, including
   Croatia. Probably as a consequence of such history, one can still find
   endemic foci of leprosy in present-day Croatia.
   The aim of this study was to analyse all cases of leprosy registered in
   Croatia during the twentieth century; therefore, we studied thoroughly
   existing medical documentation and published reports on sporadic leprosy
   cases, and went on to collect the relevant data through on-site
   investigation in those parts of Croatia known as putative endemic foci
   of leprosy. In this way, we collected data concerning the number of
   leprosy cases, the probable sources of infection, and traced the
   possible paths of spread of the disease.
   During the twentieth century, 17 cases of leprosy were registered in
   Croatia. However, due to the loss of medical documentation concerning
   the cases from Metkovic, the total number was obviously slightly
   greater. Concerning the 17 analysed cases, 4 patients were most probably
   infected during their visits (as sailors or immigrant workers) to the
   Middle East, South America or Africa; 3 patients developed leprosy after
   prolonged close contact with previously infected family members, while
   the exact source of infection remains unsettled for the remaining 10.
   However, 2 of these patients originated from the area of Cazin in Bosnia
   and Herzegovina, which is known to be an endemic focus of leprosy.
   Furthermore, the remaining 8 came from the small area of the village of
   Blizna in the Croatian municipality of Trogir, and therefore it seems
   reasonable to conclude that Blizna represents the endemic focus of
   leprosy in Croatia. The last case of leprosy in Blizna was registered
   back in 1956. Nevertheless, it is clear that sporadic cases of leprosy
   can reappear in Croatia, originating either from this endemic focus of
   Blizna, or as an infected person returning to Croatia from abroad. So,
   we can conclude that, even today, Croatian medical doctors (and
   especially dermatovenereologists) should still be acquainted with the
   clinical diagnosis of leprosy and basic principles of its treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Aquaporin CHIP (AQP-CHIP) is a water channel protein previously
   identified in red blood cells and water transporting epithelia. The
   inner ear is an organ of hearing and balance whose normal function
   depends critically on maintenance of fluid homeostasis. In this study,
   AQP-CHIP, or a close homologue, was found in specific cells of the inner
   ear, as assessed by immunocytochemistry with the use of
   affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against AQP-CHIP. AQP-CHIP was
   predominantly found in fibrocytes in close association with bone,
   including most of the cells lining the bony labyrinth and in fibrocytes
   lining the endolymphatic duct and sec. AQP-CHIP-positive cells not
   directly apposing bone include cells under the basilar membrane, some
   type III fibrocytes of the spiral ligament, fibrocytes of the spiral
   limbus, and the trabecular perilymphatic tissue extending from the
   membranous to the belly labyrinth. AQP-CHIP was also found in the
   periosteum of the middle ear and cranial bones, as well as in
   chandrocytes of the oval window and stapes. The distribution of AQP-CHIP
   in the inner ear suggests that AQP-CHIP may have special significance
   for maintenance of bone and the basilar membrane, and for function of
   the spiral ligament.}},

   efficiency because of its relationships with inlet H+ concentration, Fe

   Design parameters enhancing Mn treatment efficiency included large

Abstract = {{Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the numerical and
   categorical reproducibility of the C-14 urea breath test in a routine
   clinical setting. Background: The C-14 urea breath test is used for
   diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection and is regarded by some
   enters as the gold standard. Methods: In 140 referrals, duplicate tests
   were performed 1 wk apart. Eighteen patients were excluded because they
   had taken antibiotics or had changed medication that could influence the
   gastric urease activity between the tests. Results: The limits of
   agreement between the repeated tests were 45-234\%, Hence, the numerical
   result of a repeated test was 95\% likely to differ from the first with
   a factor of approximately two or less. However, when patients were
   classified as `'positive'' or `'negative'' according to our previously
   determined cut-off limit, only three patients were discordantly
   classified by the two tests. The observed agreement between the tests
   was 98\%, and the chance-corrected proportional agreement (kappa) was
   95\%, which is far better than that reported for the histological
   diagnosis of gastric H. pylori infection. Conclusion: The diagnostic
   reproducibility of the urea breath test was very good.}},

Abstract = {{Nineteen reference and 156 clinical strains of the genus Nocardia
   belonging to 12 taxonomic groups were studied for restriction fragment
   length polymorphism (RFLP) by using an amplified 439-bp segment of the
   65-kDa heat shock protein gene. Of 30 restriction endonucleases,
   digestion with MspI and then digestion with BsaHI produced RFLP band
   patterns which separated all 12 groups except N. asteroides type IV from
   6 of 12 N. transvalensis isolates and N. carnea from the N. asteroides
   type VI isolates, Commonly encountered species such as N. nova, N.
   farcinica, N. brasiliensis sensu stricto, and N. otitidiscaviarum were
   easily separated. Each taxon resulted in a single RFLP band pattern that
   included greater than or equal to 96\% of all biochemically grouped
   isolates for 9 of 12 taxa with MspI and for 8 of 12 taxa with BsaHI.
   With the use of both patterns, only 6 of 175 (3,4\%) isolates failed to
   fit the biochemically defined group patterns. These studies provide the
   first evidence for the separate identities of four antibiogram-defined
   (but currently unnamed) groups within the N. asteroides complex (types
   I, II, IV, and VI) and the presence of two subgroups within N.
   transvalensis. They also provide genotypic evidence for the separate
   identities of N, nova and N. farcinica. The lack of BstEII recognition
   sites in amplicons obtained from nocardiae provides a simple and rapid
   method for the differentiation of nocardiae from mycobacteria. DNA
   amplification with RFLP analysis is the first rapid method that
   distinguishes all clinically significant taxa and recognized species
   within the genus Nocardia.}},

Abstract = {{The quantitative dynamics of the zooplankton community was studied
   during a period of 13 years in the manipulated Lake Gardsjon and an
   acidified reference lake. Lake Gardsjon was acid during the first 3
   years, limed and fishless the following 4 years and stocked with brown
   trout for a period of 6 years. During the final 2 years rainbow trout
   was added. Changes in water chemistry and phytoplankton standing stock
   are associated with the manipulations. Liming had a positive effect on
   the overall species richness and diversity among rotifers and
   cladocerans. Changes in the zooplankton community during the different
   phases of the lake restoration are discussed in relation to the
   development of the planktivorous fauna of the lake, phantom midge
   larvae, aquatic hemipterans and fish. It can be concluded that liming
   creates a potential for the restoration of the zooplankton diversity,
   but the actual structure of the zooplankton community in limed lakes is
   strongly influenced by predatory and competitive interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Collaborative phase I and II studies of the combination of gemcitabine
   and cisplatin in patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer are
   ongoing at five centres in the UK and France. In the initial completed
   phase I study, 16 patients (15 evaluable) have been entered using a
   fixed dose of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) given as a 30 min intravenous
   infusion weekly for 3 weeks. On the third week the gemcitabine was
   immediately followed by cisplatin with pre- and post-hydration. This
   regimen required only 1 night of hospitalization every 4 weeks. The
   study design was for sequential groups of patients to receive 3 dose
   levels of cisplatin (60 mg/m(2), 75 mg/m(2) and 100 mg/m(2)) but these
   doses would be modified and the number of patients at any dose level
   could be increased if significant toxicity was observed. Three patients
   were to be entered at the first two dose levels and 10 patients were to
   confirm the maximum tolerated dose (if reached) or expand the database
   on toxicity at the final predetermined dose level. The major
   haematological toxicities were neutropenia (grade 4 in 3 patients) and
   thrombocytopenia (grade 3 or 4 in 5 patients) but both were of short
   duration and uncomplicated. Grade 3 nausea and vomiting occurred in 12
   patients but was no worse than would be expected from cisplatin alone.
   Alopecia was not a problem (no hair loss in 10 patients and grade 1 or 2
   in 6 patients) and no significant renal or neurotoxicity was seen. A
   phase II study using cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) in combination with
   gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) has been opened and to date 19 patients are
   evaluable for response. Eight (42\%) have achieved partial remissions.
   The study is ongoing and will recruit 50 evaluable patients.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of the progesterone antagonists (antiprogestins) onapristone
   (ZK 98 299) and ZK 136 799 on surgically induced endometriosis were
   studied in intact female rats, Endometriosis was induced by
   transplanting homologous endometrium to the parietal peritoneum of the
   abdominal wall (location A) and to the mesentery of the small intestine
   (location B). The animals were treated daily for 4 weeks at doses of 0.4
   and 2.0 mg onapristone or ZK 136;799. The growth of the
   endometriosis-like foci was measured with a calliper during both pre-
   and post-treatment laparotomy, Both antiprogestins exerted inhibitory
   effects on the growth of the endometriosis-like foci in terms of
   complete remission. A 40 and 50\% remission:df endometriosis was
   observed at each location after the administration of 2.0 mg
   onapristone, whereas 50 and 63\% (location A) and 50 and 75\% (location
   B) remissions were found after the administration of 0.4 and 2.0 mg of
   ZK 136 799 respectively. ZK 136 799 was also more potent than
   onapristone in growth inhibition (85 versus 48\% for location B) in
   animals with persistent endometriosis, Growth inhibition of the
   endometriosis-like foci was confirmed by histology and
   immunohistochemical staining of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen,
   The antiprogestins caused a reduction in glandular and luminal
   epithelial cells in the ectopic endometrium. Both antiprogestins tended
   to cause a decrease in uterine weight. Unlike the inhibitory effects in
   the ectopic endometrium, both onapristone and ZK 136 799 exhibited some
   stimulatory effects on the epithelial cells within the eutopic
   endometrium. Serum 17 beta-oestradiol concentrations did not vary
   significantly among the different treatment groups. No
   antiglucocorticoid effect of the antiprogestins was observed at either
   dose. This study indicates that the antiprogestins onapristone and
   ZK-136 799 exhibit antiproliferative effects in the ectopic but not;he
   eutopic endometrium via mechanisms which remain to be established, The
   better efficacy of ZK 136 799 is more likely caused by its higher
   antiprogestagenic activity than its partial androgenic activity. These
   findings may be a further indication of the future potential of
   antiprogestins such as onapristone and ZK 136 799 in the treatment of
   endometriosis.}},

   and written consent, 100 gynaecological patients (ASA I, II) were
   included in this study. The study was carried out in a double blind,
   randomized and prospective manner. Black perfusor syringes and extension
   sets were used, and the drugs administered were diluted to equal
   volumes. For induction, group 1 (n=25) received 0.1 mg fentanyl, 1 mg
   vecuronium, sodium thiopental (demand-adapted) and succinylcholine 1
   mg/kg; group 2 (n=25) received 0.1 mg fentanyl and propofol
   (demand-adapted); group 3 (n=25) received 0.2 mg fentanyl and propofol
   (demand-adapted); group 4 (n=25) received 0.1 mg fentanyl, 1 mg
   vecuronium, propofol (demand-adapted) and succinylcholine 1 mg/kg. Each
   patient was assessed prior to induction with regard to visualization of
   the pharynx (grade I-IV). Following induction jaw relaxation (grade
   I-IV) and the laryngoscopic visualization of the glottis (grade I-IV)
   were assessed. During the intubation, the position and movements of the
   vocal cords (grade I-IV) and patient movement during and 1 min following
   the intubation were assessed. The overall assessment of the intubation
   was graded (grade I-IV) by the anaesthetist and the anaesthetic nurse.
   Postoperatively the patients were questioned regarding muscle pain
   (grade I-IV). Before, during and after endotracheal intubation arterial
   haemoglobin oxygen saturation, heart rate and arterial blood pressure
   were monitored.
   Results. There were no intergroup differences with regard to age,
   height, weight and preanaesthetic visualization of the pharynx. In group
   1 an average of 5.5 +/- 1.2 mg/kg sodium thiopental was required. There
   were no significant differences in group 2, 3 and 4 with respect to the
   dose of propofol (2.4, 2.2 and 2.2 mg/kg). No intergroup differences
   were noted with regard to jaw relaxation, laryngoscopic visualization of
   the glottis and patients' movements during intubation. Statistically
   significant intergroup differences occurred with regard to the position
   and movements of vocal cords during intubation (group 3 worse than
   groups 1, 2, 4) and the patients' movements 1 min after intubation
   (group 2 worse than group 3). Significant intergroup differences also
   occurred with regard to the overall assessment of the intubation by the
   anaesthetist (group 3 worse than groups 2, 4) and the anaesthetic nurse
   (group 3 wourse than group 4) and the postoperative muscle pain (group 1
   worse than groups 2, 3).
   Conclusion. The use of 0.1 mg fentanyl/sodium thiopental/succinylcholine
   results in no better intubating conditions than 0.1 mg fentanyl plus
   propofol. Under these conditions, without the use of a muscle relaxant,
   it is possible to carry out safe endotracheal intubation in cases where
   no complications are anticipated.}},

Abstract = {{Maize has been used effectively as a model organism in the development
   and evaluation of molecular markers for the identification, mapping and

   traits in plants. Although quantitative geneticists have recognized the
   possibility of major loci, the general dogma had emerged that
   quantitative traits were controlled by many loci, each with a small
   effect. This interpretation sent a signal to the molecular biologist not
   to bother with quantitative traits because it would be essentially
   impossible to isolate a gene responsible for the trait. Recent results
   from numerous mapping studies have shown that quantitative traits are
   controlled by, at least some, factors with major effects, and have given
   credibility to the conclusion that major loci exist and that one might
   be able to study them. Positive results from marker-facilitated
   selection and introgression studies have further strengthened this
   conclusion.}},

Abstract = {{A time-dependent mathematical model for the heat transfer in
   laser-induced hyperthermia has been developed. The model calculates the
   temperature distribution in surface-irradiated tissues. Good agreement
   was found between the predictions of the model and in vitro experimental
   results obtained for bovine liver irradiated with an expanded beam from
   a Nd:YAG laser. Surface evaporation of water was included in the model
   and experimentally verified. The discrepancy between the measured and
   the calculated rise in temperature at three different depths on the axis
   of symmetry of the irradiating beam was found to be less than 5\% after
   15 min of irradiation. When irradiating in air and not accounting for
   the surface evaporation in the model, the accuracy of the model
   predictions was only 75-80\%. The model was then used to investigate the
   influence of surface evaporation of water on the total temperature
   distribution theoretically in a clinically relevant case. From the
   numerical simulations, it was shown that, simply by providing a
   moistened liver surface, the maximum steady-state temperature could be
   forced into the tissue to a depth of 4 mm. It was also shown that, by
   employing the numerical model during the initial phase of hyperthermia
   treatment, overshooting of the temperature during the transient thermal
   build-up time could be prevented.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of the V-type proton ATPase (H+-ATPase) was examined in
   the gill of the freshwater rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) using
   immunocytochemistry in concert with laser scanning confocal or electron

   region of the 31 kDa subunit of the bovine renal H+-ATPase was used to
   generate an antiserum in rabbits, and its suitability for use in trout
   gill was confirmed by western blotting.
   Gill epithelial cells demonstrated specific immunoreactivity, the
   intensity of which was increased markedly after 18h of exposure to
   hypercapnia (1\% CO2 in air). The increased intensity of Hf-ATPase
   immunoreactivity was associated with elevated branchial net acid
   excretion. In the hypercapnic fish, the specific immunoreactivity was
   associated with both the apical membrane and cytoplasm. Electron
   microscopy revealed that specific immunoreactivity was localized to the
   pavement cells and was particularly associated with the apical membrane
   and subapical cytoplasmic vesicles.
   The increased H+-ATPase immunoreactivity in the epithelial cells of
   hypercapnic fish and the increased intensity of the immunoreactive bands
   in western blots from hypercapnic fish demonstrate an `up-regulation' of

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on phenotypic plasticity as a major mode of
   adaptation in plants. A methodological critique examines difficulties in
   studying plasticity, including the conceptually critical distinction
   between functionally adaptive and inevitable aspects of response. It is
   argued that plasticity studies depend critically upon the genotypic
   sample, the choice of environmental factors and factor states, and the
   definition of phenotypic traits. Examples are drawn from recent studies
   showing adaptive response by genotypes to physical aspects of the
   environment, as well as to biotic factors such as neighbour density and
   the presence of bacterial symbionts. Alterations of offspring traits by
   parental plants of Polygonum persicaria are discussed as a
   cross-generational aspect of plastic response to environment. Finally,
   individual plasticity and local ecotypes are examined as alternative
   bases of species ecological breadth, and methodological problems in
   distinguishing these alternatives are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative study of degradation of wheat straw lignin by alkaline
   nitrobenzene and cupric compound (CuO, Cu(OH)(2), CuSO4 5H2(O))
   oxidation was carried out at 170 degrees C for 2.5 h in 2 N NaOH (7 mi)
   and 6.8\% nitrobenzene. The major products of such a degradation were
   the phenolic aldehydes of vanillin and syringaldehyde in both of the
   reactions. A relative high guaiacyl/syringyl ratio value was obtained by
   nitrobenzene oxidation, whereas a slightly high syringy/guaiacyl ratio
   appeared in the cupric(II) oxidation. A suite of up to 13 phenols was
   detected in the oxidation mixtures except that no acetosyringone
   appeared in the nitrobenzene oxidation. Gallic acid, protocatechuic acid
   and acetovanillone were firstly identified in both of the oxidation
   products from wheat straw lignin. The main difference between the two
   oxidant reagents was twice yield of nitrobenzene oxidation than that of
   cupric(II) oxidation.
   The effects reaction time, temperature, concentration of sodium
   hydroxide and nitrobenzene, and the amounts of sample used on the
   reaction yield and components of oxidation products from wheat straw
   were performed at 38 various conditions and the nature of the aldehyde
   and acid products determined by high-performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC). The results obtained showed that the percentages of various
   products were dependent on the conditions of alkaline nitrobenzene
   oxidation. The reaction condition (0.10 g straw in 2 N NaOH (7 mi) with
   6.8\% nitrobenzene at 170 degrees C for 4 h in a steel autoclaves)
   optimised for maximum recovery of products from wheat straw. Meanwhile,
   ferulic and p-coumaric acid released in amounts during the nitrobenzene
   oxidation, especially, at 170 degrees C for 2.5 h in 2 N NaOH without
   nitrobenzene, which suggested that more than 50\% of ferulic acid was in
   the etherified form while p-coumaric acid was predominant in the
   esterified bond with lignin in wheat straw.}},

Abstract = {{The involvement of different cell membrane components in the receptor
   structures for SA-11 rotavirus was investigated. As experimental model,
   the human enterocyte-like HT-29 cell line, was used because of its
   closer resemblance to the in vivo viral cellular target as compared to
   other in vitro systems. Rotavirus was incubated with whole membranes or
   their separated protein and lipid fractions before infection. Either
   isolated cell membranes or lipid components were capable of binding to
   the virus and to prevent infection, whereas proteins did not show any
   inhibitory activity. Among lipids, the glycolipid fraction was shown to
   impede rotaviral antigen synthesis with a dose-dependent relationship,
   whereas phospholipids failed to prevent viral infection. To confirm
   these findings, membranes and target cells were subjected to different
   enzymatic treatments prior to infection. In addition, HT-29 cells were
   also incubated with different lectins before infection. The blocking
   activity of membranes was inhibited by treatment with ceramide
   glycanase, neuraminidase, and beta-galactosidase but not by treatment
   with proteases or heat (100 degrees C). Viral infection was prevented by
   preincubation of target cells with lectins specific for sialic acid and
   galactose or with ceramide glycanase, neuraminidase, and
   beta-galactosidase, whereas protease treatments were not active. The
   results of these experimental procedures indicate that glycolipids
   containing specific carbohydrate moieties, such as sialic acid and
   galactose, contribute to the SA-11 rotavirus receptor structure on HT-29
   cells. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{After calving, two groups of four cows were fed fescue hay (10 kg/d) and
   a concentrate (8 kg/d) containing 0 or 20 g kg(-1) urea in order to
   induce different rumen microbial growth: the partition between the urine
   and milk excretion of allantoin, uric acid, creatinine and urea was
   examined. After 21 d of lactation, individual feed intakes, total faeces
   and urine output and milk yield were recorded for five consecutive days
   and these measurements were repeated three times at 21-d intervals. In
   comparison with the control, the urea-supplemented diet had higher
   apparent digestibility of DM (697 vs. 662 g kg(-1), P<0.05), OM (718 vs.
   681 g kg(-1), P<0.05), NDF (600 vs. 542 g kg(-1), P<0.01) and crude
   protein (631 vs. 497 g kg(-1), P<0.01). The urea-supplemented diet
   caused higher (P<0.01) outputs of N in the milk (91 vs. 75 g d(-1)) and
   urine (72 vs. 34 g d(-1)) and a moderate amount was retained (+24 g
   d(-1)), while in the control diet the N balance was negative (-3 g
   d(-1)). The inclusion of urea caused a significantly (P<0.01) higher
   urinary output of allantoin (11.3 vs. 9.3 g N d(-1)) and urea (44.1 vs.
   4.7 g N d(-1)), while no dietary effects were detected for uric acid or
   creatinine. The allantoin and uric acid excretion in milk was not
   significantly higher for the cows receiving urea, which had higher
   outputs of creatinine (90 vs. 71 mg N d(-1), P<0.05) and urea (1559 vs.
   507 mg N d(-1), P<0.01). The ratio between the quantitative excretion in
   urine and milk of allantoin, uric acid and creatinine (10.7, 10.2 and
   68.7, respectively) did not differ between dietary treatments, while the
   urine/milk urea excretion ratio had a significant interaction between

Abstract = {{Background Implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (ICDs) may reduce
   sudden tachyarrhythmic death in patients with severe left ventricular
   dysfunction. It is uncertain whether this improves survival,
   particularly in patients awaiting cardiac transplantation.
   Methods and Results The effect of treatment for spontaneous ventricular
   arrhythmias (ICD {[}n=59], antiarrhythmic drugs {[}n=53], or no
   antiarrhythmic treatment {[}n=179]) on total mortality and mode of
   cardiac death was analyzed in 291 consecutive patients evaluated for
   cardiac transplantation between January 1986 and January 1995. There
   were 109 deaths (37.4\%) (63 {[}21.6\%] sudden, 40 {[}13.7\%] nonsudden,
   and 6 {[}2.1\%] noncardiac) during mean follow-up of 15 months (range, 1
   to 118 months). Baseline clinical variables, medical therapies for heart
   failure, and actuarial rates of transplantation were similar between
   treatment groups. Kaplan-Meier sudden death rates were lowest in the ICD
   group, intermediate in the no antiarrhythmic treatment group, and
   highest in the drug treatment group throughout follow-up (12-month
   sudden death rates, 9.2\%, 16.0\%, and 34.7\%, respectively; P=.004).
   Total mortality and nonsudden death rates did not differ. Cox
   proportional-hazards model revealed that antiarrhythmic drug treatment
   was associated with sudden death (relative risk, 2.1; 95\% CI, 1.04 to
   3.39; P=.04) and ICD was associated with nonsudden death (relative risk,
   2.26; 95\% CI, 1.12 to 4.62; P=.02).
   Conclusions Sudden death rates were lowest in patients treated with ICDs
   compared with drug treatment or no antiarrhythmic treatment. However,
   although ICDs reduced sudden death in selected high-risk patients with
   severe left ventricular dysfunction, the effect on long-term survival
   was limited, principally by high nonsudden death rates.}},

   much larger than the control glands (P = 0.1 \%). At the end of the
   experiment the bulls fed with urea weighed, on average, 44 kg more than
   the control bulls (P = 5 \%).
   The histology and electron-microscopy tests revealed that the bulls had
   hyperplasia of the thyreocytes, grave hydropical and vacuolar
   degeneration of the thyroid glands, and a considerable decrease in the
   colloids of the folliculus.
   The morphological test on the thyroid glands of bulls fed with the
   aforementioned level of urea daily for a longer period corresponded with
   the considerable alterations observed when treating bulls with tiouracil
   by-products. The consequences of urea-rationing for a longer period were
   tested and the dangers of thyroid-gland alterations were made apparent.
   Blood samples (120 cases) were taken in the experiment to determine the
   concentrations of NH3-N, urea and of thyroxin and triiodinetironin (480
   pcs), referring to pre-rest conditions.
   The same parameters were determined five times (every 2 months) during

Abstract = {{The evidence that mechanisms other than P-170 expression may influence
   its `'pump'' and the retention/efflux of chemotherapeutic agents,
   prompted us to investigate the value of a functional multidrug
   resistance (MDR) assay in a series of childhood acute leukemia samples.
   Forty acute leukemia cases, mainly of lymphoid origin (ALL), were
   evaluated for MDR expression using a functional test based on
   rhodamine-123 efflux (Rhd-E). This was correlated with the
   quantification of P-170 external epitopes based on the positivity with
   the 4E3.16 and MRK16 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). When compared with
   the status of the disease and response to treatment, the mean (m) Rhd-E
   value was significantly lower in patients at diagnosis (m=7.1\% versus
   m=22.4\% at relapse) and in patients who achieved a complete remission
   (m=8.81\% versus 31.5\% in resistant cases). In the 22 samples analyzed,
   an overall correlation was found between the functional assay and the
   P-170 expression (r=0.6), despite the much lower level of MDR positivity
   recognized by the immunocytometric method (m=0.78\% and 0.9\% in cases
   at diagnosis versus m=3.7\% and 4.1\% at relapse, with the 4E3.16 and
   MRK16 MoAbs). These data suggest that the assessment of the clinical
   impact of MDR expression in pediatric ALL should be based on
   methodological approaches capable of providing information extended to
   the P-170 pump function, rather then only on its gene and protein
   expression.}},

Title = {{Allocation of urban space between roads and residential area - Circular

Abstract = {{In recent years, roads and trains in a large city, such as Tokyo, are
   over-crowed by cars and passengers almost all the time. Considering the
   reasons from the standpoint of traffic facilities, there is little room
   for development of new or existing facilities in the central area of a
   city, which causes serious lack of capacity of the transportation
   system. Also from the standpoint of traffic demand, the number of trips
   made by a person may differ for one living in a large city and for one
   living in a small town, the former may usually intercommunicate each
   other more frequently than the latter. Therefore, the total traffic
   volume in a city may increase at a higher rate than its population
   grows.
   In this paper, we planned a model of a city where the transportation
   facilities have necessary and sufficient capacity to pass all the trips
   made by the people in the city. When we consider this problem, it must
   be noted that the transportation system is not only a network but also
   consumes considerable space. Therefore, the population distribution in
   the city and the transportation system which has enough capacity for the
   trips are mutually dependent and can not be determined independently.
   The model of a city to be considered is a circle Omega with radius R,
   where all the trips are made by the people intercommunicating each other
   by car, the space in Omega is partitioned into residential area and
   roads to form the whole city, and the portion of residential area is
   represented by a function f(x) of position a: in Omega which is to be
   determined. It is assumed that people populate with constant density rho
   in residential area, for each pair of people a trip is made with
   constant probability b per unit time, and one moves from his origin to
   his destination along the straight line between the points. The
   parameter b is considered to depend on the population N in Omega as b =
   b(0)N(-7), where b(0) and gamma(0 less than or equal to gamma less than
   or equal to 1) are constants. This means that the number of people being
   met by one person in a unit time is equal to bN = b(0)N(1-gamma) which
   increases as the population N increases,
   Under these assumptions, we derive a functional of f(x) representing the
   traffic volume through a: in Omega, and equate it with the road
   area(which is also a function of f(x)) multiplied by transportation
   capacity c of unit road area. From this equation? it is derived that
   when radius R of the city increases but the potion of roads in the
   central area remains unchanged, then the transportation capacity c must
   be raised as R(3-2 gamma). We also solve the functional equation
   numerically to see the distribution of roads and residential area in
   Omega. In the solutions! the portion of residential area decreases
   radically as R increases, especially in the central area.}},

Abstract = {{Objective, To study tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) in
   relation to collagenolytic and gelatinolytic potential, namely
   dinitrophenyl-Pro-Gln-Gly-Ile-Ala-Gly-Gln-D-Arg (DNP-S) sensitive
   proteolytic activity, in loose total hip arthroplasty (THA)
   endoprostheses.
   Methods. Tissue localization of TIMP-1 was investigated
   immunohistochemically. TIMP-1 level of the periprosthetic tissues and
   fluid samples from 9 loose THA endoprostheses was measured by
   competitive ELISA, and DNP-S sensitive collagenolytic and gelatinolytic
   potential was evaluated by the degradation of synthetic DNP-S and
   reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography.
   Results. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed moderate to marked
   immunoreactivity of TIMP-1 in pseudosynovial lining cells, and weak to
   moderate immunoreactivity often in monocyte/macrophages, endothelial
   cells, and fibroblasts in both interface tissues between bone and
   implant and pseudocapsular tissues around the artificial joints. TIMP-1
   level was low in interface tissue samples (795 +/- 203 ng/ml) compared
   to pseudosynovial fluid samples (2026 +/- 584 ng/ml). Degradation rate
   of the substrate was higher in interface tissue samples (56 +/- 6\%)
   than in pseudocapsular tissue samples (32 +/- 4\%) and pseudosynovial
   fluid samples (6 +/- 2\%).
   Conclusion. Low TIMP-1 level combined with high percentage of
   degradation of synthetic substrate DNP-S leads to high collagenolytic
   and gelatinolytic activity in interface tissue samples. This may in part
   explain the weakening of periprosthetic connective tissue. Weakening
   Combined with cyclic mechanical loading may lead to loosening of THA
   endoprostheses.}},

Abstract = {{1 British and world distribution patterns of the moss Racomitrium
   lanuginosum (Hedw.) Brid. are used to deduce the likely conditions
   governing the occurrence of its preserved leaves in the upper layers of
   British blanket peats. It is suggested that R. lanuginosum dominates in
   blanket mires only under conditions of lowered water table and high
   atmospheric humidity.
   2 Detailed stratigraphic records from blanket mires in the Southern
   Pennines (Northern England) and the Berwyn Mountains (North Wales) show
   remains of R. lanuginosum preserved in the peat columns of both eroded
   and uneroded sites. At uneroded sites in the Southern Pennines,
   Racomitrium remains predominate between about AD 1250 and 1450 and again
   in the mid-Eighteenth Century. At hummock sites in both regions, and at
   gullied sites in the Southern Pennines, Racomitrium remains are
   continuously present in the peat column from about AD 1250-1800.
   3 It is concluded that the presence of Racomitrium remains in the peat
   column constitutes a clear proxy-climate signal, signifying, in uneroded
   areas, a prolonged period of drier climate succeeded by a return to a
   wetter, more humid climate (though that signal may be blurred by
   superimposed effects of burning and grazing of the mire surface).
   4 The macrofossil record demonstrates the marked effects on the blanket
   mire vegetation of both study regions of the documented period of drier
   climate from c. AD 1115-1300 (the `Early Mediaeval Warm Period').
   5 Possible consequences of that episode on the blanket mires of the two
   regions include the onset of gully erosion and the development of a
   `stagnation complex' in pool-and-hummock systems. The extension of these
   findings to other blanket mire regions of the British Isles is
   discussed.}},

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{915-927}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A key issue in the creation of error-free tool path for numerically
   controlled (NC) surface machining is gouging (over-cut) prevention. In
   the case of solid-based machining, where the creation of tool paths
   across several surfaces in a single pass is imperative, the major
   sources for gouging are the tangent discontinuity (C-1 discontinuity)
   and the surface gap (C-0 discontinuity) occurred in the constituent
   surfaces of the part model. C-1 discontinuity is naturally identified in
   solid modeling as `edges' and `vertices'. C-0 discontinuity occurs,
   however, in the free edges of surfaces or from errors in surface
   definition.
   In this paper, a system based on the offset/upper envelope concept is
   proposed for solving the C-0 and C-1 discontinuity in 3-axis
   multi-surface NC machining. Essentially, in addition to offsets of
   surfaces themselves, offsets are also defined for the boundary curves of
   these surfaces. By incorporating the upper enveloping operation on the
   intersection curves between the drive planes and the offsets, it is
   shown that the resulting tool paths have pleasant features of gouge
   free, smoothness, and minimal uncut area.
   In addition, a detailed algorithmic description of the intersection
   between a drive plane and the offset of surface boundaries is also
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{When bulb-scale segments of Lilium longiflorum were cultured on a medium
   containing auxin and cytokinin, the proportion of the explants with
   newly-formed bulblets was significantly increased by the application of
   different polyamines. The most effective polyamine was spermine, where
   more than 90\% of segments formed an average of 5 bulblets as compared
   to controls where less than 50\% explants formed an average of 1.5
   bulblets. Application of arginine one of the precursors putrescine
   biosynthesis, slightly promoted bulblet formation. The
   putrescine-stimulated bulblet formation was strongly inhibited by
   simultaneous addition of an inhibitor of the spermidine synthase,
   cyclohexylamine. The spermidine-promoted bulblet formation, however,
   could not be suppressed by this inhibitor. The promotive effect of
   spermidine on bulblet formation was reversed by an inhibitor of the
   spermine synthase, N-(3-aminopropyl)cyclohexylamine, but application of
   this inhibitor with spermine did not show any apparent effect on the
   bulblet formation. Endogenous level of spermine increased in common
   during bulblet formation that were stimulated by exogenous polyamines.
   Thus, spermine seemed to be the main stimulating chemical on bulblet
   formation in lily bulb-scale segments.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of crystallization of calcium salts with ion-selective
   electrodes has turned out to be a very sensitive method. The
   difficulties of handling these electrodes in native whole urine and
   other biological fluids have been eliminated by new calcium analyzers,
   which clean and calibrate the electrodes after each measurement. To
   study crystallization kinetics, repeated calcium ion measurements have
   to be performed at regular intervals. For this purpose we have developed
   a special sampler and software. The sampler brings a
   thermostat-controlled crystallization chamber to the analyzer at
   preselected intervals. The computer directs and coordinates the sampler
   and the analyzer, stores the received results and prints out growth
   curves. Furthermore it calculates the half-time (h) and the maximum
   decrease of ionic calcium at infinite incubation time (Delta
   Ca-infinity(2+)). Both values are shown to characterize the growth of
   calcium oxalate monohydrate in urine. Results are obtained within 40
   min.}},

   structure and crystallization kinetics of the rapidly quenched glasses
   and liquids in this system have been studied by high-temperature Raman
   spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The Li2O-TeO2
   liquids exhibited much higher fractions of TeO3 trigonal pyramidal units
   with non-bridging oxygens than the corresponding glasses. Whether or not
   the crystallization from the liquids occurred easily depended on the
   similarity in the local structure between the liquids and the main
   crystallization products. The crystallization kinetics revealed that the
   number of nuclei was possibly saturated during the quenching of the
   liquids in the glass preparation, which explains the unique
   crystallization behavior of the Li2O-TeO2 system.}},

Abstract = {{The demands of dynamic monitoring and fault diagnosis for flight
   engineer trainees were examined in relation to changes in heart rate
   (I-IR) and two spectral analysis measures (midfrequency: 0.07-0.14 Hz;
   high frequency: 0.15-0.40 Hz) of heart rate variability (HRV). Eleven
   trainee flight engineers were studied, as part of their training and
   assessment, over three 3-h sessions in a cockpit simulator. During each
   session, faults and incidents programmed into the system had to be
   detected, diagnosed, and corrected. Electrocardiograms were taken, and
   each session was recorded on videotape. Work phases were classified from
   video analysis of flight maintenance activities, using Rasmussen's
   cognitive control taxonomy, into monitoring, routine (rule-based), and
   problem-solving (knowledge-based) phases. HR and HRV were found to be
   sensitive to different phases of the work environment. HRV was
   suppressed during the mentally demanding problem-solving mode of the
   level flight phase, but only for the midfrequency component. Elevated
   heart rate, in contrast, was associated with the more generally
   stressful takeoff and landing phases. The findings support both the use
   of HRV as a physiological index of mental effort and its value in
   operational contexts, and the value of ecologically derived methods of
   evaluating differences in work demands in complex systems.}},

   of 3.31 apfu (anions per formula unit) is significantly less than the

   O(3) (=OH) anion was located on a difference-Fourier map, whereas no
   significant density was found in the vicinity of the O(1) site, in
   accord with the OH content determined by chemical analysis. There is
   significant Mg-Al disorder over the Y and Z sites, and site populations
   were determined from mean bond-length - constituent-cation-radius

   importance is the mechanism by which short-range bond-valence
   requirements are satisfied around both O2- and OH- at this site. The
   O(1) site lies on a 3-fold axis, and the O(1) anion is bonded only to
   three Y cations. Where O(1) = O2-, the anion is bonded to 2 Al + Mg;
   where O(1) = OH-, the anion is bonded to 3 Mg. The individual
   bond-lengths needed for complete bond-valence satisfaction around O(1)
   average to give the observed Y-O(1) bond-length in this crystal,

   African (1971), Emma Mashinini's Strikes Have Followed Me All My Life
   (1989) and Alfred Qabula's Cruel Beyond Belief (1989).(1) These four
   texts have received but scant attention from literary critics in South
   Africa. This paper is therefore an intervention to `retrieve' these
   texts from the margins of discourses on South African literature. My
   argument will be that the autobiographers' positions as activists
   constitute their primary narrative identity. The recreation of other
   identities, such as childhood, ethnicity, family and the construction of
   historical narratives, will be demonstrated to ensue from this primary
   preoccupation of the autobiographers; they negotiate their subject
   positions from what is reconcilable with their identities as trade
   unionists cum activists. The primary identity is itself also contingent
   on the writer's location at the moment of writing.}},

   study assesses whether a sustained, proactive smoking cessation program
   based on a stepped care model that targets all smoking employees in the
   worksite can actually be delivered, In one worksite in Seattle (N =
   273), a worksite-wide survey with a 99.3\% response rate identified 53
   smokers; subsequent new-hires added an additional 14 smokers to the
   worksite, This study delivered increasingly intensive intervention to
   those smoking employees who failed to quit smoking during the study
   period of 1.5 years, Telephone contacts (every 3 months) provided
   motivational messages tailored to the smokers' stage of cessation.
   Subsequent more intensive steps included self-help manuals and referrals
   to formal programs. The intervention also used community organization
   strategies, such as employee guided worksite activities to complement
   the individual and stepped strategies, In the study period, 18\% of the
   smokers quit smoking, Participation rates in activities were good and on
   average worksite smokers moved over one stage of change from baseline
   toward quitting smoking.}},

Abstract = {{Tacrolimus, formerly known as FK506, is a macrolide antibiotic with
   immunosuppressive properties. Although structurally unrelated to
   cyclosporin A (CsA), its mode of action is similar. It exerts its
   effects principally through impairment of gene expression in target
   cells. Tacrolimus bonds to an immunophilin, FK506 binding protein
   (FKBP). This complex inhibits calcineurin phosphatase. The drug inhibits
   calcium-dependent events, such as interleukin-2 gene transcription,
   nitric oxide synthase activation, cell degranulation, and apoptosis.
   Tacrolimus also potentiates the actions of glucocorticoids and
   progesterone by binding to FKBPs contained within the hormone receptor
   complex, preventing degradation. The agent may enhance expression of the
   transforming growth factor beta-1 gene in a fashion analogous to that
   demonstrated for CsA. T cell proliferation in response to ligation of
   the T cell receptor is inhibited by tacrolimus. Type 1 T helper cells
   appear to be preferentially suppressed compared with type 2 T helper
   cells. T cell-mediated cytotoxicity is impaired. B cell growth and
   antibody production are affected indirectly by the suppression of T
   cell-derived growth factors necessary for these functions. Antigen
   presentation appears to be spared. The molecular events affected by
   tacrolimus continue to be discovered.}},

Abstract = {{The Candelaria mining district in central western Nevada preserves a
   record of tectonism, magmatism, and mineralization related to early
   Mesozoic development of the cordilleran magmatic are. A deformed
   basement of Ordovician chert-phyllite (Palmetto complex) and its thin
   parautochthonous cover of Permo-Triassic marine elastic rocks (Diablo
   and Candelaria Formations) are structurally overlain, along the
   Pickhandle-Golconda thrust system, by ophiolitic tectonic mi lange
   forming the base of the Golconda allochthon. The total assemblage is cut
   by three overlapping swarms of silicic dikes comprising, from the oldest
   to the youngest: fine-grained, sparsely porphyritic calc-alkaline
   rhyolites; medium-grained, strongly porphyritic, high K calc-alkaline
   dacites; fine-grained calc-alkaline rhyolites. U-Pb zircon dating gives
   ages of 222 +/- 2 Ma for the older rhyolites, 192 +/- 3 Ma for the
   porphyries, and 196 +/- 24 Ma for the younger rhyolites. These swarms
   are products of the Triassic-Jurassic cordilleran magmatic are, which
   developed under a long-lived, broadly extensional to transtensional
   tectonic regime, to generate a major intra-are graben system
   characterized by voluminous caldera-related ignimbrites. The dike swarms
   possibly mark the site of an eroded caldera. The dacite porphyries are
   genetically associated with important sediment-hosted disseminated
   silver (-gold-base metals) mineralization, which occurs in thick tabular
   zones along the Pickhandle thrust and in a subparallel footwall
   structure-the lower Candelaria shear-which cuts reactive carbonaceous
   marry shales at the base of the Candelaria Formation. Mineralization
   occurs where the porphyries intrude the Pickhandle thrust and the lower
   Candelaria shear. The 192 +/- 3 Ma date for the dacites defines
   Candelaria as the oldest disseminated precious metal deposit in the
   Great Basin. There are similarities in tectonic setting, magmatic
   association, metal composition, and possibly, age between Candelaria and
   the Darwin-type Pb-Ag-Zn vein replacement deposits of southeastern
   California. Differences in host rock composition and host-rock
   amenability to structural preparation may account for grade-tonnage
   differences between Candelaria (large, low grade; hosted by thin-bedded
   marly shales) and the Darwin-type deposits (small, high grade; hosted by
   more massive carbonate rocks). K-Ar ages for sericites from the
   hydrothermal alteration envelope at Candelaria range from 91 to 132 Ma
   (mid to Late Cretaceous). The discrepancy between these ages and those
   of the silicic dikes is attributed to regional-scale reheating and
   resetting of K-Ar isotopic systematics, related to development of the
   younger, crosscutting Jurassic-Cretaceous cordilleran magmatic are. This
   are generated the Sierra Nevada batholithic belt, which is represented
   locally by several small calc-alkaline granite porphyry stocks, dated at
   84 to 97 Ma (K-Ar biotite), exposed within a few kilometers of
   Candelaria.}},

   strongly with the immunizing polysaccharide type (Ia, II, III). The

Abstract = {{Chronic injection of an anti-c-KIT receptor tyrosine kinase monoclonal
   antibody (ACK2) results in the disruption of the normal motility
   patterns of young BALB/c mice intestine. This effect is accompanied by a
   drastic decrease in the number of intestinal c-kit-expressing (c-kit(+))
   cells when studied immunohistochemically with the fluorescence-labelled
   antibody. In order to clarify the mechanism underlying the ACK2 action
   and the physiological roles of intestinal c-kit(+) cells, we studied the
   excitability of intestinal c-kit(+) cells in primary culture by use of
   the nystatin perforated-patch-clamp technique. Under voltage-clamp at
   -40 mV, the majority of c-kit(+) cells tested (59/70) elicited rhythmic
   current waves with an amplitude and frequency of 263 +/- 24 pA and 2.30
   +/- 0.25 cycles/min (mean +/- SEM), respectively. Intracellular
   perfusion of the c-kit(+) cells with ethylenebis (okonitrilo)
   tetraacetate (EGTA) as well as a nominally Ca2+ free external solution
   or low holding voltage (< -60 mV) prevented the rhythmic current. The
   reversal potential of the rhythmic current was close to the equilibrium
   potential for Cl-(E(alpha)). Moreover the rhythmic current was depressed
   by a Cl- channel blocker,
   4-acetoamido-4-isothiocyanat-ostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (SITS). The
   smooth muscle cells freshly dissociated from the same intestinal
   specimen revealed a Ca2+-activated K+ current, as has been described in
   a variety of smooth muscle cells. Cultured smooth muscle cells from the
   ileum preparation lacked neither the Ca2+-activated K+ nor rhythmic Cl-
   currents. Smooth muscle cells freshly dissociated from the same ileum
   preparation and those in culture showed no immunoreactivity with the
   labelled ACK2, which was consistent with our previous in situ study.
   Results provided direct evidence that the intestinal c-kit(+) cells, but
   not the smooth muscle cells, possess a rhythmic Cl- current oscillation,
   suggesting their participation in pacemaker activity for the peristaltic
   gut movement.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We investigated the association between the coping style of
   learned resourcefulness and the variables of pain description, pain
   locus of control, psychological distress, and health-care utilization.
   Design: A cross-sectional, retrospective, correlational design was used.
   Patients and Setting: The sample was comprised of 87 outpatients from a
   university-based, multidisciplinary pain clinic.
   Main Outcome Measures: Self-Control Schedule, pain intensity, McGill
   Pain Questionnaire, Pain Locus of Control Scale, SCL-90-R, Health-Care
   Utilization Questionnaire.
   Results and Conclusions: Results indicated that chronic pain patients
   obtained comparable resourcefulness ratings to normal subjects but there
   were wide individual differences. Consistent with theoretical
   predictions, resourcefulness was found to be associated with better
   psychological adjustment and less impulsive health-care measures.
   Results suggest that assessment of learned resourcefulness may be useful
   in predicting behavioral outcome in clinical settings with chronic pain
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Tertiary collision in the NW Himalaya was between the Indian plate and
   the Kohistan island are, the leading edge of the Indian plate being
   subducted beneath the are along the Main Mantle Thrust (MMT).
   Porphyroblast-matrix relationships show that metamorphism within Indian
   plate cover sediments exposed on the footwall of the MMT was synchronous
   with ductile shearing which marks the main deformation phase. The P-T-t
   paths, derived from inclusion assemblages and forward modelling of
   garnet zonation patterns, show that this metamorphism was along a path
   of increasing pressure. These data are consistent with Indian plate
   metamorphism occurring during active subduction beneath the Kohistan
   island are. Geochronological data date the metamorphic peak as pre-50
   Ma. As initial collision cannot have pre-dated 65 Ma, there was thus
   insufficient time for the long time-scales of metamorphism generally
   predicted by conductive models of post-thickening thermal relaxation.
   The cover sediments show a metamorphic inversion, argued previously as
   the result entirely of post-metamorphic thrusting and imbrication. By
   contrast, basement gneisses exposed beneath the MMT have largely been
   unaffected by Tertiary metamorphism. The relationship between ductile
   shearing and metamorphism on the footwall of the MMT during active
   subduction, and the concentration of the highest metamorphic grades in
   the stratigraphically youngest rocks, suggests that early Tertiary
   metamorphism was controlled by dissipative shear heating distributed
   across the uppermost cover sediments of the subducting Indian plate.
   This generated a primary, inverted metamorphic sequence shortly after
   collision, an inversion reinforced by subsequent thrusting associated
   with accretion of the metamorphic pile onto the base of the over-riding
   are. This conclusion stresses the importance of dissipative shear
   heating in controlling metamorphism within thrust systems and provides a
   mechanism by which areas of apparently large regional extent can undergo
   regional metamorphism over short time-scales, but in the absence of any
   magmatic heating.}},

Abstract = {{The role of the atmospheric circulation in climate change is examined. A
   review is given of the information available in the past record on the
   atmosheric circulation and its role in climate change, firstly at the
   surface via sea level pressure in both the northern and southern
   hemispheres and secondly for the free atmosphere. As with most climate
   information, the climate record is compromised by non-physical
   inhomogeneities arising from changes in observing and analyzing
   techniques and changes in data coverage. Problems with and threats to
   the rawinsonde network are discussed. Global analyses produced by the
   operational centers, U.S. National Meteorological Center (NMC) and the
   European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), for weather
   forecasting purposes contain many discontinuous changes in the analyses
   arising from improvements in the system used to produce them. A
   discussion is given of the prospects for and motivation behind an
   activity known as `reanalysis' in which the historical data are
   reanalyzed using a state-of-the-art system that is held constant for the
   entire record. The only sources of spurious change then are the changes
   in the observing system, such as the introduction of space-based
   observations. Recommendations are made on needed actions for better
   understanding and monitoring climate change.
   The role of the atmospheric circulation and the strong links to other
   variables such as temperature, precipitation and wind are established
   and illustrated with a survey of decadal variability, the evidence for
   it, and the way in which the observed atmospheric circulation is
   involved in the Pacific and Atlantic sectors. The importance of
   teleconnections is stressed, especially in the winter half year, for
   understanding local climate change. The likelihood that changes will be
   manifested in the frequency and intensity of preferred modes of behavior
   in the atmosphere, such as the Fl Nino-Southern Oscillation and
   Pacific-North American teleconnection patterns, rather than in changes
   in the modes is also emphasized. The recently observed climate changes
   and the tendency for an unprecedented prolonged El Nino are interpreted
   in this framework. The key coupled atmosphere-ocean character of decadal
   variability is noted with the atmosphere providing the spatial scales,
   the ocean the memory, but also with the need for collaborative, as
   opposed to destructive, interactions through the atmospheric
   circulation.}},

Abstract = {{Immunization of Balb/c mice with a homogeneously purified recombinant

   secreting a novel monoclonal anti-La antibody termed La4B6. La4B6
   reacted with La protein from a variety of sources including human,
   bovine, rat and mouse. ATP blocked the binding of La4B6 to recombinant
   La protein. The human epitope was identified as consisting of the amino
   acid sequence SKGRRFKGKGKGN, which includes the proposed ATP-binding
   site of the La protein. In the human and bovine La protein, the epitope
   exists as a continuous amino acid sequence. In rat and mouse the epitope
   was found to consist of the amino acid sequence SKG interrupted by a
   species-specific insert of 16 amino acids, and followed by the second
   half of the epitope, the amino acid sequence RRFKGKGKGN. Our data
   suggest that in the case of the rat and mouse La proteins the two

   optical proximity effect correction (OPC) system taking account of the
   resist development and process latitude has been developed. The system
   is designed focussing on accurate optimization of cell patterns such as
   memory or gate array devices. Using this OPC for a memory device cell
   pattern of 3.5 x 6.3 mu m area, the resist edge placement error with
   process conditions of within +/-5\% exposure latitude and +/- 0.75 mu m
   depth of focus achieved was one-third of that without OPC. The

Abstract = {{A multidimensional calculation procedure is used to investigate the flow
   in loop-scavenged two-stroke engine with curved cylinder heads. five
   different cylinder heads are considered. The curvature of cylinder head
   increases from case I to case IV. In case V the head curvature is
   further increased, but it is shaped in the radially outer region.
   Calculations reveal that a tumbling vortex forms after the exhaust port
   is closed and the vortex constantly dominates the flow structure in the
   cylinder throughout the compression period. With high head curvatures
   the vortex is well organized and occupies the entire cylinder volume in
   the late compression stage. Due to compression of the better organized
   tumbling cortex by the moving piston more energy cascades from mean flow
   to turbulence in the high curvature cases III and IV. As for case V, the
   larger clearance in the bowl center region leads to lower shear stress
   and, thus, the turbulence augmentation phenomenon is less prominent than
   that for cases III and IV.}},

Abstract = {{The pervaporative transport of aqueous solutions of high ethanol content
   was studied on polyion complex membranes. It was found that the
   permeation rate of water became smaller with the decrease in the water
   content of the feed solution and/or with the increase in the permeate
   side pressure. This fact suggested that the permeation rate was
   dependent on the activity of water in the membrane, Therefore, on the
   basis of the solution-diffusion theory, an equation of the permeation
   rate of water was derived on the assumption that both the activity and
   the diffusion constant of water depended on concentration. The
   permeation rate was calculated for the membranes of different thickness
   and under various permeate side pressures. It was confirmed that the
   derived equation accurately described the experimental data for
   permeation rate of water, On the other hand, the permeation of ethanol
   resulted mostly from the volume flow through incomplete parts of the
   membrane but was negligible compared with the permeating water flow.}},

   using a plastic replication technique and modelled, using the Navarro-de

Abstract = {{Without proper subsurface drainage of heavy clay soil, water logging due
   to low hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil and especially the
   subsoil will lead to abundant,surface runoff The abundant runoff will
   induce soil erosion and phosphorus losses. To determine the influence of
   improved subsurface drainage (IMP) on soil erosion, phosphorus losses
   and nitrogen leaching, a heavy clay soil with a 29 year old subdrainage
   system was fitted with new drains, with topsoil or wood chips used as
   backfill in the drain trenches. Before IMP, drainage water constituted
   only 10-40\% of the total runoff (drainage + surface runoff) but after
   IMP 50-90\%. Where topsoil was used as backfill, the estimated soil
   erosion and particulate P and dissolved orthophosphate P losses from
   ploughed soil during winter were lower after IMP than before (1168 vs.
   1408 kg ha(-1), 0.58 vs. 0.69 kg ha(-1), 0.09 vs. 0.12 kg ha(-1),
   respectively). Where wood chips were used as backfill, soil erosion and
   particulate P losses were not reduced. Owing to the increased drainage
   discharge, nitrogen leaching during barley cultivation was much higher
   after IMP (14 vs. 7 kg ha(-1)a(-1)).}},

Abstract = {{The large and diverse Cercospora genus of plant pathogenic fungi
   includes many species that are causal agents of economically relevant
   leaf, stem, and seed blights of numerous crop plants. Several of these
   pathogens produce the red, photoactivated, phytotoxic polyketide toxin
   cercosporin. This mycotoxin is a crucial pathogenicity factor in the
   development of leaf and pod blights by the seed-borne soybean fungal
   pathogen Cercospora kikuchii. Although certain cultivars may be less
   susceptible to the leaf- and pod-infection phases of the fungus, there
   are no soybean cultivars with resistance to cercosporin. A newly
   isolated gene from C. kikuchii, known as LE6, is essential for
   cercosporin production and pathogenicity. Therefore, genetic
   manipulation of this gene may affect resistance to cercosporin.
   Transcription of LE6 is regulated by light. The expression of
   cercosporin also may be inhibited by certain growth media and other
   natural products. Modification of cultivar screens that target LE6 may
   greatly enhance the possibility of finding native resistance to this
   soybean pathogen. Soybean germplasm that produces strong LE6
   downregulating or inhibiting compounds may enhance pathogen resistance.
   Thus knowledge of the genetic and physiological regulation of
   cercosporin should provide new technological strategies for biocontrol
   of mycotoxins and the development of soybean breeding lines that exhibit
   durable resistance to C. kikuchii.}},

Abstract = {{Intense photoluminescence with enhanced no-phonon (NP) transition was
   observed from Si-based quantum well (QW) structures. This was realized
   by exploiting neighboring confinement structure (NCS) which consists of
   a single pair of tensile-strained Si layer (QW for electrons) and
   compressive-strained Si1-yGey layer (QW for holes) cladded by completely
   relaxed Si1-xGex (y > x) layers. Quantum confinement was clearly
   observed by varying the Si well width while keeping the Si1-yGey well
   width constant. The enhanced NP transition was qualitatively explained
   in terms of exciton localization.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a deficiency of merosin has been reported in patients with
   classical congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), while other patients,
   with indistinguishable clinico-pathological features, do not present
   this deficiency, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. The purpose of the
   present investigation was to assess merosin distribution and quantity in
   21 clinically well characterized Brazilian CMD patients, in order to: a)
   estimate the proportion of merosin-deficient cases in this group of
   patients; b) characterize phenotypically merosin-negative, as compared
   to merosin-positive patients.
   Merosin deficiency was found in 11 patients and all the seven who had
   been submitted to neuroimaging studies showed evidence of
   periventricular dysmyelination. A normal pattern of 43 DAG was found in
   all patients, which suggest that this protein is not preferentially
   involved in a third form of merosin-positive CMD.
   Results from the present study are further suggestive, but do not prove,
   that the association of merosin deficiency with white matter alterations
   represents a genetic entity with common clinical, laboratory and
   neuroimaging findings.}},

Abstract = {{Among psychobiological concepts concerning origin and persistence of
   anxiety disorders, the phenomenon of cardiovascular deconditioning (CD)
   has drawn little attention. Many of the cardiovascular complaints seen
   in patients with anxiety disorders can be evoked by CD. CD has been
   studied in astronauts during and after space flights, can be provoked on
   earth by using the 6 degrees head-down tilt (HDT) method, and occurs
   after prolonged bed rest. HDT studies conducted in our laboratory with
   healthy subjects revealed the detrimental cardiovascular effects of this
   posture. Based on this observation it was hypothesized that the CD seen
   in agoraphobics (with and without panic attacks) is mainly due to the
   long period of time they spent in supine position. 15 agoraphobics, 15
   age-, sex- and body weight-matched snake-/spider-phobics and 15 healthy
   controls served as subjects. Orthostatic challenge, bicycle ergometry,
   and the behavior protocols filled in during 1 week showed that the
   agoraphobics are characterized by CD and spent significantly more time
   per day in supine position than spider-/snake-phobics and controls. On
   the basis of these findings a psychophysiological model is proposed
   combining the prolonged bed rest with cardiovascular dysregulation and
   the concomitant avoidance behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Nephron filtration rate (SNGFR) and proximal tubular reabsorption are
   coordinated by the processes of tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) and
   glomerulotubular balance (GTB). We examined the role of nitric oxide
   (NO) in TGF and GTB, by delivering the NO synthase inhibitor,
   NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) into late proximal nephrons by
   micropuncture in Inactin-anesthetized euvolemic rats. First, we
   determined the dependence of SNGFR on late proximal tubular flow rate
   (V-LP) during orthograde microperfusion of Henle's loop downstream from
   an obstructing wax block (open-loop microperfusion). Second, we examined
   the homeostatic efficiency of the TGF-GTB system, (i.e., its ability to
   stabilize V-LP) by perturbing V-LP in free-flowing nephrons, while using
   a noninvasive optical technique to measure flow immediately upstream
   from the perturbation (closed-loop perturbation). Third, we tested
   whether L-NMMA could alter the afferent signal to TGF by changing the
   relationship between V-LP and the flow rate (V-ED) Or ionic content
   (C-ED) Of early distal tubular fluid during open-loop microperfusion.
   During open-loop microperfusion, L-NMMA decreased SNGFR at V-LP between
   10 and 40 nl/min but did not alter the relationship between V-LP and
   V-ED or C-ED During closed-loop perturbation, L-NMMA did not affect
   ambient V-LP but increased the homeostatic efficiency of the TGF-GTB
   system. The combined effects on SNGFR and ambient V-LP suggest that
   L-NMMA reduces proximal reabsorption. However, this could account for
   only a small fraction of the increase in homeostatic efficiency, the
   greater share of which must be mediated within the juxtaglomerular
   apparatus. It appears that juxtaglomerular NO exerts an upward pressure
   on SNGFR and reduces the efficiency of the TGF-GTB system in stabilizing
   V-LP at ambient flow rates under euvolemic conditions.}},

   changes. Health risk caused by exposure to ozone has been evaluated
   mainly in a qualitative way by comparing ozone air quality data with

   quantifying health risk from short-term exposure to oxidant air
   pollution has been taken by expert judgement, describing known or

   assessment of the health impact of distinct ozone exposure conditions
   (acute, repeated daily, chronic) specific exposure-dose-response models

Abstract = {{It is generally recognized that fundamental limitations make data
   analysis for dynamic light scattering (DLS) not straight-forward. In
   addition to experimental problems such as multiple scattering, number
   fluctuation and noise, there are intrinsic problems. Data analysis is a
   so-called reverse problem which, owing to the mathematical equations,
   becomes `'allergic'' to noise (an ill-posed inverted problem). In an
   attempt to overcome at least some of these limitations, a software
   solution was developed. This mainly aimed to implement a tool that makes
   it easy to evaluate physically plausible solutions, rather than to
   determine many (less accurate) parameters related to the size
   distribution. One of the major goals was to create a `'whitebox''
   program. The software is in essence an easy-to-use graphical interface
   between user and computer. The most important motivation to apply the
   concept of on-line simulation is the limited information content of DLS
   autocorrelation functions. In the present approach, the user, rather
   than the software, has to evaluate the physically plausible solutions
   and select the most appropriate one. The computer becomes a mirror that
   calculates but leaves the decision making to the user. Using this
   software environment, the resolving power of the technique in ideal and
   noisy conditions was investigated. Results were obtained for monomodal
   samples where the mean diameter seems to be far more reliable than the
   polydispersity. For bimodal samples, the convergence of the solution to
   a monomodal distribution was observed when the noise level increased.
   The goal is to put into perspective the results as obtained in most
   `'black-box'' software without having to use heavy mathematical
   approaches. One of the major applications is the use of the program as
   an interactive introductory tool to become acquainted with the power

Abstract = {{Chromosome aberrations were studied in short-term cultures of
   non-neoplastic renal tissue and tumor tissue in 60 patients, 41 male and
   19 female, with renal cell cancer (RCC), and in normal renal parenchyma
   from two cases, one male and one female, at autopsy with non-kidney
   related disease. Cytogenetic analysis of the non-neoplastic renal tissue
   from the patents with RCC revealed clonal chromosome aberrations in 32
   of 60 (53\%) cases: -Y, +Y, +X, +5, +7, +10, +12, +13, +18, +21, and
   del(9)(q12). In all other cases, non-clonal numerical and structural
   chromosome aberrations were observed, except for three cases of culture
   failure. Forty-two cases of RCC yielded clonal chromosomal
   abnormalities. Trisomy 7 was present in 23 cases, loss of Y in 14,
   trisomy 5 and 12 in three, trisomy 18 in two cases, and trisomy 10 in
   one case. Clonal chromosomal anomalies found in two cases from kidneys
   without neoplasia were trisomy 7, trisomy 12, and trisomy 18 in one
   case, and monosomy of chromosome 15 in the other. The proportion of
   aberrant cells in both cases (with clonal and non-clonal aberrations)
   was, on average, 24\%. Apparently, chromosomal abnormalities only play a
   role in the process of oncogenesis when they are in the appropriate
   stage and lineage of differentiation.}},

Title = {{T-4 accumulation in lysosomes of rat thyroid remnants after subtotal
   thyroidectomy}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{437-445}},

Abstract = {{In chronically stimulated rat thyroids after subtotal thyroidectomy,
   lysosomes increased in number and volume. They contained iodocompounds
   and did not appear in iodine-deficient animals. In this study, we
   analyzed the subcellular localization and the nature of these
   intracellular iodocompounds. Classical subcellular fractions were
   isolated from homogenates of rat thyroids and remnants 14 weeks after
   sham-operation or subtotal thyroidectomy. Two lysosome subpopulations of
   increasing density, a light fraction, lysosomes 2 (L2, density
   1.065-1.08 g/ml) and a dense fraction, lysosomes 1 (L1, density > 1.08
   g/ml) were separated from crude lysosomal particulate fractions (ML) by
   centrifugation in Percoll gradients. Results obtained with thyroids of
   normal rats were used as controls.
   In TSH-stimulated thyroid remnants, total activities of three lysosomal
   enzymes and iodine concentration were increased by 1.6-fold compared
   with thyroids of sham-operated rats. Total iodoprotein-derived T-3 and
   T-4 concentrations, measured after pronase hydrolysis, were slightly
   decreased. Thyroglobulin (Tg) concentration in the supernatant was
   reduced by 50 \%. Iodine, T-3 and T-4 contents of Tg were not modified.
   After differential centrifugation, the iodine excess of remnants
   sedimented with subcellular particulate fractions. The concentration of
   iodine in dense lysosomes (L1) was 6 times that in sham L1. Intact Tg
   did not accumulate in L1. Two thirds of the iodine in L1 was soluble in
   methanol, double the normal proportion, with twice as much iodine
   included in hydrophobic peptides eluted after T-4 by reverse-phase HPLC.
   Although iodoprotein-derived T-4 and T-3 concentrations were decreased
   in the remnant homogenate, they were increased in particles,
   particularly in L1 where they were increased by 8 and 4-fold,
   respectively. In contrast, specific activities of lysosomal enzymes in
   ML and L1 remained unchanged.
   It is concluded that the chronic TSH stimulation of thyroid remnants in
   subthyroidectomized rats receiving a normal iodine supply induces the
   endocytosis of a normal Tg with iodine kept in dense lysosomes. The
   expansion of the lysosomal compartment resulted from a limitation in
   iodopeptides degradation as though secondary lysosomes would be
   overloaded with Tg. The accumulation in L1 of hydrophobic iodopeptides
   and of more iodoprotein-derived T-4 than T-3 suggests that exopeptidases
   involved in the liberation of T-4 become rate-limiting.}},

Abstract = {{In an open, randomized study in an outpatient clinic of a large teaching
   hospital, thirty-one female volunteers with regular cycles and
   established ovulation by ultrasonography were given one of two triphasic
   oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol combined with
   levonorgestrel or desogestrel during six cycles og treatment. The main
   outcome measures were transvaginal ultrasonography and serum E(2) and P
   measurements in pill cycles 1, 3 and 6.
   No ovarian activity was found in 10 subjects. Among the remaining 21
   women who showed ovarian activity, most follicle-like structures
   developed in the pill-free week and decreased in size or disappeared in
   the first pill week. One women taking triphasic desogestrel had evidence
   of a luteinized unruptured follicle and one women taking triphasic
   levonorgestrel had a possible ovulation. The latter women also showed
   symptoms of lower abdominal pain. A statistically significant difference
   in ovarian activity between the two oral contraceptives could not be
   established. The two triphasic oral contraceptives suppressed ovarian
   activity to the same degree. A trend was seen towards increasing ovarian
   activity with duration of use in both treatment groups.}},

Abstract = {{The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the circadian pacemaker in mammals
   and contains a network of arginine-vasopressin-immunoreactive (AVP-ir)
   neurons. AVP-recipient cells contain the V1a class of receptors linked
   to phosphoinositol turnover and protein kinase C (PKC). The present
   study describes the localization of AVP and the four Ca2+-dependent
   PKC-isoforms in the mouse and rabbit SCN. An estimate of the numerical
   density of AVP-ir neurons at the rostral, medial, and caudal level of
   the SCN revealed that the mouse SCN contains more than twice the number
   of AVP-ir neurons than the rabbit SCN. Neurons immunostained for AVP or
   PKC dominated in the dorsomedial and ventrolateral aspects of the mouse
   SCN, while the central area of the SCN revealed only weakly stained
   neurons. The rabbit SCN was characterized by a more homogeneous
   distribution of AVP-ir and PKC-ir neurons. PKC alpha was the most
   abundantly expressed isozyme in both species, whereas the presence of
   the other isoforms differed (mouse: PKC alpha > PKC beta I > > PKC beta
   II > PKC gamma; rabbit: PKC alpha:> PKC beta II greater than or equal to
   PKC gamma> PKC beta I). Clear PKC gamma-positive neurons were only
   observed in the rabbit SCN, while the mouse SCN predominantly contained
   immunolabeled fiber tracts for this PKC isozyme. Astrocytes
   immunoreactive for each PKC isoform. were frequently encountered in the
   rabbit SCN, but were absent in mice. Immunofluorescence double labeling
   showed that numerous AVP-recipient cells in the mouse SCN were
   immunopositive for PKC alpha, and that nearly all AVP-ir neurons express
   PKC alpha abundantly. These results substantiate the putative role for
   PKC alpha in vasopressinergic signal transduction in the SCN. The
   differential expression in degree and cell type of the Ca2+-dependent
   PKC-isoforms in the mouse and rabbit SCN may be related to the
   differences observed in circadian timekeeping between the two species.}},

Title = {{Serodiagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection: An evaluation of a
   commercially available ELISA-IgG}},
Journal = {{NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF MEDICINE}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{272-277}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Our aim was to evaluate a commercially available ELISA
   (Pyloriset(C) IgG, Orion diagnostica, Imphos B.V.) for detection of
   serum IgG antibodies to Helicobacter pylori.
   Methods: Serum samples were taken from 154 Dutch patients. As a
   reference method several biopsy specimens were taken from different
   gastric areas for histological analysis, bacterial culture and direct
   urease testing. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative
   predictive values of the Pyloriset(R) IgG were calculated as compared to
   the reference method.
   Results: Of 154 patients 126 were found to be H. pylori positive (82\%),
   28 were H. pylori negative (18\%). Using a cut-off value at a titre of
   500 U/l (as advised by the manufacturer) we found a sensitivity,
   specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive
   value (NPV) of 81, 89, 97 and 51\%, respectively. Lowering the cut-off
   value to 350 U/l and excluding patients aged above 70 years optimalized
   the performance of the Pyloriset(R) IgG to a sensitivity, specificity,
   PPV and NPV of 92, 96, 99 and 72\%, respectively. In the subgroup of 54
   patients under the age of 45 years a sensitivity, specificity, PPV and
   NPV of 92, 100, 100 and 82\% was found.
   Conclusions: The Pyloriset(R) IgG is a simple and accurate method for
   detecting H. pylori infection in dyspeptic Dutch patients. The
   performance of this assay is improved by lowering the cut-off value
   (test becomes predominantly more sensitive) and excluding older patients
   (test becomes predominantly more specific). Therefore serology might
   eventually replace endoscopy or breath tests in the detection of H.
   pylori infection, especially in the younger age groups.}},

Title = {{Anti-inflammatory HDL becomes pro-inflammatory during the acute phase

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{96}},

Abstract = {{We previously reported that high density lipoprotein (HDL) protects
   against the oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL)
   induced by artery wall cells causing these cells to produce
   pro-inflammatory molecules. We also reported that enzyme systems
   associated with HDL were responsible for this anti-inflammatory property
   of HDL, We now report studies comparing HDL before and during an acute
   phase response (APR) in both humans and a croton oil rabbit model, In
   rabbits, from the onset of APR the protective effect of HDL
   progressively decreased and was completely lost by day three, As serum
   amyloid A (SAA) levels in acute phase HDL (AP-HDL) increased, apo A-I
   levels decreased 73\%, Concomitantly, paraoxonase (PON) and platelet
   activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) levels in HDL declined 71 and
   90\%, respectively, from days one to three, After day three, there was
   some recovery of the protective effect of HDL, AP-HDL from human
   patients and rabbits but not normal or control HDL(C-HDL) exhibited
   increases in ceruloplasmin (CP), This increase in CP was not seen in
   acute phase VLDL or LDL, C-HL incubated with purified CP and re-isolated
   (CP-HDL), lost its ability to inhibit LDL oxidation, Northern blot
   analyses demonstrated enhanced expression of MCP-1 in coculture cells
   treated with AP-HDL and CP-HDL compared to C-HDL, Enrichment of human
   AP-HDL with purified PON or PAF-AH rendered AP-HDL protective against
   LDL modification, We conclude that under basal conditions HDL serves an
   anti-inflammatory role but during APR displacement and/or exchange of
   proteins associated with HDL results in a pro-inflammatory molecule.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the results of 109 piriform sinus (PS) cancers
   treated between 1973 and 1984 by surgery and/or external beam radiation
   therapy (EBRT) in a large comprehensive cancer center, and in particular
   tries to redefine the role of EBRT in the management of these tumors. At
   the time the policy was to start with EBRT to a dose of 40 Gy. A good
   response to a first series was to be continued by EBRT (RT-1); in case
   of poor responding tumors, the primary and neck were to be operated upon
   (RT-S). Poor responders unfit for S or those refusing S were also
   carried to a full course of EBRT (RT-2). The RT-S, RT-1, and RT-2
   actuarial 5-year locoregional relapse-free survival (LR-RFS) and overall
   survival(OS) were 60\%, 40\%, and 20\% and 40\%, 30\%, and 20\%,
   respectively. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis the most
   important prognostic factor appeared to be N-stage, with hazard ratios
   of 1.16 (N1), 2.2 (N2), and 3.3 (N3). The RT-S treatment group fared
   best (hazard ratio 0.5). The risk of relapse for T3,4 was 1.3 times as
   high as opposed to T1,2. For stage I/II (19/21 treated by EBRT only), a
   LR-RFS and OS at 5 years of 60\% and 40\%, respectively, was observed.
   This analysis supports data for stage III/IV PS cancers to be treated by
   surgery combined with EBRT; in stage I/II there might be a role for EBRT
   alone. It is speculated that with further sophistication in
   RT-techniques, the locoregional control rates by EBRT alone could
   improve.}},

Abstract = {{Matrix projections allow identification of those phases in the life
   cycle with a high potential impact on the population growth rate. This
   impact is assessed by the sensitivity or elasticity of the matrix
   elements that are computed from life cycle data such as age-dependent
   survival or fecundity. Covariation among life cycle components, e.g.,
   due to trade-offs, is a main subject of life history theory.
   Sensitivities or elasticities of matrix elements do not take this
   covariation into account. Integrated sensitivities and elasticities
   measure the net effect of a matrix element, combining its direct effect
   and indirect effects through correlation with other matrix elements.
   These measures are related to the selection differentials and expected
   selection responses from quantitative genetics. The use of these
   measures is illustrated with data on disease resistance in a perennial
   weed Plantago lanceolata, and the demography of killer whale pods.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of alendronate (amino-hydroxybutylidene
   bisphosphonate) on biochemical indices of bone turnover and on lumbar
   spinal bone mineral density in 15 postmenopausal women with vertebral
   osteoporosis, Alendronate 7.5 mg daily was administered intravenously as
   a slow infusion for four consecutive days, Treatment was associated with
   a significant decrease in serum calcium (p < 0.01), fasting urinary
   calcium excretion (p < 0.01) and hydroxyproline excretion within several
   days followed a later decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase activity
   that showed a significant reduction at two months after treatment (p <
   0.05). Serum calcium reverted to pretreatment values by the second week
   after infusion, but the decrease in alkaline phosphatase, urinary
   calcium, and hydroxyproline excretion persisted to six months after
   infusion, There was a 3\% mean increase in lumbar bone mineral density
   at six months (p < 0.01), A transient lymphopenia or leucopenia was
   noted in eight patients and a short-lived fever in six, No other side
   effects were observed, This study demonstrates that shortterm exposure
   to high intravenous doses of alendronate induces suppression of bone
   resorption in osteoporosis that persists for at least 6 months after
   infusion. We conclude that a short exposure to high intravenous doses
   induces sustained effects on bone turnover in much the same manner as
   that observed in Paget's disease of bone.}},

Abstract = {{During the MAC-VI campaign, bidirectional reflectance measurements were
   taken on a cotton crop in order to analyze the effects of sun and view
   geometries in the wavebands and in the viewing vertical plane of the
   SPOT High Resolution Visible (HRV) instrument. The bidirectional
   reflectance was measured using a CIMEL SPOT simulation radiometer fixed
   on a goniometric apparatus 2 m above the top of the crop. Data are
   presented in terms of bidirectional reflectance factors relative to
   nadir reflectance for 15 view angles (- 70 degrees to + 70 degrees) and
   for 12 solar zenith (73-26 degrees) angles. Results show major
   variations according to Sun position and backscattering or forward
   scattering observations. The relative reflectance factor of the cotton
   varies from 0.7 to 1.9 throughout one day. Measurements are compared to
   the output of a geometrical model where cotton rows are simulated by
   spheroidal cylinders sitting on an horizontal surface. The relative
   reflectance factor is calculated according to the global structure of
   the rows which is divided into illuminated and shaded facets viewed by
   the radiometer for each view and solar angle. The analysis of
   comparative results shows a good agreement between predicted and
   measured data in the three SPOT HRV wavebands.}},

Abstract = {{More than 2000 km(3) of acid and 9000 km(3) of basic volcanic rocks
   formed during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous in the Coast Range of
   central Chile, between 32 degrees 30'S and 34 degrees S. These rocks,
   which constitute the major part of an similar to 15-km-thick pile of
   alternately marine and continental deposits, issued from volcanic arcs
   situated between a land area with Paleozoic basement in the west and a
   marginal sea in the east. Asthenospheric upwelling led to extension and
   bimodal volcanism; the volcanic products were deposited in intra-arc
   basins subsiding at high rates (100-300 m/m.y.), The source of the
   magmas became more depleted with time due to an increase in degree of
   partial melting, and their compositions were modified by
   subduction-related fluids and contamination with a progressively thinner
   and younger crust. The basic lavas are of high-Ii calc-alkaline to
   shoshonitic affinity, chemically resembling the lavas found in some
   mature island arcs in the western Pacific. The extension and subsidence
   resulted in a low-relief topography close to sea level, in contrast with
   the present-day convergent type of Andean volcanism at the same latitude
   where calc-alcanism intermediate lavas erupt from volcanoes at great
   height above a thick crust.}},

Abstract = {{Three programs are presented which sort data according to any specified
   field within a multifield record. The paper presents the AWK language, a
   small programming language developed under UNIX, and also available
   under MS-DOS. It is effective to manipulate text and mixed types of
   variables. In a first approach, a program coded in structured BASIC, the
   user selects on which field data are going to be sorted. Sorting is done
   using a heapsort process. The second example is the literal translation
   of the former code into the AWK language. This coding is shorter and
   more efficient than the preceding one. A third version is presented,
   which takes advantage of the language and MS-DOS built-in functions. The
   result is a five-line program. Finally, the same process is done using
   the built-in sort function from UNIX, but ported to MS-DOS with expanded
   options. It emphasizes the small number of lines required to develop
   programs that manipulate files using AWK. Source code for these programs
   are listed in the Appendix.}},

   epithelium, mononuclear cells, and basement membrane and was correlated
   with the severity of asthma (P < 0.0005, P < 0.002, and P < 0.007,

Abstract = {{Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular pathogen that enters the
   cytoplasm of infected cells by secreting listeriolysin (LLO), a protein
   that destroys the phagosomal membrane. In infected mice, LLO is a major
   Ag detected by protective, MHC class I-restricted CTLs. Although the
   role of LLO in pathogenesis and host immunity is well established, its
   rate of intracellular synthesis has yet to be determined. Herein we show
   that cytosolic L. monocytogenes secrete LLO at a relatively low rate of
   approximately one molecule per bacterium per minute. Under extracellular
   labeling conditions, the rate of LLO secretion is approximately 50-fold
   higher. Intracellular LLO synthesis suffices, however, for the
   accumulation of 600 to 1000 H-2K(d)-associated LLO 91-99 epitopes per
   cell,We calculate that between four and 11 LLO molecules are degraded
   for each LLO 91-99 epitope bound by H-2K(d). Our findings indicate that
   the antigenicity of LLO, with respect to MHC class I-restricted CTLs,
   cannot be attributed to high levels of intracellular secretion. Rather,
   LLO is a dominant Ag because it is rapidly degraded and very efficiently
   processed into an MHC class I-associated epitope.}},

Abstract = {{We report on our experience with 7 pregnancies in 6 women who previously
   underwent recon struction of the urinary tract with a continent urinary
   diversion using an ileo caecal segment (Mainz-Pouch I),
   ureterosigmoidostomy or bladder augmentation. Urinary tract infection
   and upper tract dilatation were the only complications during pregnancy
   which required bi-lateral nephrostomies in one case. All other sequelae
   were handled conservatively. The continence mechanisms were not
   compromised during pregnancy or delivery. Deliveries were vaginal in two
   cases and by Caesarean section in five. All seven newborn were healthy.
   Pregnancy is not contraindicated after any type of urinary diversion
   including continent reservoirs. Close urological and gynaecological
   observation of these women throughout pregnancy is mandatory. The mode
   of delivery is in the majority of cases guided by obstetric indications.
   If Caesarean section is necessary, the obstetrician should be familiar
   with the intraabdominal situation.}},

Abstract = {{Carboxyamido-triazole (CAI), an agent that targets calcium-sensitive
   signal transduction pathways, has both antiproliferative and
   antimetastatic properties, The objective of this study was to evaluate
   the myelotoxicity of CAI to normal human and murine hematopoietic cells,
   In vitro toxicity of CAI was determined by inhibition of myeloid
   {[}colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-Sm)] and erythroid
   {[}burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-e)] colony formation in clonal
   assays, The effects of oral CAI on CD2F1 mouse marrow and splenic
   cellularity, marrow progenitor content, and peripheral blood cell counts
   were assessed in relation to plasma CAI levels, In vitro, CAI caused a
   concentration-dependent inhibition of CFU-gm and BFU-e colonies
   following continuous drug exposure, Murine CFU-gm and BFU-e were
   inhibited > 90\% by in and 15 mu g/mL CAI, respectively, However,
   suppression of human CFU-Sm and BFU-e did not exceed 65\% at the same
   concentrations, In vivo, CAI reduced the number of CFU-Sm and BFU-e per
   femur after the initial dose and through day 4, Variations in colony
   inhibition paralleled changes in CAI plasma concentrations, While colony
   inhibition increased in vitro with escalating drug concentrations, this
   was not observed in vivo with additional CAI doses, The low toxicity of
   CAI in vivo combined with the significant difference between toxicity
   for human and mouse progenitors in vitro suggests a relatively low
   adverse potential to the bone marrow for this new signal transduction
   inhibitory agent. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The paired infrared organs of Melanophila acuminata consist of 50-100
   sensilla situated at the bottom of a pit next to the coxae of the
   mesothoracic legs, where no exocuticle is developed. Each sensillum is
   accompanied by a wax gland and has a cuticular lens-like spherule
   (diameter 12-15 mu m) bulging out with its upper hemisphere above the
   surface, covered only by a thin cuticle of about 1 mu m. Distal
   processes of two enveloping cells surround the entire spherule in the
   farm of a flattened protoplasmatic layer with the exception of a small
   apical stalk connecting the spherule to the outer cuticle. The spherule
   is innervated by a single sensory neuron of the ciliary type which is
   anchored ventrally with the distal tip of its cylindrical and unbranched
   DOS in the spherule. The insertion of the dendrite, which contains a
   well-developed tubular body, is always eccentric like in a hair
   mechanoreceptor (sensillum trichodeum) and there is no evidence of any
   optical function of the spherule. Three enveloping cells exist, but only
   one - probably the trichogen cell - forms a relatively small outer
   receptor lymph cavity.
   In the posterior wall of the pit - where exocuticle is developed -
   so-called suppressed systems can be found which remain completely below
   the cuticle with their otherwise well-developed spherules. Additionally,
   there is a tendency towards basally flattening and longitudinally
   stretching of spherules which are situated more peripherally. They
   strongly resemble the basal regions of hair mechanoreceptors (sensilla
   trichodea) in their immediate neighbourhood which are also accompanied
   by wax glands. Because of the existence of these transitional stages and
   the great ultrastructural resemblance between infrared receptors and
   hair mechanoreceptors concerning the bauplan of the sensory neurons and
   their mode of innervating the cuticular apparatus, we conclude that the
   infrared sensilla are probably derived from hair mechanoreceptors. Based
   on these results and transmission measurements of infrared radiation
   through the cuticular components of the organ, a model of the possible
   function of the infrared receptor is presented.}},

Abstract = {{This article updates a 1982 article (R. E. Vuchinich, 1982) in which an
   analysis of alcohol abuse that was based on molar behavioral theories of

   the addiction literature that are related to the choice perspective are
   summarized. The molar choice view has been incorporated into human and
   animal research on addictive behaviors other than alcohol abuse, but it
   has had little impact on the alcohol literature. This lack of influence
   on alcohol research is attributed to its poor fit with the Zeitgeist of
   the relevant scientific community rather than to a lack of potential for
   positive contributions. This tension with the Zeitgeist is created by
   the contrast between molecular and molar approaches to studying alcohol
   abuse.}},

Abstract = {{The compound 5-azacytidine has been previously shown to convert cells of
   the rat embryonic fibroblastic cell line, C3H/1OT1/2, into myoblasts,

   periosteum, referred to as mesenchymal stem cells, have been shown to
   differentiate into a number of mesenchymal phenotypes including bone,
   cartilage, and adipocytes. Rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem
   cells were exposed to 5-azacytidine beginning 24 h after seeding
   twice-passaged cells into culture dishes, After an exposure of 24 h,
   long, multinucleated myotubes were observed in some of the dishes 7-11
   days later, Cells containing Sudan black-positive droplets in their
   cytoplasm were also observed, Thus, culture-propagated rat bone marrow
   mesenchymal stem cells appear to have the capacity to be induced to
   differentiate in vitro into myogenic and adipocytic phenotypes, although
   nonmesenchymal cells (rat brain fibroblasts) cannot be so induced, Taken
   together, these observations provide support for the suggestion that
   mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow of postnatal organisms may
   provide a source for myoprogenitor cells which could function in

Abstract = {{Background. There are no guidelines for the appropriate follow-up of
   patients after pulmonary resection for lung cancer.
   Methods. Three-hundred fifty-eight consecutive patients who had
   undergone complete resections of nonsmall cell lung cancer between 1987
   and 1991 were evaluated for tumor recurrence and development of second
   primary tumors. Recurrences were categorized by site (local or distant),
   mode of presentation (symptomatic or asymptomatic), treatment given
   (curative intent or palliative), and duration of overall survival.
   Results. Recurrences developed in 135 patients (local only, 32; local
   and distant, 13; and distant only, 90). Of these, 102 were symptomatic
   and 33 were asymptomatic (most diagnosed by screening chest
   roentgenogram). Forty patients received treatment with curative intent
   (operation or radiation therapy > 50 Gy) and 95 were treated
   palliatively. The median survival duration from time of recurrence was
   8.0 months for symptomatic patients and 16.6 months for asymptomatic
   patients (p = 0.008). Multivariate analysis shows that disease-free
   interval (greater than 12 months or less than or equal to 12 months) was
   the most important variable in predicting survival after recurrence and
   that mode of presentation, site of recurrence, initial stage, and
   histologic type did not significantly affect survival. New primary
   tumors developed in 35 patients.
   Conclusions. Although detection of asymptomatic recurrences gives a lead
   time bias of 8 to 10 months, mode of treatment and overall survival
   duration are not greatly affected by this earlier detection.
   Disease-free interval appears to be the most important determinant of
   survival. Screening for asymptomatic recurrences in patients who have
   had lung cancer is unlikely to be cast-effective. Frequent follow-up and
   extensive radiologic evaluation of patients after operation for lung
   cancer are probably unnecessary.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of semi-sterile panicles in Indica-Japonica crosses of rice
   is due to an allelic interaction at a gamete abortion locus, S-5 on
   Chromosome 6. The S-5(n) allele is referred to as `'wide compatibility
   gene'' (WCG), since one of the parents carrying this allele does not
   show hybrid sterility in the F-1. However, Ketan Nangka, which is a
   donor of S-5(n), showed typical hybrid sterility when it was crossed to
   local varieties from Tai-hu Lake, such as Fengjingdao and Feilaifeng, as
   well as to those from Yunnan Province, such as Dabai, Luanjiaolong and
   Xiaobaigu. A new locus for the sterility in the hg brid between Ketan
   Nangka and the local varieties was detected near the Est-5 locus on
   Chromosome 1, and designated as S-16 following our recent reports on
   S-7, S-8, S-9 and S-15. Three alleles were detected at S-16 as follows:
   Ketan Nangka and the Chinese varieties carried S-16(kn) and S-16(j),
   respectively, and the hybrid genotype of S-16(kn)/S-16(j) showed
   semisterility due to partial abortion of the female gamete carrying
   S-16(j). A Japonica tester variety Akihikari and an Indica tester IR 36
   were found to have a neutral allele S-16(n) at this locus. In addition
   to the unique allele at S-16, the native varieties from Tai-hu and
   Yunnan carried S-7(ai) at a relatively high frequency, while among the
   present varieties in the continent few varieties carried the allele, as
   indicated by the fertility of the hybrids between them and Ketan Nangka.
   These unique alleles in Chinese local varieties appear to reflect their
   common origin and isolation from major varietal groups.}},

Abstract = {{Conceptual modelling in information systems development is the creation
   of an enterprise model for the purpose of designing the information
   system. It is an important aspect of systems analysis. The value of a
   conceptual modelling language (CML) lies in its ability to capture the
   relevant knowledge about a domain. To determine which constructs should
   be included in a CML it would be beneficial to use some theoretical
   guidelines. However, this is usually not done. The purpose of this paper
   is to promote the idea that theories related to human knowledge can be
   used as foundations for conceptual modelling in systems development. We
   suggest the use of ontology, concept theory, and speech act theory.
   These approaches were chosen because: (1) they deal with important and
   different aspects relevant to conceptual modelling and (2) they have
   already been used in the context of systems analysis. For each approach
   we discuss: the rationale for its use, its principles, its application
   to conceptual modelling, and its limitations. We also demonstrate the
   concepts of the three approaches by analysing an example. The analysis
   also serves to show how each approach deals with different aspects of
   modelling.}},

Abstract = {{LaxSr1-xCoO3 (LSCO) (0 < x < 0.5) has attracted much attention recently
   because of its applications as electrodes for fuel cells and for
   ferroelectric memories. In this paper, the microstructure of LSCO grown
   on MgO(001) by metal-organic chemical vapour deposition has been
   analysed by transmission electron microscopy. The LSCO film is dominated
   by an ordered anisotropic perovskite-type structure, denoted as new
   La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (n-LSCO). This structure is the result of lattice
   substitution between La and Sr. The atomic model of the structure is
   determined for the first time. The LSCO him is composed of domains
   exhibiting a {[}001], {[}010] and/or {[}100] directional anisotropic
   n-LSCO structure. Numerous stacking faults with displacement vector of
   1/4{[}011] have been observed. The stacking faults are confined in the
   (100) and (010)planes and are produced by the {[}100] and {[}010] steps
   respectively on the MgO(001) substrate. The (010) and (100) interplanar
   distances in LSCO are constrained owing to lattice mismatch between LSCO
   and MgO and the presence of (010) and (100) planar stacking faults.}},

Abstract = {{Oral administration of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or myelin basic
   protein (MBP) to Lewis rat prior to immunization with AChR or MBP and
   complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) has previously been shown to prevent or
   delay the onset of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) or
   experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), which represent animal
   models of myasthenia gravis and multiple sclerosis, respectively. Here
   we show that Lewis rats immunized with AChR + MBP + CFA developed both
   signs of muscular weakness seen in EAMG and paresis characteristic for
   EAE. This disease was associated with high levels of anti-AChR and
   anti-MBP antibody secreting cells and of AChR- and MBP-reactive
   INF-gamma secreting Th1-like cells in lymph nodes. The diseased rats
   also showed upregulation of AChR- and MBP-induced mRNA expression of
   IFN-gamma in lymph node cells. Oral tolerization with AChR and MBP in
   combination prior to immunization with AChR + MBP + CFA alleviated
   clinical disease as well as AChR- and MBP-specific B cell responses and
   autoantigen-induced IFN-gamma secretion and production, but upregulated
   antigen-induced TGF-beta mRNA expression in lymph node cells. The
   results implicate that oral tolerization simultaneously to more than one
   autoimmune disease-related autoantigen is feasible, and that suppression
   of autoantigen-induced IFN-gamma and augmentation of TGF-beta are
   pivotal in tolerance induction.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous extracts of 10, 20, 40 and 60 g dry leaves of mesquite (Prosopis
   juliflora), in a line of distilled water, were tested for their
   autotoxic effects on seed germination and early seedling growth. With
   the exception of the effect of the least concentrated extract on the
   final seed germination, all extracts reduced seed germination
   percentage, and radicle and hypocotyl lengths considerably, in
   comparison with the distilled water control. This reduction increased
   with the increase of extract concentration throughout the germination
   period. The radicles, which did not elongate at all in the highest
   concentrated extract, were more affected than the hypocotyls. Using
   ground leaves mixed with sand in the ratios of 1:15, 1:10 and 1:5,
   (leaves: sand, by volume) compared to sand as a control, resulted in
   similar findings. The pH and the osmotic potentials of the extracts were
   not low enough to bring about such effects, so it could be concluded
   that the mesquite foliage contains water-soluble allelochemicals which
   could inhibit seed germination and seedling growth of the same species.

Abstract = {{The crystallographic structures of jack bean canavalin and French bean
   phaseolin have been used to construct a homology model of the storage
   vicilin of cocoa. Reported molecular weights for cocoa storage protein
   subunits correlate with proteolysis at the site of a large hydrophilic
   insert in the mature protein. Burial of the hydrophobic amino acids on
   trimer formation is a strongly conserved feature in the vicilin family.
   Histidine residues also sit at the monomer-monomer interfaces of the
   trimer and are likely to contribute to the decreased solubility of cocoa
   vicilin at mild acidic pH, which is generally considered to be caused
   solely by aggregation near to the isoelectric point. Electrostatic
   calculations suggest that such an arrangement of histidine residues in
   the absence of specific counterion binding will not favour the
   particular geometry of trimer formation below neutral pH. Higher order
   aggregates that do not exclude histidine charge from the solvent may be
   favoured, aiding the precipitation of cocoa vicilin at mild acidic pH.
   This suggestion is considered for the vicilin family. The hypothesis
   could contribute to an understanding of the pH and ionic strength
   dependence of vicilin solubility in vitro, and possibly of the behaviour
   of vicilins in the seed storage environment.}},

Abstract = {{Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), a non-destructive optical method, was
   used for the characterization of In0.48Ga0.52P-based thin-layer
   structures. Two types of sample structures were investigated. One was an
   In(0.48)Gao(0.52)P-based single-layer structure and the other was an
   In(0.48)G(0.52)P-based multi-layer structure. Our objective was to
   determine the optical properties of In(0.48)Gao(0.52)P for the
   single-layer samples and to characterize the structures of the
   multi-layer samples, such as layer thicknesses. For each sample
   investigated, the measured spectra were analyzed with an appropriate
   fitting model, which was constructed based on the sample's nominal
   structure. In the determination of the optical properties of
   In(0.48)G(0.52)P, two methods were employed, namely, the harmonic
   oscillator approximation and the wavelength-by-wavelength fitting
   method, which is routinely used in SE analysis, The advantages and
   disadvantages of these two methods are discussed with the results from
   the chosen samples. In the structural characterization, the thickness
   results obtained by SE were compared with the corresponding ones
   determined by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. It is
   shown that, for each sample under study, very good agreement was found
   between the results obtained by the two methods. This in turn
   demonstrates that SE is reliable for thickness characterization of the
   multi-layer samples.}},

   voltage-insensitive, fast-activating,
   4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfo acid (DIDS)-, flufenamic acid-,
   and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB)-blockable outward
   currents showing inactivation at depolarized voltages. LPA activated
   identical currents, also only in cells from wounded corneas. Blocker and
   reversal potential experiments characterized the current as a Cl-current
   (I-Cl). Lysophosphatidylcholine (10 mu M) failed to activate the
   current. An identical current was activated by hyposmotic stimulation in
   cells from control and wounded corneas. Hyposmotic stimulation also
   activated I-Cl in cells from wounded corneas that were unresponsive to
   LPA. We conclude that serum, LPA, and hypotonic stress activate Ia in
   keratocytes from wounded corneas. We also conclude that LPA is a serum
   factor that can activate I-Cl and that hyposmotic activation may work
   through a signaling pathway separate from that of LPA.}},

Abstract = {{Small island states or dependencies have increasingly turned to
   international mass tourism as a strategy for overcoming their
   underdeveloped status. However, mounting criticism of this sector has
   increased the interest in alternative tourism. The Caribbean island of
   Montserrat is well positioned to implement an ecotourism strategy based
   on the island's scenic beauty, biodiversity and historical/cultural
   attributes. This would augment an already unconventional tourism product
   emphasizing low-density residential tourism. The fact that few tangible
   initiatives have so far been taken in the direction of ecotourism is not
   problematic, since careful planning is advisable given the risks
   inherent in any form of tourism, and given existing and potential
   problems which could threaten its viability. A Montserrat Heritage Trail
   network is proposed as the centrepiece of this ecotourism product, while
   various marketing and institutional initiatives are recommended.}},

Abstract = {{In this trial a full-sib family of Clarias gariepinus was raised under
   standard conditions in a warmwater recirculation system. The fish were
   divided into two experimental groups of 1200 individuals each and were
   raised in separate tanks. The groups were fed two experimental diets
   differing in crude protein (group I 40\% and group II 52\% DM) and crude
   fat (group I 8\% and group II 13\% DM). Gross energy was 21.3 and 22.1
   MJ/kg. Slaughtering of 100 fish per group (50 males, 50 females) took
   place after two experimental periods. Besides the significant effect of
   the diets on body weight and size, a higher degree of corpulence was
   observed in group II. Tissue and organ percentages were not influenced,
   except a higher intestinal fat deposition in intensively fed fish. This
   group also showed a higher carcass weight. More expressed differences
   between both feeding alternatives were observed in physical and chemical
   flesh quality criteria. In group I texture of flesh was firm and
   water-binding-capacity was significantly increased in group II. The
   appearance of the filer was affected by the diet. Intensively fed
   catfish showed a tendency to a lighter and more yellowish colour. The
   chemical composition of the flesh indicated a significant increase of
   dry matter caused by higher protein and fat contents in this group. A
   strong influence of sex and fattening age on inner and outer product
   quality was evident. High fat and protein content of the diet has a
   certain influence on product quality in African catfish. It can be
   concluded that there is a clear effect of diet on quantitative criteria
   with a tendency to higher slaughtering yields in intensively fed
   catfish.}},

Abstract = {{Selection in a population of families was investigated in terms of
   family contributions. The outcome of selection can be described by the
   selected proportion of individuals, the genetic gain, and the effective
   family number. There exists an optimal selection procedure, resulting in
   optimal family contributions, which maximizes genetic gain at a given
   selected proportion and minimum effective number. Numerical analyses
   were made for large normally distributed populations over a range of
   heritabilities, selected proportions, and effective numbers. Numerical
   results concerning the relationship between gain and effective number,
   heritability, breeding strategy, and family type (half- or full-sib)
   were discussed. Linear deployment, where family contributions are
   linearly related to the family average values, is an approximation to
   optimal selection, which is simpler to compute. Linear deployment was
   shown to function well as an approximation of optimal selection over a
   wide range of values of selected proportion, effective number, and
   heritability. For some special cases the linear deployment is optimal.

   2,6-(C6H3Pr2)-Pr-i) with PhLi affords the phenyl complex
   {[}eta(2)(N,C)-2,4,6-NC(5)(t)Bu(3)H(2)]Ta(OAr)(2)-Ph (2) in moderate
   yield. The para-substituted phenyl derivatives
   {[}eta(2)(N,C)-2,4,6-NC(5)(t)Bu(3)H(2)]-Ta(OAr)(2)(4-C(6)H(4)X), where X
   = OMe (3), Me (4), Cl(5), and CF3 (6), are prepared similarly from 1 and
   the appropriate aryl Grignard or lithium reagent. Complexes 2-6
   represent the kinetic products of this reaction since, upon their
   thermolysis, aryl migration from metal to ligand occurs and the
   ring-opened compounds Ta{[}=NC(t)Bu=CHC(t)Bu=CHC(t)Bu(4-C(6)H(4)X)]-
   (OAr)(2), where X = H (7), OMe (8), Me (9), Cl (10), and CF3 (11), are
   formed by C-N bond scission. Kinetic and mechanistic studies of the
   {[}eta(2)(N,C)-2,4,6-NC(5)(t)Bu(3)H(2)]Ta(OAr)(2)(4-C(6)H(4)X) -->
   Ta{[}=NC(t)Bu=CHC(t)Bu=CHC(t)Bu(4-C(6)H(4)X)](OAr)(2) rearrangement
   reveal that aryl migration follows clean first-order kinetics, implying
   an intramolecular, endo attack of the migrating aryl group on the
   eta(2)(N,C)-pyridine ligand. An Eyring plot provides activation
   parameters for the
   {[}eta(2)(N,C)-2,4,6-NC(5)(t)Bu(3)H(2)]Ta(OAr)(2)(4-C(6)H(4)OMe) (3) -->
   Ta{[}=NC(t)Bu=CHC-(t)Bu=CHC(t)Bu(4-C(6)H(4)OMe)](OAr)(2) (8)
   rearrangement of Delta H double dagger=+19.2+/-1.3 kcal mol(-1) and
   Delta S-double dagger=127+/-4 cal K-1 mol(-1), for a Delta G(double
   dagger)=+27l3+/-1.3 kcal mol(-1) at 25 degrees C, suggesting a highly
   ordered transition state leading to aryl transfer. Hammett
   considerations for the transformation of complexes 2-6 into 7-11 provide
   rho=-0.58+/-0.10 for the aryl migration reaction. While the sign of rho
   is in agreement with an electrophilic aromatic substitution at the
   migrating phenyl ligand, the small value of rho argues against this
   pathway and against the involvement of the aryl pi framework during
   migration. These data suggport the direct attack of the formal
   {[}C(6)H(4)X](-) sigma bond on C-alpha of the eta(2)(N,C)-pyridine
   ligand and C-N bond scission resulting from migration of the aryl group
   as a sigma-nucleophile. Unlike their alkyl congeners, these ring-opened
   aryl derivatives Ta{[}=NC(t)Bu-CHC(t)Bu=CHC(t)Bu(4-C(6)H(4)X)]-(OAr)(2)
   (7-11) are stable to subsequent rearrangement. The structure of
   Ta{[}=NC(t)Bu=CHC-(t)Bu=CHC(t)BuPh](OAr)(2) (7) indicates a highly
   localized metallacycle with an imido nitrogen linkage characterized by a
   Ta-N-C angle of 145.3(3)degrees and Ta-N bond distance of 1.771(3)
   Angstrom. Although an endo attack of the phenyl group is evident from
   mechanistic studies, the solid-state structure intimates an exo
   addition, and a simple pathway that interconverts endo and exo isomers
   is described to account for this observation. The reactions and
   structures of this model system are discussed in terms of a fundamental
   mechanistic knowledge of C-N bond scission that is relevant to
   hydrodenitrogenation catalysis.}},

Abstract = {{We review the application of spatially explicit models to conservation
   biology, and discuss several problems regarding the use of these models.
   First, it is unclear whether increasing the complexity of spatial models
   to include age structure enhances our ability to predict population
   growth in temporally varying environments. Second, if simulations of
   individual behavior are used to identify options for landscape
   management, predictions about the fate of dispersing organisms are
   likely to be hugely in error unless dispersal attributes are known to a
   far greater degree of accuracy than is reasonable to expect. Third, the
   compelling metaphor of extinction debts resulting from habitat
   destruction in competitive communities stands firm as a cautionary tale
   even when the metapopulation models include multiple trophic levels -
   but the question remains of how widespread and tight are the tradeoffs
   between dispersal capacity and competitive superiority. Given the
   shakiness of spatial models as a foundation for specific conservation
   recommendations, we conclude they may be more useful as a tool for
   exploring the design of spatially-structured monitoring schemes, so that
   management mistakes might be detected before they become irreversible.}},

Abstract = {{Organelles, fibrillar bodies, present in the cytoplasm of all planktic
   foraminifera may have originated as intracellular symbiotic bacteria.
   Those in Pulleniatina obliquiloculata, are squat to elongate ovoids and
   elongate rods with a length of 2-15 mu m and a diameter of 2-5 mu m.
   They are bounded by a membrane-like structure, and sometimes more than
   one fibrillar body is present within a single vacuole (division?). They
   have an electron-lucent( DNA-containing?) central-region, ribosome-like
   and storage-like granules, and are commonly enclosed within a vacuole.
   The fibrillar bodies are polymorphic in outline, but also occur as
   elongate, ovoid and rod-shaped structures that resemble bacteria. These
   organelles, I hypothesize originated as bacterial endo-symbionts and not
   by direct filiation.}},

Abstract = {{The success of current and future air shower arrays in detecting point

   analysis of cosmic ray data taken with the Geiger towers of the HEGRA
   air shower array. The combination of these charged particle detectors
   with the neural net based analysis is characterized by high background
   rejection and signal efficiency. In contrast to the often-quoted
   non-transparency of the net technique, the detailed analysis of the net
   performance gives insight into the physics involved and helps to asses
   the different information that allow gamma/hadron separation.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and movements of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in the
   Svalbard area were studied, using mark and recapture and satellite
   radio-telemetry in the period 1988 to 1994. A total of 172 bears has
   been captured, mostly in the southern and south-eastern parts of
   Svalbard, and 36 females have been tracked by satellite for more than
   330 days. Two bears out of 389 tagged in the period 1966 to 1993 have
   been reported from the Greenland catches, which have been about 100 per
   year in the same period. About 95\% of tracking days and 89\% distance
   covered were from the Norwegian part of the area, the rest were from
   Russian territory. Minimum polygon home-range estimates for 36 females,
   each tracked for more than 330 days, were 69468 +/- 79136 km(2).
   Twenty-five percent (9/36) of the females have moved eastwards into
   Russian territory. Only two of them (6\%), one of them in two different
   years, have landed at Franz Josef Land and one at Novaja Zemlja.
   Information on seasonal fidelity based on the distance from first spring
   capture location to spring locations in consecutive years exists for 38
   female and four male bears. For 30 females, the average distance after
   one year was 149.3 +/- 143.2 km from the first tagging site. After two
   years the average distance was 78.9 +/- 82.5 km for 15 females. after
   three years the distance was 51.1 +/- 29.5 km for nine females and after
   four years 32.0 +/- 31.9 km for four. The regression slope between
   distances and time is negative. The denning locations of 25 of the
   females were recorded based on satellite data. Twenty-four of these were
   al Svalbard and one (4\%) at Franz Josef Land. Satellite data combined
   with mark recapture data show that the polar bears have a very high
   degree of seasonal fidelity to Svalbard. This suggests that the
   migration of polar bears between Svalbard and Greenland and between
   Svalbard and Russia is relatively low and that the Svalbard population
   of polar bears can be managed as a local population.}},

Abstract = {{The `'Streptococcus milleri'' (SMG) group have been shown to possess

   fibrin clots and fibrinogen, giving maximum adhesion values of 16.5\%,
   21.8\% and 151 mol/cell respectively. Members of the species S.
   constellatus produced thrombin-like activity. Lancefield group C SMG
   aggregated rat platelets, a bacterial cell-surface protein acting as
   mediator in the reaction. Most of the in-vitro factors did not correlate
   with each other, an indication that SMC strains possess a wide variety
   of pathogenic properties that may be involved in the production of
   abscesses or endocarditis. However, there was a correlation between the
   binding of large amounts of fibrinogen ( > 100 mol/cell) and the ability

Abstract = {{Chromosomal loss in cancer cells has been observed by nonisotopic in
   situ hybridization using pericentromeric probes. Accurate determination
   of this loss depends upon efficient hybridization and visualization of
   all probe signals in a two-dimensional field. Close association of
   homologous centromeres, reported in various normal and tumor tissues,
   can complicate evaluation and interpretation, resulting in the
   overestimation of actual chromosome loss. Using pericentromeric FISH
   probes for chromosomes 9 (classical and beta-satellite) and 17
   (alpha-satellite), as well as 17q-specific phage probes, we tested the
   frequency of homologous centromere association in normal and malignant
   prostate tissues and lymphoblastoid cells. We found that the
   pericentromeric region of both chromosomes 9 and 17 associated in
   prostate tissues, but only chromosome 9 demonstrated association in the
   lymphoblastoid cells. The association observed for chromosome 9 in both
   cell types appeared to be limited to the classical satellite III-type of
   heterochromatic, pericentromeric DNA. Using a single-copy probe along
   with the chromosome 17-specific pericentromeric probe, we determined
   that the association did not extend to the chromosome arms, but was
   limited to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17. To accurately
   determine chromosome loss, rye advocate the use of single-copy probes in
   addition to, or in place of, pericentromeric probes.}},

Title = {{Contrasting fractionation trends in coexisting continental alkaline

Abstract = {{Two coexisting series of strongly alkaline (basanite-tephrite-phonolite)
   and weakly alkaline (alkali basalt-trachyandesite-trachyte-rhyolite)
   lavas occur in the Cantal volcano (French Massif Central). The parental
   magmas appear to be derived by variable degrees of partial melting of a
   common asthenospheric mantle source. Derivative trachyandesites and
   feldspathoid-bearing tephrites show depletions and enrichments in trace
   elements which indicate that they have been generated by broadly similar
   fractionation processes, related to the removal of a mineral extract,
   from the parental alkali basalts and basanites respectively, dominated
   by, olivine, clinopyroxene, amphibole, apatite and titaniferous
   magnetite +/- plagioclase. In the most extreme differentiates
   (trachytes, rhyolites and phonolites) fractionation of zircon, sphene
   and alkali feldspar exerts a major control an the trace element
   characteristics of the magmas.
   Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data for the two magma series suggest the importance
   of combined assimilation-fractional crystallization processes (AFC)
   within the lower crust in their evolution. Modelling demonstrates that
   the AFC process amplifies the original compositional differences between
   the parent magmas. After similar to 55\% crystallization in the strongly
   alkaline series and 65\% in the weakly alkaline series crustal
   contamination ceases, although fractional crystallisation continues
   beyond this point to produce the most evolved differentiates (phonolites
   and rhyolites). This may reflect progressive sealing of the
   lower-crustal magma reservoirs. The tendency of the magmas to follow
   over- or under-saturated evolutionary trends, producing rhyolitic and
   phonolitic residua respectively, appears to be established at the early
   stages of magmatic differentiation, reflecting inherent differences in
   the compositions of the parental magmas.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the recent large-scale entry of women into
   policing in one Australian state following a period of supposed major
   organisational and philosophical reform, in the Queensland Police
   Service. It focuses upon the early experiences of women recruits and
   their thoughts about their futures. The research literature shows that
   women have usually encountered considerable resistance when trying to
   establish themselves in police organisations both locally and overseas.
   In view of this, an important aim of the study is to try to determine
   whether there are any signs of fundamental change for women entering
   policing in the 1990s. The evidence suggests that while men and women
   entrants have much in common, there are some significant biographical
   and anticipatory differences. The study concludes that continuity rather
   than change is likely to characterise the experiences of women entering
   policing; obstacles to full integration persist. The situations of women
   recruits are discussed under five themes which encompass: continuity of
   experiences, physicality, exclusion, ambivalence and coping strategies.}},

   (TCP), numbers of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and the vertical
   profiles of sulfate, thiosulfate, acid volatile sulfides (AVS) and
   chromium reducible sulfides (CRS) were measured within 10-cm-deep
   13-week-old planted and unplanted paddy soil microcosms. The soil pole
   water of unplanted microcosms showed sulfate concentrations <110 mu M
   and no delectable thiosulfate. The upper layers of planted microcosms,
   in contrast, showed concentrations of sulfate and thiosulfate that
   reached > 300 mu M and > 150 mu M. respectively, indicating that
   oxidation of reduced sulfur was stimulated in this zone (the loot zone
   of the I icr plants). On the other hand, concentrations of AVS were also
   much higher in the upper layers of planted versus unplanted microcosms
   indicating that reduction of oxidized sulfur compounds was also
   stimulated in this zone. The highest AVS and CRS concentrations were 1.6
   and 1.3 mu mol cm(-3) soil, respectively. Indeed, planted soils showed a
   two- to five-fold higher SRP and TCP (< 2.8 and < 1.9 mu mol cm(-3)
   d(-1), respectively) compared to unplanted microcosms (< 0.56 mu mol
   cm(-3) d(-1)). Concentrations of acetate and lactate were also higher,
   especially in the uppermost soil layers. However, SRP and TCP were only
   stimulated by the addition of hydrogen. SRB were enumerated by the MPN
   technique using hydrogen, acetate, propionate, lactate, butyrate,
   succinate and benzoate as electron donors. Vertical profiles indicated
   that the SRB were relatively homogenously distributed in the paddy soil
   microcosms. The SRB populations growing on H-2, propionate and succinate
   appeared to be higher in planted than in unplanted paddy soil microcosms
   although at a relatively low statistic significance (alpha < 0.1).
   Enrichment cultures showed a relatively high diversity of
   sulfate-reducing bacteria with respect to utilization of at least eight
   different substrates out of 21 substrates tested. The genera observed
   included Desulfouibrio, Desulfotomaculum, Desulfobulbus, and
   Desulfobotulus. Our results indicate a very dynamic cycling of both
   reduced and oxidized sulfur species in the rhizosphere of planted paddy

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine the influence of the systemic
   renin-angiotensin system on the gene expression of atrial natriuretic
   peptide in rat hearts. The renin-angiotensin system was stimulated (1)
   by unilateral renal artery clipping (0.2-mm clip, 2 days), producing a
   fourfold increase of circulating plasma renin activity and increasing
   blood pressure. (2) by furosemide infusion with simultaneous salt
   substitution, increasing plasma renin activity values to 45 ng
   angiotensin I/h per milliliter without changing blood pressure; or (3)
   by administration of the calcium antagonist amlodipine, which increased
   plasma renin activity values to 42 ng angiotensin I/h per milliliter and
   lowered blood pressure. Unilateral renal artery clipping increased
   atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA levels approximately 20-fold in the left
   ventricles and approximately twofold in the right ventricles and atria.
   Furosemide infusion had no effect on cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide
   mRNA levels, and in amlodipine-treated rats, cardiac atrial natriuretic
   peptide mRNA levels decreased to 30\% of control values. The increase of
   atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA in the ventricles during renal artery
   clipping was blunted by the administration of the angiotensin-converting
   enzyme inhibitor ramipril, which also attenuated the blood pressure
   rise. In clipped rats amlodipine did not change elevated plasma renin
   activity values but abolished the rise of blood pressure and also
   attenuated the rise of atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA in the hearts.
   These findings indicate that an increase of the activity of the systemic
   renin-angiotensin system does not result in an obligatory change in
   cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide expression. Moreover, our results
   suggest that activation renin-angiotensin system by renal artery
   stenosis preferentially stimulates left ventricular atrial natriuretic
   peptide gene expression by an angiotensin II-dependent mechanism that
   could be associated with the induction of myocardial hypertrophy.}},

Abstract = {{These studies examined whether the luminal flow dependency of chloride
   absorption in the 81 proximal tubule during glomerulotubular balance was
   due to change in active and/or passive transport of chloride. Using in
   vivo microperfusion in the Munich-Wistar rat and an essentially pure
   sodium chloride perfusate (devoid of bicarbonate and organic solutes),
   we found that an increase in luminal perfusion rate from 30 to 45 nl/min
   caused stimulation of total chloride absorption (active plus passive) by
   87 peq . mm(-1). min(-1) (632 +/- 17 to 719 +/- 11, P < 0.001). When
   cyanide was added to this perfusate to eliminate active transport, the
   flow-induced change in passive transport was 58 peq . mm(-1). min(-1)
   (479 +/- 9 to 537 +/- 11, P < 0.001). The cyanide-inhibitable active
   transport component was therefore 29 peq . mm(-1). min(-1). With
   elimination of the transepithelial chloride gradient and, hence, passive
   transport by isethionate substitution, active transport increased by 63
   peq . mm(-1). min(-1) (121 +/- 4 to 184 +/- 7, P < 0.001) as flow rate
   rose from 30 to 45 nl/min. Removal of organic solutes from a glomerular
   ultrafiltrate-like perfusate had a minimal effect on flow-induced change
   in chloride transport (190 vs. 207 peq . mm(-1)min(-1)), In conclusion,
   flow-dependent active and passive chloride transport in the 81 proximal
   tubule may both contribute to normal glomerulotubular balance.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study examines the extent to which preventive and
   promotive advice is integrated into the clinical practice of doctors.
   Study design: Using a cross-sectional descriptive survey design, the
   study compares the performance of doctors in giving healthy lifestyle
   advice for five clinical conditions, their perceived practice and their
   rating on the importance of disseminating selected key lifestyle
   messages,
   Data extraction methods: A total of 28 volunteers were trained to
   simulate the five clinical conditions which required related health
   advice and to rate the doctors' performance with the use of a prepared
   checklist, Simulated patient ratings of 343 doctor-patient encounters
   provided the data on doctors' health promotion efforts for the selected
   clinical conditions. A post-visit self-administered questionnaire survey
   of a sub-sample of 100 doctors gave an insight into their opinions and
   perceived practice.
   Principal findings: Only in 49\% of the instances was a health promotion
   message given, The doctors' encouraging interest in health education and
   health promotion and their positive perceptions of their volume of
   healthy lifestyle counselling were not borne out in actual clinical
   practice,
   Conclusions: The results indicate that the extent of preventive and
   promotive health education in both the public and private health sectors
   is unacceptably low, The matter needs to be addressed through training
   programmes as well as the formulation of clear health promotion
   priorities and strategies in Malaysia.}},

   daily number of puffs of beta(2) agonist and they were assessed at weeks
   4 and 8. At the end of the treatment, MIC was repeated again. Patients
   receiving budesonide showed a significant improvement in airway
   responsiveness compared with those receiving placebo (p <0.05). They
   also showed a significant improvement in asthma severity score and a
   significant decrease in beta(2) agonist bronchodilator use. This study

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an
   adrenal/gonadal androgen, can act centrally to reduce energy intake in a
   model of genetic obesity, the Zucker fatty rat. To investigate a
   possible mechanism of action.
   DESIGN: Two experiments were performed in lean and obese female Zucker
   rats. In the first experiment, 24 h following administration of i.p.
   DHEA (200 mg/kg), three hypothalamic regions {[}lateral hypothalamus
   (LH), ventromedial nucleus (VMH), and paraventricular nucleus (PVN)]
   were analyzed for monoamine neurotransmitter concentrations. In the
   second experiment, DHEA (50 mu g) was administered by i.c.v. injection.
   Energy intake for the following day was measured.
   MEASUREMENTS: In the first experiment, concentrations of norepinephrine
   (NE), epinephrine (EPI), dopamine (DA), serotonin (5HT), the serotonin
   metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured. Ratios of
   5HT/5HIAA were calculated. In the second experiment, kilojoules consumed
   per 24 h were calculated.
   RESULTS: All LH monoamines, and PVN DA, displayed lower concentrations
   in obese than lean control rats. DHEA treatment reversed these
   reductions in obese rats without affecting lean rats. DHEA increased VMH
   EPI in obese rats only. DHEA increased PVN NE in both lean and obese
   rats. I.C.V. DHEA decreased energy intake in obese but not lean rats.
   CONCLUSION: The i.c.v. results suggest that DHEA exerts a phenotype
   specific, centrally mediated inhibitory effect on food intake. In
   addition, in doses previously shown to reduce energy intake in obese but
   not lean rats, i.p. DHEA reversed reduced concentrations of many
   monoamines, particularly in the LH, in obese animals only. These latter
   changes provide indirect evidence to suggest that these central
   neurotransmitters may play an important role in the antiobesity effect
   of DHEA in the Zucker fatty rat.}},

Abstract = {{Almost fifty years have passed since 1949 when Dowling (14) used an
   egg-saline medium, developed by Hammond (26) for mouse embryos to
   culture 8-cell bovine embryo's to the 16-cell stage. These investigators
   certainly must have queried the normality of the cultured embryos with
   their variations in cell shape and color observed. With the advances of
   in vitro systems and the improvement of instrumentation, investigators
   are faced with the same fundamental questions asked some fifty years
   ago. Namely, how viable are embryos that are manipulated in vitro, as
   compared to embryos in vivo? Compounding this difficult question is the
   lack of basic information on metabolic processes of in vivo embryos.
   Once the embryos are removed from the maternal environment for study,
   they are exposed to myriad in vitro conditions which can negatively
   effect metabolism or morphology. This manuscript is a review of the
   literature concerning studies that compared in vitro-manipulated to in
   vivo-produced preimplantation embryos from the farm species. The authors
   apologize in advance for studies which were inadvertently omitted and
   acknowledge the diligent work of investigators who have published in
   this most challenging and important area of embryo development.}},

Abstract = {{1 (-)-Caryachine, isolated from the plant (Cryptocarya chinensis),
   increased the contractility of atrial and right ventricular strips and
   significantly suppressed the reperfusion arrhythmias in adult rabbit
   heart (ED(50) = 1.27 mu M)
   2 Data obtained by the whole-cell voltage clamp technique has shown that
   (-)-caryachine causes a negative shift of the steady-state Na channel
   inactivation and a slower rate of recovery from inactivation. The
   maximal Na current amplitude decreased to 67+/-7\%, 29+/-8\% and
   12+/-5\% after 0.5, 1.5 and 4.5 mu M (-)-caryachine, respectively.
   3 This agent also had effects on the time- and voltage-dependent K
   currents. (-)-Caryachine markedly suppressed the 4-AP-sensitive
   transient outward current (I-to). However, it produced very little
   voltage-dependent shift in inactivation. After 0.5, 1.5 and 4.5 mu M of
   the compound, the respective value of I,, elicited at +60 mV was
   80+/-7\%, 45+/-8\% and 15+/-3\%. At higher concentrations, the inward
   rectifier K current (I-Kl) was also inhibited but to a much smaller
   extent. Its slope conductance after 0.5, 1.5 and 4.5 mu M (-)-caryachine
   was reduced to 71+/-9\%, 51+/-12\% and 42+/-11\%, respectively. The
   outward hump of inward rectification was not changed.
   4 In contrast, the L-type Ca current was not significantly changed by
   (-)-caryachine.
   5 Electrophysiological studies in perfused whole heart preparations
   revealed that (-)-caryachine increased the intra-atrial conduction
   interval and also prolonged the atrial refractory period. No
   proarrhythmic effects were induced during the infusion of this compound
   (up to 13.5 mu M)
   6 We conclude that (-)-caryachine predominantly blocks the Na and I-to
   currents. These changes alter the electrophysiological properties of the
   heart and terminate the induced ventricular arrhythmias. The relatively
   selective I-to inhibition, safety margin of I-Kl suppression and lack of
   effect on I-Ca-L will provide an opportunity to develop an effective
   antiarrhythmic agent with positive inotropy as well as low proarrhythmic

   The proposed technique is based on a backstepping procedure to construct
   a time-varying singularly perturbed system and the underlying
   theoretical approach by the Lyapunov theory. The main result is that a
   dynamically parametrized state feedback is developed to cancel the
   output tracking error. Finally, an illustrative example through a

Abstract = {{Meningacoccal septic shock (MSS) is complicated by activation of

   children with MSS. Activation was assessed upon admittance to the

   factor XII- (FXII), prekallikrein- and factor XI (FXI) antigen levels,
   as well as on the detection of FXTIa-FXIa inhibitor, FXIIa-C1-inhibitor,
   and kallikrein-C1-inhibitor complexes, respectively. Levels of FXII,
   prekallikrein and FXI were reduced to about 50\% in all patients on
   admission, and were significantly higher 48 h later. FXIIa-C1-inhibitor
   complexes were elevated in 7 patients, and kallikrein-C1-inhibitor
   complexes in 2 patients. FXIa-alpha(1)-antitrypsin complexes were
   elevated in all patients, FXIa-C1-inhibitor complexes in nine, and

Abstract = {{Experiments on rock materials and volatile components provide an array
   of phase equilibrium boundaries, giving the depth-temperature framework
   for the phase transitions experienced by rock masses as they move up or
   down within the Earth in response to the dynamic processes of mantle
   convection and plate tectonics. Sub-solidus phase transitions in mantle
   materials correlate well with upper mantle structure determined from
   seismic studies, but debate continues about whether there is a change in
   composition at some seismic boundaries. The interface at 650 km
   correlates with the transformation of most minerals into the perovskite
   structure, which may have significant effects on mantle dynamics. Recent
   research on mantle xenoliths has been concerned with extension of
   standard thermometers and barometers to higher pressures and their
   practical assessment, along with the development and refinement of new
   geothermobarometers. The experimental partial melting of mantle
   peridotite has been elucidated by detailed studies of model systems and
   new experimental techniques. Parameterization of the data makes
   prediction possible. The origin of MORBs involves a complex process of
   fractional fusion. Evidence from static olivine flotation experiments
   and shock wave compression experiments on molten komatiite indicates
   that the densities of mantle melts may exceed that of the residual rock
   at depths greater than 400 km, which would prohibit ascent of the magma.
   Recent investigations have identified many dense hydrous magnesian
   silicates (DHMS), stable through the upper mantle between similar to 300
   and 650 km, and reaching the peridotite-volatile solidus curve through
   part of this interval. The near-solidus liquid composition in
   peridotite-CO2-H2O above similar to 2 GPa is carbonatitic (calcic
   dolomite), potentially a powerful agent for metasomatism. Experimental
   studies of trace element distributions between mantle minerals and
   carbonatitic liquids are beginning to permit quantification.
   Determination of the effect of reduced oxygen fugacity has introduced
   mantle scenarios with melting induced by redox changes. There is
   indirect experimental evidence that the solidus may terminate at a
   critical end-point at depths of a few hundred kilometers. Recent
   experiments related to subduction of oceanic crust include measurements
   of liquid composition from the melting of H2O-undersaturated peridotite,
   the vapour-absent melting of amphibolite, and partial melting of pelagic
   clays. Much H2O is expelled during subduction, but the current estimates
   of low temperatures support the deep subduction and long-term storage in
   the mantles of both H2O and CO2.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperlipidemia and high blood pressure have clearly evolved as major
   risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. High fat intake, obesity, and
   cigarette smoking have been shown to be root causes of such risk.
   Ecologic correlations and case-control studies have provided evidence
   that hyperlipidemia and obesity certainly have their beginnings during
   childhood, and that the onset of cigarette smoking at a young age
   escalates the risk for coronary artery disease. Thus, preventive
   measures will have the greatest impact when applied at an early age. In
   fact, several fine comprehensive school health education programs (eg,
   Health Ahead/Heart Smart, Know Your Body) have demonstrated that
   behavior can be changed and that the risk factors for heart disease can
   be reduced. Such programs are most cost effective when they are
   multifactorial in nature and address health promotion on a broad scale.
   Therefore, comprehensive school health education programs should be a
   component of national health-care reform. The investment in early health
   education will pay off by deterring chronic diseases in adulthood and
   will thus contribute to a healthier nation.}},

Abstract = {{Coagulation factor V (FV) and factor VIII (FVIII) are usually decreased

   volunteers stimulate activation of the fibrinolytic, contact and
   coagulation systems, but not clinical DIG. Following the administration
   of endotoxin (4 ng/kg) to normal volunteers (n = 15), we applied new
   assays for FV antigens using monoclonal antibodies to the activation
   peptide (C1) and to the light chain of FV. At 5 hours, FV coagulant
   activity was significantly decreased (64 +/- 9\%), as was the FV light
   chain antigen (74 +/- 6\%), without a change in factor V C1 antigen or
   total protein C. In contrast, FVIII coagulant activity was greater than
   preinfusion levels at 2-5 hours. The decrease in FV activity may be due
   to APC cleavage of FV heavy chain, but the loss of light chain antigen
   suggests that plasmin and/or calpain also contribute. APC may not be the
   only enzyme responsible for cofactor inactivation. FV is one of the most
   sensitive markers, even reflecting subclinical activation of

Abstract = {{Two days of the Antarctic winter (20 and 21 June 1986) were chosen to
   study some turbulent parameters in this particular boundary-layer.
   Richardson number, Monin-Obukhov length, eddy transfer coefficients,
   turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent intensities, friction velocities and
   sensible heat flux at three levels (5, 17 and 32 m) were considered. The
   results show how the stability at 17 and 32 m influences the turbulent
   transfer at 5 m. The shear of wind is the main mechanism to produce
   mixing in the lower atmosphere at Antarctica, and thermal inversions
   associated to surface cooling develop with winds < 10 m(s-1) at 5 m. The
   possible influence of internal gravity-waves on the atmospheric
   boundary-layer during strong stable stratification is studied.}},

Abstract = {{Gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) may be related to
   coordinating the function of osteoblasts during bone mineralization,
   Since an alkaline pH supports mineral deposition while an acidic pH
   promotes mineral dissolution, it was investigated whether GJIC is
   altered by changes in extracellular pH (pH(0)) Functional GJIC was
   assessed by fluorescent dye transfer after microinjection, and connexin
   protein abundance was examined by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
   in MC3T3-E1 cells, a model of osteoblast-like cells, The percent of
   cells coupled by GJIC was found to be 40.7\% (24 of 59 injected cells)
   at pH 6.9, 72.2\% (26 of 36) at pH 7.2, and 92.8\% (26 of 28) at pH 7.6.
   A decrease in GJIC was detectable by 30-60 minutes of exposure to a
   pH(0) of 6.9. Decreased gap junction communication was also found in
   cells after 3, 8, and 24 h of incubation in a bicarbonate-CO2 system at
   an ambient pH of 6.9. Connexin protein abundance experiments showed that
   at after exposure to a pH of 6.9 for 2.75 h, the specific band(s) at
   41-43 kD were fainter compared with these same band(s) at pH 7.2 and
   7.6. There was no significant difference in band densities at pH 7.2 and
   7.6. Determination of intracellular pH (pH(i)) showed that it was
   similar to pH(0) after 2.75 h of incubation at each ambient pH. When pH,
   was clamped at 6.9 or 7.2, there was a time-dependent decrease in the
   gap junction coupling frequency at a pH(i) of 6.9 when pH(0) was 7.2.
   Steady-state mRNA levels were decreased at pH(0) 6.9 but were unchanged
   at either pH(0) 7.2 or 7.6. Our conclusions are that (1) longer
   incubations (greater than or equal to 2.75 h) at low pH(0) decrease GJIC
   which in part may be due to a decrease in connexin protein abundance
   perhaps as a result of a decrease in connexin steady-state mRNA
   expression; (2) GJIC inhibition or augmentation found at low and high
   pH(0), respectively, suggests that gating of the GJ channel by pH may
   also occur; (3) pH(0)-induced alterations in GJIC in the MC3T3-E1
   osteoblastic model are related to concomitant changes in pH(i).}},

Abstract = {{Background. Lethal midline granuloma is now considered to be a malignant
   lymphoma derived from peripheral T cells or from natural killer cells.
   The therapeutic outcome of nasal T-cell lymphoma (NL) treated by
   conventional chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is poor, although
   some patients have a good response to radiotherapy. To clarify the
   mechanisms of drug resistance, the expression of P-glycoprotein
   (P-gp)/MDR1, which is the product of the multidrug resistance (MDR) 1
   gene, and MDR3 mRNA in NL cells, were examined.
   Methods. Ten Japanese patients with NL were studied. Nine of these
   patients were examined before therapy. P-glycoprotein expression and
   phenotypes of lymphoma cells were examined by immunohistochemical
   staining using UIC2 as an anti-P-gp monoclonal antibody. In one case,
   the Rhodamine-123 efflux test was performed. MDR1 and MDR3 mRNA were
   detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
   Results. Nine of the 10 patients were P-gp positive. In one of nine,
   functional P-gp expression was observed. MDR1 mRNA was detected in all
   seven examined patients with P-gp positive NLs, whereas MDR3 mRNA was
   negative. Retrospectively, patients who received chemotherapy alone had
   poorer outcome than those treated by combination chemotherapy after
   irradiation.
   Conclusion. The poor prognosis for patients with NL treated with
   chemotherapy may be explained by P-gp expression of the NL calls.}},

Abstract = {{Ste7p and Mkk1p are MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase) family members that function
   in the mating and cell integrity signal transduction pathways in
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We selected STE7 and MKK1 mutations that
   stimulated their respective pathways in the absence of an inductive
   signal, Strikingly, serine-to-proline substitutions at analogous
   positions in Ste7p (position 368) and Mkk1p (position 386) were
   recovered by independent genetic screens, Such an outcome suggests that
   this substitution in other MEKs would exhibit similar properties, The
   Ste7p-P-368 variant has higher basal enzymatic activity than Ste7p but
   still requires induction to reach full activation. The higher activity
   associated with Ste7p-p(368) allows it to compensate for defects in the
   cell integrity pathway, but it does so only when it is overproduced or
   when Ste5p is missing. This behavior suggests that Ste5p, which has been
   proposed to be a tether for the kinases in the mating pathway,
   contributes to Ste7p specificity.}},

Abstract = {{The Salmonella typhimurium fimA gene is controlled bg several ancillary
   fim genes. One of these genes, fimZ, appears to be involved in
   increasing the expression of fimA. A fimZ mutant of S. typhimurium was
   constructed by allelic exchange, and this mutant was found to be
   nonfimbriate. The fimZ mutant demonstrated decreased levels of fimA
   expression compared with the parental strain when both were grown under
   conditions favoring fimbrial expression, An examination of the predicted
   amino acid sequence, deduced from the nucleotide sequence of fimZ,
   indicated that the FimZ polypeptide possessed a DNA binding motif,
   Bacterial lysates, derived from strains transformed with recombinant
   plasmids possessing a fimZ gene, demonstrated DNA binding activity with
   a fragment containing the fimA promoter, Lysates without a FimZ
   polypeptide did not exhibit any binding activity, These data are
   consistent with FimZ being a transcriptional activator of fimA, and FimZ
   acts by binding to the promoter region.}},

   We observed about 22\% P-wave velocity dispsersion and 15\% S-wave
   velocity dispersion within this range of wavelength to scale ratios. We
   observed no scale effects on the static Young's modulus of the same

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Incidence of aseptic loosening of hip prostheses is
   increasing in recent years. Previous studies suggested involvement of
   proteinases and cytokines in the accelerated bone lysis associated with
   loosening.
   EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To investigate the role of matrix
   metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the loosening we immunolocalized MMP-1
   (tissue collagenase), MMP-2 (gelatinase A), MMP-3 (stromelysin-1), MMP-9
   (gelatinase B) and their common inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of
   metalloproteinases (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2), in the bone-prosthesis interface
   membranes. In situ hybridization was performed for the detection of
   MMP-9 mRNA in the membranes. The amounts of these MMPs and TIMPs in the
   tissue were measured by the sandwich enzyme immunoassays and enzyme
   activities assayed using radiolabeled collagen, gelatin, and
   carboxymethylated transferrin substrates. We also examined the ability
   of the cells from interface membranes to resorb mouse calvaria bone.
   RESULTS: The membranes obtained from the loose bone-implant interface
   were composed of fibrous granulation tissue containing numerous
   multinucleated giant cells with high density polyethylene debris.
   Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the giant cells were
   strongly positive for MMP-9 and weakly for MMP-1. Expression of MMP-9
   mRNA in the cells was demonstrated by in situ hybridization. MMP-2 and
   TIMP-2 were immunolocalized mainly in the fibroblasts. TIMP-1 was
   localized in the endothelial cells of the blood vessels and weakly in
   fibroblasts. However, MMP-3 was almost negative in the membrane tissue.
   Sandwich enzyme immunoassays showed that MMP-9 levels are significantly
   higher in both homogenates and culture media of the cup and stem
   interface membranes than the control pseudocapsule. Gelatinolytic
   activity was also remarkably higher in the membrane samples than the
   control. The cells isolated from the membranes had no ability to resorb
   calvaria bone.
   CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that MMP-9 is produced by the
   multinucleated giant cells appeared by the reaction to polyethylene
   debris in the interface membranes. This proteinase may play a role in
   degradation of the extracellular matrix macromolecules present around
   and on the surface of the bone trabeculae, facilitating the osteoclastic
   bone resorption.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new information processing model for engineering
   using a vibrating potential field. In the field of engineering, the
   conventional information processing models are based on central control
   processing and parallel distributed processing. Such conventional models
   are programmed by a sequence of procedures through internal connections
   between specified processing units, and for this reason it is difficult
   for all the units to express unity of purpose, enlarge of the system and
   observe the status of internal connections. However, information
   exchange between all depends on using field information and information
   processing of living units is a self-organizing process that can be
   achieved using field information. Many examples are found in nature
   where high-performance information processing can be attained without
   supervision. An analogous model of this self-organized information
   processing can give a useful control mechanism for PDP. This paper
   proposes a new information processing model using the vibrating
   potential field and discusses the results of computer simulations using
   this model.}},

Abstract = {{The hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)
   is an optional envelope protein present in only some MHV isolates. Its
   expression is regulated by the copy number of a UCUAA pentanucleotide
   sequence present in the leader sequence of the viral genomic RNA. The
   functional significance of this viral protein so far is not clear. In
   this report, we compared the neuropathogenicity of two MHV isolates,
   JHM(2) and JHM(3), which express different amounts of HE protein.
   Intracerebral inoculation of these two viruses into C57BL/6 mice showed
   that JHM(2), which expresses an abundant amount of HE protein, was more
   neurovirulent than JHM(3), which expresses very little HE.
   Histopathology showed that early in infection, JHM(2) infected primarily
   neurons, while JHM(3) infected mainly glial cells. JHM(3) eventually
   infected neurons and caused a delayed death relative to JHM(2)-infected
   mice, suggesting that the progression of JHM(3) infection in the central
   nervous system was slower than JHM(2). In vitro infection of JHM(3) in
   primary mixed glial cell cultures of astrocyte-enriched cultures yielded
   higher virus titers than JHM(2), mimicking the preferential growth of
   THM(3) in glial cells in vivo. These findings suggest that the reduced
   neuropathogenicity of JHM(3) may correlate with its preferential growth
   in glial cells. Sequence analysis showed that the S genes of these two
   viruses are identical, thus ruling out the S gene as the cause of the
   difference in neuropathogenicity between these two viruses, We conclude
   that the HE protein contributes to viral neuropathogenicity by
   influencing either the rate of virus spread, viral cell tropism or both.}},

   potential (ODP = 0.0001) than the 1,1,1-TCA (ODP = 0.1) and allows easy
   replacement of the 1,1,1-TCA. The interface characteristics were
   superior or comparable to the conventional pyrogenic oxidation. The
   dielectric breakdown reliability was improved by addition of t-DCE. The
   optimum t-DCE concentration depends on preoxidation cleaning condition.
   In the case of the SCl(NH4OH:H2O2:H2O) and subsequent DHF (HF:H2O)
   preoxidation cleaning, the optimum t-DCE concentration is 5 weight
   percent (w/o). In the case of the SCl preoxidation cleaning, the best
   dielectric characteristics are shown at higher t-DCE concentration;
   however, the recommended t-DCE concentration is 5 w/o from the view
   point of balance of cost and performance. The high quality and highly
   reliable oxide film can be successfully formed by t-DCE added oxidation,
   which also minimizes the ozone layer influence. The t-DCE is a primary
   candidate to replace the 1,1,1-TCA.}},

Abstract = {{Palmitoylation can regulate both the affinity for membranes and the
   biological activity of proteins, To study the importance of the
   palmitoylation of the Src-like tyrosine protein kinase p56(kk) in the
   function of the protein, Cys-3, Cys-5, or both were mutated to serine,
   and the mutant proteins were expressed stably in fibroblasts and T
   cells, Both Cys-3 and Cys-5 were apparent sites of palmitoylation in Lck
   expressed in fibroblasts, as only the simultaneous mutation of both
   Cys-3 and Cys-5 caused a large reduction in the incorporation of {[}H-3]
   palmitic acid, The double mutant S3/5Lck was no Longer membrane bound
   when examined by either immunofluorescence or cell fractionation. This
   indicated that palmitoylation was required for association of Lck with
   the plasma membrane, Since the S3/5Lck protein was myristoylated,
   myristoylation of Lck is not sufficient for membrane binding, When
   Cys-3, Cys-5, or both Cys-3 and Cys-5 were changed to serine in
   activated F505Lck, palmitoylation of either Cys-3 or Cys-5 was found to
   be necessary and sufficient for the transformation of fibroblasts and
   for the induction of spontaneous, antigen-independent interleukin-2
   production in the T-helper cell line DO-11.10. Nonpalmitoylated F50Lck
   exhibited little activity in vivo, where it did not induce elevated
   levels of tyrosine phosphorylation, and in vitro, where it was unable to
   phosphorylate angiotensin in an in vitro kinase assay. These findings
   suggest that F505Lck must be anchored stably to membranes to become
   activated, Because palmitoylation is dynamic, it may be involved in
   regulating the cellular localization of p56(kk), and consequently its
   activity, by altering the proximity of p56(kk) to its activators and/or
   targets.}},

Abstract = {{Clementine (Citrus reticulata {[}Hort.] Ex. Tanaka cv. Oroval) is a
   self-incompatible mandarin with a slow rate of fruit growth and high
   percentage of fruit abscission. Seedless Satsuma (Citrus unshiu {[}Mak]
   Marc. cv. Clausellina) shows natural parthenocarpy and higher fruit set.
   Application of 25 mu g fruit(-1) of paclobutrazol (PP333), an inhibitor
   of gibberellin biosynthesis, reduced the rate of growth and accelerated
   fruit abscission in both varieties. In contrast, gibberellin A(3)
   (GA(3)) stimulated fruit growth only in the self-incompatible mandarin.
   Clementine fruits, in the absence of pollination, showed an
   approximately 2-fold transient increase in the free abscisic acid (ABA)
   content shortly after petal fall, In Satsuma, a very small accumulation
   of ABA was detected, Paclobutrazol treatment induced a 3-fold increase
   in ABA in Satsuma fruits but did not substantially affect the pattern of
   ABA accumulation in Clementine. In this variety, GA(3) suppressed the
   ABA increase observed in untreated fruits. These effects were observed
   24 h after treatment. However, in Satsuma fruits, the effect of GA(3) on
   the ABA content was negligible. In addition, a comparative analysis of
   growing and non-growing fruits of Clementine showed that ABA, on a per
   unit weight basis, was always higher in the nongrowing fruits. Treatment
   with 85 mu M fluridone, an inhibitor of carotenoid biosynthesis and thus
   indirectly of ABA, delayed fruit abscission in Clementine, but also
   decreased fruit growth. Collectively, these observations indicate a
   relationship between high ABA content and a reduced rate of fruit growth
   and an acceleration of fruit abscission.}},

Abstract = {{In this pilot investigation, precise optical positions in the FK5 system
   are presented for a set of 16 compact extragalactic radio sources, which
   will be part of the future radio-optical reference frame. The 0.9 m KPNO
   and CTIO telescopes equipped with 2 K CCDs have been used for this
   project. The astrometric properties of these instruments are
   investigated in detail. New techniques of using wide field CCD
   observations for astrometry in general are developed. An internal
   precision of 5-31 mas in position per single exposure is found,
   depending on the brightness of the object. The tie to the primary
   optical reference system is established by photographic astrometry using
   dedicated astrographs on both hemispheres. An accuracy of approximate to
   30 mas per source is estimated for the multistep reduction procedure
   when based on the future Hipparcos catalog, while the FK5-based
   positions suffer from system errors of 100-200 mas as compared to the
   radio positions. This work provides a contribution to the international
   effort to link the Hipparcos instrumental coordinate system to the
   quasi-inertial VLBI radio reference frame. Precise radio and optical
   astrometry of a large sample of compact extragalactic sources will also
   contribute to the astrophysics of these objects by comparing the
   respective centers of emission at the optical and radio wavelengths. (C)

   operation and another one before 48 hours; 4 patients required more than
   48 hours to be completely awake and oriented. Two patients were operated
   on with a recent stroke. One of them recovered without sequelae before
   hospital discharge and the other one had a major regression of his brain
   damage. Two other patients had emergency surgery because of cardiac
   tamponade and cardiogenic shock. Both of them had a satisfactory
   recovery. Six patients presented azotemia but only 2 of them needed
   dialysis. There was no case of Q wave infarction nor congestive heart
   failure in the perioperative period. Follow-up was 100\% completed (12
   patients) with a mean of 9.8 months (range 5 to 18 months). One patient
   died on the 10th postoperative month because of a late infectious
   process. Eight patients are in functional class I and 3 in II. Ten of

Abstract = {{Based on numerous microbiological studies performed over the past
   several decades, it is clear that mutans streptococci can cause human
   root caries. S. mutans fulfills the criteria for implicating bacteria in
   the etiology of a mixed infection. For example, S. mutans is found in
   high numbers in lesion sites, higher than on sound root surfaces in the
   same subject. Subjects make elevated antibody levels to S. mutans
   antigens. The organism produces a number of virulence factors including
   metabolic acid from dietary sucrose and extracellular polysaccharides
   which facilitate bacterial colonization of tooth surfaces. Eliminating
   or reducing the number of S. mutans reduces the number of root caries
   lesions and can even result in `'healing'' of incipient lesions. There
   is also data demonstrating the cariogenic potential of S. mutans in
   animal models. Clearly, S. mutans fulfills the aforementioned
   requirements. Further, there is also evidence to implicate Lactobacillus
   as being important in the pathogenesis of root caries by virtue of its
   association with S. mutans in these lesions. There is less recent
   evidence regarding the importance of Actinomyces in this disease. While
   this microorganism is present in root caries and while animal studies
   clearly point to their cariogenic potential, more recent studies with
   few exceptions fail to find much association between Actinomyces and
   root caries. There is an important caveat, however. The Actinomyces may
   have subspecies groups which are more highly virulent and more closely
   involved in the etiology of root caries than other groups. For example,
   A. viscosus serovar 2 is associated with root caries. This and other
   subspecies groups may produce certain virulence factors not found within
   Actinomyces species as a whole. For this group of microorganisms and for
   other potential pathogens, techniques in molecular biology such as 16S
   ribosomal RNA sequencing offers the hope of more precisely defining
   species and unraveling what may be largely problems in bacterial
   taxonomy. Ribosomal RNA sequencing may reveal taxonomic relationships
   not apparent with classical phenotypic or serologic analyses. Other
   molecular methods, such as DNA or RNA probes to specific virulence
   factors may also reveal relationships between clinical lesions and
   microorganisms possessing these virulence factors. Finally, there are
   clearly a number of additional species which may have importance in root
   surface caries as shown in some studies. These techniques can be used to
   identify the distribution of novel, even uncultivable bacteria in root
   caries lesions and in this way establish their role in this important
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Recently many so called self-dispensing multi-dose dry powder inhalers
   were designed. Calculation of the average weight, the coefficient of
   variation of the dosing-sequences are often used to indicate the
   (in)accuracy of the system. These parameters supply no information with
   respect to the cause of the inaccuracy. No statistical methods are in
   use to locate the cause of the inaccuracy. Two techniques, spectral
   analysis and ARIMA-modelling were used to determine the characteristics
   of the sequences of two (model) dry powder inhalers. Spectral analysis
   detects periodic behaviour in sequences, while ARIMA unravels the way a
   dose interacts with the next one. It was shown that the sequence of the
   first inhaler is a moving average process, indicating sticking powder in
   the dosing mechanism itself. The second inhaler showed negative
   autocorrelation, indicating insufficient supply of powder to the dosing
   mechanism. Spectral analysis and ARIMA-modelling provide information not
   obtainable with the present evaluation techniques, enabling the designer
   to focus his efforts in improving the system. Their use can be
   implemented in the evaluation of self-dispensing multi-dose dry powder
   inhalers.}},

Abstract = {{The development of surgery in regime of day hospital proceeds swiftly,
   especially in Anglo-saxon countries, so that at the beginning of the
   second millennium it can be foreseen that in USA alone, 75\% of all
   surgery will be carried out in this manner. From March 1st to September
   1st 1994, 100 patients were submitted to operations in ODS (One Day
   Surgery). We had 3 reconversions into ordinary hospitalization (3\%), 2
   for social-economic reasons and one for headache and vomiting due to
   intolerance to local anesthetics, As has been seen we have encountered
   no important complications, all patients were satisfied, From the
   analysis of our experience we have deducted useful indications that
   oblige us to partially modify our attitude:
   we want to transform our service into a free standing center where the
   patient can undergo preoperative exams, anesthesiologic examinations and
   surgery on the same day;
   we are just about to verify the possibility, thanks to an accurate
   anamnesis, to not request preoperative routine exams in patients with
   ASA 1 and 2 physical status;
   to look for a possible asymptomatic crural hernia in patients that
   undergo inguinal hernioplasty;
   we do not submit patients to ODS if they do not have assistance at home;
   or if they live too far from our service.}},

Abstract = {{CURRENTLY, NO IDEAL method exists for monitoring the injured brain.
   Recently, a single, compact, fiberoptic sensor has become available for
   measuring oxygen, CO2, pH and temperature in blood. We have adapted this
   instrument for continuous use in brain tissue to measure oxygen tension,
   carbon dioxide tension (pCO(2)), pH, and temperature. To evaluate this
   new technique, we produced hypercapnia, hypocapnia, intracranial
   pressure increase, and hypoxemia in seven normal cats. In an additional
   six animals, sensors were placed within a zone of focal brain ischemia
   induced by occluding the left middle cerebral artery. The sensor
   readings were compared with cerebral blood flow measurements,
   intracranial pressure, and brain histological findings. An in vitro
   experiment was also performed using human blood to test the accuracy of
   the sensor over a wide range of pCO(2) and oxygen tension values. After
   careful precalibration and rigid cranium fixation, stable measurements
   could be obtained throughout the 6- to 8-hour experiments. In normal
   animals, brain oxygen was 42 +/- 9 mm Hg, brain CO2 was 59 +/- 14 mm Hg,
   brain pH was 7.0 +/- 0.2, and brain temperature was 36.7 +/- 0.7 degrees
   C. Hypocapnia and hypoxemia produced a significant decline in tissue
   oxygen (less than or equal to 30 +/- 3 mm Hg; P < 0.001), whereas
   hypercapnia caused by hypoventilation and intracranial pressure increase
   produced a significant increase in tissue CO2 (greater than or equal to
   74 +/- 4 mm Hg; P < 0.001). Focal ischemia produced a rapid 42\% decline
   in brain oxygen (25 +/- 7 mm Hg) and a 25\% increase in tissue pCO(2)
   (71 +/- 23 mm Hg). Brain oxygen further decreased to 19 +/- 6 mm Hg
   toward the end of the experiment, 4 hours later. After middle cerebral
   artery occlusion, the regional cerebral blood flow decreased to 10 +/- 5
   ml per 100 g per minute, within the Ist hour, from a baseline value of
   65 +/- 15 ml per 100 g per minute. It then gradually increased to 15 +/-
   5 ml per 100 g per minute by the end of the 4-hour experiment. Brain pH
   was closely and inversely related to brain CO2. The brain temperature in
   the focally ischemic tissue decreased from 36.7 +/- 0.7 to 35.5 +/- 1.6
   degrees C by the end of the experiment. The in vitro experiment
   demonstrated good linear correlation between the sensor readings and the
   blood gas analysis. Continuous monitoring of oxygen, CO2, pH, and
   temperature in damaged or at-risk brain tissue using a single sensor is
   now feasible and will, thus, allow improved continuous monitoring of
   neurosurgical patients who are at risk of significant secondary brain
   damage.}},

Abstract = {{The ultrastructure of crural Pacinian corpuscles was examined after
   sciatic nerve crush performed in 7- to 20-day-old rats, i.e. during the
   postcritical period of development when the corpuscles no longer
   degenerate after axotomy but cease growing. The aim of our study was to
   assess the innervation pattern and structural changes of the corpuscles
   following transient denervation and subsequent reinnervation during
   their maturation and growth. Reinnervated corpuscles were examined by
   electron microscopy from 2.5 months after nerve crush onwards. After
   sciatic nerve crush at 7 days of age, the corpuscles are mostly
   reinnervated with multiple axon terminals, each of them enclosed within
   a newly formed inner core. The axial multiple cores are in part covered
   by a layer of concentric inner core lamellae and surrounded by a
   capsule, both structures having survived from the original corpuscle.
   After nerve crush at 10 days of age, reinnervated Pacinian corpuscles
   usually contain, in their axial region, a denervated remainder of the
   original core together with a few regenerated axon terminals enclosed
   within new inner cores. These axial structures are surrounded by a layer
   of concentric lamellae of the original core which may accommodate some
   regenerated terminals. Additional axon terminals with their small inner
   cores may be found at the outer aspect of the composite core beneath the
   capsule. When the nerve is crushed in 15-day-old rats, the inner core
   which is already well developed remains preserved by the time of
   reinnervation, and regenerating axons grow in between the original
   lamellae inducing only moderate neoformation of 2-3 lamellar layers
   which enclose the terminals. After crushing the sciatic nerve in
   20-day-old rats, formation Of new inner core lamellae is minimal and
   regenerated terminals become accommodated between the original lamellae
   of the core as is the case in adult animals. Regeneration of new inner
   cores and reinnervation of the preserved lamellar structure thus
   characterize the recovery of Pacinian corpuscles following reinnervation
   after nerve crush during the postcritical period of their development.}},

Abstract = {{Recently it was discovered that cosmic rays can induce failures in large
   area, high voltage power semiconductors. The effect is of considerable
   practical significance and has caused a series of equipment malfunctions
   in the field. We show that earlier attempts to model the physical
   process of failure are inadequate and introduce a new model. From the
   new model we derive a phenomenological law for the failure rate as a
   function of simple design parameters. The law has only two adjustable
   parameters and the parameters have a simple physical interpretation. In
   particular the parameter which describes the slope of the extrapolation
   curve from test to field conditions can be calculated from first
   principles and shows good agreement with the experimentally found value.
   This gives high confidence in the validity of the extrapolation law. We
   give mathematical expressions and diagrams to quantify the safe
   operating conditions with respect to the cosmic ray failure mode for all
   high voltage power devices. This allows the user to design reliable
   power electronic equipment and the semiconductor manufacturer to design
   devices virtually immune against this failure mode.}},

Abstract = {{It is common practice to estimate kinetic parameters from dynamically
   acquired tomographic data by first reconstructing a dynamic sequence of
   three-dimensional reconstructions and then fitting the parameters to
   time activity curves generated from the time-varying reconstructed
   images, However, in SPE;CT, the pharmaceutical distribution can change
   during the acquisition of a complete tomographic data set, which can
   bias the estimated kinetic parameters, It is hypothesized that more
   accurate estimates of the kinetic parameters can be obtained by fitting
   to the projection measurements instead of the reconstructed time
   sequence, Estimation from projections requires the knowledge of their
   relationship between the tissue regions of interest or voxels with
   particular kinetic parameters and the projection measurements, which
   results in a complicated nonlinear estimation problem with a series of
   exponential factors with multiplicative coefficients, A technique is
   presented in this paper where the exponential decay parameters are
   estimated separately using linear time-invariant system theory, Once the
   exponential factors are known, the coefficients of the exponentials can
   be estimated using linear estimation techniques, Computer simulations
   demonstrate that estimation of the kinetic parameters directly from the
   projections is more accurate than the estimation from the reconstructed
   images.}},

   studies showed that licochalcone A altered the ultrastructure of
   Leishmania major promastigote and amastigote mitochondria in a
   concentration-dependent manner without damaging the organelles of
   macrophages or the phagocytic function of these cells, Studies on the
   function of the parasite mitochondria showed that licochalcone A
   inhibited the respiration of the parasite in a concentration-dependent
   manner, as shown by inhibition of O-2 consumption and CO2 production by
   the parasites, Moreover, licochalcone A inhibited the activity of the
   parasite mitochondrial dehydrogenase, The inhibition of the activity of
   the parasite mitochondrial enzyme correlated well with the changes in
   the ultrastructure of the mitochondria shown by electron microscopy,

Abstract = {{Experimental investigations suggest that microcracking may be the major
   cause for the commonly encountered degradation of ferroelectric
   actuators, namely electric fatigue, It is commonly believed that stress
   concentration is responsible for the onset of cracking although the
   quantitative relation between these two events has not been understood
   completely, It is expected that formation of ferroelectric twins, i.e.,
   90 degrees domains, can cause severe stress concentration at
   intersections of domain walls with grain boundaries because of the
   incompatibility of lattice distortions with grain boundary constraints.
   This article presents an analysis upon the asymptotic behavior of stress
   and electric fields near these intersections, The asymptotic analysis is
   carried out within a framework of electrostatics for deformable
   continua, assuming that the electromechanical state in each of the
   ferroelectric domains is slightly distorted from one of the natural
   states of the crystal, the authors developed a piecewise linearized
   model for which concentrations of stress and electric fields correspond
   to singularities of these fields, The analysis concludes that both the
   stress and the electric fields exhibit a power-law singularity; i.e.,
   their magnitudes are proportional to r(lambda), with r being the radial
   coordinate originating at the intersecting point and lambda being a
   constant whose value is within the range (-1,0). The examples included
   show that the severity of concentration depends upon the crystal

   grain boundary which they intersect. Considering the microcracks may be
   generated during the cooling or poling process, the authors have also
   studied the interaction of ferroelectric twins with preexisting
   microcracks, both intergranular and transgranular. The analysis
   indicates that this interaction makes the singularity substantially
   stronger than the conventional root r-singularity and hence it suggests
   that this interaction promotes crack growth.}},

Abstract = {{Uniaxial compression tests on marble plates containing two prefabricated
   en echelon fractures were performed in this study. Photographs showing
   the typical characteristics of subcrack development were taken under
   direct scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation during the test.
   From these photographs, the effects of the length L of a single
   fracture, the separation distance d and overlapping proportion a/L
   between two prefabricated en echelon fractures on the development of
   subcracks were analyzed. The results show that the interaction between
   en echelon fractures strengthened with decreasing d. For d greater than
   or equal to L, there was little interaction and the development of
   subcracks near one of the en echelon fractures was unaffected by the
   existence of the other. Whereas for d < L, the number of subcracks in
   the area intermediate between en echelon fractures tended to increase
   with increasing a and decreasing d. In order to ascertain whether the
   experiment can furnish some implications for research on earthquake
   prediction and neotectonic activity, the test results were compared with
   the spatial-temporal development of foreshocks and ground-water
   anomalies before the 1975 Haicheng earthquake and the structural
   framework of the Ganzi pull-apart basin. The results of the comparison
   are encouraging. According to the similarity between the test results in
   the laboratory and the natural phenomena in the field, the fault on
   which the Haicheng earthquake would occur, could be inferred immediately
   from the relative geometry of the two sub-parallel active faults in the
   area. Thus, it is considered that the test results would advance our
   understanding of the process of neotectonic activities and give us
   inspiration for earthquake prediction.}},

Abstract = {{GLUT2 is the major glucose transporter of adult hepatocytes. In vivo,
   membrane GLUT1 is localized to a ring of perivenous cells and increases
   slightly after fasting or insulin deprivation. GLUT1 also increases in
   vitro after prolonged culture of isolated adult hepatocytes. We have
   previously shown that GLUT1 mRNA, protein, and activity are present in
   the rat fetal hepatocyte, and that both GLUT1 and GLUT2 are important
   for the pattern of glucose transport in the fetal hepatocyte, We tested
   the hypothesis that the postnatal increase in circulating glucose is one
   of the regulators of the changed pattern of GLUT1 and GLUT2 in the
   hepatocyte after the fetal to neonatal transition. Fetal and adult rat
   hepatocytes were cultured for 45 hours in supplemented Dulbecco's
   modified Eagle's medium at glucose concentrations of 1, 8.3, or 30
   mmol/L. Culture at 8.3 and 30 mmol/L glucose diminished GLUT1 mRNA as
   compared with culture in 1 mmol/L glucose in both fetal and adult
   hepatocytes (P <.05), but GLUT1 mRNA levels were lower in adult versus
   fetal hepatocyte cultures at 8.3 and 30 mmol/L (P <.05). Similarly,
   GLUT1 protein levels were significantly diminished in hepatocytes
   cultured at higher medium glucose (P <.05 for fetal cells at 30 v 1
   mmol/L; P <.05 for adult cells at 8.3 and 30 v 1 mmol/L). GLUT2 mRNA
   abundance was enhanced by medium glucose in adult hepatocytes (P <.05 at
   8.3 and 30 v 1 mmol/L) and was unchanged by medium glucose in fetal
   hepatocytes. In contrast, GLUT2 protein level was unchanged by medium
   glucose in adult hepatocytes, and was diminished at 30 mmol/L as
   compared with 1 mmol/L glucose in fetal hepatocytes (P < .05). In
   confirmation of these findings, uptake of a-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) by
   fetal hepatocytes was significantly diminished after culture in 8.3 or
   30 mmol/L glucose versus 1 mmol/L glucose (P <.05 and <.01,
   respectively). These studies confirm that the fetal hepatocyte glucose
   transporter pattern could be maintained in part by low fetal portal
   glucose levels. However, the resistance of the fetal hepatocyte glucose
   transporter pattern as compared with that of the adult hepatocyte to the
   effects of hyperglycemia suggests additional undefined control
   mechanisms. Copyright (C) 1995 by W.B. Saunders Company}},

Abstract = {{The lack of alternative selectable markers in crop transformation has
   been a substantial barrier for commercial application of agricultural
   biotechnology. We have developed an efficient selection system for wheat
   transformation using, glyphosate-tolerant CP4 and GOX genes as a

   bombarded with two separate plasmids harboring the CP4/GOX and GUS
   genes. After a 1 week delay, the bombarded embryos were transferred to a
   selection medium containing 2 mM glyphosate. Embryo-derived calli were
   subcultured onto the same selection medium every 3 weeks consecutively
   for 9-12 weeks, and were then regenerated and rooted on selection media
   with lower glyphosate concentrations. Transgenic plants tolerant to
   glyphosate were recovered. ELISA assay confirmed expression of the CP4
   and GOX genes in R(0) plants. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that
   the transgenes were integrated into the wheat genomes and transmitted to
   the following generation. The use of CP4 and GOX genes as a selectable
   marker provides an efficient, effective, anti alternative transformation

Abstract = {{We have previously demonstrated that endothelin-1 (ET-1) increases
   plasma insulin and decreases blood glucose, The present study was
   designed to determine if ET-1-induced hypoglycemia occurs in the
   presence of the insulin secretion inhibitor, somatostatin, and whether
   ET-1-induced insulin secretion is affected by the nitric oxide synthase
   I inhibitor, N-G-methyl-L-arginine (NMLA), in the anesthetized rat, ET-1
   increased plasma insulin and decreased blood glucose in all protocols,
   Somatostatin alone decreased blood glucose and plasma insulin.
   Somatostatin blocked ET-1-induced plasma insulin release but did not
   completely block ET-1-induced hypoglycemia. NMLA alone decreased blood
   glucose and plasma insulin, NMLA also blocked ET-1-induced insulin
   release but not ET-1-induced hypoglycemia. The present study confirms
   our previous finding that ET-1 decreases blood glucose and increases
   plasma insulin. Because hypoglycemia occurs during insulin inhibition
   with somatostatin, the present study suggests that ET-1-induced
   hypoglycemia is partially caused by non-insulin-mediated mechanisms.
   Because insulin secretion is blocked by the nitric oxide synthase I
   inhibitor, NMLA, the present study suggests that ET-1-induced insulin
   release may be mediated by production of nitric oxide. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{EPR and Mossbauer studies demonstrate that iron chelation by adriamycin
   is complex, with several different chelation structures. At
   physiological pH in aqueous solution, three different EPR spectra are
   observed: a spectrum at g = 4.2 of Fe3+ in a rhombic crystal field (type
   1); a spectrum at g = 2.01 with symmetric Gaussian lineshape linewidth
   225 G (1 G = 10(-4) T), suggestive of Fe3+ bound in an octahedral
   crystal field (type 2); and a broad spectrum centered at g = 2.0
   suggestive of ferromagnetically coupled Fe3+ (type 3), The type 1 and 2
   spectra are observed at adriamycin/Fe3+ ratios >4, the type 3 spectrum
   is observed at ratios <4 and at ratios <2 an increasing amount of Fe3+
   gives rise to CPR silent iron(III) hydroxide polymers, At 4 K the type 1
   and 2 complexes exhibit a broad doublet Mossbauer signal with an isomer
   shift delta = 0.56 (1) mm s(-1) and quadrupole splitting Delta E(Q) =
   0.74 (1) mm s(-1). The type 3 complex gives rise to a sextet signal with
   isomer shift delta = 0.47 (1) mm s(-1) and hyperfine splitting HF = 476
   (1) kG with exhibits superparamagnetic relaxation behavior with a
   blocking temperature of 23 K, consistent with a microcrystal size of 25
   Angstrom. Cu2+ binds to adriamycin at adriamycin/Cu2+ ratios >4:1 giving
   rise to an EPR spectrum with axial symmetry g(parallel to) = 2.26,
   g(perpendicular to) = 2.066, A(parallel to) = 188 G, while 2:1 complexes
   exhibit a single Gaussian line at g = 2.09 indicative of
   exchange-coupled Cu2+. The exchange-coupled Cu2+ and ferromagnetically
   coupled Fe3+ complexes fan be explained by the formation of stacked 2:1
   adriamycin-metal polymers. On titration of adriamycin with
   Fe3+-nitrilotriacetate a different spectrum is observed at g = 4.3 and
   its intensity plateaus at an adriamycin/iron ratio of 2, The iron
   adriamycin complexes cycle to reduce molecular oxygen and this cycle has
   been hypothesized to be a mechanism mediating the therapeutic and toxic
   effects of the drag, Both EPR and Mossbauer experiments demonstrate that
   the type 1 and 2 chelates reduce their Fe3+ to Fe2+ while the type 3
   chelate does not, Therefore, the stoichiometry and method of complex
   preparation can profoundly effect the properties of these complexes.}},

Abstract = {{Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of methylphenidate hydrochloride,
   a drug used in the treatment of attention-deficient disorders, were
   performed in F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice. In these studies,
   methylphenidate hydrochloride was administered for 2 years at doses of
   0, 100, 500 or 1000 ppm in the feed to rats and at doses of 0, 50, 250,
   500 ppm to mice in groups that consisted of 50 animals/dose/sex/species.
   The average amount of methylphenidate consumed per day was estimated to
   be 4-47 mg/kg/day for rats and 5-67 mg/kg/day for mice. Survival was
   similar in dosed and control groups. An increase in benign tumors of the
   liver and increased liver weights were observed in male and female mice
   at the high dose. An increase in hepatoblastomas was also seen in high
   dose male mice. Methylphenidate was not mutagenic in the Salmonella
   assay system, and it is hypothesized that this tumorigenic effect might
   be due to nongenotoxic effects of the chemical such as an increase in
   cell proliferation. Increased incidences of neoplasms were not seen in
   rats. However, there was a notable decrease in mammary gland
   fibroadenomas in female rats and a marginal decrease in benign
   pheochromocytomas in male rats. Epidemiology studies of methylphenidate
   have found no evidence of a carcinogenic effect in humans and like our
   findings in rats, report a less than expected rate of cancers in
   patients taking methylphenidate.}},

   in agreement with a previous result from mass spectrometry. Predicted
   vibrational band wavenumbers from force constant calculations are used
   to calculate values of the heat capacity C-p(sic) the enthalpy

Abstract = {{Fluorescence properties of 36 specially chosen aromatic compounds are
   experimentally studied at a temperature of 293 K. The compounds are
   arranged in pairs so that even numbered compounds, because of
   symmetrical substitutions, are designated a higher symmetry group than
   those of odd numbered compounds. The pairs are, however, family-related
   in pi-structure. The quantum yield of fluorescence gamma, and decay
   times tau(f), of deaerated and nondeaerated cyclohexane solutions are
   measured. The oscillator strength f(e), the fluorescence rate constants
   K-f, natural lifetimes tau(0)(T) and intersystem crossing rate constants
   K-st, are calculated. Investigations showed that transition from a lower
   to higher symmetry, but family-related in pi-structure molecule
   depending on the nature of the S-1 excited state, has different effects
   on parameters such as gamma, tau(f), f(e), K-f and K-st. If the S-1
   excited state has the nature of the S-P(La-1) state, then the value of
   nu(00) decreases. This is accompanied by an increase in the values of
   gamma and tau(f). Parameters f(e) and K-f may change unpredictably.
   However, if the development of pi-structure occurs in the direction of
   polarization of the S-0-->S-1 transition, the values of f(e) and
   consequently K-f are also found to increase. If the S-1 excited state
   has the nature of the S-alpha((1)Lb) state then generally, gamma, f(e)
   and K-f are found to decrease, with tau(f) increasing. Furthermore, the
   K-st value in most cases of symmetrical substitution, decreases,
   sometimes very significantly, though the energy gap between S-1 and T-1
   states becomes less. For example, the transition from 9-phenylanthracene
   (C-2 symmetry group) to 9,10-diphenylanthracene (D-2 symmetry group) is
   accompanied by a decrease in the value of K-st, by a factor of 18. This
   phenomenon is qualitatively treated using the first-order spin-orbit
   coupling theory and simulation of singlet and triplet levels.}},

   putative tRNA(Ile) gene probe which has been previously isolated and

   these tRNAs has been partially determined, and contains a modified
   nucleotide at the first position of the anticodon. This type of
   posttranscriptional modification event could change the specificity of
   amino acid acceptance of a tRNA, unlike that deduced from the

Abstract = {{Two young researchers were found lying beside 3 Dewar flasks for liquid
   nitrogen in a cold experimental room of a university. They were sent to
   a hospital but died 1.5 h after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. One of
   the cadavers had dark red discoloration of the skin on the left arm at
   autopsy. By the histological investigation of the discolored region
   karyopyknosis and vacuolation of the keratinocytes were noticeably
   observed in the epidermis. In addition, hyperemia and edematous changes
   were seen. Hemoglobin (Hb) was not immunodetected in the skin tissue
   except intravascular erythrocytes. Therefore, these histological
   findings of the discolored skin can indicate that the skin damage was
   produced by cold due to liquid nitrogen before death. The cause of death
   was asphyxia due to oxygen deficiency. There were few autopsy findings
   which showed the participation of liquid nitrogen in the accident. But,
   the histological findings of the discolored region demonstrate that
   liquid nitrogen was involved in this accident.}},

   2,3,10,10a-tetrahydrocyclopropa{[}d]benzo{[}f]quinol-5-one (CBQ)
   alkylation subunit, are detailed. The agents were found to alkylate the
   same sites as the corresponding enantiomers incorporating the DSA, DA,
   CPI, CBI, or CI alkylation subunit. Consistent with their reactivity,
   they exhibited less selectivity among the available alkylation sites and
   alkylated DNA with a lower efficiency. Importantly, only adducts derived
   from adenine N3 addition to the least substituted cyclopropane carbon
   were detected under the relevant conditions of limiting agent. The
   adenine N3 adduct obtained by thermal depurination was isolated,
   quantitated, characterized, and shown to be derived from addition to the
   least substituted cyclopropane carbon of CBQ-TMI. Since the CBQ-based
   agents exhibit nonselective solvolysis regioselectivity with cleavage of
   both the normal external C9b-C10 and the abnormal internal C9b-C10a
   cyclopropane bonds, the observations suggest that the clean
   regiochemical course of the characteristic adenine N3 DNA alkylation
   reaction may benefit from not only the stereoelectronic control but
   additional features that complement the normally observed
   regioselectivity as well. These potentially include preferential
   adoption of binding orientations that favor the normal adenine N3
   addition (proximity effects), and destabilizing torsional strain and
   steric interactions that accompany the abnormal adenine N3 nucleophilic
   addition, as well as a potential binding induced conformational change
   in CBQ which imposes a stereoelectronic preference for adenine N3
   addition to the least substituted cyclopropane carbon.}},

Abstract = {{The extent of plasticity in the behavior of hermit crabs is reviewed.
   Data are presented demonstrating that in the hermit crab Calcinus
   tibicen, the diversity of experience with shell types affects the ease
   with which crabs enter novel shells. Hermit crabs that had more diverse
   experience with shell types made fewer mistakes and entered novel shells
   more quickly than individuals with less diverse experience. Examples of
   the limitations on the extent of plasticity are reviewed and some of the
   mechanisms which could lead to limitations are discussed. These
   mechanisms include (a) sensory capabilities, (b) morphological
   constraints, (c) limits on learning abilities, and (d) constraints by
   cognitive structure, i.e. the nature of the connections between
   categories of behavior. As an example of the latter, data are presented
   for the hermit crab Clibanarius vittatus showing that crabs that
   regularly detected blood of conspecifics (a presumed indicator of a high
   predation level) did not select different shells than controls not
   exposed to such input.}},

Abstract = {{The adaptive value of carry-over effects, the persistence of induced
   phenotypes for several generations despite the change in the conditions
   that first induced these phenotypes, is studied in the framework of a
   simple model. Three different organismal strategies - non-inducible
   (genetic), completely inducible (plastic), and intermediate
   (carry-over)-are compared in fitness terms within three different
   environments. Analytical results and numerical simulations show that
   carry-over effects can have an advantage in stochastic environments even
   over organisms with high adaptive plasticity. We argue that carry-over
   effects represent an adaptive mechanism on the ecological timescale that
   fills the gap between short-term individual adaptations and long-term
   evolutionary adaptations. An extension of the concept of plasticity to
   incorporate the time dimension and include the stability of induced
   phenotypes through both clonal and sexual generations, is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{3-Oxo-Delta(5)-steroid isomerase (KSI) from Pseudomonas testosteroni
   catalyzes the isomerization of a variety of 3-oxo-Delta(5)-steroids to
   their conjugated Delta(4)-isomers through the intermediate formation of
   a dienolate ion. This dienolate is formed by proton transfer from C-4 of
   the substrate to Asp-38, which then protonates the dienolate at C-6.
   Catalysis is enhanced by electrophilic assistance (hydrogen bonding) to
   the 3-oxygen by Tyr-14. We have investigated the effect of modifying
   phenylalanine-101 (F101), a hydrophobic residue that is located in the
   binding pocket of KSI. Two mutant enzymes (F101L and F101A) of KSI were
   prepared, and their kinetic properties were examined with
   5-androstene-3,17-dione (1) as the substrate. Both of the mutants show
   reduced values of k(cat) compared to the wild type (WT), by about
   30-fold (F101L) and by 270-fold (F101A), with only a small difference in
   K-m values. There is Little change in the K-i's (less than or equal to
   4-fold) for the product 4-androstene-3,17-dione (3), although both
   enzymes bind the intermediate analog d-equilenin (4) about 25-fold less
   tightly than does the WT. Fluorescence spectra of 4 bound to each of
   these enzymes suggest that 4 is ionized at the active site of WT,
   un-ionized at the active site of F101A and a mixture of these ionization
   states at the active site of F101L. Free energy profiles are constructed
   for each of the mutant enzymes, and these are compared to the free
   energy profile for the WT. The results are interpreted in terms of
   stabilization of the intermediate dienolate and the flanking transition
   states by the phenyl ring of F101.}},

   of segregation distributions were determined by introducing a tracer
   blob numerically and tracking the concentration of the tracer particles
   as a function of location and time. In spite of the chaotic nature of
   the dynamics of this flow, the analyses provided the broad features of
   twin extrusion flow and its ability to mix. The processing
   characteristics of kneading disks were found to depend on the stagger
   angle and complemented earlier numerical and experimental results on
   residence time distributions and color incorporated tracer analyses. (C)

Abstract = {{Gene transfer techniques may provide efficient treatment for a variety
   of malignant neoplasms. A replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad) vector
   which carries the cDNA for wild-type p53 (AdCMV.p53) was tested for its
   in vitro and in vivo effects on the growth of murine melanoma cell line
   B16-G3.26 and human melanoma cell line SK-MEL-24. The growth of
   B16-G3.26 cells infected with AdCMV.p53 was inhibited when compared to
   the uninfected cells or cells infected with the control vector AdCMV.NLS
   beta gal. Similarly, the growth of SK-MEL-24 cells infected with
   AdCMV.p53 was also below that of AdCMV.NLS beta gal-infected and
   uninfected controls. DNA laddering using agarose gel electrophoresis and
   in site labeling of DNA fragmentation (TUNEL) showed that
   AdCMV.p53-infected murine and human melanoma cells underwent apoptosis.
   Nude mice injected s.c. either with B16-G3.26 cells or with SK-MEL-24
   cells developed localized tumors. These tumors were subsequently
   infiltrated with either AdCMV.p53, AdCMV.NLS beta gal or saline alone.
   One week after infection, B16-G3.26 tumors exposed to AdCMV.p53 were 2.5
   times smaller than control tumors and exhibited DNA fragmentation. A
   similar growth-inhibitory effect of AdCMV.p53 was observed with
   SK-MEL-24 tumors. Thus, Ad-mediated wildtype p53 overexpression resulted
   in melanoma cell apoptosis and inhibition of melanoma growth in vitro
   and in vivo. These gene therapy approaches may be useful in targeting
   rapidly growing, malignant melanomas in a clinical setting. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{The low-temperature phase diagram of polycrystalline UCu5 has been
   determined from magnetization and magnetoresistance measurements. This
   system undergoes two magnetic transitions at low temperatures. The
   lower-temperature phase transition at T-2 = 1.16 K, which manifests
   itself as a sudden jump in the magnetization and electrical resistance
   with decreasing temperature, shows a temperature hysteresis of about 40
   mK for fields up to 12 T. The magnetic properties of this
   low-temperature phase show irreversible and metastable behaviour, which
   becomes more dramatic at the lower fields. The critical temperature T-2
   is observed to increase proportionally with the square of the magnetic
   field. Our results are discussed in comparison with available specific
   heat, neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance data, with the
   aim of determining the actual nature of the low-temperature magnetic
   phase transition.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a 40\% reduction in the total number of oxytocin
   immunoreactive neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the

   determined whether this decrease is associated with a diminished amount

   densitometric image analysis for the quantitative assessment of oxytocin
   gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus of a group of AIDS
   patients (n = 10) and a carefully matched control group (n = 8). We
   found no significant difference (P = 0.08) in the amount of oxytocin
   mRNA per total paraventricular nucleus between the two groups. In
   addition, no significant differences were found in the part of the
   volume of the paraventricular nucleus that was occupied by hybridized
   cells (P = 0.12) or in the mean signal density (P = 0.08). The findings
   do not support the hypothesis that the extensive decrease in oxytocin
   immunoreactive neurons of the paraventricular nucleus in AIDS is
   associated with a decrease in total oxytocin mRNA content in this
   nucleus. The data are compatible with the suggestion that in AIDS the
   biosynthesis of oxytocin is changed in an unknown way at the

Abstract = {{Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and its beta sub-unit (hCG beta) are
   secreted by trophoblast cells during pregnancy, and by tumoral cells of
   trophoblastic and non-trophoblastic origin. In contrast to hCG, the free
   hCG beta sub-unit is consistently undetectable in healthy non-pregnant
   subjects. With this in mind, we sought to determine whether an immune
   response to hCG beta can be detected in patients with bladder or
   germ-cell testis cancers. Peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from
   31\% of patients with hCG beta-productive bladder cancers and 33\% of
   testis-tumor-bearing patients displayed an hCG beta-specific
   proliferative response, whereas no patients with non-hCG beta-productive
   cancers had a proliferative response. PBMC from pregnant women and
   healthy controls did not elicit significant reactivity. By the use of
   overlapping synthetic peptides, the immunogenic regions of hCG beta were
   delineated within the central 20-65 portion. Moreover, in 2
   bladder-cancer patients with the HLA DR7, DQ2 haplotype, the T-cell
   response to hCG beta was focused on the hCG beta(20-47) peptide. Taken
   together, these results indicate that hCG beta is a tumor-associated
   antigen capable of inducing a cell-mediated immune response in patients
   with productive tumors. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   were compared along with those of PH by analyzing preneoplastic
   glutathione S-transferase placental form positive (GST-P+) hepatocyte
   foci as endpoint marker lesions. The DGA treatment did not affect the
   body weight gain whereas the PH treatment caused a transient body weight
   loss. Although both bioassay protocols were effective to detect the
   potential hepatocarcinogenicity of 2-AAF the number and area of GST-P
   positive foci per cm(2) were larger in the bioassay using DGA than in
   that using PH, the number being statistically significant (P < 0.05).
   Our results thus suggest that the present bioassay protocol with
   repeated administration of DGA instead of PH may offer a new and
   sensitive method to screen large numbers of environmental carcinogens.}},

   p53 alterations by temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis/direct
   sequencing and immunohistochemistry. HPV, mostly type 16/18, was found
   in 80.4\% of the cervical tumors (92.0\% of the SCC and 69.2\% of the
   AdCa), but in only 27.5\% of vulvar carcinomas. In contrast, p53
   mutations were found in 7.8\% and 52.5\% of cervical and vulvar tumors
   respectively. Mutant p53 occurred in pre-invasive vulvar lesions,
   indicating that this oncogenic factor is involved early in
   carcinogenesis. Further analysis of recurrent/metastatic lesions of 9
   cervical and 14 vulvar tumors also showed remarkable differences: in
   cervical cancer, HPV was persistent, and p53 mutations absent, whereas
   in vulvar tumors, HPV was mostly absent or not persistent, and the p53
   mutation rate was very high (78.6\%). These observations suggest that
   HPV persistence is an important event for the evolution and maintenance
   of cervical cancer, whereas for vulvar cancers p53 mutation and not HPV
   activity is a central oncogenic event. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of microinjections of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta
   (rhIL-1 beta) into the hypothalamus and neighboring basal forebrain on
   nociceptive behavior were studied using a hot-plate test in rats. The
   microinjection of rhIL-1 beta at doses between 5 pg/kg and 50 pg/kg into
   the medial part of the preoptic area (MPO) reduced the paw-withdrawal
   latency. The maximal reduction was obtained 30 min after the injection
   of rhIL-1 beta at 20 pg/kg. RhIL-1 beta (20 pg/kg)-induced hyperalgesia
   was completely blocked by the simultaneous injection of IL-1 receptor
   antagonist (IL-1ra, 20 ng/kg), Na salicylate (200 ng/kg) or
   alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH, 20 ng/kg). The
   intra-MPO injection of rhIL-1 beta at doses of less than 5 pg/kg or more
   than 50 pg/kg (up to 2 ng/kg) had no effect on nociceptive behavior. The
   microinjection of rhIL-1 beta (20 pg/kg) into the lateral part of the
   preoptic area, the median preoptic nucleus and the diagonal band of
   Broca also reduced the latency. On the other hand, the microinjection of
   rhIL-1 beta (20 pg/kg) into the paraventricular nucleus, the lateral
   hypothalamic area and the septal nucleus had no effect on nociception.
   The microinjection of rhIL-1 beta (20 pg/kg-50 pg/kg) into the
   ventromedial hypothalamus produced a prolongation of the paw-withdrawal
   latency. A maximal prolongation was obtained 10 min after the injection
   of rhIL-1 beta at 50 pg/kg. This reaction was also blocked by the
   simultaneous injection of IL-1ra (50 ng/kg) and Na salicylate (500
   ng/kg). These findings indicate that IL-1 beta in the MPO and the VMH
   produces hyperalgesia and analgesia, respectively, while, in addition,
   both effects are mediated by IL-1 receptors and the synthesis of
   prostaglandins.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperbilirubinemia in Crigler-Najjar disease type I (CN) can be
   partially controlled by daily phototherapy, but these children remain at
   permanent risk of developing brain damage due to kernicterus, Because
   liver transplantation is the only available curative treatment for
   liver-based inborn errors of metabolism, orthotopic liver
   transplantation (OLT) was performed in six patients with CN, Mean age at
   surgery was 52.5 months (range 27 to 100), Despite a mean daily
   phototherapy of 12.4+/-0.8 hr, mean bilirubin of the 6 patients was 388
   mu M/L (range 175 to 703) before OLT; one of them was also being treated
   with tin-protoporphyrin. All 6 had elevated AST/ALT, ranging from 1.4 to
   6 times upper normal values, Complications occurred in three patients
   after OLT, including miliary tuberculosis in one, graft rejection and
   retransplantation in one, and hepatic artery thrombosis in one, All
   patients survive with normal serum bilirubin level (follow up 6 to 116
   months). Four have normal enzymes on post-OLT follow-up (30 to 95
   months), follow a normal education program, and have a normal social
   life. One recently transplanted patient has progressively normalizing
   liver function tests 6 months after OLT, One patient transplanted at 8
   y.o. (now 116 months post-OLT) has moderate neurological delay due to
   pretransplant kernicterus, and posttransplant chronic persistent
   hepatitis, Our series shows that OLT cures hyperbilirubinemia in CN
   patients, with an excellent survival prospect, The procedure should be
   decided upon before neurological sequelae occur, since these persist
   after transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{Midwater fishes were collected by oblique hauls between the surface and
   an average depth of 1290 m, using a 10-ft Isaacs-Kidd midwater trawl, at
   seven stations off the Pacific coast of Bose Peninsula, central Japan. A
   total of 1860 fishes (excluding larvae), representing 19 families and 66
   species, were collected, with a mean abundance and biomass of 565 inds
   and 278 g (wet weight) per 100 m(2) of ocean surface in the upper 1000 m
   water column, respectively. Gonostomatids were most numerically abundant
   (75\%), followed by myctophids (20\%), melamphaids (1.4\%) and
   sternoptychids (0.9\%), while myctophids dominated in total biomass
   (47\%), followed by gonostomatids (42\%), melamphaids (3.1\%) and
   bathylagids (3.1\%). Of these, the gonostomatid, Cyclothone atraria,
   ranked top in both total abundance (52\%) and biomass (26\%).
   Zoogeographic grouping of the 66 species on the basis of centers of
   distributions/abundance in relation to water masses indicated that
   tropical-subtropical species were the most numerous overall (43 spp.),
   followed by wide-ranging (10 spp.), subarctic (6 spp.), pseudoceanic (6
   spp.) and transitional species (1 sp.). Except for the transitional
   species, all zoogeographic groups were represented by at least one of
   the six most abundant species. Size-frequency distributions and other
   available information suggested that the study area was located at an
   interface between peripheral breeding populations of the
   tropical-subtropical, subarctic and pseudoceanic species, being a
   consequence of both the adjacent land mass and hydrographic conditions
   of the area, where cold, less saline waters originating from the
   subarctic region advected below the more saline, warm Kuroshio current
   flowing northeastward along the peninsula.}},

Abstract = {{We have isolated and sequenced chloroplast (chl) and cytoplasmic (cyt)
   cysteine tRNAs from Nicotiana rustica. Both tRNAs carry a GCA anticodon
   but beyond that differ considerably in their nucleotide sequences. One
   obvious distinction resides in the presence of N-6-isopentenyladenosine
   (i(6)A) and 1-methylguanosine (m(1)G) at position 37 in chl and cyt
   tRNA(Cys) respectively, In order to study the potential suppressor
   activity of tRNAs(Cys) we used in vitro synthesized zein mRNA
   transcripts in which an internal UGA stop codon had been placed in
   either the tobacco rattle virus (TRV)- or tobacco mosaic virus
   (TMV)-specific codon context. In vitro translation was carried out in a
   messenger- and tRNA-dependent wheat germ extract. Both tRNA(Cys)
   isoacceptors stimulate read-through over the UGA stop codon, however,
   chl tRNA(GCA)(Cys) is more efficient than the cytoplasmic counterpart.
   The UGA in the two viral codon contexts is suppressed to about the same
   extent by either of the two tRNAs(Cys), whereas UGA in the beta-globin
   context is not recognized at all. The interaction of tRNA(GCA)(Cys) with
   UGA requires an GCA unconventional G:A base pair in the wobble position,
   as postulated earlier for plant tRNA(G Psi A)(Tyr) misreading the UAA
   stop codon. This is the first case that a cysteine-accepting tRNA has
   been characterized as a natural UGA suppressor.}},

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional structures of the Fab fragment, in its unliganded
   and liganded crystals, of mouse anti-(4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetate
   (NP) antibody N1G9 have been determined by the molecular replacement
   method. The unliganded and NP-liganded structures were refined at 2.4
   Angstrom resolution to crystallographic R-factors of 0.194 and 0.196,
   respectively Antibody N1G9 bears lambda light chains, and is one of the
   primary immune response antibodies. Fab N1G9 exhibits an elbow angle of
   197 degrees in both structures. This large angle is ascribed to the
   V-L-C-L interface formed by lambda-chain residues. A hydrophobic pocket
   surrounded by the complementarity-determining regions except L2 is
   identified as a hapten-binding site. Between the liganded and unliganded
   structures, root-mean-square (r.m.s.) positional deviations are 0.42
   Angstrom for the main-chain atoms, and 0.74 Angstrom for all the protein
   atoms. The major structural differences between these structures are
   localized in the hapten-binding site, and yield an r.m.s. deviation of
   1.03 Angstrom for the side-chain atoms. The soaked NP ligand is in van
   der Waals contact with the aromatic side-chains of Tyr32L and Trp91L of
   the Light chain, and Trp33H and Tyr97H of the heavy chain, and is
   hydrogen-bonded to the side-chains of Trp96L, His35H, Arg50H, Tyr95H,
   and Ser100aH. The side-chain of Lys58H is salt-bridged to the NP
   hydroxyl group. The side-chains of Arg50H, Trp33H, and Tyr97H are
   shifted toward the NP carboxyl group. The side-chain of Trp33H, whose
   replacement to Leu increases affinity by tenfold, is sandwiched between
   the Arg50H and Tyr97H side-chains, and is in cramped contact both with
   the ligand and with these side-chains. Affinity increases in the
   maturation of the anti-NP antibodies are ascribable to conformational
   relief of these cramped contacts through the replacement of Trp33H or
   through suitable structural alterations in the H3 region. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Systemic vasoconstriction due to stimulation of the sympathetic and
   renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems is a hallmark of heart failure and
   this is accompanied by impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations at the
   level of large arteries. This study investigated, in a rat model of
   heart failure, whether such an endothelial dysfunction also exists at
   the level of the resistance artery, and whether this is associated with
   morphologic changes, as well as the effects of chronic treatment with
   the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (2 mg/kg/ day).
   After 12 months, arterial pressure, left ventricular (LV) end diastolic
   pressure (LVEDP), and LV dP/dt were measured in anesthetized rats.
   Responses to acetylcholine and nitroprusside were determined in isolated
   and perfused mesenteric artery segments (diameter: 280 +/- 15 mu m).
   After fixation, vessel diameter, media cross-sectional area, and media
   collagen and elastin densities were measured by image analysis. After 12
   months, untreated rats showed signs of heart failure, i.e., reduced LV
   dP/dt, and increased LVEDP, heart weight/body weight, LV cavity
   circumference, and myocardial collagen density. In mesenteric vessels
   the endothelium-dependent vasodilator response to acetylcholine was
   impaired, whereas the response to the nitric oxide donor nitroprusside
   was unaffected. Heart failure did not affect vascular morphological
   parameters. Perindopril decreased blood pressure and LVEDP without any
   modification of LV dP/dt, and prevented cardiac remodeling. At the
   vascular level, perindopril improved the response to acetylcholine and
   reduced media cross-sectional area and collagen density without
   affecting internal vessel diameter or elastin density. Thus, heart
   failure decreases endothelium-dependent vasodilator response to
   acetylcholine without modification of vessel structure. The
   heart-failure induced endothelial dysfunction could be prevented by
   angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.}},

Abstract = {{We have shown that sequences contained within the viral mRNA
   5'-untranslated region (UTR) played a critical role in directing
   selective influenza viral mRNA translation. We therefore attempted to
   identify transacting factors that may regulate viral mRNA translation
   through interactions with the 5'-UTR and at the same time map the
   precise sequences to which these factors bind. We can now demonstrate
   that multiple cellular proteins interact with influenza viral but not
   cellular 5'-UTRs using gel mobility shift and UV cross linking analyses.
   Gel supershift studies revealed that the La autoantigen was one of the
   cellular proteins that interacted with the viral 5'-UTR. Utilizing
   mutants of the viral mRNA 5' UTR, we have determined that sequences
   within the very 5'-conserved region and nucleotides immediately 3' are
   necessary but not always sufficient for binding certain cellular
   proteins. Northwestern analysis showed the binding of a distinct subset
   of cellular proteins to the viral 5'-UTR, but also demonstrated
   interactions of the viral nonstructural protein NS1. Gel shift analysis
   with purified recombinant NS1 confirmed the binding of the viral protein
   to a specific region of the viral 5'-UTRs. A model describing the
   possible role of these cellular and viral RNA-binding proteins in
   regulating influenza virus mRNA translation will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Expression of P-glycoprotein by tumor cells confers resistance to
   multiple natural product drugs because of its ability to export these
   compounds, This transporter is a substrate for several protein kinases;
   however, the functional significance of its phosphorylation is not
   defined, We examined the effects of many activators and inhibitors of
   protein kinases on the activity of P-glycoprotein in drug-resistant
   human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7/ADR), Several phorbol esters
   sensitized these cells to P-glycoprotein substrate drugs; however, there
   was no correlation with activation of protein kinase C. The 4 alpha- and
   4 beta-isomers of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were equally potent in
   sensitizing the cells to actinomycin D and daunomycin and in increasing
   the intracellular accumulation of {[}H-3]vinblastine. These effects of 4
   beta-phorbol myristate acetate required much higher concentrations than
   were needed to increase P-glycoprotein phosphorylation and were not
   antagonized by staurosporine, Similar to verapamil, the phorbol esters
   did not sensitize MCF-7/ADR cells to cisplatin, nor parental MCF-7 cells
   to any of the anticancer drugs, Mezerein, K-252a, and H-89 sensitized
   MCF-7/ADR cells, increased intracellular accumulation of
   {[}H-3]vinblastine, and antagonized photolabeling of P-glycoprotein by
   {[}H-3]azidopine. Therefore, phosphorylation does not appear to play a
   significant role in regulating P-glycoprotein activity in MCF-7/ADR
   cells.}},

Abstract = {{We recently reported that gastrin and glycine-extended progastrin
   processing intermediates (G-Gly) exert growth promoting effects on
   AR4-2J cells (derived from rat pancreas) via interaction with distinct
   receptors, In this study we sought to investigate the mechanisms by
   which gastrin and G-Gly stimulate cell proliferation, While gastrin
   increased {[}Ca2+](i) in AR4-2J cells, G-Gly had no effect. Similarly,
   G-Gly had no effect either on basal and 10(-7) M vasoactive intestinal
   polypeptide-stimulated cAMP generation, although gastrin is known to
   inhibit cAMP generation, Gastrin dose dependently stimulated AR4-2J cell
   mRNA content of both c-fos and c-jun, two genes known to function in
   regulating cell proliferation, but G-Gly had no effect, Gastrin also
   induced the expression of luciferase in AR4-2J cells transfected with a
   construct consisting of a luciferase reporter gene coupled to the serum
   response element of the c-fos gene promoter, In similar fashion, gastrin
   stimulated the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase, an enzyme
   known to mediate the induction of the c-fos serum response element in
   response to growth factor stimulation. Although G-Gly had none of these
   effects of gastrin in AR4-2J cells, it stimulated activity of c-Jun
   amino-terminal kinase, an enzyme known to phosphorylate and
   transcriptionally activate c-Jun. These data support the notion that
   gastrin stimulates cell proliferation by inducing c-fos and c-jun gene
   expression, while G-Gly acts by post-translationally regulating early
   gene transcriptional activation, Our studies represent a novel model in
   which both the precursor and the product of a key processing reaction,
   peptide alpha-amidation, act cooperatively to stimulate cell
   proliferation via distinct receptors linked to different signal
   transduction pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Although infection with Campylobacter jejuni is recognized
   as a common antecedent of the Guillain-Barre syndrome, the clinical and
   epidemiologic features of this association are not well understood.
   Methods. We performed a prospective case-control study in a cohort of
   patients with Guillajn-Barre syndrome (96 patients) or Miller Fisher
   syndrome (7 patients) who were admitted to hospitals throughout England
   and Wales between November 1992 and April 1994. Bacteriologic and
   serologic techniques were used to diagnose preceding C. jejuni
   infection.
   Results. There was evidence of recent C. jejuni infection in 26 percent
   of the patients with Guillain-Barre or Miller Fisher syndrome, as
   compared with 2 percent of household controls and 1 percent of
   age-matched hospital controls (P<0.001). Of the 27 patients with C.
   jejuni infection, 19 (70 percent) reported having had a diarrheal
   illness within 12 weeks before the onset of the neurologic illness. No
   specific serotypes were associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome. C.
   jejuni infection was slightly more common in men (P=0.14) and was more
   likely to be associated with a pure motor syndrome and a slower recovery
   (P=0.03). The patients with preceding C. jejuni infection were more
   likely to have acute axonal neuropathy or axonal degeneration in
   association with acute inflammatory demyelinating
   polyradiculoneuropathy, and they had greater disability after one year
   (P=0.02). C. jejuni infection was significantly associated with a poor
   outcome even after correction for other factors associated with a poor
   prognosis.
   Conclusions. Infection with C. jejuni often precedes the Guillain-Barre
   syndrome and is associated with axonal degeneration, slow recovery, and
   severe residual disability.}},

   Blood and head kidney samples were collected from treated and
   non-treated turbot at different times in the 168 h period after
   injection. The number of neutrophils increased markedly in the
   peripheral blood of P. piscicida O-antigen injected turbot 24 h after
   injection, being significantly higher (p < 0.01) than the neutrophil
   number in V. damsela O-antigen injected turbot. Forty-eight hours after
   injection, the numbers of head kidney neutrophils and macrophages in V.
   damsela and in P. piscicida O-antigen injected turbot increased
   significantly (p < 0.05) compared with those in saline-injected turbot
   while the neutrophils in the peripheral blood decreased in fish treated
   with each of the vaccines. Turbot neutrophils have peroxidase-positive
   granules and also showed phagocytic capability. The phagocytic rate of
   the peripheral blood and head kidney phagocytes was higher in turbot
   injected with bacterins than in the saline-injected turbot, with the
   maximum phagocytic activity occurring 48 h after injection. Phagocytic
   activity of phagocytes in peripheral blood, kidney, and spleen was

   diiodomethane (CH2I2) on oxygen-covered Rh(111) has been investigated,
   using a combination of temperature programmed reaction and high
   resolution electron energy loss spectroscopies. Partial oxidation to
   formaldehyde is favored at high oxygen coverages, while nonselective
   dehydrogenation and methane formation are prevalent at low and total
   combustion at intermediate oxygen coverages. Oxygen influences the
   chemistry of diiodomethane on Rh(111) in four distinct ways: (1)
   stabilization of carbon-iodide bonds, (2) inhibition of carbon-hydrogen
   bond cleavage in adsorbed hydrocarbons, (3) scavenging and removing of
   surface hydrogen, and (4) direct addition to gaseous methylene
   fragments. At high oxygen coverages, CH2I2 dissociation is inhibited, so
   as to produce transient CH2 that reacts with surface oxygen to form
   formaldehyde prior to equilibration with the surface. Equilibration of
   methylene with the rhodium surface ultimately leads to dehydrogenation
   and subsequent CO and CO2 formation. Specifically, there is no evidence
   for oxygen insertion into the Rh-CH2 bond.}},

Abstract = {{The bolaform lipid PLE extracted from the thermophilic archaeon
   Sulfolobus solfataricus and its mixtures with egg phosphatidylcholine
   (egg PC) have been used to prepare sonicated vesicles. The leakage of
   entrapped calcein was continuously monitored by fluorescence
   dequenching. The half times of leakage have been used to compare vesicle
   stability under different conditions of temperature, lipid composition
   and presence of destabilizing agents like Ca2+ ions and poly(ethylene
   glycol) (PEG). It has been found that leakage is primarily modulated by
   the monopolar/bipolar lipid ratio. In particular, the half time of
   leakage for vesicles formed from a mixture of the polar lipid extract
   (PLE) and egg PC is characterized by a maximum at about 1:2 molar ratio.
   The free energy of mixing has been evaluated from pressure-area
   isotherms on monolayers at the air/water interface. The results indicate
   a non monotonous behaviour of the excess free energy of mixing as a
   function of the molar ratio and the occurrence of a minimum at a fixed
   molar ratio. The possible formation of a complex is discussed and
   compared with previous calorimetric measurements on similar compounds.}},

   C-released form of rat osseous plate alkaline phosphatase and its

Abstract = {{Alkaline phosphatase activity was released up to 100\% from the membrane
   by incubating the rat osseous plate membrane-bound enzyme with
   phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. The molecular weight of
   the released enzyme was 145,000 on Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration and
   66,000 on PAGE-SDS, suggesting a dimeric structure. Solubilization of
   the membrane-bound enzyme with phospholipase C did not destroy its
   ability to hydrolyse PNPP, ATP and pyrophosphate. The hydrolysis of ATP
   and PNPP by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-released
   enzyme exhibited `Michaelian' kinetics with K-0.5=70 and 979 mu M,
   respectively. For pyrophosphate, K-0.5 was 128 mu M and site-site
   interactions were observed (n=1.4). Magnesium ions were stimulatory
   (K-0.5=1.5 mM) and zinc ions were a powerful noncompetitive inhibitor
   (K-i=6.2 mu M) of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-released
   enzyme.
   Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-released alkaline
   phosphatase was relatively stable at 40 degrees C. However, with
   increasing temperature from 40-60 degrees C, the enzyme was inactivated
   rapidly following first order kinetics and thermal inactivation
   constants varied from 5.08 x 10(-4) min(-1) to 0.684 min(-1).
   Treatment of phosphatydilinositol-specific phospholipase C-released
   alkaline phosphatase with Chellex 100 depleted to 5\% its original
   PNPPase activity. Magnesium (K-0.5=29.5 mu M), manganese (K-0.5=5 mu M)
   and cobalt ions (K-0.5=10.1 mu M) restored the activity of
   Chelex-treated enzyme, demonstrating its metalloenzyme nature. The
   stimulation of Chelex-treated enzyme by calcium ions (K-0.5=653 mu M)
   was less effective (only 26\%) and occurred with site-site interactions
   (n=0.7). Zinc ions had no stimulatory effects.
   The possibility that the soluble form of the enzyme, detected during
   endochondral ossification, would arise by the hydrolysis of the
   Pl-anchored form of osseous plate alkaline phosphatase is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{High resolution infrared optothermal spectroscopy has been used to study
   small clusters of cyanoacetylene, (HCCCN)(n), containing three or more
   monomer units. For the linear HCCCN trimer the fundamental of the free
   C-H stretch vibration has been rotationally resolved and analyzed,
   yielding a ground vibrational state rotational constant (B-0) of
   94.031(13) MHz. In addition, an inner C-H stretch fundamental band of
   the linear trimer (rotationally unresolved) has been identified by
   observing the effect of large electric fields on the band shape. This
   assignment is also consistent with spectral intensity measurements as a
   function of molecular beam stagnation pressure. Predissociation
   lifetimes of the upper states of these two bands were determined from
   the observed homogeneous linewidths. Several other rotationally
   unresolved vibrational bands have also been observed. The stagnation
   pressure and electric field dependence of these spectra are used to
   estimate the cluster sizes and to make tentative structural assignments.

Abstract = {{The interaction of the actin-binding protein hisactophilin from
   Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae to partially charged Lipid membranes
   composed of mixtures of L-alpha-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPG)
   with L-alpha-dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) and
   L-alpha-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is studied by film
   balance experiments, microfluorescence, and lateral diffusion
   measurements at low ionic strengths (similar to 20 mM). Excess surface
   concentrations and adhesion energies of the protein are evaluated by the
   application of Gibbs law of surface excess as a function of charged
   lipid content. Protein expressed in E. coli lacking a myristic acid
   chain (EC-HIS) and natural protein with a fatty acid (DIC-HIS) isolated
   from Dictyostelium cells are compared. For mixtures of DMPG and DMPC,
   protein binding leads to an increase in lateral pressure of the
   monolayer (at constant area) and causes strong lipid immobilization
   pointing to partial penetration of the protein into the lipid layer. The
   natural protein causes a much stronger immobilization than does EC-HIS.
   For a given bull; concentration, the adsorbed protein/lipid molar ratio
   increases with the molar fraction X(PG) Of charged lipid but saturates
   at about 50 mol\% of DMPG. Natural hisactophilin (DIG-HIS) binding to
   PIP2-containing monolayers is purely electrostatic at low bulk
   concentration c(b), and protein penetration dominates only at c(b) >68
   nM. Fluorescence experiments demonstrate that the natural protein
   (DIG-HIS) can mediate the binding of monomeric actin or very small
   oligomers to membranes, showing that the adsorbed protein remains
   functional. In contrast, the recombinant hisactophilin (EC-HIS) can
   mediate only the membrane coupling of larger actin structures.}},

   \{3,7-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-3,7-diazabicyclo{[}3.3.1]nonane\} with
   copper(II) perchlorate has been determined: space group Pbcn (no. 60), a
   = 8.904(2), b = 14.366(1), c = 17.402(2) Angstrom, Z = 4, R = 0.0538.
   The Cu-N bond lengths to the saturated nitrogens are 2.002(4) Angstrom.
   and those to the aromatic nitrogens of dpb are 1.976(4) Angstrom. The
   co-ordination geometry around Cu is considerably distorted away from the
   usual square-planar arrangement found with four nitrogen donor atoms,
   towards tetrahedral geometry, with the trans N-Cu-N angles being
   161.1(2)degrees instead of the expected 180 degrees. Molecular mechanics
   calculations showed that the distortion arises because of van der Waals
   repulsion between the two co-ordinated pyridyl groups of the ligand,
   particularly the hydrogen atoms ortho to the nitrogen donors. These
   calculations are also used to support the idea that the much greater
   thermodynamic stability of the complexes of dpb with smaller metal ions
   than is found for complexes of analogous unreinforced ligands is due to
   the rigid bispidine-type bridge of dpb.}},

Abstract = {{The evolutionary stable distribution of animals between two sources of
   food is considered. At one source (the `'fixed'' source), food is
   obtained at a fixed rate, regardless of the number of animals present
   and the time since the source was used. At the other source (the
   `'renewing'' source) the probability that an item of food is present
   depends on the time since the previous item was obtained. Animals may
   switch from the fixed source to the renewing source to see if an item is
   available and then return to the fixed source. This takes a total time
   tau. The evolutionarily stable distribution gives us an ideal free
   distribution. This distribution depends on the number of animals as well
   as on the parameters of the two sources and the travel time tau. The
   rate on the renewing source is defined to be the probability of
   obtaining an item divided by tau. In contrast to most ideal free
   distributions, the rates on the two sources are not always equal, but
   they do tend to become equal as the number of animals becomes large. (C)

Abstract = {{Conversion of the cellular isoform of prion protein (PrPC) into the
   scrapie isoform (PrPSc) involves an increase in the P-sheet content,
   diminished solubility, and resistance to proteolytic digestion.
   Transgenetic studies argue that PrPC and PrPSc form a complex during
   PrPSc formation; thus, synthetic PrP peptides, which mimic the
   conformational pluralism of PrP, were mixed with PrPC to determine
   whether its properties were altered, Peptides encompassing two
   alpha-helical domains of PrP when mixed with PrPC produced a complex
   that displayed many properties of PrPSc, The PrPC-peptide complex formed
   fibrous aggregates and up to 65\% of complexed PrPC sedimented at
   100,000 x g for 1 h, whereas PrPC alone did not. These complexes were
   resistant to proteolytic digestion and displayed a high P-sheet content.
   Unexpectedly, the peptide in a P-sheet conformation did not form the
   complex, whereas the random coil did. Addition of 2\% Sarkosyl disrupted
   the complex and rendered PrPC sensitive to protease digestion, While the
   pathogenic A117V mutation increased the efficacy of complex formation,
   anti-PrP monoclonal antibody prevented interaction between PrPC and
   peptides, Our findings in concert with transgenetic investigations argue
   that PrPC interacts with PrPSc through a domain that contains the first
   two putative alpha-helices. Whether PrPC-peptide complexes possess prion
   infectivity as determined by bioassays remains to be established.}},

Abstract = {{The activated spin-label 3-(2-bromoacetamido)proxyl modifies the sulfur
   atom of phosphorothioate-containing AMP, ADP, and ATP analogs in a
   facile reaction that produces a new series of spin-labeled nucleotides.
   One of these products, adenosine 5'-O-(S-acetamidoproxyl
   3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma SAP), has been evaluated as a structural
   probe for Rhodobacter sphaeroides phosphoribulokinase (PRK). When
   incubated with affinity-purified enzyme that contains tightly bound
   substrate ATP, ATP gamma SAP binds noncooperatively to the allosteric
   site (n = 1; K-D = 8 mu M). Probe bound in this site is displaced (K-1/2
   = 100 mu M) by the allosteric effector, NADH, at concentrations
   comparable to those required for enzyme activation (K-a 133 mu M). In
   the presence of NADH, when PRK's substrate site is vacant, ATP gamma SAP
   binds in a cooperative mode (Hill coefficient approximate to 2.9; K-D =
   20 mu M). In the absence of NADH, ATP gamma SAP mimics ATP by exhibiting
   nonequilibrium binding to PRK. The observations with
   phosphoribulokinase, together with the straightforward nature of the
   methodology documented for synthesis and isolation of this class of
   spin-labeled nucleotides, suggest that these analogs have potentially
   wide application as structural probes.}},

Abstract = {{Cocaine exposure in utero causes severe alterations in the development
   of the central nervous system. To study the basis of these teratogenic
   effects in vitro, we have used cocultures of neurons and glial cells
   from mouse embryonic brain. Cocaine selectively affected embryonic
   neuronal cells, causing first a dramatic reduction of both number and
   length of neurites and then extensive neuronal death. Scanning electron
   microscopy demonstrated a shift from a multipolar neuronal pattern
   towards bi- and unipolarity prior to the rounding up and eventual
   disappearance of the neurons. Selective toxicity of cocaine on neurons
   was paralleled by a concomitant decrease of the culture content in
   microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), a neuronal marker measured by
   solid-phase immunoassay. These effects on neurons were reversible when
   cocaine was removed from the culture medium. In contrast, cocaine did
   not affect astroglial cells and their glial fibrillary acidic protein
   (GFAP) content. Thus, in embryonic neuronal-glial cell cocultures,
   cocaine induces major neurite perturbations followed by neuronal death
   without affecting the survival of glial cells. Provided similar neuronal
   alterations are produced in the developing human brain, they could
   account for the qualitative or quantitative defects in neuronal pathways
   that cause a major handicap in brain function following in utero
   exposure to cocaine.}},

Abstract = {{Reaction of the chlorophosphite CIPOCH(2)CMe(2)CH(2)O 1 with
   cyclohexylamine gave the expected product (C6H11NH)POCH(2)CMe(2)CH(2)O 3
   whereas the corresponding chloroarsenite 2 led to the bridged compound
   12. When the reaction was performed in the presence of water, 1 gave the
   expected product H(O)POCH(2)CMe(2)CH(2)O 11 whereas 2 gave the
   ore-bridged compound (AsOCH(2)CMe(2)CH(2)O)(2)O 13. The amino phosphite
   3 underwent hydrolysis to afford the ring cleaved product 18 whereas the
   phenoxy phosphite 21 led to the ring preserved compound 11. In contrast,
   the corresponding phenoxy arsenite (PhO)AsOCH(2)CMe(2)CH(2)O 25 gave the
   oxo-bridged compound 13. Addition of perchloro-o-benzoquinone to the
   phosphite 23 was highly exothermic and afforded the phosphorane 29;
   however the corresponding arsenonate 27 reacted very sluggishly at room
   temperature and when heated gave an uncharacterizable mixture of
   products.
   The identity of the title oxy-bridged compounds 13 and 15 obtained here
   has been confirmed by X-ray structure determination; the six-membered
   rings in 13 have a `chair' conformation and the eight-membered rings in
   15 have a `symmetrical anti' conformation.}},

Abstract = {{The differentiation of oligodendrocytes from undifferentiated progenitor
   cells was studied in cultures obtained from the postnatal rabbit retina.
   `Sandwich' cultures were established by turning the coverslips with
   adhering cells up-side down about 24 h after seeding. As a result
   O4-positive oligodendrocyte progenitors stop dividing and differentiate.
   Within 6 days in vitro they form extensive membranous sheets and acquire
   myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG), proteolipid protein (PLP), and
   myelin basic protein (MBP). O4-/MBP-positive oligodendrocytes and
   vimentin-positive/GFAP-negative Muller cells (a kind of modified
   astrocyte type in the retina), which are also present in these cultures,
   occupy distinct territories in vitro. When oligodendrocyte precursors
   were seeded onto a preformed Muller cell feeder layer they prefer to
   settle on the Muller cell free substrate poly-L-lysine, develop numerous
   processes but no membranous sheets and fail to acquire detectable
   amounts of MBP. In addition, culturing Muller cells and oligodendrocytes
   within the same medium, but without direct contact to each other,
   oligodendrocyte precursor cells fail to express MBP. The Muller cell
   factor(s) responsible for this interaction remains to be determined.}},

   test the hypothesis that dopamine receptors were overproduced prior to

   hypothesis was confirmed in striatum but not nucleus accumbens. D-1
   receptor B-max ({[}H-3]SCH-23390) peaked at 40 days, with levels 67 +/-
   21\% greater than at 25 days. However, B-max levels were at least 35\%
   lower at 60-120 days than at 40 days. Similarly, D-2 receptor numbers

Abstract = {{During the Astro-2 mission in 1995 March, the Hopkins Ultraviolet
   Telescope (HUT) was used to conduct a sensitive search for far-UV
   emission lines from hot gas in the halo of NGC 4631. This galaxy has
   strong radio continuum emission, extended H(Y emission, and soft X-ray
   emission from an extended halo. Recent ROSAT observations indicate that
   much of the X-ray emission comes from a very soft component, with a
   temperature less than 6 x 10(5) K. Gas cooling through this temperature
   range should show emission in the prominent O VI lambda lambda 1032,
   1038 and C IV lambda lambda 1548, 1551 lines. Hot gas interacting with
   cold clouds at the interface of the disk and the halo may form turbulent
   mixing layers, which should produce strong emission in lower ionization
   species such as C II lambda 1335 and O III] lambda lambda 1661, 1666.
   The aperture of the HUT spectrograph subtends 10 `' x 56 `' and was
   positioned parallel to the disk 39 `' (1.4 kpc) south of the nucleus. No
   emission lines were detected. The derived constraints are tempered
   somewhat by the unknown extinction within the NGC 4631 halo. If it is
   low, the upper limits suggest that the mean mixing-layer temperatures
   are less than 2 x 10(5) K or that mixing layers are not a significant
   contributor to the observed Ha emission at the position of the HUT slit.
   For smooth flows, the upper limit to the O VI flux suggests that less

Abstract = {{Adenosine, a modulator of pain processing in the spinal cord, is
   metabolized by adenosine kinase and adenosine deaminase. In this study
   we determined which of these mechanisms is more important for the
   regulation of endogenous adenosine levels in the rat spinal cord. The
   effects of the adenosine kinase inhibitors, 5'-amino-5'-deoxyadenosine
   (NH(2)dAD) and iodotubercidin (IOT), and the adenosine deaminase
   inhibitor, 2'-deoxycoformycin (DCF), on adenosine release in a spinal
   cord superfusion model were studied. DCF markedly increased basal
   adenosine levels detected in perfusates and was more potent than
   NH(2)dAD and IOT in this regard. Coadministration of DCF with NH(2)dAD
   produced an enhanced effect compared to the inhibitors alone. NH(2)dAD,
   but not DCF, potentiated morphine-evoked adenosine release. These
   results suggest that adenosine deaminase may be the predominant pathway
   for adenosine metabolism in this experimental model.}},

Abstract = {{Carbonyl products of the gas phase reaction of ozone with four
   monosubstituted and three 1,2-disubstituted unsaturated alcohols that
   are relevant to biogenic emissions have been identified in laboratory
   experiments involving unsaturated alcohol-ozone mixtures in the dark.
   Cyclohexane was added to scavenge the hydroxyl radical, which forms as a
   product of the ozone-unsaturated alcohol reaction. Major carbonyl
   products included formaldehyde and hydroxyacetaldehyde from allyl
   alcohol, acetaldehyde, and hydroxyacetaldehyde from 2-buten-1-ol,
   propanal, and hydroxyacetaldehyde from cis-2-penten-1-ol, formaldehyde
   from 3-buten-2-ol, 1-penten-3-ol, and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol, and
   hydroxyacetaldehyde from 2-buten-1,4 diol. Yields of the primary
   carbonyls (ozone + unsaturated alcohol --> 2 primary carbonyls + 2
   biradicals) averaged 0.91 +/- 0.29, which compares to a theoretical
   value of 1.0. Yields of carbonyls that are not hydroxy substituted
   averaged 0.38 +/- 0.13, which compares to a theoretical value of 0.50 if
   one assumes that the alkyl-substituted and the hydroxyalkyl-substituted
   biradicals are formed in equal yields. The corresponding reaction
   mechanisms are outlined with focus on similarities between unsaturated
   alcohols and alkene structural homologues. Possible decomposition
   pathways for hydroxyalkyl-substituted biradicals are examined. The
   atmospheric persistence and the fate of unsaturated alcohols from
   biogenic emissions and of their carbonyl products are briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Spark-processed Si was characterized by temperature-dependent
   cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements. The CL spectra were recorded
   between 6 and 300 K. Two separated CL maxima were observed. The
   high-energy peak centred around 480 nm and the low-energy peak near 650
   nm. Whereas the intensity of the red CL increased at lower temperatures,
   the intensity of the blue CL had a maximum near 230 K and then decreased
   continuously with decreasing temperatures. The integrated intensity for
   both CL bands remained essentially constant at temperatures below 270 K.
   This behaviour is interpreted in terms of a competitive radiative
   mechanism. Furthermore, the localized distribution of cathodoluminescing
   centres across the surface of a sample was studied by spectrally
   resolved CL micrographs. The results are discussed in comparison with
   the photoluminescing characteristics of spark-processed Si and in the

Abstract = {{An exact method that analytically provides transfer matrices in finite
   networks of quasicrystalline approximants of any dimensionality is
   discussed. We use these matrices in two ways: (a) to exactly determine
   the band structure of an infinite approximant network in analytical
   form; (b) to determine, also analytically, the quantum resistance of a
   finite strip of a network under appropriate boundary conditions. As a
   result of a subtle interplay between topology and phase interferences,
   we find that a strip of phason defects along a special symmetry
   direction of a low 2D Penrose approximant, leads to the rigorous
   vanishing of the reflection coefficient for certain energies. A similar
   behaviour appears in a low 3D approximant. This type of `resonance' is
   discussed in connection with the gap structure of the corresponding
   ordered (undefected) system.}},

Abstract = {{By using the diagram technique method, we introduce the collective

   individual structure factors of the block copolymer chain entering the
   Leibler expression of the collective structure factor. The expansion
   parameter, which controls the fluctuations, is found to be proportional
   to the Flory-Huggins chi parameter. We apply our method to compute the
   collective structure factor of a diblock copolymer melt above the
   microphase separation (MST) in a self-consistent way. Below the MST, we
   predict that the individual quantities of the copolymer melt (gyration
   radius, R(g); mean-square end-to-end distance of the block copolymer,
   R(2)) become explicitly dependent on the order parameter and compute
   this dependence for R(2) up to the lowest order.}},

Volume = {{454}},
Number = {{1, 1}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines several methods of tracing galaxies in N-body
   simulations and the effects of these methods on the derived galaxy
   statistics. Special attention is paid to the phenomenon of velocity
   bias, the idea that the velocities of galaxies may be systematically
   different from that of the mass distribution. Using two simulations with
   identical initial conditions, one following a single dark matter
   particle fluid and the other following two particle fluids of dark
   matter and baryons, both collisionless and collisional methods of
   tracing galaxies are compared to one another and against a set of
   idealized criteria. None of the collisionless methods prove
   satisfactory, including an elaborate scheme developed here to circumvent
   previously known problems. The main problem is that galactic
   overdensities are both secularly and impulsively disrupted while
   orbiting in cluster potentials. With dissipation, the baryonic tracers
   have much higher density contrasts and much smaller cross sections,
   allowing them to remain distinct within the cluster potential. The
   question remains whether the incomplete physical model, especially the
   expected conversion from a collisional gas to a collisionless stellar
   fluid, introduces systematic biases. Statistical measures determined
   from simulations can vary significantly based solely on the galaxy
   tracing method utilized. The two-point correlation function differs most
   on cluster scales (less than 1 Mpc), with generally good agreement on
   larger scales (except for one systematically biased method). Pairwise
   velocity dispersions show less uniformity on all scales addressed here.
   All tracing methods show a velocity bias to varying degrees, but the
   predictions are not firm: either the tracing method is not robust, or
   the statistical significance has not been demonstrated. Though
   theoretical arguments suggest that a mild velocity bias should exist,
   simulation results are not yet conclusive.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To evaluate measurement of serum prostate specific antigen as
   a potential screening test for future clinical prostate cancer among
   healthy men.
   Design-Nested case-control study with stored serum samples collected
   from 49261 men with follow up using national death and cancer
   registration systems.
   Subjects-265 asymptomatic men who subsequently developed clinical
   prostate cancer and 1055 controls matched for age, study centre, and
   duration of storage of samples.
   Main outcome measures-Distribution of concentrations of the antigen in
   men who developed prostate cancer and in controls.
   Results-Prostate specific antigen concentrations were significantly
   higher in men who subsequently developed prostate cancer than in
   controls. In the first three years after blood collection the median
   concentration was 23 times greater in cases than in controls of the same
   age at the same centre (that is, 23 multiples of the median). A smaller
   difference persisted thereafter; 4.0 multiples of the median 3-6 years
   after blood collection, 3.6 6-10 years, and 1.8 after 10 years. In the
   first three years the proportion of men who developed prostate cancer
   and had raised levels of the antigen (greater than or equal to 12
   multiples of the median) (detection rate or sensitivity) was 81\% (95\%
   confidence interval 54\% to 96\%). The proportion of men who did not
   develop prostate cancer but had levels this high (false positive rate)
   was only 0.5\%.
   Conclusion-Prostate specific antigen measurement is a highly
   discriminatory screening test for prostate cancer among healthy men. In
   the general population, 60-74 year old men who had greater than or equal
   to 12 times the normal median level would have about a 50\% chance of
   developing clinical prostate cancer in the next three years. Measurement
   of this antigen is a good enough screening test to justify a randomised
   controlled trial to determine any reduction in mortality from prostate
   cancer.}},

   polymeric immunoglobulin A receptor (Barr, V. A., and Hubbard, A. L.
   (1993) Gastroenterology 105, 554-571), Starting with crude microsomes
   from the livers of {[}S-35]methionine-labeled rats, we sequentially
   immuno-adsorbed first vesicles containing the endocytic
   asialoglycoprotein receptor and then (from the depleted supernatant)
   vesicles containing the polymeric IgA receptor, Biochemical
   characterization indicated that early basolateral and late endosomes
   were present in the first population but not in the second. Neither
   Golgi, apical plasma membrane (PM)-, nor basolateral PM-derived vesicles
   were significant contaminants of either population. Both vesicle
   populations contained S-35-labeled receptor and S-35-labeled-dipeptidyl
   peptidase TV, Importantly, the elevated relative specific activity of
   the dipeptidyl peptidase (\% of S-35-labeled/\% immunoblotted) in the
   second population indicated that these vesicles must transport newly
   synthesized dipeptidyl peptidase IV. A distinct kind of vesicle was
   immunoadsorbed from a `'carrier-vesicle fraction''; surprisingly, these
   vesicles contained little S-35-receptor and virtually no dipeptidyl
   peptidase IV. These results, together with previous kinetic data from in
   vivo experiments, are consistent with a computer-generated model
   predicting that newly synthesized dipeptidyl peptidase IV is delivered
   to basolateral endosomes, which also contain newly synthesized polymeric
   immunoglobulin A receptor. The two proteins are then transcytosed
   together to the subapical region.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics and solution structure of the lithium salt of
   2-methoxy-{[}(R)-1-phenylethyl]{[}(S)-1-phenylethyl]amine (1) in diethyl
   ether (DEE), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethoxyethane (DME),
   N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylene diamine (TMEDA) and toluene were studied
   by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy at temperatures down to -100 degrees C.
   The lithium salt of 1 (3) is a dimer with C-2 symmetry in DEE with two
   different lithium resonances in the Li-6 NMR. The activation parameters
   for the intra-aggregate lithium exchange in DEE has been determined by
   line-shape analysis, Delta H double dagger = 50 +/- 2 kJ/mol; Delta S
   double dagger = -10 +/- 10 J/(mol K). The observed low activation
   entropy and the concentration-independent coalescence temperature, T-c =
   250 K, suggest an intra-aggregate lithium exchange without assistance by
   additional ligands in the rate-limiting transition state. Slow ligand
   exchange on the NMR time scale for 3 in DEE, THF, DME, and TMEDA were
   observed by both C-13 and Li-6 NMR spectroscopy. It was established that
   3 coordinates only one solvent ligand indicating that one of the
   lithiums in 3 is tetracoordinate (two nitrogens and two methoxy groups)
   and the other is tricoordinate (two nitrogens and one solvent ligand). A
   slightly broader Li-6 signal and a much broader Li-7 signal were
   observed for the tricoordinate lithium compared to the tetracoordinate
   one. This effect is probably due to the less symmetric local environment
   around the tricoordinate lithium. THF titration of 3 in DEE showed that
   THF has substantially greater affinity for 3 than does DEE. The addition
   of 0.5 equivalents of THF to a DEE solution of 3 afforded THF solvated
   3. At higher concentrations of THF, monomers of the lithium salt of 1
   were observed, and in neat THF only monomers were observed. From a
   temperature study at low THF concentrations, the enthalpy and entropy
   for the dimer-monomer equilibrium were determined, Delta(r) degrees =
   -33 +/- 1 kJ/mol; Delta(r)S degrees = -185 +/- 4 J/(mol K). The
   Li-6,H-1-HOESY spectra of 3 ligated by different ethers showed similar
   dimer structures. Titration of 3 in toluene with DME showed the presence
   of DME solvated monomers and dimers of 3 with DME probably functioning
   as a monodentate ligand. Titration of 3 in toluene with TMEDA resulted
   in the formation of mostly monomers with bidentate TMEDA ligation. Slow
   ligand exchange was only observed for monosolvated and tricoordinate
   lithium cations.}},

   has been shown to be effective alone or in combination with other agents

   buffer results in the rapid formation of a stable mono-derivatized
   product (N-substituted 1-cyanobenz{[}f]isoindole, CBI), which is UV
   active. An analytical method has been developed to separate CBI-DFMO
   from NDA-CN derivatization products of 20 standard amino acids using
   capillary electrophoresis (CE). This method is then employed for the
   determination of DFMO in plasma microdialysis samples. Separation of
   DFMO from other components in the dialysate was achieved within 20 min.
   The response for DFMO in Ringer's solution was linear over the range of
   1.2 . 10(-6) to 1.6 . 10(-4) M after derivatization. The detection limit
   of DFMO in the plasma dialysate is 5 mu M using UV detection at 254 nm.
   This method has been proven to have adequate sensitivity for

   successfully applied to monitoring the pharmacokinetics of DFMO by

Abstract = {{In view of the observations that the calcium ionophores, A23187 and
   ionomycin, enhance the processing and secretion of interleukin-1 (IL-1
   alpha) and IL-1 beta from macrophages, and IL-1 alpha processing is
   mediated by calpain, a calcium-dependent protease, we evaluated the
   possibility that calpain might also play a role in the processing of
   IL-1 beta, Whereas calpain-containing P388D1 macrophage lysates and
   purified calpain processed precursor IL-1 alpha to its mature 17-kDa
   form, precursor IL-1 beta was degraded by both sources of calpain,
   However, the activation of calpain in P388D1 cells that were transiently
   transfected with a cDNA expression vector encoding the precursor form of
   IL-1 beta did not result in the degradation of precursor IL-1 beta, but
   did result in the processing and secretion of IL-1 alpha, implying that
   precursor IL-1 beta is protected from calpain degradation in vivo.
   Furthermore, calpain did not enhance the processing of the IL-1 beta
   precursor by the IL-1 beta-converting enzyme, These results indicate
   that calpain is not involved in the processing of precursor IL-1 beta in
   vitro or in vivo, The IL-1 beta precursor may be protected from calpain
   degradation by a sequestering mechanism that involves a cytoplasmic
   factor(s) that reduces the sensitivity of IL-1 beta to attach by calpain
   or localizes IL-1 beta to a site that precludes any interaction with the
   protease.
   Although MDL 28,170, a calpain inhibitor, prevented the
   ionomycin-induced processing of precursor IL-1 alpha to the mature
   protein in P388D1 cells, it did not inhibit the ionomycin-induced
   secretion of the mature IL-1 alpha and -beta proteins expressed in these
   cells. These results indicate that a calcium-dependent factor other than
   calpain is involved in the secretion of the mature IL-1 proteins.}},

   determination (without derivatization) of twenty common amino acids with
   indirect absorbance detection {[}Y.-H. Lee and T.I. Lin, J. Chromatogr.
   A, 680 (1994) 287]. Here, we report a further improvement in the
   resolution, resulting from the use of various cyclodextrin (CD)
   additives. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) was performed at pH 11.0 with
   either p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) or 4-(N,N'-dimethylamino)-benzoic
   acid (DMAB) as the background electrolyte (BGE). The effects on the CE
   separation brought about by various CD additives, e.g. alpha- and
   beta-cyclodextrins, methyl-, hydroxypropyl-, 2,6-dimethyl-, and
   2,3,6-trimethyl-beta-cyclodextrins were investigated. These CD additives
   form inclusion complexes with the BGE and also with amino acids,
   altering the migration behavior of the analytes. For some amino acids
   which have previously proved difficult or impossible to separate, an
   improvement in the separation selectivity has been attained. Association
   constants of BGEs for cyclodextrins were determined on the basis of the
   CE mobility changes caused by the CD additive. The concentration of CD
   additive needed to achieve a suitable separation was calculated and
   optimized experimentally. Using 10 mM PAS or DMAB, in the presence of 20
   mM alpha-cyclodextrin at pH 11.0, eighteen amino acid peaks were
   baseline-resolved in under 35 min. Leu and Ile could also be separated
   in the presence of 15-20 mM beta-CD under similar CE conditions. The
   performance of CE in separating amino acids in the presence of various
   CD additives is discussed.}},

   volunteers (eight men, three women; mean age 30.5 {[}26-36] years; mean
   weight 71.4 kg) after a single intake of 80 g ethanol (corresponding to

   interleukin-6 receptortor, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist,
   gamma-interferon and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. A
   tendency towards an increase was measured regarding the CD-4 lymphocyte

Abstract = {{A dynamic computer model for the simulation of open-tubular capillary
   electrophoresis which includes in situ calculation of electroosmosis

   electroosmosis is calculated with the use of a wall mobility, the
   voltage gradient and the dissociation of the wall represented by the
   dissociation of a weak monovalent acid. Then, the bulk capillary flow is
   taken to be the average of al of the segment flows and considered to
   represent a plug flow. This simple approach permits the combined
   simulation of the temporal behavior of electroosmosis and
   electrophoresis. Comparison of simulation data obtained with a wall pK
   of about 6 and a mobility between 5 . 10(-8) and 7 . 10(-8) m(2)/V . s
   with data produced in untreated fused-silica capillaries shows that the
   model provides a good estimate of the magnitude and distribution of
   electroosmosis when having buffers of pH > 5.5. For lower pH, a pK lower
   than 6 has to be used, this representing a rough approximation only. The
   model also provides the whole dynamics of all components, the electrical

   responses to increased zinc concentrations, but differences were found
   in the responses to both cadmium and iron. Since population

Abstract = {{Glucagon receptor mutants were characterized with the aim of elucidating
   minimal structural requirements for proper biosynthesis, ligand binding,
   and adenylyl cyclase coupling. One N-terminal deletion mutant and five
   truncation mutants with progressively shorter C termini were expressed
   in transiently transfected monkey kidney (COS-1) cells. Each truncation
   mutant was designed so that the truncated C-terminal tail would remain
   on the cytoplasmic surface of the receptor. In order to characterize the
   cellular location of the expressed receptor mutants, a highly specific,
   high affinity antipeptide antibody was prepared against the
   extracellular, N-terminal tail of the receptor, Immunoblot analysis and
   immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the presence of all seven
   putative transmembrane segments, but not an intact N-terminal tail, was
   required for cell surface expression of the receptor, Membranes from
   cells expressing receptor mutants lacking a large portion of the
   N-terminal tail or any of the seven putative transmembrane segments
   failed to bind glucagon. Membranes from cells expressing the C-terminal
   tail truncation mutants, which retained all seven transmembrane
   segments, bound glucagon with affinities similar to that of the native
   receptor and activated cellular adenylyl cyclase in response to
   glucagon. These results indicate that all seven helices are necessary
   for the proper folding and processing of the glucagon receptor,
   Glycosylation is not required for the receptor to reach the cell
   surface, and it may not be required for ligand binding, However, the
   N-terminal extracellular portion of the receptor is required for ligand
   binding, Most of the distal C-terminal tail is not necessary for ligand
   binding, and the absence of the tail may increase slightly the receptor
   binding affinity for glucagon. The C-terminal tail is also not necessary
   for adenylyl cyclase coupling and therefore does not play a direct role
   in G protein (G(s)) activation by the glucagon receptor.}},

Abstract = {{The peeling of an adhesive tape is studied when a constant applied load
   is clamped to its extremity. Three different regimes are observed, as in
   the peeling at constant speed, previously studied (Maugis and Barquins,
   1988). If applied loads are small, the peeling is stable and it
   increases at increasing load so that the strain energy release rate
   varies as a power function of the peeling speed, as already found
   (Barquins et al., 1986). When the applied load reaches a critical value,
   a velocity jump is observed whereas the peeling becomes jerky with
   emission of a characteristic noise. This phenomenon of self sustained
   oscillations (stick-slip) is well-known. When applied loads are high,
   the peeling regime is stable again, and the speed increases slowly at
   increasing load. The new phenomenon which is exhibited in this study is
   that during the jerky mode of peeling, the mean value of the peeling
   speed remains constant whatever the applied load in a large range.
   Moreover, the stick-slip is characterized by simultaneous light-wave and
   acoustic emissions which have been recorded.}},

   The spectrum of Pt(100) hex-R0.7 degrees is found to be dominated by
   surface polariton-like absorption due to the wavy nature of the first
   layer superstructure, but an additional absorption is also observed in
   the reconstructed layer. After exposure to CO the surface transforms to
   a Pt(1 x 1) surface covered with Pt islands. The growth of the (1 x 1)
   phase is highly anisotropic, i.e. the growth being much faster along the
   {[}<0(1) over bar 1>] direction than along {[}011]. The islands are
   elongated in the fast growth direction and an optical anisotropy from

Abstract = {{Photonic devices are becoming increasingly important in information and
   communication technologies. But attempts to integrate photonics with
   silicon-based microelectronics are hampered by the fact that silicon has
   an indirect band gap, which prevents efficient electron-photon energy
   conversion. Light-emitting silicon-based materials have been made using
   band-structure engineering of SiGe and SiC alloys and Si/Ge
   superlattices, and by exploiting quantum-confinement effects in
   nanoscale particles and crystallites(1-3). The discovery(4,5) that
   silicon can be etched electrochemically into a highly porous form that
   emits light with a high quantum yield has opened up the latter approach
   to intensive study(6-12). Here we report the fabrication, by
   molecular-beam epitaxy, of well-defined superlattices of silicon and
   SiO2, which emit visible light through photoluminescence. We show that
   this light emission can be explained in terms of quantum confinement of
   electrons in the two-dimensional silicon layers. These superlattice
   structures are robust and compatible with standard silicon technology.}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that loss of the short arm of chromosome 3 is one
   of the most frequent abnormalities in human head and neck cancers
   including oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and that one or more
   putative tumor suppressor gene(s) which may contribute to the initiation
   and/or progression of these tumors might be located on chromosome 3p. In
   this study, we examined the effects of introducing human chromosome 3 or
   7 by microcell hybridization on the tumor-associated phenotypes of three
   different human oral SCC cell lines, HSC-2, HSC-3 and HSC-4. Transfer of
   a single chromosome 3p completely suppressed the tumorigenicity of all
   three parental cell lines, which showed a significant decrease in growth
   rate in vitro and morphological changes. In contrast, transfer of
   chromosome 7 had no effect on HSC-2 and HSC-4 cells, although it
   suppressed the tumorigenicity of HSC-3 cells without modifying their in
   vitro growth properties. Our findings provide additional confirmatory
   evidence that loss or inactivation of putative tumor suppressor gene(s)
   present on chromosome 3p might be primarily involved in the development
   of human oral SCC. The possibility that chromosome 7 may carry another
   tumor suppressor gene(s) is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the attenuation and geometrical spreading coefficient of Lg

   source-receiver distances between 80 and 400 km. We used the coda
   normalization method which is based on the elimination of the source and
   site effects from observed spectra of Lg waves. Q for Lg waves in the
   crust was determined as a function of frequency in the range 1.5-10.0 Hz
   for western Anatolia and in the range 1.5-12 Hz for southern Spain. We
   found that Q(Lg) shows a strong frequency dependence in both regions. In
   western Anatolia, the frequency dependence of Q(Lg) is Q(Lg)(f)=
   82.f(1.0) and the geometrical spreading coefficient ranges from 0.6 to
   0.9. We found Q(Lg) = 83.f(0.88) and a geometrical spreading coefficient
   close to 0.5 in southern Spain. Comparing our results with code-Q values
   obtained in both regions, Q(Lg) and Q(Lg) are similar. Q(Lg) is close to
   Q(i) in all frequency bands. We interpret the geometrical spreading

Abstract = {{Let R be an atomic integral domain. Suppose that H is a nonempty subset
   of irreducible elements of R, u is a unit of R, and
   alpha(1),...,alpha(n), beta(1),...,beta(m) are irreducible elements of R
   such that (1) alpha(1)...alpha(n) = u .beta(1)...beta(m). Set H-alpha =
   \{i\textbackslash{}alpha(i) is an element of H\} and H-beta =
   \{j\textbackslash{}beta(j) is an element of H\}. H is a factorization
   set (F-set) of R if for any equality involving irreducibles of the form
   (1), \textbackslash{}H-alpha\textbackslash{} not equal 0 implies that
   \textbackslash{}H-beta\textbackslash{} not equal 0. H is a
   half-factorial set (HF-set) if any equality of the form (1) implies that
   \textbackslash{}H-alpha\textbackslash{} =
   \textbackslash{}H-beta\textbackslash{}. In this paper, we explore in
   detail the structure of the F-sets and I-IF-sets of an atomic integral
   domain R. If P is a nonzero prime ideal of R and I(R) the set of
   irreducible elements of R, then set H-P = P boolean AND I(R). We show
   that if F is an F-set of R, then there exists a nonempty set X of
   nonzero prime ideals of R such that F = UP is an element of XHP. We
   define an F-set to be minimal if it contains no proper subsets which are
   F-sets. We then show that in R every F-set can be written as a union of
   minimal F-sets if and only if R satisfies the Principal Ideal Theorem.
   If, in addition, every height-one prime ideal of R is the radical of a
   principal ideal, then this representation is unique. We study the
   structure of the HF-sets of R and concentrate on the case where R is a
   Krull domain with torsion divisor class group. For such a domain R, we
   show that if H is an KF-set of R and P is a nonprincipal prime ideal of
   R with H-P subset of or equal to H, then H-Q subset of or equal to H for

Abstract = {{Six new {[}2]catenanes, which have been constructed by efficient
   (38-64\%) template-directed methods incorporate (a) within their
   crown-10 components hydroquinone and/or 1,5-dioxynaphthalene residues as
   pi-donors and (b) within their tetracationic cyclophane components,
   bipyridinium and/or trans-bis(pyridinium)ethylene units as pi-acceptors,
   the latter as potential photochemically-addressable functions. Four of
   the {[}2]catenanes exhibit translational isomerism in solution, as
   evidenced by dynamic H-1 NMR spectroscopic studies. The preferred
   isomers have a 1,5-dioxynaphthalene residue inside the tetracationic
   cyclophane components and a bipyridinium unit inside the crown-10
   components. Where the {[}2]catenanes have crystallized, X-ray
   crystallography has revealed that the predominant isomer in solution is
   the one that exists in the crystal-for example, only one amongst four
   possible translational isomers is detected in solution at low
   temperatures as well as in the solid state, in the case of the
   {[}2]catenane containing two different pi-donors {[}hydroquinone and
   1,5-dioxynaphthalene rings] and two different it-accepters
   {[}bipyridinium and trans-bis(pyridinium)ethylene units]. The isomer
   populations in solution are also indicated by electrochemical
   experiments. There is evidence in the case of the {[}2]catenane composed
   of bisparaphenylene-34-crown-10 and a tetracationic cyclophane
   incorporating a bipyridinium unit as well as a
   trans-bis(pyridinium)ethylene unit of being able to switch the
   translational isomer preference by reducing and oxidizing sequentially
   the bipyridinium unit electrochemically. These results illustrate the
   progress that is being made toward the construction of controllable
   {[}2]catenanes. A detailed photochemical and photophysical investigation
   has shown that, although the trans-bis(pyridinium)ethylene units undergo
   efficient trans-->cis photochemical process even when incorporated in a
   cyclophane structure, the corresponding {[}2]catenanes cannot be
   photoaddressed because of the presence of low energy charge-transfer
   levels.}},

   reported that following intratracheal instillation of AD in hamsters,
   metabolite could not be detected in lung tissue. However, in studies in
   our laboratory dAD was detected following instillation of AD. The goal
   of the present study was to monitor the distribution of AD and dAD to
   lung and liver within 1 h of AD instillation and to investigate the site
   of AD metabolism. Both AD and dAD were detected in the lung and liver
   within 5 min of AD instillation; lung and liver concentrations of AD and
   dAD were also quantified at 30 and 60 min following AD instillation.
   Incubation of lung and liver microsomes with AD showed that the liver is

Abstract = {{Background Dose-dependent effects of ACE inhibitors on blood pressure,
   cardiac hypertrophy, and beta-adrenergic signal transduction were
   examined in an animal model with beta-adrenergic desensitization: which
   has been identified in failing hearts and in hypertensive cardiac
   hypertrophy. It is unknown whether beneficial ACE-inhibitor effects are
   due to an unloading of the failing heart or a reduction of
   neuroendocrine activation with beta-adrenergic resensitization.
   Methods and Results Low-dose (LD, 1 mg/kg) and high-dose (HD, 25 mg/kg)
   fosinopril treatment was performed in spontaneously hypertensive rats
   (SHR) and control (WKY) rats. Myocardial norepinephrine concentrations,
   adenylyl cyclase activity, beta-adrenergic receptors (radioligand
   binding), G(s alpha) (functional reconstitution), and G(i alpha)
   (pertussis toxin labeling) were determined. Ventricular weights and
   blood pressures were measured. HD but not LD reduced blood pressure and
   left ventricular weights in SHR, Isoprenaline- and
   guanylylim-idodiphosphate-stimulate adenylyl cyclase activities as well
   as beta(1)-adrenergic receptors were reduced in SHR. The catalyst and
   G(i alpha) were unchanged, but G(s alpha) and norepinephrine
   concentrations were increased. Both LD and HD treatments restored
   beta-adrenergic alteration.
   Conclusions LD treatment with ACE inhibitors restored beta-adrenergic
   signal transduction defects independently of regression of cardiac
   hypertrophy. This could contribute to the effects of ACE inhibitors in
   patients, who are often treated with nonhypotensive doses.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. This study sought to determine whether having a cardiologist
   as a regular source of care influences likelihood of undergoing
   necessary coronary angiography.
   Background. An important element of the current health policy debate is
   the respective roles of primary care and specialist physicians. However,
   there are few data on interspecialty differences in quality of care for
   patients with ischemic heart disease.
   Methods. We contacted 243 patients by telephone (response rate 72\%) who
   had positive (or very positive) exercise stress test results and met
   additional clinical criteria for necessary coronary angiography. Study
   patients were randomly sampled from those undergoing exercise stress
   testing at one university and three public hospitals in Los Angeles
   between January 1, 1990 and June 30, 1991. Patients were asked whether
   they had a regular source of care during the time after their exercise
   stress test and, if so, whether that provider was a cardiologist or
   cardiology clinic.
   Results. Among survey responders, 47\% underwent necessary coronary
   angiography within 3 months of exercise testing and 61\% within 12
   months. After adjustment for sociodemographics and clinical
   presentation, patients with a cardiologist as a regular source of care
   were more likely than all other patients to have undergone necessary
   angiography within 3 months (52\% vs. 38\%, p = 0.05) and within 12
   months (74\% vs. 44\%, p = 0.0001) of the exercise test. At 3 months,
   there was a trend toward a more pronounced effect of ongoing cardiologic
   care within the public hospitals compared with the private hospital (p =
   0.09 for interaction between hospital types).
   Conclusions. Patients ffith a cardiologist as a regular source of care
   were more likely than all other patients to undergo clinically necessary
   coronary angiography within both 3 and 12 months of exercise stress
   testing.}},

Abstract = {{A novel neutral ferrocene-containing polyacrylamide-based redox gel was
   prepared from the copolymerization of vinylferrocene (VF) with
   acrylamide and N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide in a one-step procedure,
   Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD) was used to convert
   water-insoluble VF into the water-soluble VF-HPCD inclusion complex,
   allowing the copolymerization to be performed in aqueous solution. A new
   ternary catalyst, consisting of flavin mononucleotide, H2O2, and
   N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine, was developed for initiating the
   polymerization, A redox gel electrode, fabricated by covering the redox
   gel on the surface of a carbon paste electrode with a dialysis membrane,
   exhibits quasireversible electrochemical characteristics. The
   electrocatalytic properties of a glucose biosensor prepared by
   entrapping glucose oxidase in the redox gel were investigated. The
   simplicity and reproducibility of its preparation make this new redox
   gel a good candidate for biosensor applications.}},

Abstract = {{The exchange-correlation energy of a many-electron system may be written
   as the electrostatic interaction between the electron density at
   position r and the density of the exchange-correlation hole at position
   r + u. If we average the hole over the entire system, we find that the
   energy is uniquely decomposed into contributions from various electronic
   separations u. We may also decompose the hole into contributions from
   parallel and antiparallel spins. We give several exact conditions which
   this system-averaged, spin-decomposed exchange-correlation hole
   satisfies. Local spin density (LSD) and generalized gradient
   approximations (GGAS), are more appropriate for u --> 0 than for large u
   and more trustworthy for antiparallel spins than for parallel spins. We
   illustrate how good LSD is as u --> 0 with explicit examples, but also
   note that, contrary to expectation, LSD is not exact for u = 0, except
   in certain limiting cases. We show that the dramatic failure of the
   second-order gradient expansion for large u can be cured by a real-space
   cutoff procedure which generates a nonempirical GGA, the PW91
   functional. We conclude with some thoughts about the search for greater
   accuracy in the next 30 years of density functional theory. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Synechococcus sp, PCC 7942 modulates photosynthetic function by
   transiently replacing the constitutive D1 photosystem II protein, D1:1,
   with an alternate form, D1:2, to help counteract photoinhibition under
   excess light, We show that a temperature drop from 37 to 25 degrees C
   also drives D1:1/D1:2 exchange under constant, moderate light, Chilling
   or light-induced D1 exchange results from rapid loss of psbAI message
   coding for D1:1 and accumulation of psbAII and psbAIII messages coding
   for D1:2, During chilling, a large pool of a novel form, D1:2{*},
   transiently accumulates, distinguishable from normal D1 by an increase
   in apparent molecular mass, D1:{*} is not phosphorylated and is probably
   a functionally inactive, incompletely processed precursor, After
   acclimation to 25 degrees C, D1:2{*} disappears and D1:1 again
   predominates, although substantial D1:2 remains, Partial inhibition of
   electron transport under constant, moderate light also triggers the D1
   exchange process, These treatments all increase excitation pressure on
   photosystem II relative to electron transport, Therefore, information
   from photosynthetic electron transport regulates D1 exchange without any
   requirement for a change in light intensity or quality, possibly via a
   redox sensing mechanism proximal to photosystem II.}},

   The attenuation of the ultrasonic amplitude increased with decreasing

   faster than the diffusion of palladium into vanadium. Significantly, we
   find that hydrogen increases the rate of intermetallic diffusion, and

Abstract = {{By two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 30S ribosomal
   subunit proteins (S proteins) from Haloarcula marismortui we identified
   27 distinct spots and analyzed all of them by protein sequence analysis.
   We demonstrated that protein HmaS2 (HS2) is encoded by the open reading
   frame orfMSG and has sequence similarities to the S2 ribosomal protein
   family. The proteins HmaS5 and HmaS14 were identified as spots HS7 and
   HS21/HS22, respectively. Protein HS4 was characterized by amino-terminal
   sequence analysis. The spot HS25 was recognized as an individual protein
   and also characterized by sequence analysis. Furthermore, the complete
   primary sequence of HS26 is reported, showing similarity only to
   eukaryotic ribosomal proteins. The sequence data of a further basic
   protein shows a high degree of similarity to ribosomal protein S12,
   therefore it was designated HmaS12. Slightly different results compared
   to published sequence data were obtained for the proteins HS12 and
   HmaS19. The putative `ribosomal' protein HSH could not be localized in
   the two-dimensional pattern of the total 30S ribosomal subunit proteins
   of H. marismortui. Therefore, it seems to be unlikely that this protein
   is a real constituent of the H. marismortui, ribosome.}},

   cysteine-rich domain and the 12 repeats of the four-cysteine module of
   the unusually long amino-propeptide. This still unknown four-cysteine
   motif is generally encoded by one exon, which confirms that the distinct
   amino-propeptide structures of the fibril lar collagens arise from the
   shuffling of several exon-encoding modules. Moreover, Southern blot
   analysis of the sea urchin genome and sequencing of selected genomic
   clones allowed us to demonstrate that several sea urchin genes could
   potentially code for the four-cysteine module. Curiously, one of these
   genes lacks the exons coding for four repeats of this motif while, in
   another gene, the same exons are submitted to an alternative splicing

Abstract = {{Large GaAs domains embedded in an AlxGa1-xAs matrix act as potential
   wells for both electrons and holes, resulting in a direct band-gap
   system. When the GaAs domains become small, however, quantum-confinement
   effects may push the Gamma-like conduction-band state localized on GaAs
   above the X-like conduction-band state of the AlxGa1-x As alloy, leading
   to an indirect band-gap system. Using a pseudopotential band-structure
   method, as well as the conventional one-band effective-mass
   approximation, we investigate the nature of the direct-->indirect
   (Gamma-->X) transition in GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs quantum films, wires, and
   dots. In the case of an isolated GaAs quantum structure embedded in
   AlAs, we find that the critical size for the onset of the Gamma-->X
   transition increases from similar to 31 A in a two-dimensional film
   through similar to 56 Angstrom in a one-dimensional cylindrical wire to
   similar to 80 Angstrom in a zero-dimensional spherical dot. The
   interaction between GaAs quantum structures tends to reduce the critical
   size for the Gamma-->X transition. We further study the effect of the
   alloy composition on the Gamma-->X transition, finding that the critical
   size decreases when the Ga concentration of the alloy increases. In the
   case of spherical GaAs quantum dots embedded in an AlxGa1-xAs alloy, we
   show that, as a function of the dot radius and the alloy composition,
   different alignments of the band-edge states lead to different regimes
   of the lowest-energy optical transition.}},

Abstract = {{Cytolytic T cells, acting through cytokines or by direct lysis of
   infected target cells, have been shown to play a significant role in the
   control of viral infections and may be responsible for the prolonged
   asymptomatic phase following infection by HIV. Accordingly, methods that
   can generate strong cell-mediated immune responses may be useful in the
   development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against HIV.
   Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive intracellular microorganism
   that elicits strong cell-mediated immune responses against its own
   secreted proteins following infection. In this study we have modified
   the chromosome of L. monocytogenes so that it stably expresses and
   secretes the p55 HIV gag gene product and examined the cell-mediated
   immune response of BALB/c mice to infection with this recombinant
   organism. Infected animals were found to mount a specific, strong,
   long-lasting CD8(+) cytolytic T cell response against a predominant
   epitope contained within the p24 fragment of the HIV Gag protein. This
   epitope previously has been shown to be recognized by CTLs obtained from
   some HIV-infected humans. Our results suggest that chromosomally

Abstract = {{More than 250,000 women will die of cancer in the United States this
   year, almost 10\% of which are due to gynecologic malignancies, Many of
   these women will have received care in the intensive care unit (ICU).
   With important advances in medical technology and the advent of an
   expanded pharmacologic armamentarium, our ability to maintain life has
   increased greatly over the past few years. However, this phenomenon has
   been associated with great emotional and financial cost. It is estimated
   that ICU charges totaled almost 10\% of the \$810 billion spent on
   health care in the United States in 1992. Because 6-month survival rates
   for patients with cancer admitted to an ICU are the lowest of any
   disease subgroup (23.7\%), we must critically evaluate the role of the
   ICU in the care of these patients.
   Decisions regarding admission to an ICU, level of care, and termination
   of care must take into account patient and family wishes, a reasonable
   estimation of the reversibility of the acute disease process in
   question, and the natural history of the underlying disease. Many
   prognostic scoring systems have been devised to estimate the probability
   of death among adult ICU patients; however, most of these systems were
   developed with data from trauma patients rather than from patients with
   an underlying malignancy, and none are capable of predicting which
   patient will die, Decisions concerning level of care in the ICU will
   necessarily involve medical as well as ethical considerations and are
   best made with a team approach.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the possible causal association between squamous-cell

   compared the history of use of this substance in 375 patients with
   squamous-cell carcinomas of the lip, buccal cavity and floor of mouth,
   and 271 patients with squamous carcinomas of the tongue, palate and
   maxillary sinus, with 204 patients exhibiting non-squamous oral and
   non-oral malignant neoplasms and 2,820 individuals who had no
   malignancy, selected from the general population. The study revealed
   that the high prevalence of oral cancer in the Sudan is largely due to
   chronic use of toombak. The adjusted ORs associated with toombak dipping
   for the first case group, cancer of the lip, buccal cavity and floor of
   mouth in comparison with the hospital and population control groups,
   were 7.3 and 3.9 (95\% confidence limits, 4.3-12.4 and 2.9-5.3)
   respectively and among long-term users the adjusted ORs were 11.0 and
   4.3 (95\% confidence limits, 4.8-25.1 and 2.9-6.3) respectively. The
   elevated risk found when investigating intra-oral cancers of sites in
   direct contact with toombak quid compared to those with little or no
   contact, confirms the hypothesis that direct contact with tissues is an
   important factor in tobacco carcinogenesis in the mouth. The increased
   risk associated with the use of toombak is of particular concern in view
   of its wide consumption in the Sudan.}},

Abstract = {{A general covariant quantization of a superparticle, Green-Schwarz,
   superstring, and a supermembrane with manifest supersymmetry and duality
   symmetry is proposed. This quantization provides a natural-quantum
   mechanical description of curved BPS-type backgrounds related to the
   ultrashort supersymmetry multiplets. Half-size commuting and
   anticommuting Killing spinors admitted by such backgrounds in quantum
   theory become truncated K-symmetry ghosts. The symmetry of Killing
   spinors under dualities transfers to the symmetry of the spectrum of
   states. A GS superstring in the generalized semi-light-cone gauge can be
   quantized consistently in the background of ten-dimensional
   supersymmetric gravitational waves. Upon compactification they become
   supersymmetric electrically charged black holes, either massive or
   massless. However, the generalized light-cone gauge breaks S duality. We
   propose a new family of gauges, which we cap black hole gauges. These
   gauges are suitable for quantization both in hat Minkowski space and in
   the black hole background, and they are duality symmetric. As an
   example, a manifestly S-duality symmetric black hole gauge is
   constructed in terms of the axion-dilaton-electric-magnetic black hole
   hair. We also suggest the U-duality covariant class of gauges for type
   II superstrings.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper, we consider a system of equations that describes
   the interaction of a nonlinear oscillator with an infinite string. The
   main result is the stabilization: roughly speaking, each finite energy
   solution to the system tends to a stationary solution as t --> +infinity
   (and similarly as t--> -infinity). The proof uses the description of a
   reversible system by an irreversible. The limit stationary solutions
   corresponding to t = +/-infinity may be different and arbitrary. The
   result gives a mathematical model of transitions to stationary states in
   reversible systems; these transitions are similar to Bohr ones. Such
   transitions are impossible for finite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems
   and for linear autonomous Shrodinger equations. The paper contains the
   complete exposition and an extension of the author's recent results. (C)

   at these two subbands, we calculate the energy difference between the

   at low temperature, we did observe a persistent photoconductivity. The
   electron densities of the first and second subbands for the sample with
   preannealed substrate were increased by the illumination from 17.3 to
   18.2X10(11) cm(-2) and 3.6 to 4.1X10(11) cm(-2), respectively. The onset

   that the concentration of deep donor traps is about 1.4X10(11) cm(-2)
   and the deep donor traps are not affected by the preannealed substrate.
   We believe that the model to describe the persistent-photoconductivity

   those deep donor levels below Fermi energy and it does not have to be

Abstract = {{We have shown previously {[}McCool, Forstner and Forstner (1994)
   Biochem. J. 302, 111-118] using pulse-chase labelling of mucin with
   {[}H-3]threonine that LS180 colonic tumour cells synthesize and secrete
   MUC2 without the addition of secretagogues. Treatment of the LS180 cells
   with monensin to disrupt Golgi function was also found to inhibit
   baseline secretion almost completely. In this paper we show that
   addition of nocodazole to inhibit microtubule assembly reduced baseline
   secretion by 53\% over a 6 h chase period. In contrast, cytochalasin D
   did not affect the rate of unstimulated mucin synthesis or secretion,
   suggesting that baseline secretion is not influenced by disruption of
   actin microfilaments. In addition, regulated mucin secretion by LS180
   cells was studied in response to carbachol, phorbol 12-myristate
   13-acetate and A23187. Mucin released in response to secretagogues
   behaved identically on SDS/PAGE to that secreted under baseline
   conditions. T84 cells and the B6 subclone of the HT29 cell line
   responded in a similar manner to LS180 cells and secreted
   high-molecular-mass mucin which included MUC2 and behaved like LS180
   mucin on SDS/PAGE. Neither monensin nor nocodazole significantly
   affected secretagogue-stimulated mucin secretion. Since these compounds
   inhibited secretion of labelled mucin under baseline conditions, mucin
   released by secretagogues must have come from a separate, unlabelled
   mucin pool in stored granules. Cytochalasin D, on the other hand, caused
   the release of small amounts of stored mucin, suggesting that actin
   microfilaments participate in regulated exocytosis. Thus two kinds of
   mucin secretion occur in LS180 cells. Unregulated secretion depends upon
   continuous transport of mucin granules from Golgi vesicles to the cell
   surface and does not utilize stored mucin, whereas regulated secretion
   involves the release of mucin from storage granules and is not affected
   by microtubule or Golgi disruption.}},

Abstract = {{A 2D N-15-correlated NOESY experiment is described which makes it
   possible to obtain distance information for exchange-broadened amino
   protons in nucleic acids. Little or no NOE distance information is
   normally obtained for guanine and adenine amino protons because of
   rotation of the amino group around the C-N bond which leads to extreme
   broadening of the amino proton resonances. Here NOEs involving amino
   protons are detected via efficient transfer of heteronuclear
   magnetization between the amino protons and nitrogens, which is
   accomplished by application of a train of closely spaced 180 degrees
   echo pulses. This technique has been applied to a uniformly N-15-labeled
   lead-dependent ribozyme known-as the leadzyme. The 2D N-15-correlated
   NOESY experiment allowed 19 NOE constraints to amino protons to be
   identified that had not been previously observed in standard NOE
   spectra. Molecular dynamics calculations were performed with and without
   these additional amino NOE constraints and demonstrated that these amino
   constraints significantly improved the structure of the GAAA tetraloop
   in the leadzyme. Such NOE constraints involving amino protons will
   likely improve structure determinations of many other nucleic acid
   motifs.}},

Abstract = {{Thin oxide on strained Si1-xGex surface has been grown using a
   nonelectron cyclotron resonance mode microwave plasma at low
   temperatures (150-200 degrees C). An optimized post-oxidation and
   post-metal annealing cycle has resulted in very low fixed oxide charge
   density (1.78X10(10)/cm(2)) and moderately low interface trap density
   (2.9X10(11)/cm(2) eV). A controlled in situ hydrogen-plasma treatment to
   Si1-xGex has been found to be useful in improving the electrical
   properties of the oxide. The high electron injection phenomena of metal
   oxide semiconductor capacitors has been used for charge trapping studies
   of sites normally present in the SiGe oxides. From the position and the
   extent of current ledge observed as a function of ramped gate voltage,
   the capture cross section and the total number of traps have been
   determined. (C) 1995 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Background The appearance of cardiac proteins in blood is the most
   specific and sensitive indicator of acute myocardial cell necrosis. The
   measurement of cardiac markers, however, is time consuming and requires
   sophisticated equipment. To facilitate the biochemical detection for
   acute myocardial cell necrosis, a whole-blood rapid assay device for
   cardiac troponin T detection was developed that provides a test result
   within 20 minutes.
   Methods and Results Monoclonal antibody M7 is labeled with gold
   particles, and antibody 1B10 is labeled with biotin. Both antibodies, as
   well as buffer substances and detergents, are adsorbed onto paper
   fleeces mounted below an application well. Heparinized blood (160 mu L)
   applied to this well solubilizes the dry chemistry reagents. Blood cells
   are separated from plasma via a glass-fiber fleece. The immunocomplexes
   formed are concentrated within the reading zone by binding of the
   biotin-labeled antibody with streptavidine immobilized to the test
   device. Troponin T bound to the test device serves as a control. The
   detection limit of this assay is 0.18 mu g/L with a cross-reactivity
   with skeletal troponin T of 0.5\%. In clinical analyses involving 25
   healthy volunteers, 62 patients with chest pain but without myocardial
   ischemia, 35 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 24 patients with
   minor myocardial cell damage due to radiofrequency ablation, and 35
   patients with unstable angina, the rapid assay was comparable to the
   troponin T enzyme immunoassay in regard to sensitivity and specificity.
   Conclusions This newly developed assay allows accurate, rapid, and
   convenient diagnosis of acute myocardial cell necrosis.}},

Abstract = {{We have used the VLA to image the neutral hydrogen emission from the
   Seyfert galaxy NGC 3227, with angular resolutions ranging from 12 to 60
   arcsec. We detect plumes of HI extending to similar to 70 kpc north and
   similar to 31 kpc south of the galaxy which may be a consequence of
   interaction. Complex motions in the galactic disc have been resolved
   into emission from the disc, which is in approximate solid body
   rotation, and an anomalous velocity cloud, situated north-west of the
   disc at the base of the northern plume. The cloud has a mean velocity of
   similar to 150 km s(-1) above the systemic velocity of NGC 3227 and
   shows evidence of rotation. We suggest that this cloud is a gas-rich
   dwarf galaxy that either is one of the bodies responsible for the
   interaction, or has formed as a consequence of the interaction.
   No neutral hydrogen emission is associated with the companion galaxy NGC
   3226, and the presence of low velocity (500 km s(-1)) gas reported in
   single dish measurements is not detected in the present observations.
   The continuum image of NGC 3227 shows an extended component, in addition
   to the compact core, that may be enhanced disc emission due to the
   interaction. In the central 15 arcsec of the disc we detect evidence of
   HI absorption against the nuclear continuum source. Higher resolution
   observations are required to confirm this.
   Although the velocities in the disc are remarkably close to solid body
   velocities (considering the presence of a disturbing companion), the
   integrated neutral hydrogen emission shows a bar of enhanced emission
   crossing the nucleus, in a north-west to south-east direction, that has
   a `Z' shaped morphology and trails in the same sense as the optical
   spiral arms. This HI bar seems to be a continuation of the CO bar and we
   suggest that it may play an important role in the fuelling of the AGN.
   From our HI observations we deduce a heliocentric systemic velocity of
   1135 +/- 10 km s(-1) for NGC 3227. We derive a value of 56 degrees for
   the inclination of the galactic disc and 158 degrees +/- 2 degrees for
   the PA of the major arris. Neutral hydrogen masses of 5.7 x 10(8) M. for
   the disc, 2.1 x 10(8) M. for the cloud, 1.3 x 10(8) M. in the southern
   plume and 1.8 x 10(8) M. in the northern plume were found, resulting in
   a total H I mass for NGC 3227 of 1.1 x 10(9) M..}},

Abstract = {{Graft rejection and graft failure represent major obstacles in
   allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Cytokines possibly play a
   central role in the inflammatory and allospecific components of
   allograft rejection, Therefore, we evaluated inflammatory cytokine
   levels following BMT in 12 consecutive patients with graft rejection
   (GR), Seven of the patients underwent BMT from siblings (6 matched and 1
   mismatched), 4 patients received bone marrow from other family members
   (3 mismatched and 1 matched), and 1 patient underwent HLA-matched
   unrelated BMT. Nine of 12 had a sex-mismatched BMT and 5/12 had an
   ABO-mismatched BMT, Nine of 12 underwent T cell-depleted (Campath
   anti-CDw52 moAb) BMT. Rejection was defined as marrow hypoplasia with a
   peripheral white blood cell count <0.5x10(9)/L 21 days after BMT, in
   conjunction with the absence of donor cells by polymerase chain reaction
   analysis using a sex-mismatched probe and/or a tumor-specific probe
   (BCR/ ABL). Twenty-five patients who underwent uneventful BMT with no GR
   served as controls. The levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF),
   interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 (IL-1) were evaluated by a high
   sensitive RIA or an enzyme immunoassay, The levels of TNF and IL-6 were
   found to be higher in 10/12 and 7/7 evaluated GR patients, respectively,
   as compared with controls (P<0.05), The level of IL-1 was high only in
   2/12 patients, TNF elevation occurred in all patients immediately after
   GR, TNF and IL-6 levels were significantly higher for patients with
   early rejection (<35 days after BMT) as compared with patients with late
   rejection (>35 days after BMT) (P<0.049 and P<0.006, respectively),
   Eight patients engrafted after the second transplant (2 only transient),
   All 6 patients with Stable engraftment are alive (4 with basic disease),
   while the 4 patients who did not engraft and the 2 patients with only
   transient engraftment died In the 6 patients with no engraftment or only
   transient engraftment, the elevated TNF levels remained high; in the 6
   patients who had stable engraftment after retransplant, TNF levels, but
   not IL-6 levels, decreased In conclusion, a majority of the patients
   with GR displayed high levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF and IL-6),
   Dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines may be involved in the
   pathogenesis of GR.}},

Abstract = {{Mutants of Escherichia coli defective in the HemA protein grow extremely
   poorly as the result of heme deficiency. A novel hemA mutant was
   identified whose rate of growth was dramatically enhanced by addition to
   the medium of low concentrations of translational inhibitors, such as
   chloramphenicol and tetracycline. This mutant (H110) carries mutation at
   position 314 in the hemA gene, which resulted in diminished activity of
   the encoded protein. Restoration of growth of H110 upon addition of the
   drugs mentioned above was due to activation of the synthesis of
   porphyrin. However, this activation was not characteristic exclusively
   of cells with this mutant hemA gene since it was also observed in a
   heme-deficient strain bearing the wild-type hemA gene. The activation
   did not depend on the promoter activity of the hemA gene, as indicated
   by studies with fusion genes. It appears that partial inhibition of
   protein synthesis via inhibition of peptidyltransferase can promote the
   synthesis of porphyrin by providing an increased supply of glutamyl-tRNA
   for porphyrin synthesis. Glutamyl-tRNA is the common substrate for
   peptidyltransferase and HemA.}},

Abstract = {{This article has a few goals. First, a new highly accurate and anomaly
   free time-independent approach to reactive scattering is presented,
   based on the use of very-short-range imaginary potentials. The range of
   the imaginary potentials is extremely short - in successful
   one-dimensional simulations they cover only two grid points. The savings
   are incurred by limiting the role of the imaginary potentials to
   shifting the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian away from the real axis,
   thereby avoiding anomalies; the imaginary potentials are not required to
   impose outgoing boundary conditions. Another goal is a rigorous
   derivation of a flux-amplitude (FA) expression, whereby (far any
   scattering approach, whether using negative imaginary potentials or not)
   reactive S-matrix amplitudes are extracted from the wavefunction at a
   single surface of any desired `'internal'' coordinate system - there is
   no need to project the wave function to the asymptotic products
   coordinates before determining its flux. With the FA expression,
   expensive volume integrals in state-to-state scattering are reduced to
   simple surface integrals. The FA expression also leads to a rigorous
   derivation of various alternate expressions for the scattering matrix
   which are useful whenever negative imaginary potentials are utilized.
   Finally, a new expression is presented for estimating the errors in
   absorbing potentials single-column calculations due to imperfections in
   the absorbing potentials. (C) 1995 American Institute of Physics.}},

   larger variational Hilbert space. We have applied this formulation to a
   system sufficiently simple to permit study of its inner workings. We
   find that the unapproximated theory can be applied to delocalized,
   metallic systems, but the optimized functions, considered as a function
   of the strength of a localizing lattice potential, are not well
   localized for realistically weak (pseudo) potentials. Perhaps more
   importantly, we find that the formulation can be extremely numerically
   sensitive, rendering approximations made within the formulation
   potentially dangerous.}},

Abstract = {{Cervical cancer develops from well-defined precursor lesions referred to
   as either cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or squamous intraepithelial
   lesions. It is now known that specific types of human papillomaviruses
   (HPV) are the principal etiologic agents for both cervical cancer and
   its precursors. The high-oncogenic-risk HPV types associated with
   invasive cervical cancer produce two oncoproteins, designated E6 and E7,
   which interact with endogenous cell cycle regulatory proteins, including
   p53 and Rb. The interaction of virally derived and endogenous cellular
   proteins converges in deregulation of cell cycle progression and appears
   to be critical for the development of cervical cancers. However, the
   development of cervical cancer is a multistep process that cannot be
   explained simply by infection with specific types of HPV. One additional
   event that appears to play a role in tumor progression is integration of
   HPV DNA into the host genome, Integration of HPV DNA frequently disrupts
   the E2 open reading frames, resulting in overexpression of the E6 and E7
   oncoproteins and possibly causing genomic instability. Additional
   cofactors and mutational events may be important in the pathogenesis of
   invasive cervical cancers and may include chromosomal rearrangements,
   loss of constitutional heterozygosity, and proto-oncogene activation.}},

   mites were seen, treatment was continued for at least 2 more weeks and
   then slopped, Dogs were reexamined, and skin scrapings were repeated if
   any skin lesions developed. For dogs that remained clinically normal,
   follow-up information was obtained by telephone. Dogs that were free of
   clinical signs of demodicosis 12 months after ivermectin administration
   was discontinued were considered cured.
   Results-Ten of 12 dogs were cured. Median duration of treatment for
   these dogs was 10 weeks (range, 6 weeks to 5 months). Two dogs were
   failures, relapsing 10 months and 11.5 months after treatment was
   stopped. One of these dogs was successfully treated with a second course
   of ivermectin. Mild ivermectin toxicosis developed in 1 dog after 6
   weeks of treatment; side effects resolved shortly after the treatment
   was stopped.
   Clinical Implications-Daily use of ivermectin, at a dosage of 0.6 mg/kg,
   po, was found to be effective in the treatment of generalized
   demodicosis in dogs.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the second-harmonic generation process in a microcavity of
   optical nonlinear material. We show that, in the case when the cavity
   thickness is much smaller than the material coherence length and for
   sufficiently high finesses, no phase match procedures are necessary to
   obtain a quite large optical conversion yield. It is thus possible to
   capitalize on the large optical nonlinear susceptibilities of III-V or
   II-VI materials though these compounds are not birefringent. It is shown
   that by adjusting mirror reflectivity phases it is possible to obtain
   doubly resonant cavities in which there is no phase mismatch between
   pump and harmonic waves. (C) 1995 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{LINE-like retrotransposons, the so-called I elements, control the system
   of I-R (inducer-reactive) hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster.
   I elements are present in many Drosophila species. It has been suggested
   that active, complete I elements, located at different sites on the
   chromosomes, invaded natural populations of D. melanogaster recently
   (1920-1970). But old strains lacking active I elements have only
   defective I elements located in the chromocenter. We have cloned I
   elements from D. melanogaster and the melanogaster subgroup. In D.
   melanogaster, the nucleotide sequences of chromocentral I elements
   differed from those on chromosome arms by as much as 7\%. All the I
   elements of D. mauritiana and D. sechellia are more closely related to
   the chromosomal I elements of D. melanogaster than to the chromocentral
   I elements in any species. No sequence difference was observed in the
   surveyed region between two chromosomal I elements isolated from D.
   melanogaster and one from D. simulans. These findings strongly support
   the idea that the defective chromocentral I elements of D. melanogaster
   originated before the species diverged and the chromosomal I elements
   were eliminated. The chromosomal I elements reinvaded natural
   populations of D. melanogaster recently, and were possibly introduced
   from D. simulans by horizontal transmission.}},

   Pr(4)VOPc precipitates as a glassy phase in pure PMMA matrix during the

   vapor, stable crystalline Pr(4)VOPc, which has stronger absorption in
   the near-IR region and larger nonlinear refractive index n(2) than the

   solubilization and crystallization of the dye, plastication of the
   polymer chains, and migration of the dye. The nonlinear refractive index

Title = {{HOW MUCH OF THE EXTREME LUMINOSITY OF IRAS F10214+4724 CAN BE ATTRIBUTED
   TO GRAVITATIONAL LENSING}},
Journal = {{MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY}},

Abstract = {{The galaxy IRAS F10214 + 4724, discovered in a spectroscopic survey of a
   0.2-Jy sample by Rowan-Robinson and collaborators in 1991, is
   significantly more luminous than any other known galaxy. Its bolometric
   luminosity is 2x10(14) L., which is comparable to the luminosities of
   the most luminous quasars. Recent observations have revealed a candidate
   foreground group of galaxies, which might gravitationally lense F10214 +
   4724, thus explaining much of its luminosity. High-resolution imaging of
   F10214 + 4724 has revealed that most of its near-IR flux comes from a
   circularly symmetric are; this also supports the gravitational lens
   interpretation. In such a scenario, F10214 + 4724 would be the
   high-redshift analogue of the ultraluminous IRAS galaxies observed
   locally. This work presents a simple statistical lensing model to
   investigate this possibility.
   We show that, on statistical grounds alone, the probability that F10214
   + 4724 is a gravitational lens system with magnification 2 < mu < 10 is
   approximately 25 per cent, If nearby determinations of the luminosity
   function phi(L) for ultraluminous IRAS galaxies can be extrapolated to
   both high redshifts z and high luminosities L. If phi(L) steepens with
   either increasing z or increasing L, we predict a substantial increase
   in the probability of F10214 + 4724 being a lens system. Very large
   magnifications (mu > 20) are ruled out by this model, unless phi(L) is
   very steep, e.g., a power law with index a < - 6. These results
   therefore suggest that F10214 + 4724 is indeed the most luminous galaxy
   known. However, if it is a lens system with mu > 2, it would not have
   been discovered had it not been lensed.}},
