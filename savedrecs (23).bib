Abstract = {{For the design of the five-hundred-meter aperture spherical radio
   telescope (FAST), a four-cable-driven parallel manipulator, which is
   long in span and heavy in weight, is adopted as the first-level
   adjustable feed-support system. The purpose of this paper is to optimize
   dimensions of the four-cable-driven parallel manipulator to meet the
   workspace requirement of constraint condition in terms of cable tension
   and stiffness. Accordingly, this optimization method adopts catenary
   simplification in order to set up the cable tension equilibrium
   equations, preliminarily optimizing three important dimensional
   parameters. Stiffness of the cable is also taken into consideration
   because of its effect on work performance of a cable-driven parallel
   manipulator. However, the stiffness value of a cable-driven parallel
   manipulator is not totally credible by traditional theoretical analysis.
   Therefore, an experimental method for stiffness analysis is presented in
   this paper. It applies Buckingham pi theorem to set up an experimental
   stiffness similarity model to obtain a more credible stiffness value,
   which is used in the optimization process. In this way, dimensional
   optimization is realized with a set of optimized dimensions for building
   the feed-support system in the FAST. More importantly, the stiffness
   similarity model can be universally adopted in stiffness analysis of
   other large cable-driven parallel manipulator.}},

Abstract = {{High speed milling (HSM) has great potential use in die/mold cutting,
   but traditional machining plans do exploit HSM capabilities effectively.
   An important consideration in HSM is to limit cutting force variations,
   and one way to do so is to reduce cutter-workpiece engagement (CWE)
   variations. CWE is measured as the area of the tool instantaneously
   engaged with the part. Estimating CWE as a function of the tool path
   requires repeated, expensive computations. This paper develops
   algorithms for a discretized computational model to make CWE
   computations for arbitrary shaped parts. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.3527074]}},

Abstract = {{A KrF laser was used to ablate a polycrystalline Si target for
   deposition of Si on MgO and GaAs substrates at room temperature. The
   deposition was performed in 10(-8) mbar, with two types of laser beams:
   a homogeneous beam being imaged onto the target (2.9 J/cm(2)), and a
   non-homogeneous which is nearly focused (2 J/cm(2), 6.5 J/cm(2)). In
   both cases, the beam was scanned over an area of 1 cm(2). For the
   homogenous beam, we observed only a limited number of droplets (<0.1 mu
   m). A high number of micron-sized (<5 mu m) droplets were observed on
   the film by the higher fluence nonhomogeneous laser beam. Raman
   spectroscopy showed that the micron-sized droplets are crystalline while
   the film is amorphous. The generation of the large droplets is most
   likely related to the cone structures formed on the ablated target. We
   also compared cone formation on a polycrystalline Si target and a single
   crystalline Si wafer, using multiple laser pulses onto a single spot.}},

   were graded for affective salience by means of aversive fear
   conditioning, with a conditioned angry face (CS+), an unconditioned
   angry face (CS), and a neutral control face. The letter-classification
   task was presented under conditions of both low and high perceptual
   load. Results showed that fear conditioned (i.e., CS+) angry face
   distractors interfered with task performance more than CS angry or

   eliminated by high perceptual load. These findings demonstrate that
   aversively conditioned face distractors capture attention only under

Abstract = {{Although selenium (Se) is not an essential element in plants, Se
   metabolism in plants is remarkable, mainly for the purpose of
   phytoremediation and nutritional supplementation of Se. Brassica juncea
   (Indian mustard) is known as an Se accumulator. In addition to Indian
   mustard, unique Brassicaceae plants are consumed in Japan. Brassica rapa
   var. hakabura, commonly known as nozawana, and Brassica rapa var.
   peruviridis, commonly known as komatsuna, are typical Brassicaceae
   plants. In this study, we evaluated the Se-accumulating ability of these
   unique Brassicaceae plants. There were no significant differences in the
   Se concentrations in the roots and the leaves of the three Brassicaceae
   plants. However, nozawana most efficiently accumulated Se among the
   three Brassicaceae plants because it showed the most rapid growth,
   resulting in the highest biomass. Speciation revealed that the Se
   species accumulated in the three plants were identical. In addition,
   nozawana contained easily extractable essential minerals, such as iron,
   copper, and zinc. Potentialities of nozawana as a source of minerals and
   the phytoremediation of soil and water contaminated with Se were
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Gynecomastia is defined as a palpable enlargement of the mammary gland
   in males that is distinguishable from lipomastia. The aim of this study
   was to assess the prevalence and characteristics of different causes of
   breast enlargement in young males referred to our tertiary center, and
   evaluation of the factors associated with gynaecomastia.
   One hundred thirty-five male recruits aged 20-30 years were enrolled in
   the study. A control group comprising 32 age-matched healthy individuals
   aged 20-25 years was also studied.
   Idiopathic gynecomastia (IG) was diagnosed in 31 of 135 patients (23\%)
   and Klinefelter' syndrome (KS) was diagnosed in 70 cases (52\%).
   Patients with KS had significantly higher body mass index (BMI) and
   waist and hip circumference waist/hip ratio than the control group. FSH,
   LH and SHBG were significantly higher and DHEAS, free testosterone (fT)
   and total testosterone (tT) were lower in patients with KS than the
   control group. Anthropometric measurements revealed significant increase
   in body weight and BMI in patients with IG compared with healthy
   controls. FSH and LH levels were significantly higher in the patients
   with IG. Patients with pseudogynecomastia alone were not obese and
   hypogonadism was observed in 35.1\% of patients.
   We concluded that gynaecomastia in young adult males is mostly because
   of KS or idiopathic in origin. IG seems to be the result of androgen
   resistance and in part increased aromatization because of increased
   adiposity. Symptoms or findings for hypogonadism must be evaluated
   carefully in patients with pseudogynecomastia. We also suggest that the
   presence of both gynecomastia and azoospermia necessitate further
   karyotypic analyses for KS.}},

Abstract = {{The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic activator genes bzlf1 and brlf1 are
   conventionally referred to as immediate-early (IE) genes. However,
   previous studies showed that the earliest expression of these genes was
   blocked by cycloheximide when the EBV lytic cycle was induced by histone
   deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and protein kinase C agonists. Anti-IgG
   activates a complex signal transduction pathway that leads to EBV lytic
   activation in the Akata cell line. Here we demonstrate that in Akata
   cells, where lytic cycle activation occurs very rapidly after anti-IgG
   treatment, de novo protein synthesis is also required for induction of
   bzlf1 and brlf1 expression. New protein synthesis is required up to 1.25
   h after application of anti-IgG; bzlf1 and brlf1 mRNAs can be detected
   1.5 h after anti-IgG. Five cellular IE genes were shown to be expressed
   by 1 h after addition of anti-IgG, and their expression preceded that of
   bzlf1 and brlf1. These include early growth response genes (egr1, egr2,
   and egr3) and nuclear orphan receptors (nr4a1 and nr4a3). These genes
   were activated by anti-IgG treatment of Akata cells with and without the
   EBV genome; therefore, their expression was not dependent on expression
   of any EBV gene product. EGR1, EGR2, and EGR3 proteins were kinetically
   upstream of ZEBRA and Rta proteins. Expression of EGR1, ZEBRA, and Rta
   proteins were inhibited by bisindolylmaleimide X, a selective inhibitor
   of PKC. The findings suggest a revised model in which the signal
   transduction cascade activated by cross-linking of the B cell receptor
   induces expression of cellular IE genes, such as early growth response
   and nuclear orphan receptor genes, whose products, in turn, regulate
   bzlf1 and brlf1 expression.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of submerged hollow fibre membrane systems without the aid
   of coagulant was investigated as a pre-treatment for seawater reverse
   osmosis in this paper. The operation parameters such as filtration
   duration, backwash duration, backwash strength and the aid of air
   scouring during backwash were investigated in order to optimize the
   filtration performance and fouling control. The underlying fouling
   limitation mechanisms which result in those optimized operation
   parameters were also explored. It was found that periodical backwash
   with the permeate can provide effective removal of fouling layer and
   reduce the fouling rate during the filtration cycle. Results also
   indicated the strong inter-correlation among backwash strength and
   filtration duration and their effect on fouling rate. Excessive backwash
   strength was found unable to minimize fouling, and in fact, resulted in
   higher fouling rate during filtration. The percentage of removable
   fouling by backwash was also significantly affected by the
   inter-correlation between the backwash strength and backwash duration.
   By analyzing the composition of the feed, permeate and the solution
   after backwash, it was found that UF membrane (pore size 0.04 mu m) can
   remove more than 60\% of biopolymers. The biopolymers rejected by the UF
   membrane formed the cake on the membrane surface, and this fouling cake
   can be easily removed by periodical backwash. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION
   Malaysian architect Dr. Ken Yeang is an architect-planner and is
   frequently described as one of the foremost designers, theoreticians,
   theoreticians, and thinkers in the field of green design. He has been
   described as one of the world's leading advocates in ecological and
   passive low-energy design. He has designed over one hundred projects,
   and his theory of ``bio-climatic{''} towers has had an impact around the
   world, fusing high-tech with organic principles. He was born in Penang,
   Malaysia, in 1948, and was educated in Penang, the United States, and at
   the Architectural Association in London. He received his doctorate in
   Architecture from Cambridge University in 1974. He is the author of a
   number of books on the topic of ecological planning and high-rise design
   (e.g., The Skyscraper: Bio-climatically Considered, 1996;
   Eco-Masterplanning, 2009). According to Yeang, the ``bioclimatic{''}
   high-rise tower is a low-energy tower that is based on bioclimatic
   design principles and designed as a vertical urban design typology
   crossed by air and light wells and protected by sun shading devices.
   Bio-climatic in architecture means responding to the climate with
   minimal reliance on fossil-fuel energy for achieving comfort.
   Ken Yeang's definition of bio-climatic is based on the following
   concepts: The integration of the grey (engineering), blue (water), red
   (human), and green (landscape) infrastructures in projects of all
   scales; the bio-integration of the building as an artificial element
   into the biosphere; the eco-mimesis, repeating nature's patterns such as
   solar energy and waste equals food; the re-linking of ecosystems by
   bridging the existing natural areas; and, finally, the monitoring for
   rectifying and improving the existing built environment. His
   single-minded pursuit of eco-design through his own architectural
   practice and writing for over 35 years has influenced countless
   architects around the world.
   Major works by Ken Yeang include:
   The IBM Malaysia Tower in Kuala Lumpur (1989-1992)
   The National Library Building in Singapore (2000-2005)
   The National Library is the first building in Singapore to obtain the
   Green Mark Platinum award. It incorporates many passive and active
   design strategies, e.g., a large naturally-ventilated and lit atrium
   space; the use of external sun-shading louvers; and integrated greenery
   for thermal benefits. The total embodiment of the building (being its
   first costs) was calculated to be 17GJ/m2, an impressive result achieved
   through carbon footprint considerations in the selection of all building
   materials.
   The author met with Ken Yeang at the SASBE Conference in Delft, in June
   2009, to discuss the future of sustainable urbanism and why our cities
   need to change. Here are excerpts from their conversation.}},

Abstract = {{Lead toxicity has been associated with its ability to interact and
   damage DNA. However, its molecular mechanisms of action are not fully
   understood. In vitro studies in our laboratory indicated that lead
   nitrate (PbNO3) induces cytotoxicity and oxidative stress to human liver
   carcinoma (HepG(2)) cells in a dose-dependent manner. In this research,
   we hypothesized that n-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a known antioxidant
   compound, affords protection against lead-induced cell death associated
   with genotoxic damage. To test this hypothesis, HepG(2) cells were
   treated either with a physiologic dose of NAC, NAC plus PbNO3, or PbNO3
   alone, followed by incubation in humidified 5\% CO2 incubator at 37
   degrees C for 48 hr. The cell viability was determined by trypan blue
   exclusion test. The degree of DNA damage was detected by micro gel
   electrophoresis (comet) assay. Our results showed that lead exposure
   induces a substantial cytotoxicity as well as a significant genotoxicity
   to HepG(2) cells. However, co-treatment with a physiologic dose (500 mu
   M) of NAC slightly increases cell viability, and significantly reduced
   (P<.05) the degree of DNA damage. Hence, NAC treatment may be a
   promising therapeutic candidate for chemoprevention against lead
   toxicity, based on its ability to scavenge free radicals. (Ethn Dis.

   enhance safety by improving a miner's ability to see mining hazards and
   reducing glare. This paper investigates if LEDs provide another benefit
   by reducing miner exposure to hazards during maintenance and operation
   of LED lighting. LEDs could provide useful lives up to 50 times longer
   than incandescent lighting commonly used in mining and could enable
   design changes to reduce certain hazards. The mining accident records
   compiled by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) were
   examined to determine the extent and nature of accidents involving the
   maintenance and operation of mine luminaries. A total of 140 relevant
   accident records were found for the years 2002-2006. These incidents
   resulted in 3668 days lost from work with an additional 925 days of
   restricted activity. The injury narratives were studied to determine if
   the implementation of LED-based luminaries could reduce injury severity
   and frequency. The greatest near-term potential impacts appear to be
   related to reducing maintenance and cap lamp redesign. Longer term (5
   years), low-power and lightweight auxiliary LED lighting for surface
   mines could also have potential impact for improving safety. Published

Abstract = {{Fowlicidin-3 and fowlicidin-1 are cathelicidin-type antimicrobial
   peptides found in chicken. They effectively inhibit the proliferation of
   many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. To obtain sufficient
   amounts of these peptides for possible use in therapeutic applications,
   DNA encoding each full-length gene, including all exons and introns, was
   fused to the beta-casein promoter in a pBC1 vector that was then
   introduced into C127 cells. The full-length precursor proteins were
   expressed in response to a mixture of insulin, hydrocortisone, and
   prolactin. Processed fowlicidin-1 and fowlicidin-3, as well as their
   precursors, were found in the cell culture media, which suggested that
   they could be processed and secreted. These transgenic peptides had
   antibacterial activity. Thus, transfected C127 cells may serve as an in
   vitro transgenic cell system that can be used to evaluate if specific
   gene constructs can be efficiently expressed in the mammary glands of

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to explore feasibility of H-1 NMR metabolic
   fingerprinting for discrimination of authenticity of saffron using
   principal component analysis (PCA) modeling. Authentic reference Iranian
   saffron (n = 31) and commercial samples (n = 32) were used.
   Cross-validated PCA models based on H-1 NMR spectra of solutions
   prepared by direct extraction of grinded saffron with methanol-d (4)
   distinguished reference Iranian saffron samples from commercial samples
   that formed several distinct clusters, some of which represent falsified
   samples as confirmed by microscopic analysis. The production sites and
   drying conditions of the authentic reference Iranian samples were not
   reflected in the current dataset. Picrocrocin and glycosyl esters of
   crocetin emerged as the most important H-1 NMR markers of authentic
   saffron by using statistical correlation spectroscopy. In conclusion,
   H-1 NMR spectra of saffron extracts combined with pattern recognition by
   PCA provide immediate means of unsupervised classification of saffron
   samples.}},

Title = {{OPTIMIZATION OF THE EFFECT OF SWEETENER AND DIETARY FIBER ON RHELOGICAL
   AND SENSORY PROPERTIES OF SALEP BEVERAGE}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TEXTURE STUDIES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{804-824}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rheological properties of salep beverage samples were evaluated in
   relation to four processing variables: aspartame concentration, 2-6
   g/100 mL; lemon fiber concentration, 0.5-2.5 g/100 mL; cooking time,
   5-25 min and serving temperature 25-65C. The power law model fitted the
   shear stress-shear rate data. Salep beverage samples exhibited a
   shear-thinning behavior. A second-order composite design was used to
   investigate the effects of the four processing variables on the
   consistency index (k) and sensory score (Ss) of the samples to find the
   optimum levels of these processing variables. The aspartame and lemon
   fiber concentration had the most significant increasing effect on the
   consistency index and Ss, while serving temperature had a decreasing
   effect on these values. Based on Ss, optimum conditions were determined
   as aspartame concentration = 6.0 g/100 mL, lemon fiber concentration =
   2.1 g/100 mL, cooking time = 11.6 min and serving temperature = 26C.
   PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
   The rheological properties of salep beverages with added dietary fiber
   and sweetener have not been well documented. The majority of reported
   experimental data on the rheological properties have focused solely on
   the effects of two processing factors, namely concentration and
   temperature on the rheological properties of salep, but no one has
   considered the simultaneous effects of sweetener, dietary fiber
   concentrations, temperature and cooking time on the rheological and the
   related sensory properties of salep beverage. In addition, no study has
   appeared to study optimum levels of these processing variables
   maximizing or minimizing the rheological and sensory score values.
   Therefore, the results of this study would be useful for engineering
   applications in the processing of salep beverages under related
   processing conditions as well as for process design, quality control and
   sensory properties of salep beverage.}},

   of Na ions on the performance of organic light-emitting diode (OLED)
   were studied by etching away a few tens of nanometers off the ITO
   surface with a dilute aquaregia solution of HNO3:HCl:H2O. A
   single-layer, molecularly doped ITO/(PVK+TPD+Alq(3))/Al OLEDs were
   fabricated on bare and etched ITO samples. Although the removal of a
   10-nm layer of ITO surface increased the voltage range, brightness, and
   lifetime, it was insufficient to correlate these improvements with
   solely to the Na ion reduction without considering the surface
   roughness.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ``mushroom cap{''} sign on
   T2-weighted MR imaging in patients with submucosal tumors in the
   rectosigmoid colon.
   From January 2001 to August 2009, 12 patients with four different
   diseases presenting or mimicking submucosal tumors in the rectosigmoid
   colon underwent colonic resection. All patients with deep endometriosis
   (n = 6), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (n = 4), metastasis from ovary
   cancer (n = 1), and carcinoid tumor (n = 1) had either an MRI of the
   rectum or pelvis before surgery. We evaluated the MRI findings and
   compared them with the macroscopic and microscopic observations in the
   resected specimens.
   In all six cases of deep endometriosis, a characteristic ``mushroom
   cap{''} shaped appearance was found on T2-weighted MR imaging.
   Heterogeneous low signal intensity of the hypertrophic muscularis
   propria, covered with high signal intensity of the mucosa and submucosa
   on T2-weighted MR images, looked like a ``mushroom cap{''} with the
   pattern of intraluminal endophytic growth. In histological findings,
   deep endometriosis involved the submucosa (n = 4) or mucosa (n = 2). The
   ``mushroom cap{''} sign was not present in any of the six other tumors.
   The ``mushroom cap{''} sign on T2-weighted MR imaging may be a
   characteristic sign for diagnosing deep rectosigmoid endometriosis.}},

   ladder, which appears as a continuum intensity below the Mott gap,
   decreases in intensity with temperature. Because the intraband
   excitation is related to the dynamics of doped holes in the ladder, its
   decrease of the intraband excitation is attributed to the reduction of
   the mobile holes in the ladder at low temperature. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Atypical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (atypical BSE) has recently
   been identified in several countries including Japan. Most cases of
   atypical BSE have been reported in cattle older than 8 years of age. To
   clarify the association between age and occurrence of atypical BSE, we
   investigated both the physiological properties and amount of cellular
   prion protein (PrPC) in brain homogenates from young and aged cattle by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting. The amount of PrPC
   in the brain homogenates was not significantly different between young
   and aged cattle, but the amount in the detergent-insoluble fraction in
   the aged cattle was significantly higher than that of young cattle.
   Significant differences were observed in neither of the glycosylation
   forms nor in proteinase K sensitivity in young and aged cattle.
   Age-related changes included deposition of lipofuscin pigment and a
   decrease of 33\% in proteasome activity in the brains of aged cattle
   compared to that of young cattle.}},

Abstract = {{A number of therapeutic strategies targeting epidermal growth factor
   receptor (EGFR) have not always led to success in the present state of
   breast cancer therapy. Notably, there is currently no way to treat

   found that heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor
   (HB-EGF), a member of the EGFR ligands, was predominantly expressed in
   breast cancer and that treatment with crossreacting material 197
   (CRM197), a specific inhibitor of HB-EGF, blocked ERK as well as AKT
   activation via complexes of EGFR and unknown growth factor receptors in
   TNBC or through complexes of EGFR and human epidermal growth factor
   receptor-2 in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer, caused significant
   cell apoptosis and inhibited tumor growth. Accordingly, we can provide a
   novel concept that a certain EGFR ligand is recognized as a rational
   target against breast cancer. In addition, it is plausible that CRM197
   could be an effective anticancer agent for molecularly targeted

Abstract = {{Plastid transformation has to date been applied to the expression of
   heterologous genes involved in agronomic traits and to the production of
   useful recombinant proteins. Here, we report a feasibility study for
   producing the human beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE) via
   transformation of tobacco chloroplasts. Stable integration of human BACE
   into the plastome was confirmed by PCR. Genomic Southern blot analysis
   detected the presence of the tobacco aadA and human BACE genes between
   trnI and trnA in the plastome. Northern blot analysis revealed that the
   aadA and BACE genes were both properly transcribed into a dicistronic
   transcriptional unit. Human BACE protein expression in transplastomic
   tobacco was determined by western blot analysis. ELISA analysis revealed
   that, based on a dilution series of E. coli-derived BACE as a standard,
   transplastomic lines accumulated BACE to levels of 2.0\% of total
   soluble proteins. When mice were gavaged with the transplastomic tobacco
   extracts, they showed an immune response against the BACE antigen. The
   successful production of plastid-based BACE protein has the potential
   for developing a plant-based vaccine against Alzheimer disease.}},

   Methods 30 patients with an unexplained chronic cough lasting more than
   8 weeks were randomly assigned to take 250 mg erythromycin once daily
   (n=15) or placebo (n=15) for 12 weeks in a double-blind parallel group
   study. Cough frequency, cough reflex sensitivity and cough severity were
   assessed at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 weeks. The primary outcome measure
   was change in 24 h cough frequency at 12 weeks.
   Results There was no difference in the change in cough frequency between
   the erythromycin and placebo groups at 12 weeks (mean difference in fold
   change 1.1; 95\% CI 0.7 to 1.5; p=0.585) or at other times. There was a
   statistically significant between-treatment difference in the change in
   sputum neutrophils at 12 weeks (-10.2\% vs +6.6\% with erythromycin and
   placebo; mean difference 16.8\%; 95\% CI 1.6 to 32.1; p=0.03) but not at
   other times. There was no difference in the change in other measures of
   cough between treatments.
   Conclusions Treatment with low-dose erythromycin for 12 weeks reduces
   the induced sputum neutrophil count but not cough frequency or severity
   in patients with unexplained chronic cough.}},

Abstract = {{Histological characterization of spinal fusions in Atlantic salmon
   (Salmo salar) has demonstrated shape alterations of vertebral body
   endplates, a reduced intervertebral space, and replacement of
   intervertebral cells by ectopic bone. However, the significance of the
   notochord during the fusion process has not been addressed. We have
   therefore investigated structural and cellular events in the notochord
   during the development of vertebral fusions. In order to induce
   vertebral fusions, Atlantic salmon were exposed to elevated temperatures
   from fertilization until they attained a size of 15 g. Based on results
   from radiography, intermediate and terminal stages of the fusion process
   were investigated by immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction. Examination of structural extracellular
   matrix proteins such as Perlecan, Aggrecan, Elastin, and Laminin
   revealed reduced activity and reorganization at early stages in the
   pathology. Staining for elastic fibers visualized a thinner elastic
   membrane surrounding the notochord of developing fusions, and
   immunohistochemistry for Perlecan showed that the notochordal sheath was
   stretched during fusion. These findings in the outer notochord
   correlated with the loss of Aggrecan- and Substance-P-positive signals
   and the further loss of vacuoles from the chordocytes in the central
   notochord. At more progressed stages of fusion, chordocytes condensed,
   and the expression of Aggrecan and Substance P reappeared. The
   hyperdense regions seem to be of importance for the formation of
   notochordal tissue into bone. Thus, the remodeling of notochord
   integrity by reduced elasticity, structural alterations, and cellular
   changes is probably involved in the development of vertebral fusions.}},

Abstract = {{We present the growth mechanism of MgO film on Si (100), specifically
   epitaxial growth at the interface strain relaxation at critical
   thickness, and preferred orientation formation after strain relaxation
   We first focused on domain matching epitaxy (DME) between MgO and Si
   with a large lattice mismatch of 224\% MgO/Si (100) with 4/3 and 5/4
   domain matching during growth of MgO on Si (100) are equally mixed to
   reduce domain mismatch Two continuous 4/3 domains have domain mismatch
   of 0 1124 nm, but mixed 4/3 and 5/4 domains have mismatch of only 0 0093
   nm The experimental critical thickness for strain relaxation is similar
   to 100 nm, and this result is supported by theoretical modeling of MgO
   film growth using an overall film energy model We focus the anisotropic
   properties of MgO material to explain the preferred orientation in the
   (111) direction after strain relaxation MgO with strong ionic bonding
   characteristic has a polar surface along particular orientations in
   which anions and cations are arranged alternately, this is the MgO (111)
   orientation This orientation has strong sticking probability and tends
   to be preferred orientation by adsorbing adatom dominantly}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a thermodynamic analysis on the performance of a
   transcritical cycle using azeotropic refrigerant mixtures of R32/R290
   with mass fraction of 70/30 has been performed. The main purpose of this
   study is to theoretically verify the possibility of applying the chosen
   refrigerant mixture in small heat pumps for high temperature water
   heating applications. Performance evaluation has been carried out for a
   simple azeotropic mixture R32/R290 transcritical cycle by varying
   evaporator temperature, outlet temperature of gas cooler and compressor
   discharge pressure. Furthermore, the effects of an internal heat
   exchanger on the transcritical R32/R290 cycle have been presented at
   different operating conditions. The results show that high heating
   coefficient of performance (COP(h)) and volumetric heating capacity can
   be achieved by using this transcritical cycle. It is desirable to apply
   the chosen refrigerant mixture R32/R290 in small heat pump water heater
   for high temperature water heating applications, which may produce hot
   water with temperature up to 90 degrees C. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We investigate the effect of N/B doping on the electronic properties for
   a zero-dimensional zigzag-edged triangular graphene, wherein two sets of
   sublattices are unbalanced, using density functional theory (DFT). We
   find that the substitutional N/B atom energetically prefers to
   distribute in the major sublattice. After the N/B doping, the net spin
   for triangular graphene is reduced and full or partial depolarization
   occurs depending on doping sites. Our OFT calculations show that the
   triangular graphene with N/B doped in the major sublattice has a larger
   energy gap, and the electronic properties depend on the doping position.
   There is an impurity state below or above the Fermi level for the
   N/B-doped triangular graphene, depending on the sublattice at which the
   dopant locates. The dependence of the electronic properties on doping
   position is attributed to the competition between the Coulomb attraction
   of N+ (B-) and the correlation with nonbonding states for the extra
   charge introduced by the N/B atom.}},

Abstract = {{A method for the simultaneous determination of 11 triazine herbicides
   residues in river water has been developed. It involves solid-phase
   extraction (SPE) pretreatment step and rapid resolution liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (RRLC-MS-MS). In the SPE
   pretreatment step, the adsorptive performance of MWCNTs material as SPE
   adsorbent and the elution capability of five kinds of solvents were
   investigated; in the LC separation step, a rapid resolution high
   throughput LC column, was used and the gradient elution mode adopted.
   The linear correlation coefficients (r (2)) of the method for 11 target
   analytes varied between 0.9930 and 0.9980, the mean recoveries were in
   the range of 73.0 and 98.0\% with relative standard deviations (RSD) 2.6
   similar to 4.2\%, the method detection limits (MDL) were all below 0.1
   ng L-1. An expanded uncertainty of not more than 20\% was estimated for
   each analyte at the spiked concentration of 4.0 mu g L-1. The proposed
   method was applied to the determination of the residue concentrations of
   11 pollutants in Songhuajiang River water.}},

Abstract = {{Axisymmetric bogus vortexes at sea level are usually used in the
   traditional bogus data assimilation (BDA) scheme. In the traditional
   scheme, the vortex could not accurately describe the specific
   characteristics of a typhoon, and the evolving real typhoon is forced to
   unreasonably adapt to this changeless vortex. For this reason, an
   asymmetrical typhoon bogus method with information blended from the
   analysis and the observation is put forward in this paper, in which the
   impact of the Subtropical High is also taken into consideration. With
   the fifth-generation Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) and its
   adjoint model, a four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var)
   technique is employed to build a dynamic asymmetrical BDA scheme to
   assimilate different asymmetrical bogus vortexes at different time. The
   track and intensity of six summer typhoons much influenced by the
   Subtropical High are simulated and the results are compared. It is shown
   that the improvement in track simulation in the new scheme is more
   significant than that in the traditional scheme. Moreover, the periods
   for which the track cannot be simulated well by the traditional scheme
   can be improved with the new scheme. The results also reveal that
   although the simulated typhoon intensity in the new scheme is generally
   weaker than that in the traditional scheme, this trend enables the new
   scheme to simulate, in the later period, closer-to-observation intensity
   than the traditional scheme. However, despite the fact that the observed
   intensity has been largely weakened, the simulated intensity at later
   periods of the BDA schemes is still very intensive, resulting in overly
   development of the typhoon during the simulation. The limitation to the
   simulation effect of the BDA scheme due to this condition needs to be
   further studied.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic properties and microstructures of L1(1) (Co50-xCux)Pt-50 films
   sputter-deposited at 350 degrees C on MgO(111) substrates are reported.
   The addition of Cu significantly improves the alignment of c-axis and
   chemical ordering. Perpendicular coercivity (H-c perpendicular to) also
   increases markedly from 0.1 to 1.9 kOe while in-plane coercivity
   declines from 0.5 to 0.07 kOe for the 20 nm thick films at x = 26.
   Similar phenomena are observed with larger effects for the 50 nm thick
   films. The coercive mechanism is attributed to domain-wall pinning
   produced by the compositional segregation of nanoscaled nonmagnetic
   Cu-rich and magnetic Co-rich regions within a coherent L1(1) crystal
   domain. Therefore, an intermediate value of H-c perpendicular to can be
   obtained from this hardening mechanism when further microstructure
   modifications are enforced, which largely increases the potential for
   the use in spintronic devices or patterned media. (C) 2010 American

Abstract = {{Injury of the nervous system, particularly in the spinal cord, impairs
   the quality of life of the patient by resulting in permanent loss of
   neurologic function. The main limitation in spinal cord regeneration is
   the lack of extracellular matrix to guide nerves for functional recovery
   of the transected nerve tissue. In the present study, a tissue
   engineered nerve tube was prepared by wrapping neural stem cells (NSCs)
   on aligned fibers using a micropatterned film with astrocytes aligned
   along the microgrooves to support the NSCs. Initially the cell behavior
   on micropatterns and parallel fibers was investigated with cytoskeletal
   and nuclear staining, immunocytochemistry, and proliferation assay using
   the fiber and the film system separately. The results showed that both
   cells, NSCs in undifferentiated and astrocytes in differentiated form,
   were oriented in the direction of the guiding and support elements, the
   microgrooves, and the microfibers. They were able to grow and increase
   in number on these cell carriers. This trend was also maintained after
   the components were brought together in a nerve tube form and testing in
   coculture. The cells were able to survive and maintained their
   orientation in the 3D tissue engineered construct. The guided nerve
   tissue engineering approach tested in the present study with parallel
   NSCs and support cells in the tubular construct is expected to provide
   an appropriate environment for nerve regeneration in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Observations showed that the main engine water exhaust plumes from space
   shuttles released at similar to 110 km altitude from Florida could be
   transported over thousands of kilometers northward or southward,
   reaching the Arctic after a day or so, and in one case Antarctica after
   three days (Stevens et al., 2003,2005). In this work, we study the
   meridional transport associated with the quasi-two-day wave (QTDW) and
   migrating tides. Diagnostic calculations are performed to trace the
   particle trajectories using winds from the
   Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation
   Model (TIME-GCM) simulations for January, when the amplitude of the QTDW
   usually peaks. The calculations demonstrate that the mean meridional
   circulation, a QTDW or a migrating tide cannot individually sustain
   planetary-scale meridional transport for one to three days, but the
   combined effects of a QTDW and a tide can. In particular, when the QTDW
   and the tides are scaled according to the observed amplitudes, particles
   released at similar to 110 km and appropriate longitudes/local times can
   under go transport fast enough to reach Antarctica within three days as
   observed. The magnitude and direction of the transport depend on the
   amplitudes and phases of the tides and the QTDW. These simulations thus
   suggest that the observed rapid planetary-scale meridional transport of
   the shuttle main engine plume can be driven by planetary waves and
   tides. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The lattice gas automation (LGA) simulations for electrical transport
   properties have been performed on digital rock samples virtually
   saturated with oil and water to investigate the relationship between
   resistivity index and water (oil) saturation (I-Sw) of reservoir rocks
   at micropore scale. The digital rocks were constructed by the pileup of
   matrix grains with a radius distribution obtained by laboratory
   measurements on reservoir rock samples. The LGA was then applied to
   simulate the flow of electrical current through the pores of these
   virtually saturated digital rocks to reveal the non-Archie relation of
   I-Sw. The results from LGA simulation indicate that the I-Sw relation is
   generally a non-linear function changing with the decrease of water
   saturation and porosity on a log-log scale. Archie's equation is an
   approximation in high water saturation range. Based on this study, we
   developed a new equation for non-Archie relation of I-Sw to improve the
   calculation of pore fluid saturation. The calculated results with this
   new equation have shown better fit to laboratory measurements.}},

Title = {{Competing schemes in Spanish word formation}},
Journal = {{ONOMAZEIN}},
Year = {{2010}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{59-82}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In lexical morphology, it is very common to find word-formation patterns
   that rival each other because they belong to the same conceptual field.
   This trait is more evident in the suffixation, the more productive
   word-formation process in Spanish. Derivation provides a large
   repertoire of competing schemes due to the overlap in meaning and
   function within the system. For instance, competition occurs between
   forming-verb suffixes -cion and -miento: agrupacion and agrupamiento;
   financiacion and financiamiento; aburricion and aburrimiento; detencion
   and detenimiento, etc. Rivalry becomes more complex if we realize that
   there are other competing suffixes in the system: -dura (torcedura,
   torcimiento); -aje (almacenamiento, almacenaje). It is commonly stated
   that competition is resolved in favour of the more productive pattern.
   However; as productivity is relative and depends on many factors, the
   same pattern does not always prevail. This research aims to describe the
   phenomenon, note the source of some of these rivalries and propose
   relevant parameters and factors to define and characterize this process.
   We argue that most of these rivalries depends on structural factors and
   language use factors that interact in different ways and to various
   degrees.}},

   influence of free-stream turbulence}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{665}},
Pages = {{57-98}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The flow through a compressor passage without and with incoming
   free-stream grid turbulence is simulated. At moderate Reynolds number,
   laminar-to-turbulence transition can take place on both sides of the
   aerofoil, but proceeds in distinctly different manners. The direct
   numerical simulations (DNS) of this flow reveal the mechanics of
   breakdown to turbulence on both surfaces of the blade. The pressure
   surface boundary layer undergoes laminar separation in the absence of
   free-stream disturbances. When exposed to free-stream forcing, the
   boundary layer remains attached due to transition to turbulence upstream
   of the laminar separation point. Three types of breakdowns are observed;
   they combine characteristics of natural and bypass transition. In
   particular, instability waves, which trace back to discrete modes of the
   base flow, can be observed, but their development is not independent of
   the Klebanoff distortions that are caused by free-stream turbulent
   forcing. At a higher turbulence intensity, the transition mechanism
   shifts to a purely bypass scenario. Unlike the pressure side, the
   suction surface boundary layer separates independent of the free-stream
   condition, be it laminar or a moderate free-stream turbulence of
   intensity T-u similar to 3\%. Upstream of the separation, the
   amplification of the Klebanoff distortions is suppressed in the
   favourable pressure gradient (FPG) region. This suppression is in
   agreement with simulations of constant pressure gradient boundary
   layers. FPG is normally stabilizing with respect to bypass transition to
   turbulence, but is, thereby, unfavourable with respect to separation.
   Downstream of the FPG section, a strong adverse pressure gradient (APG)
   on the suction surface of the blade causes the laminar boundary layer to
   separate. The separation surface is modulated in the instantaneous
   fields of the Klebanoff distortion inside the shear layer, which
   consists of forward and backward jet-like perturbations. Separation is
   followed by breakdown to turbulence and reattachment. As the free-stream
   turbulence intensity is increased, T-u similar to 6.5 \%, transitional
   turbulent patches are initiated, and interact with the downstream
   separated flow, causing local attachment. The calming effect, or delayed
   re-establishment of the boundary layer separation, is observed in the
   wake of the turbulent events.}},

Abstract = {{Increased access to sterile syringes among injection drug users (IDUs)
   has been correlated with reduced syringe sharing Many states, including
   Rhode Island, have legalized non prescription (NP) sale of syringes in
   pharmacies Previous studies have suggested that training pharmacists to
   provide HIV-related services to IDUs may be an important opportunity to
   engage IDUs and provide them with such services However, it is not clear
   to what extent pharmacy staff are willing to expand their roles in
   providing services to IDUs who come in to purchase syringes We recruited
   pharmacists and pharmacy staff from the 48 pharmacies indicating NP sale
   of syringes in the greater Providence, RI area, to participate in an
   online survey consisting of demographic information, views about the
   current syringe laws in Rhode Island, willingness to provide HIV related
   services, including referral for HIV testing, substance use treatment,
   and medical and social services, to IDUs, and past experiences with IDU
   customers One hundred and forty-six individuals completed the online
   survey (32 pharmacies, 114 pharmacy staff) Most participants were
   employed by chain pharmacies (92\%) Most participants thought that
   pharmacies are important resources for IDU customers (77\%) and that
   they would be willing to provide health and prevention
   information/referrals to IDU customers who purchase NP syringes (59\%)
   With respect to willingness to offer HIV prevention-related services,
   access to confidential space and concern about personal safety had the
   strongest associations with willingness to provide HIV prevention
   services (OR, 4 3 and 0 1, respectively) As the nature of the retail
   pharmacy shifts, researchers, pharmacy executives, and health care
   officials can build upon the willingness of pharmacists and pharmacy
   staff in order to address the health needs of injection drug users and

Abstract = {{This paper provides a study of the bending behavior of a circularly
   curved functionally graded piezoelectric cantilever actuator under an
   applied electric load and heat conduction. As a special case, the curved
   piezoelectric actuator is assumed to have graded property for the
   piezoelectric parameter g(31) only in the thickness direction, which is
   expanded by Taylor series. Based on the theory of linear
   piezoelectricity, the analytical formulations are developed by
   introducing the Airy stress function. Numerical simulations are made to
   show the effects of material gradient and heat conduction on the bending
   behavior of the actuators. It is found that the electroelastic field of
   the curved actuator is significantly influenced by the thermal load. The
   results will be very helpful for the design and optimization of curved
   functionally graded piezoelectric actuators when these devices

   were divided into four groups: two control groups of each breed, without
   hCG stimulation (n = 20 for each breed), and two experimental groups (n
   = 18 for each breed), with hCG stimulation (Pregnyl (R); N.V. Organon,
   Oss, The Netherlands, 30 IU/kg live weight). Pigs were slaughtered 3
   days after hCG stimulation and enzyme activities were measured in
   hepatic microsomes using two approaches. First, only one substrate
   concentration was used for the analysis of each enzyme activity. We
   found that EROD activity was suppressed by hCG-stimulation in Landrace
   (p = 0.004), but not Duroc pigs (p > 0.05). Generally, EROD activity was
   higher in Duroc pigs compared with Landrace (p = 0.017).
   Methoxyresorufin O-demethylase and PROD activities did not differ
   between groups (p > 0.05). To further characterize EROD, MROD and PROD,
   enzyme kinetic studies were performed. V-max values for EROD and MROD in
   both breeds were lower after hCG stimuation (p < 0.001 for Landrace and
   p < 0.05 for Duroc). Additionally, V-max values for EROD significantly
   differed between Landrace and Duroc pigs being higher in Duroc pigs (p <
   0.05). We concluded that both hCG stimulation and breed differences may
   be important in the regulation of EROD and MROD activities. This study
   provides the first data on the effect of hCG stimulation and thus high
   testicular steroids, on EROD, MROD and PROD activities. Further studies
   are needed to investigate individual CYP450 enzymes and their regulation
   in porcine tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Global change is causing an average temperature increment which affects
   several aspects of organisms' biology, especially in ectotherms.
   Nevertheless, there is still scant knowledge about how this change is
   affecting reptiles. This paper shows that, the higher average
   temperature in a year, the more individuals of the snake Hemorrhois
   hippocrepis are found in the field, because temperature increases the
   snakes' activity. Furthermore, the quantity of snakes found was also
   correlated with the temperature of the previous years. Our results
   suggest that environmental temperature increases the population size of
   this species, which could benefit from the temperature increment caused
   by climatic change. However, we did not find an increase in population
   size with the advance of years, suggesting that other factors have
   negatively impacted on this species, balancing the effect of increasing
   temperature.}},

Abstract = {{User preferences discovery aims to learn the patterns of user
   preferences for various services or items such as movies. Preferences
   discovery is essential to the development of intelligent personalization
   applications. Based on decision and utility theories, traditional
   approaches to preferences discovery explicitly query users about the
   behavior of value function, or utility of every outcome with respect to
   each decision criterion. Consequently, these approaches are generally
   error-prone and labor intensive. Although implicit elicitation
   approaches have been proposed to address the above limitations, extent
   approaches largely ignore multi-valued nature of item features and
   uncertainty associated with item features and user preferences. To
   address uncertainty due to vagueness and imprecision, this research
   proposed a general framework for preferences discovery based on fuzzy
   set theories. In addition, new fuzzy models were created for preferences
   discovery and representation. Further, an algorithm was developed to
   predict user preferences with uncertainty, and visualization of item
   features, user feedback, and the discovered preferences helped improve
   the interpretation of the discovered knowledge. The results of the
   simulation evaluation using a benchmark movie dataset revealed that the
   proposed preference discovery method: (I) doubled the accuracy of
   preference discovery as compared to random prediction; and (2)
   outperformed conventional techniques in making movie recommendation.
   These findings suggest that fuzzy models are effective for preferences
   patterns discovery, and personalized recommendation application.

   used to initiate the ROP of epsilon-caprolactone for constructing

Abstract = {{Two series of partial confinement of hydrophilic and hydrophobic
   proteins, and corn starch were fabricated. The model system included
   corn starch and proteins i.e., zein, gliadin, gluten, soy protein, and
   rapeseed protein. The effects of different kinds of proteins and
   dehydration treatment on inner structure were characterized by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM). Intermolecular interactions between proteins
   and corn starch were examined by Attenuated total reflection Fourier
   transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. Based on the solubility
   measurement results, almost all protein pills showed the similar
   solubility to the natural protein powders, resulting from the weak
   influence of different dehydration treatment on protein inner structure.
   The porous and compact morphology in the nonconfined and confined areas,
   respectively, were observed for both hydrophobic proteins and
   corresponding blend pills, which is highly dependent on the hydration
   rates. On the contrary, the hydrophilic proteins and corresponding blend
   pills had uniform and densely packed architecture both in nonconfined
   and confined areas. The FTIR results further confirmed that
   intermolecular interaction between corn starch and hydrophilic protein
   occurred both in confined and nonconfined areas, implying that corn
   starch granules dispersed into protein network to form the homogeneous
   morphology. No clear change of the characteristic peaks for hydrophobic
   protein blends when starch is added, attributing to no intermolecular
   interaction formed resulting in the micro-phase separation.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Purpose: This study quantified the lung volume development of
   pectus excavatum (PE) patients using chest computed tomography (CT)
   3-dimensional volumetric reconstructions. The technique permits current
   and retrospective analyses of data from different institutions. Patients
   and Methods: We analyzed the records of PE patients who underwent chest
   CT preoperatively between 2005 and 2009 at 3 institutions. All patients
   were Chinese. Awindow of -992 to -198 Hounsfield units was chosen for
   calculating the CT total lung volume (TLV). The data were compared with
   the data for 73 microtia and other chest-wall tumor patients studied
   during the same period as a control group. Results: In total, 377 PE
   patients with Haller pectus index (PI) of at least 3.2 were identified
   for this study. Compared with the reported TLV data for 1050 healthy
   children and our control group, we found little evidence of a decreased
   TLV in PE patients at any age for either sex. The mean PI did not change
   significantly between the ages of 3 and 27 years. The PI was inversely
   correlated with the TLV (P <.001). Conclusion: Our cross-sectional study
   provides evidence that the TLV of PE patients is within the reference
   range in children and adolescents. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: Infiltration by macrophages is a hallmark of obesity-related
   adipose tissue (AT) inflammation that is tightly linked to insulin
   resistance. Although CD11c(+) AT macrophages (ATMs) have recently been
   shown to promote inflammation in obese mice, the knowledge on phenotype
   and function of different ATM populations is still very limited. This
   study aimed at identifying and characterizing ATM populations in
   obesity.
   Methods: Isolation of ATM populations defined by CD11c and mannose
   receptor (MR) expression and analysis of gene expression in high-fat
   diet-induced obese mice.
   Results: Obesity provoked a shift from a predominant MR(+)CD11c(-)
   population ('MR-ATM') to two MR- populations, namely MR(-)CD11c(+)
   ('CD11c-ATM') and MR(-)CD11c(-) (double negative, `DN-ATM'). Although
   CD11c-ATMs were of a clear inflammatory M1 phenotype, DN-ATMs expressed
   few inflammatory mediators and highly expressed genes for alternative
   activation (M2) markers involved in tissue repair, such as arginase and
   YM1. In contrast, MR-ATMs marginally expressed M1 and M2 markers but
   highly expressed chemokines, including Mcp-1 (Ccl2) and Mcp-3 (Ccl7).
   Both CD11c-ATMs and DN-ATMs, but not MR-ATM, highly expressed a panel of
   chemokine receptors (namely Ccr2, Ccr5, Ccr3 and Cx3cr1), whereas the
   expression of Ccr7 and Ccr9 was selective for CD11c-ATMs and DN-ATMs,
   respectively. Notably, stressed adipocytes upregulated various
   chemokines capable of attracting CD11c-ATM and DN-ATM.
   Conclusion: This study identifies a novel ATM population with a
   putatively beneficial role in AT inflammation. This DN-ATM population
   could be attracted to the obese AT by similar chemokines such as
   inflammatory CD11c-ATM, on which only Ccr7 is uniquely expressed.

Abstract = {{The reverse engineering problem of identifying the topology of dynamical
   networks with time varying intersystem coupling delays from noisy
   observation data is treated in this paper. A three-stage approach is
   adopted to solve this identification problem: first, feedback control is

   the information obtained from the observed steady state responses is
   explored and the identification problem is converted into a mixed
   integer optimization problem; finally, an inference algorithm is applied
   to obtain all elements of the connectivity matrix. Several dynamical
   network examples are provided for illustration. Identification results
   show that the proposed method is robust to noise and computationally

   I-on/I-off ratio recovers with room temperature annealing. Both
   band-to-band tunneling and trap-assisted tunneling contribute to the
   observed leakage. Device leakage before and after irradiation is found
   to be sensitive to halo implant dose and the number of Si monolayers at
   the Ge/insulator interface. Interface trap densities and body leakage
   also increase with dose and decrease with annealing.}},

Abstract = {{Unitary space-time modulation (USTM) fits for rapid Rayleigh flat fading
   channels as it can realize wireless communication when neither the
   transmitter nor the receiver knows the channel state information (CSI).
   However, an intrinsic problem is that only when the signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) is high can it give an ideal bit error rate (BER)
   performance. The existing bit-wise processing scheme of the combination
   of turbo code and USTM improves the BER performance and results in an
   unacceptable calculation complexity, storage and time delay problem. In
   this paper, we propose a multiary processing scheme and its
   corresponding multiary MAP decoding algorithm. Simulation results verify
   that our scheme can reduce the system complexity while keep a good BER
   performance. Furthermore, we present the first analysis of the reason
   for the BER performance deterioration of the combination scheme at low
   SNR with the help of the definition of USTM.}},

Abstract = {{The lined seahorse, Hippocampus erectus (Perry), is an important species
   in both medicinal and aquarium trades. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the effects of stocking density (1, 3 and 5 individuals L-1) on
   the growth performance and survival of the early-stage juvenile H.
   erectus. The height (HT), wet weight, weight gain (WG) and specific
   growth rate (SGR) were affected significantly by the stocking density
   during the 40-day study. The HT, WG and SGR of the seahorse at 1 and 3
   juveniles L-1 were significantly higher than that at 5 juveniles L-1.
   The survival of juveniles at the three stocking densities was not
   significantly different at day 25 (90.3 +/- 4.5\%, 86.7 +/- 4.2\% and
   86.2 +/- 3.8\% for 1, 3 and 5 juveniles L-1 respectively), but was
   significantly different at day 40 (87.8 +/- 3.9\%, 69.6 +/- 4.2\% and
   52.9 +/- 2.8\% for 1, 3 and 5 juveniles L-1 respectively). For the
   early-stage juvenile H. erectus, we recommend a stocking density of 3
   juveniles L-1, but the density should be reduced to 1-2 juveniles L-1 to
   avoid reduced and variable growth and high mortality after 25 days.}},

Abstract = {{A series of phosphorus modified Si-MCM-41 catalysts prepared via the
   impregnation method were used for the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement
   of cyclohexanone oxime to caprolactam. The catalysts were characterized
   by XRD, N(2) adsorption, FT-IR, and NH(3)-TPD. The results indicated
   that weak acid sites increased with P content, leading to enhanced
   catalytic activity. The catalyst with Si/P mol ratio of 25 showed best
   performance at 633 K. The conversion of cyclohexanone oxime and the
   selectivity for caprolactam were 92.7 and 64.2\%, respectively. The P-OH
   groups are main active sites for the Beckmann rearrangement. Grafting
   acid hydroxyl groups to cover the Si-OH groups may be a good way to
   improve the selectivity for this reaction.}},

Abstract = {{Coesite-bearing eclogites from > 100 km2 in the southern Dulan area,
   North Qaidam Mountains (NQM) of western China, contain zircon that
   records protolith crystallization and ultra high pressure (UHP)
   metamorphism. Sensitive High-Resolution Ion Microprobe (Mass
   Spectrometer) and Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass
   Spectrometry U-Pb analyses from cathodoluminescence (CL)-dark zircon
   cores in a coesite-bearing eclogite yield an upper intercept age of 838
   +/- 50 Ma, and oscillatory zoned cores in a kyanite-bearing eclogite
   gave a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 832 +/- 20 Ma. These zircon cores
   yield steep heavy rare earth element (HREE) slopes and negative Eu
   anomalies that suggest a magmatic origin. Thus, c. 835 Ma is interpreted
   as the eclogite protolith age. Unzoned CL-grey or -bright zircon and
   zircon rims from four samples yield weighted mean ages of 430 +/- 4, 438
   +/- 2, 446 +/- 10 and 446 +/- 3 Ma, flat HREE patterns without Eu
   anomalies, and contain inclusions of garnet, omphacite, rutile, phengite
   and rare coesite. These ages are interpreted to record 16 +/- 5 Myr of
   UHP metamorphism. These new UHP ages overlap the age range of both
   eclogite and paragneiss from the northern Dulan area, suggesting that
   all UHP rock types in the Dulan area belong to the same tectonic unit.
   Our results are consistent with slow continental subduction, but do not
   match oceanic subduction and diapiric exhumation UHP model predictions.
   These new data suggest that, similar to eclogites in other HP/UHP units
   of the NQM and South Altyn Tagh, protoliths of the eclogites in the
   Dulan area formed in a continental setting during the Neoproterozoic,
   and then subducted to mantle depth together with continental materials
   during the Early Palaeozoic.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrological simulation is a key component in argo-hydrological models
   for optimizing resources use and minimizing the environmental
   consequences in agriculture In this study we extended a simple and
   explicit algorithm for solving the basic soil water flow equation by
   Yang et al (2009) to the solute transport equation The key feature of
   the algorithm is to use a uniform soil layer thickness and a small time
   step in solving the soil water and solute transport equations so that
   the calculations can be made on a layer basis This drastically
   simplifies the procedure of modeling water and solute transport in soil
   using the basic equations The proposed algorithm was tested against the
   complex finite element (FE) numerical scheme in simulating soil water
   and solute transport in different soils via numerical experiments The
   results showed that the proposed algorithm with a uniform soil layer
   thickness of 5 cm and a small time step of 0 001 d was able to achieve
   the identical accuracy as the FE method Tests of the proposed algorithm
   in simulating water and nitrogen dynamics against data from a field
   experiment on wheat revealed that the predicted results with the simple
   algorithm were in good agreement with the time-course measurements of
   soil water and mineral N concentration at the various depths in the
   profile suggesting that the proposed algorithm performed well and can be
   reliably applied in agro-hydrological models The simplicity and accuracy
   of the algorithm will encourage scientists to use basic equations for
   soil water and solute transport more in the future for improving
   performance of agro-hydrological models (c) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights

Title = {{Selective regulation of nuclear orphan receptors 4A by adenosine
   receptor subtypes in human mast cells}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CELL COMMUNICATION AND SIGNALING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{173-183}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Nuclear orphan receptors 4A (NR4A) are early responsive genes that
   belong to the superfamily of hormone receptors and comprise NR4A1, NR4A2
   and NR4A3. They have been associated to transcriptional activation of
   multiple genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis and cell cycle
   control. Here, we establish a link between NR4As and adenosine, a
   paradoxical inflammatory molecule that can contribute to persistence of
   inflammation or mediate inflammatory shutdown. Transcriptomics screening
   of the human mast cell-line HMC-1 revealed a sharp induction of
   transcriptionally active NR4A2 and NR4A3 by the adenosine analogue NECA.
   The concomitant treatment of NECA and the adenosine receptor A(2A)
   (A(2A)AR) selective antagonist SCH-58261 exaggerated this effect,
   suggesting that upregulation of these factors in mast cells is mediated
   by other AR subtypes (A(2B) and A(3)) and that A(2A)AR activation
   counteracts NR4A2 and NR4A3 induction. In agreement with this,
   A(2A)AR-silencing amplified NR4A induction by NECA. Interestingly, a
   similar A(2A)AR modulatory effect was observed on ERK1/2 phosphorylation
   because A(2A)AR blockage exacerbated NECA-mediated phosphorylation of
   ERK1/2. In addition, PKC or MEK1/2 inhibition prevented ERK1/2
   phosphorylation and antagonized AR-mediated induction of NR4A2 and
   NR4A3, suggesting the involvement of these kinases in AR to NR4A
   signaling. Finally, we observed that selective A(2A)AR activation with
   CGS-21680 blocked PMA-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and modulated the
   overexpression of functional nuclear orphan receptors 4A. Taken
   together, these results establish a novel PKC/ERK/nuclear orphan
   receptors 4A axis for adenosinergic signaling in mast cells, which can
   be modulated by A(2A)AR activation, not only in the context of adenosine
   but of other mast cell activating stimuli as well.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the predictive value of plasma cystatin C,
   creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as risk
   factors for cardiovascular disease in Chinese. Plasma cystatin C and
   creatinine were measured in 466 coronary heart disease (CHD) patients
   recruited from 4 hospitals and 349 healthy controls from local
   communities in Wuhan, China. Cockroft-Gault formula was used to estimate
   the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) after adjusting for body surface
   area. With each measure, the study population was divided into
   quintiles. The results showed that the patients had significantly higher
   levels of plasma cystatin C, creatinine, and lower level of eGFR than
   controls. Lower eGFR was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular
   events. As compared with the first (highest) quintile, the hazard ratios
   (and 95\% CIs) after multivariate adjustment for CHD were as follows:
   third quintile, 2.98 (1.54-5.78); fourth quintile, 3.34 (1.58-7.09);
   fifth quintile, 4.37(1.84-10.35). With higher cystatin C quintiles (>=
   1.00 mg/L and >= 1.17 mg/L), the hazard ratios for CHD were 2.16
   (1.23-3.81) and 2.34 (1.25-4.38), similar to those of creatinine 2.21
   (1.21-4.03) and 2.03 (1.07-3.84). However, it was plasma cystatin C not
   eGFR or creatinine had stronger association with ischemic stroke. The
   highest quintile had the hazard ratio of 4.51 (1.45-14.08) after
   multivariate adjustment. It was concluded that plasma cystatin C,
   associated with renal function, is not an independent risk factor for
   cardiovascular disease. eGFR is a better risk predictor for CHD than
   plasma cystatin C and creatinine. But for ischemic stroke, plasma
   cystatin C is a better risk factor than creatinine and estimated GFR.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the genetic basis of nitrogen and carbon metabolism will
   accelerate the development of plant varieties with high yield and
   improved nitrogen use efficiency. A robotized platform was used to
   measure the activities of 10 enzymes from carbon and nitrogen metabolism
   in the maize (Zea mays) intermated B73 x Mo17 mapping population, which
   provides almost a 4-fold increase in genetic map distance compared with
   conventional mapping populations. Seedling/juvenile biomass was included
   to identify its genetic factors and relationships with enzyme
   activities. All 10 enzymes showed heritable variation in activity. There
   were strong positive correlations between activities of different
   enzymes, indicating that they are coregulated. Negative correlations
   were detected between biomass and the activity of six enzymes. In total,
   73 significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) were found that influence
   the activity of these 10 enzymes and eight QTL that influence biomass.
   While some QTL were shared by different enzymes or biomass, we
   critically evaluated the probability that this may be fortuitous. All
   enzyme activity QTL were in trans to the known genomic locations of
   structural genes, except for single cis-QTL for nitrate reductase, Glu
   dehydrogenase, and shikimate dehydrogenase; the low frequency and low
   additive magnitude compared with trans-QTL indicate that cis-regulation
   is relatively unimportant versus trans-regulation. Two-gene epistatic
   interactions were identified for eight enzymes and for biomass, with
   three epistatic QTL being shared by two other traits; however, epistasis
   explained on average only 2.8\% of the genetic variance. Overall, this
   study identifies more QTL at a higher resolution than previous studies
   of genetic variation in metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Walnut (Juglans regia), an economically important woody plant, is widely
   cultivated in temperate regions for its timber and nutritional fruits.
   Despite abundant studies in germplasm, systemic molecular evaluations of
   walnut are sparsely reported mainly due to the limited molecular markers
   available. Expressed sequence tags (EST) provide a valuable resource for
   developing simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. In this study, a total
   of 5,025 walnut ESTs (covering 16.41 Mb) were retrieved from the
   National Center for Biotechnology Information database. The SSR motifs
   were then analyzed by the SSRHunter software. In total, 398 SSRs were
   obtained with an average frequency of 1/4.08 kb. Dinucleotide (di-)
   repeat motifs accounted for 69.85\% of all SSRs, followed by
   trinucleotide (tri-) with a frequency of 27.64\%, while low frequency
   (2.51\%) of tetranucleotide (tetra-) to hexanucleotide (hexa-) was
   observed. Meanwhile, GCA and TC motifs were prevalent among di- and tri-
   loci, respectively. Subsequently, a total of 123 primer pairs were
   designed from the non-redundant SSR-containing unigenes with the
   selection threshold of SSR length set to 10 bp or more. To examine the
   efficiency of candidate markers, seven DNA pools were collected from
   geographically different accessions. Results demonstrated that 41 SSR
   primer sets could generate high polymorphic amplification products
   (33.3\%), and these polymorphic loci were mainly located in the
   3'-untranslated region. Annotation analysis revealed that only two of
   these 41 loci were located inside open reading frames of characterized
   proteins (E a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand
   1E-30).}},

Abstract = {{Electromigration (EM) behavior of eutectic Sn-Bi modified with cage-type
   polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) trisilanol was investigated.
   A direct current (DC) was applied to solder joints newly designed for
   uniform current distribution throughout the joint. For this study, a
   current density of 10(4) A/cm(2) was applied at 25A degrees C and 50A
   degrees C. The evolution of surface and interior microstructure due to
   current stressing was observed periodically using optical and scanning
   electron microscopy. The results revealed that the EM behavior was
   retarded significantly in solder joints with the addition of POSS
   trisilanol. Different from eutectic Sn-Bi solder joints, no continuous
   hillocks formed at the anode side and no cracks occurred at the cathode
   side in solder joints modified with POSS trisilanol even after 336 h of
   current stressing at 25A degrees C. In addition, the accumulation of
   Bi/Sn phases at regions near the anode/cathode was also effectively
   limited. Joints stressed at 50A degrees C also exhibited similar
   behavior. It is postulated that POSS trisilanol near the phase boundary
   provided significant restriction to the mass transport due to DC current
   stressing.}},

Abstract = {{In aquatic environments, iodine minty exists as iodide, iodate, and
   organic iodine. The high mobility of iodine in aquatic systems has led
   to I-129 contamination problems at sites where nuclear fuel has been
   reprocessed, such as the F-area of Savannah River Site. In order to
   assess the distribution of I-129 and stable I-127 in environmenta
   systems, a sensitive and rapid method was developed which enables
   determination of isotopic ratios of speciated iodine. Iodide
   concentrations were quantified using gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS) after derivatization to 4-iodo-N,N-dimethylaniline.
   Iodate concentrations were quantified by measuring the difference of
   iodide concentrations in the solution before and after reduction by
   Na2S2O5. Total iodine, including inorganic and organic iodine, was
   determined after conversion to iodate by combustion at 900 degrees C.
   Organo-iodine was calculated as the difference between the total iodine
   and total inorganic iodine (iodide and iodate). The detection limits of
   iodide-127 and iodate-127 were 0.34 nM and 1.11 nM, respectively,
   whereas the detection limits for both iodide-129 and iodate-129 was 0.08
   nM (i.e., 2pCi I-129/L). This method was successfully applied to water
   samples from the contamineted Savannah River Site, South Carolina, and
   more pristine Galveston Bay, Texas.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells are relatively resistant to
   ionizing radiation (IR). The phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) kinases are
   members of a family of lipid kinases that rnediate cellular functions,
   including cell growth, proliferation and DNA repair, which may
   contribute to radioresistance. We studied whether inhibition of PI3
   kinases could increase the response of NSCLC cells to gamma-irradiation.
   The results showed that pretreatment of PI3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin
   dose-dependently radiosensitized NSCLC A549 and H1650 cells by
   inhibiting colony formation, which was due to enhanced G2/M arrest and
   apoptosis by wortmannin. The accelerated apoptosis was accompanied by
   increased loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cytochrome
   c release to the cytoplasm. In addition, wortmannin pretreatment
   significantly increased caspase-3 activation, which was associated with
   the repression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). The
   radio-sensitizing effect of wortmannin was correlated with the
   inhibition of phosphorylated PKB/Akt level. Furthermore, wortmannin
   down-regulated the expression of DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic
   subunit (DNA-PKcs) which is involved in DNA double stand break (DSB)
   repair, as a result, leading to the inhibition of DSBs rejoining, as
   indicated by increased level of gamma-H2AX at 24 h after IR. Taken
   together, our results demonstrate that wortmannin acts as a powerful
   radiosensitizer in NSCLC cells by inhibiting PI3K/Akt survival signaling
   and DNA repair protein DNA-PKcs, suggesting that PI3 kinase inhibitors
   may represent a novel strategy for overcoming resistance to IR-induced
   apoptosis in NSCLC cells.}},

Abstract = {{Interfaces are explicitly accounted for, within gradient plasticity, by

   materials under constant load or constant displacement rate conditions.
   The corresponding stress-strain curves exhibit serrations as observed
   experimentally during nanoindentation or microtensile tests:
   ``plateaus{''} or ``strain bursts{''} in the case of a constant load
   rate and ``serrations{''} or ``stress drops{''} in the case of a

   phenomenon when the deformation process is experimentally monitored by
   sufficiently sensitive devices in a variety of material classes is the

Abstract = {{Introduction: B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration
   site 1 (Bmi-1) is a member of polycomb group, which participates in
   axial patterning, hematopoiesis, cell cycle regulation, and senescence.
   Recently, overexpression of Bmi-1 has been reported in various human
   cancers and proved to be associated with poor survival. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the expression of Bmi-1 protein in human
   uterine cervical cancer (UCC) and explore its associations with
   clinicopathological factors and prognosis.
   Methods: Western blot was used to detect the expression of Bmi-1 in 4
   human cervical cancer cell lines (Hela, SiHa, CasKi, and C33A) and a
   normal cervical epithelial cell line. In addition, 152 UCC and 30
   adjacent normal cervical paraffin-embedded samples were collected to
   detect Bmi-1 expression by immunohistochemistry.
   Results: Western blot analysis showed Bmi-1 was overexpressed in 4 human
   UCC cell lines but not in the normal cervical epithelial cell line.
   Moreover, immunohistochemical staining revealed Bmi-1 was overexpressed
   in 63.2\% UCC tissues (Bmi-1 ++ or +++), and the overexpression of Bmi-1
   protein was significantly correlated with tumor size (P = 0.046),
   clinical stage (P = 0.021), and regional lymph nodes metastasis (P =
   0.010). Survival analysis showed a significant difference between Bmi-1
   protein overexpression and poor survival (P = 0.021). Cox proportional
   hazards risk analysis indicated that Bmi-1 protein overexpression was an
   independent prognostic factor for overall survival.
   Conclusions: B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration
   site 1 is overexpressed in UCC and correlated with adverse clinical
   characteristics and poor prognosis, which suggests that the Bmi-1 might
   participate in the development and progression of UCC and have clinical
   potential not only as a useful predictor of aggressive phenotype but
   also a promising prognostic predictor.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a multifactorial disease
   influenced by various genetic factors involved in accumulation of
   atherosclerosis in the walls of the coronary arteries. Many single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with CAD.
   Material/Methods: DNA samples were extracted from peripheral white blood
   cells and 32 tag SNPs of 12 genes (ADD 1, PECAM-1, CRP, ecNOS, PC-1,
   SELL, GNB3, ACE, AT1R, ACT, MTHFR and HL) that were listed in
   International Haplotype Map (hapmap) for Chinese people of Han ethnicity
   in Beijing (CHB) were selected for use in the current work. Genotypes of
   SNPs were investigated with the Genome Lab SNP stream genotyping system
   after polymerase chain reaction, extension and hybridization were
   performed. The levels of the biochemical index were detected with the
   Roche 7600 automatic biochemical modular system.
   Results: The genotype and/or allele frequencies of 6 tag SNPs in CRP,
   ecNOS, PC-1 and ACE genes were significantly different between CAD and
   control groups. According to the linkage-disequilibrium levels of SNPs,
   the haplotypes were constructed and the results showed that the
   frequencies of the constructed haplotypes of ecNOS, PC-1 and ACE genes
   were associated with CAD. Genotypes of CRP and ACE genes were associated
   with serum CRP and ACE levels.
   Conclusions: Six SNPs that were discovered and were associated with CAD
   may help in explaining the molecular basis of the disorder and the
   susceptibility to coronary atherosclerosis. It can also help identify
   early prediction, prevention and therapy for CAD.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a microfluidic device capable of fully integrated
   sample preparation and gene analysis from crude biosamples such as whole
   blood. Our platform takes the advantage of the silica superparamagnetic
   particle based solid phase extraction to develop an all-in-one scheme
   that performs cell lysis, DNA binding, washing, elution and the PCR in
   the same reaction chamber. The device also employs a unique reagent
   loading scheme, allowing efficient preparation of multiple reactions via
   a single injection channel. In addition, PCR is performed in a
   droplet-in-oil manner, eliminating the need for chamber sealing. The
   combination of these design features greatly reduces the complexity in
   implementing fully integrated lab-on-a-chip systems for genetic
   detection, facilitating parallel analysis of multiple samples or genes
   on a single microchip. The capability of the device is demonstrated by
   performing DNA isolation from the human whole blood sample and analyzing
   the Rsf-1 gene using the TaqMan probe based gene specific PCR assays.}},

Abstract = {{Dysfunction of the UPS (ubiquitin-proteasome system) has been implicated
   in dopaminergic neuronal death in PD (Parkinson's disease). Recent
   studies suggest that unregulated cell cycle events play a key role in
   neuronal death. In this study, the effects of IJPS dysfunction on cell
   cycle events in neuronal differentiated PC12 cells were analysed using a
   specific inhibitor of proteasome, lactacystin. Lactacystin induced
   apoptosis, G(2)/M cell cycle arrest and sustained the phosphorylation of
   the pRB (retinoblastoma protein), the key molecular process of G(1)/S
   transition, in neuronal PC12 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of cell
   cycle progression protected against lactacystin-induced cell apoptosis.
   Finally, we determined that lactacystin activated the ERK signalling
   pathway. Inhibition of ERK1/2 activation by MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059
   decreased cell cycle aberrant and prevented apoptosis induced by
   lactacystin. These results indicate that aberrant cell cycle events
   contribute to apoptotic death induced by UPS dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{Various functional imaging tools have been used to detect epileptic
   activity in the neural network underlying mesial temporal lobe epilepsy
   (mTLE). In the present fMRI study, a data-driven approach was employed
   to map interictal epileptic activity in mTLE patients by measuring the
   amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of the blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Twenty-four left mTLE patients and 26
   right mTLE patients were investigated by comparing with 25 healthy
   subjects. In the patients, the regions showing increased ALFF were
   consistently distributed in the mesial temporal lobe, thalamus, and a
   few of other cortical and subcortical structures composing a mesial
   temporal epilepsy network proposed previously, while the regions showing
   decreased ALFF were mostly located in the areas of so-called
   default-mode network. Data of simultaneous EEG-fMRI from a portion of
   the patients suggested that the increases in ALFF might be associated
   with the interictal epileptic activity. Individual analyses based on
   statistic parametric mapping revealed a moderate sensitivity and a
   fairly high specificity for the lateralization of unilateral mTLE. We
   conclude that the ALFF analysis may provide a useful tool in fMRI study

Abstract = {{Background: Obesity has been proposed to be a risk factor for the
   development of childhood asthma.
   Objective: We sought to examine weight status from birth to age 5 years
   in relation to the occurrence of asthma at ages 6 and 8 years.
   Methods: Two hundred eighty-five full-term high-risk newborns with at
   least 1 asthmatic/atopic parent enrolled in the Childhood Origin of
   Asthma project were studied from birth to age 8 years. Overweight was
   defined by weight-for-length percentiles of greater than the 85th
   percentile before the age of 2 years and a body mass index percentile of
   greater than the 85th percentile at ages 2 to 5 years.
   Results: No significant concurrent association was found between
   overweight status and wheezing/asthma occurrence at each year of age. In
   contrast, longitudinal analyses revealed complex relationships between
   being overweight and asthma. Being overweight at age 1 year was
   associated with a decreased risk of asthma at age 6 (odds ratio {[}OR],
   0.32; P=.02) and 8 (OR, 0.35; P=.04) years, as well as better lung
   function. However, being overweight beyond infancy was not associated
   with asthma occurrence. In fact, only children who were overweight at
   age 5 years but not at age 1 year had an increased risk of asthma at age
   6 years (OR, 5.78; P=.05).
   Conclusion: In children genetically at high risk of asthma, being
   overweight at age 1 year was associated with a decreased risk of asthma
   and better lung function at ages 6 and 8 years. However, being
   overweight beyond infancy did not have any protective effect and even
   could confer a higher risk for asthma. (J Allergy Clin Immunol

Abstract = {{In skeletal muscle cells, insulin stimulates cytoskeleton actin
   remodeling to facilitate the translocation of glucose transporter GLUT4
   to plasma membrane. Defect of insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation and
   actin remodeling may cause insulin resistance. Free fatty acids cause
   insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the effects of fatty acids on glucose transport and actin
   remodeling. Differentiated L6 muscle cells expressing c-myc
   epitope-tagged GLUT4 were treated with palmitic acid, linoleic acid and
   oleic acid. Surface GLUT4 and 2-deoxyglucose uptake were measured in
   parallel with the morphological imaging of actin remodeling and GLUT4
   immunoreactivity with fluorescence, confocal and transmission electron
   microscopy. Differentiated L6 cells showed concentration responses of
   insulin-induced actin remodeling and glucose uptake. The ultrastructure
   of insulin-induced actin remodeling was cell projections clustered with
   actin and GLUT4. Acute and chronic treatment with the 3 fatty acids had
   no effect on insulin-induced actin remodeling and GLUT4
   immunoreactivity. However, insulin-mediated glucose uptake significantly
   decreased by palmitic acid (25, 50, 75, 100 mu mol/L), oleic acid (180,
   300 mu mol/L) and linoleic acid (120, 180, 300 mu mol/L). Oleic acid
   (120, 300 mu mol/L) and linoleic acid (300 mu mol/L), but not palmitic
   acid, significantly decreased insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation.
   These data suggest that fatty acids inhibit insulin-induced glucose
   transport associated with actin remodeling in L6 muscle cells.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the quickest detection of idle periods in multiple ON-OFF
   processes. At each time, only one process can be observed, and the
   observations are random realizations drawn from two different
   distributions depending on the current state (ON or OFF) of the chosen
   process. The objective is to catch an idle period in any of the ON-OFF
   processes as quickly as possible subject to a reliability constraint. We
   show that this problem presents a fresh twist to the classic problem of
   quickest change detection that considers only one stochastic process. A
   Bayesian formulation of the problem is developed for both infinite and
   finite number of processes based on the theory of partially observable
   Markov decision process (POMDP). While a general POMDP is PSPACE-hard,
   we show that the optimal decision rule has a simple threshold structure
   for the infinite case. For the finite case, basic properties of the
   optimal decision rule are established, and a low-complexity threshold
   policy is proposed which converges to the optimal decision rule for the
   infinite case as the number of processes increases. This problem finds
   applications in spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks where a
   secondary user searches for idle channels in the spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{A new clonal selection immune algorithm with perturbation guiding search
   and non-uniform hypermutation (nCSIA) is proposed based on the idea of
   perturbed particle swarm algorithm and non-uniform mutation. The
   proposed algorithm proportional clones antibody based on the affinity,
   adaptively adjusts the searching steps of antibodies with hypermutation
   according to the adaptive variation rule of non-uniform mutation and
   chooses the promising antibody based on the affinity by clonal selection
   principle. In order to keep the balance of exploration/exploitation
   better, perturbation guiding search strategy is presented, which is
   actually an elitist learning mechanism and is borrowed from the
   perturbed particle swarm algorithm. In order to validate the
   effectiveness of nCSIA, comprehensive experiments and analysis are done
   based on fifteen unimodal or multimodal benchmark functions. Compared
   with standard and the recent algorithms, it indicates that the proposed
   algorithm is feasible, effective and has better performance in terms of
   convergence, accuracy and stability. More evident predominance emerges
   from further experimental comparisons with expanding search space and
   increasing dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the association between common variants
   in the matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) gene and the risk of
   developing sporadic brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM). We
   performed genotyping analyses for five single nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs) in MMP-3 in a case-control study involving 319 Chinese patients
   with BAVM and 333 Chinese controls. The association between MMP-3
   genotypes and the risk of developing BAVM was evaluated using logistic
   regression analyses. We found that the genotype frequencies were
   significantly different between patients and controls for the rs522616 A
   > G variant of MMP-3 (p = 0.02). Logistic regression analysis revealed
   that the variant genotype of this polymorphism was associated with a
   significantly decreased risk of BAVM (adjusted odds ratio = 0.62, 95\%
   confidence interval = 0.44-0.87. p = 0.006 for the AG compared with the
   AA genotype; adjusted odds ratio = 0.68, 95\% confidence interval =
   0.49-0.94, p = 0.019 for the AG + GG compared with the AA genotype).
   These findings indicate for the first time that the MMP-3 rs522616
   polymorphism may contribute to the etiology of sporadic BAVM in the
   Chinese population. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   achieved for the sigmoid (C = 2, gamma = 0.5) SVM classifier as well as
   the polynomial (C = 2, gamma = 0.5, d = 1) SVM classifier. The proposed
   SVM classifier achieved the best classification accuracy, showing that
   the SVM-ChIF system can provide a potential tool for automatically

Abstract = {{Recently, both academia and industry have initiated research projects
   directed on integration of P2PSIP paradigm into communication systems.
   In this paradigm, P2P network stores most of the network information on
   each participating peer without help of the central servers. The concept
   of self-configuration, self-establishment greatly improves the
   robustness of the network system compared with the traditional
   Client/Server based systems. In this paper, we survey P2PSIP solutions
   proposed recently both in the academic and industrial research. We
   consider technical issues that include Chord overlay topology, P2PSIP
   session initiation (including enrollment and boot-strap, NAT traversal,
   message routing, P2PSIP interworking, P2PSIP Client, etc), and security
   issues. Our survey is based on recent research publications.}},

Abstract = {{Combining data collected from different sources can potentially enhance
   statistical efficiency in estimating effects of environmental or genetic
   factors or gene-environment interactions. However, combining data across
   studies becomes complicated when data are collected under different
   study designs, such as family-based and unrelated individual-based
   case-control design. In this article, we describe likelihood-based
   approaches that permit the joint estimation of covariate effects on
   disease risk under study designs that include cases, relatives of cases,
   and unrelated individuals. Our methods accommodate familial residual
   correlation and a variety of ascertainment schemes. Extensive simulation
   experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods for estimation and
   inference perform well in realistic settings. Efficiencies of different
   designs are contrasted in the simulation. We applied the methods to data
   from the Colorectal Cancer Family Registry.}},

   Implications for understanding environmental changes in drainage basins}},
Journal = {{CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is a primary constituent of the aquatic
   geochemistry of terrestrial ecosystems. Changes in DIC concentration and
   its isotopic composition are closely associated with environmental
   changes in the drainage basin. Thus, a better understanding of DIC may
   lead to improved characterization of environmental changes. Corbicula
   fluminea (Muller 1774), a bivalve native to southeast Asia and a
   dominant invasive species in many aquatic environments around the world,
   has the potential to record DIC information, particularly because of its
   sequential skeletal deposition. Analysis of the stable carbon isotope
   composition (delta C-13) of the shell and the aquatic DIC in the Xijiang
   River drainage basins in southern and western China allowed us to
   determine that changes in delta C-13 in the skeleton significantly
   correlated with those of DIC (P < 0.01, r = 0.63). These results
   indicate that the isotopic signature of the shell reflects that delta
   C-13 of the DIC in ambient water. The temporal resolution was at the
   seasonal scale. Metabolic effect does not change the co-variation, even
   though it makes the shell delta C-13 1.4 parts per thousand lower
   statistically than that of DIC. delta C-13 of DIC in creeks of some
   watershed areas may experience large temporal changes characterization
   of these changes requires high sampling resolution of the shell. This
   problem makes the clams in these areas less preferable for
   reconstruction of environmental changes. The present findings provide
   the basis for recovering paleoenvironmental changes and carbon cycles in
   a watershed through analysis of fossil shells of C. fluminea, which are
   common in some lacustrine and/or riverine sediment sequences.}},

Title = {{A pragmatic approach to the design of bullwhip controllers}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{556-568}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that forecasting mechanisms can greatly increase
   ``bullwhip{''} - demand variance amplification of orders as processed by
   both human and algorithmic decision makers. This paper is concerned with
   the application of the well-established APIOBPCS Decision Support System
   (a variant of the Order-Up-To Rule) in such circumstances. It has two
   feedback controls (based on the inventory and the orders-in-pipeline
   respectively) with gains set equal according to the Deziel-Eilon Rule.
   There is one feed-forward control based on exponential forecasting,
   although this is not a restriction on the application of this system.
   We consider the pragmatic role of APIOBPCS in the situation where the
   echelon decision maker may be handling a wide range of SKU's in a
   non-altruistic environment where upmarket information may either be
   withheld or simply unavailable. Under such circumstances it has been
   established via site-based studies that the decision makers output (the
   orders) reflect a wide range of strategies (or maybe ignorance). Three
   strategies may be regarded as ``appropriate{''}, i.e. Pass-orders-Along;
   Demand Smoothing; and Level Scheduling depending, on context. APIOBPCS
   can be adapted to each of these modus operandi. In the first case with
   the added capability of smoothing the ``sharp edges{''} with a modicum
   of inventory variation, and in the last case with the advantage of
   built-in trend detection.
   ``Players{''} in non-altruistic supply chains must be able to cope with
   added uncertainties due to lead-time variations. We show that APIOBPCS
   may be well matched to such situations and is hence ``copable{''} as
   well as ``capable{''}. The paper includes recommended parameter settings
   according to desired decision-making policies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

   1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ({[}C6MIM]{[}PF6]) was
   used as the extraction solvent for the enrichment of four benzoylurea
   (BU) pesticides. Factors such as volume of {[}C6MIM]{[}PF6], sonication
   time, sample pH, extraction time, centrifuging time and salting-out
   effect were systematically investigated. Under the optimum conditions,
   an excellent linear relationship was achieved in the range of 1.0-100 mu
   g/L. The detection limits varied from 0.21 to 0.45 mu g/L and the
   precision of the method was below 6.9\% (RSD, n = 56). The proposed
   method was successfully applied for the determination of these BU
   pesticides in water samples and excellent spiked recoveries were

Abstract = {{An entomopathogenic bacterial strain SCQ1 was isolated from silkworm
   (Bombyx mori) and identified as Serratia marcescens via 16S rRNA gene
   analysis. This strain produces a red pigment that causes acute
   septicemia of silkworm. The red pigment of strain SCQ1 was identified as
   prodigiosin analogue (PGA) with various reported biological activities.
   In this study, we found that low concentration of PGA showed significant
   anticancer activity in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, but has
   little effect in human bone marrow stem cells, in vitro. By exposure to
   different concentrations of PGA for 24 h, morphological changes and the
   MTT assay showed that A549 cell line was very sensitive to PGA, with
   IC50 value about 2.2 mg/L. Early stage of apoptosis was detected by flow
   cytometry while A549 cells were treated with PGA for 4 and 12 h,
   respectively. The proportion of dead cells was increased with treatment
   time or the concentrations of PGA, but it was inversely proportional to
   that of apoptotic cells. These results indicate that PGA obtained from
   strain SCQ1 induces apoptosis in A549 cells, but the molecular
   mechanisms of cell death are complicated, and the S. marcescens strain
   SCQ1 may serve as a source of the anticancer compound, PGA.}},

Abstract = {{The working environment in health care organizations is characterized by
   its demand for highly dynamic process and labor management in which (a)
   medical personnel are generally associated with several disparate types
   of tasks, (b) service location and service personnel change frequently,
   (c) highly uncertain environment where emergency issues could arise at
   any time, and (d) the stakes are high since invaluable human lives are
   involved. There is an urgent need from both researchers and health care
   organizations to develop reasonable management strategies for
   maintaining a good balance between efficient management and superior
   medical service quality. We discuss the potential for real-time health
   care coordination and effective medical process and labor management
   enabled by RFID item-level tracking/tracing identification technology.
   We explore the uniqueness of instance-level process mining and its
   application in health care environment. We then propose an adaptive
   learning framework that supports real-time health care coordination and
   analyze its benefits compared to traditional routine process and labor
   management. We find that while RFID-enabled real-time medical process
   and labor management provides marginal improvement for premium medical
   service providers, it generates appreciable improvement both in terms of
   efficiency and service quality for public health care institutions where
   availability of necessary resources such as medical staff and equipment
   are highly constrained. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Huanggang tin-iron deposit, Inner Mongolia, is an important deposit of
   the South Daxinganling metallogenic belt. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating
   results show that the K-feldspar granite and granite-porphyry in the
   Huanggang rocks were formed at 136.7 +/- 1.1 Ma and 136.8 +/- 0.57Ma,
   respectively. The Huanggang granites are characterized by SiO2 content
   (66.81\% similar to 77.39\%), Al2O3 content (11.33\% similar to
   14.54\%), and significant depletion of magnesium, high ALK (5.65\%
   similar to 10.67\%), the K2O/Na2O values format a range of 0.32 to
   10.53, averaging 2.78. The chondrite-nomalized REE pattern shows LREE
   enrichment, strong negative Eu anomalies, and delta Eu at 0.03 to 0.20.
   The high field strength elements such as Zr, Hf and lithophile elements
   such as Rb, U and Th are enriched, whereas the elements P, Ti, Ba and Sr
   are significantly depleted and their have similar Y/Nb values (>1.2) to
   those of oceanic island basal tic These features are coincident with the
   typical A1 within-plate anorogenic granite. Its genesis might be
   ascribed to the underplating of the mantle-derived magma which caused
   younger crust partial melting to form granitic magma within the
   lithosphere extension environment and its magma source are related to
   the crust-mantle mixed remelting.}},

Abstract = {{On August 1, 2007, the collapse of the I-35W bridge over the Mississippi
   River in Minneapolis abruptly interrupted the usual route of about
   140,000 daily vehicle trips, which substantially disturbed regular
   traffic flow patterns on the network. It took several weeks for the
   network to re-equilibrate, during which period travelers continued to
   learn and adjust their travel decisions. A good understanding of this
   process is crucial for traffic management and the design of mitigation
   schemes. Data from loop-detectors, bus ridership statistics, and a
   survey are analyzed and compared, revealing the evolving traffic
   reactions to the bridge collapse and how individual choices could help
   to explain such dynamics. Findings on short-term traffic dynamics and
   behavioral reactions to this major network disruption have important
   implications for traffic management in response to future scenarios. (C)

Abstract = {{In the present study three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix
   (3DEEM) fluorescence spectroscopy was applied to characterize the
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the overlying water under aerobic and

   peak intensities of protein-like fluorophores were both higher than
   those of the humic-like fluorophores, however, the phenomenon of the
   oxidative degradation of humic-original DOM could be seen. While in
   anaerobic condition, the peak intensities of the humic-like fluorescence
   were increased with increasing the incubation time. After the 21 day
   anaerobic incubation, the peak intensities of the humic-like
   fluorescence can be as 3. 51 and 3. 78 times higher than those of
   protein-like fluorescence. The differences in the DOM fluorescence

Abstract = {{Two-step steam reforming of methane (SRM) is a novel chemical looping
   process towards the production of pure hydrogen and syngas (synthesis

   Renewable energy can be used to drive this process for hydrogen
   production, especially solar energy. CeO2-Fe2O3 complex oxide oxygen
   carrier was prepared by the impregnation method and characterized by
   means of X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (Raman) and
   hydrogen programmed reduction (H-2-TPR). CH4 temperature programmed and
   isothermal reactions were adopted to test syngas production reactivity,
   and water splitting reaction was employed to investigate water-splitting
   activity. Moreover, two-step SRM performance was evaluated by a
   successive redox cycle. The results showed that CO-uncontaminated H-2
   and highly selective syngas (with H-2/CO ratio close to 2) could be
   respectively obtained from two steps, and CeFeO3 formation was found in
   the first redox cycle and proved to be enhanced by the redox treatment.
   After 10 successive cycles, obvious CeFeO3 phase was detected, which may
   be responsible for favorable successive redox cycle performances.}},

Abstract = {{Restricting amplification of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA to
   wild-type (WT) HCMV is useful to exclude PCR contaminations by
   laboratory strains from viral cultures. A set of UL141-specific TaqMan
   PCRs was developed to amplify (1) WT HCMV and laboratory strain
   Towne(long), but not strain AD169, (2) only WT HCMV. The performance was
   compared to a PCR targeting the conserved sequence of HCMV glycoprotein
   B using 46 serum and urine samples from blood donors with primary CMV
   infection. Amplification was restricted to the targeted strains with the
   exception of Towne(long) being amplified also by PCR (2), but at a
   distinctly lower efficiency than WT HCMV. The coefficient of regression
   for linear dilutions of two clinical samples with a high concentration
   of HCMV DNA was 0.999 and 0.997, respectively. The correlation between
   both WT PCRs and the generic HCMV PCR was good, with coefficients of
   regression of 0.891 and 0.871 for PCR (1) and (2), respectively. The
   limit of detection was calculated to be 1.5 genome equivalents per PCR.
   The set of HCMV TaqMan PCRs enables rapid differentiation between WT and
   laboratory strains, which can be especially useful as even virus lysate
   can contaminate sensitive PCRs without prior DNA isolation. A
   standardized WT HCMV control would be useful to evaluate WT-specific PCR

   (substrate and strips/grains). The atoms in contact with the substrate
   generate the tensile stress, but atoms in contact with the grain
   generate the compressive stress. The melted grains increase the contact
   surface giving possibility the larger number of atoms to penetrate the

Title = {{The Role of Water in Generating the Calc-alkaline Trend: New Volatile
   Data for Aleutian Magmas and a New Tholeiitic Index}},

Abstract = {{The origin of tholeiitic (TH) versus calc-alkaline (CA) magmatic trends
   has long been debated. Part of the problem stems from the lack of a
   quantitative measure for the way in which a magma evolves. Recognizing
   that the salient feature in many TH-CA discrimination diagrams is
   enrichment in Fe during magma evolution, we have developed a
   quantitative index of Fe enrichment, the Tholeiitic Index (THI): THI =
   Fe-4 center dot 0/Fe-8 center dot 0, where Fe-4 center dot 0 is the
   average FeO{*} concentration of samples with 4 +/- 1 wt \% MgO, and Fe-8
   center dot 0 is the average FeO{*} at 8 +/- 1 wt \% MgO. Magmas with THI
   > 1 have enriched in FeO{*} during differentiation from basalts to
   andesites and are tholeiitic; magmas with THI < 1 are calc-alkaline.
   Most subduction zone volcanism is CA, but to varying extents; the THI
   expresses the continuum of Fe enrichment observed in magmatic suites in
   all tectonic settings. To test various controls on the development of CA
   trends, we present new magmatic water measurements in melt inclusions
   from eight volcanoes from the Aleutian volcanic arc (Augustine, Emmons,
   Shishaldin, Akutan, Unalaska, Okmok, Seguam, and Korovin). Least
   degassed H2O contents vary from similar to 2 wt \% (Shishaldin) to > 7
   wt \% (Augustine), spanning the global range in arc mafic magmas. Within
   the Aleutian data, H2O correlates negatively with THI, from strongly
   calc-alkaline (Augustine, THI = 0 center dot 65) to moderately
   tholeiitic (Shishaldin, THI = 1 center dot 16). The relationship between
   THI and magmatic water is maintained when data are included from
   additional arc volcanoes, back-arc basins, ocean islands, and mid-ocean
   ridge basalts (MORBs), supporting a dominant role of magmatic water in
   generating CA trends. An effective break between TH and CA trends occurs
   at similar to 2 wt \% H2O. Both pMELTs calculations and laboratory
   experiments demonstrate that the observed co-variation of H2O and THI in
   arcs can be generated by the effect of H2O on the suppression of
   plagioclase and the relative enhancement of Fe-oxides on the liquid line
   of descent. The full THI-H2O array requires an increase in fO(2) with
   H2O, from FMQ (where FMQ is the fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer) in
   MORB to similar to delta FMQ +0 center dot 5 to +2 in arcs, consistent
   with inferences from measured Fe and S species in glasses and melt
   inclusions. A curve fit to the data, H2O (wt \% +/- 1 center dot 2) =
   exp{[}(1 center dot 26 - THI)/0 center dot 32], may provide a useful
   tool for estimating the H2O content of magmas that are inaccessible to
   melt inclusion study.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the Allee effect is incorporated into a predator-prey
   model with Holling type II functional response. Compared with the
   predator-prey model without Allee effect, we find that the Allee effect
   of prey species increases the extinction risk of both predators and
   prey. When the handling time of predators is relatively short and the
   Allee effect of prey species becomes strong, both predators and prey may
   become extinct. Moreover, it is shown that the model with Allee effect
   undergoes the Hopf bifurcation and heteroclinic bifurcation. The Allee
   effect of prey species can lead to unstable periodical oscillation. It
   is also found that the positive equilibrium of the model could change
   from stable to unstable, and then to stable when the strength of Allee
   effect or the handling time of predators increases continuously from
   zero, that is, the model admits stability switches as a parameter
   changes. When the Allee effect of prey species becomes strong, longer
   handling time of predators may stabilize the coexistent steady state.

Abstract = {{A novel adsorbent, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) modified maghemite
   nanoparticles (SDS-gamma-Fe(2)O(3)), was used for removal of cationic
   dyes brilliant cresyl blue (BCB), thionine (Th) and janus green b (JG),
   from water samples. Prepared nanoparticles were characterized by TEM,
   SEM, XRD, BET and EDX measurements. The influences including initial pH,
   dosage of adsorbent, surfactant amount and contact time have been
   researched in order to find the optimum adsorption conditions. The
   experimental data were analyzed by the Langmuir and Freundlich
   adsorption models. Equilibrium data fitted very well with the Langmuir
   model signifying the energetic homogeneity of SDS-maghemite surface
   adsorption sites. The maximum predicted adsorption capacities for Th,
   BCB and JG dyes were obtained as 200.0, 166.7 and 172.4 mg g(-1),
   respectively. It was shown that the sorbent can remove more than 93\% of
   the investigated dyes within the first 4 min of contact time. The
   desorption process of the adsorbed cationic dyes was also investigated
   using methanol and methanol-acetic acid mixture as the solvent. It was
   notable that both the adsorption and desorption of dyes were quite fast
   probably due to the absence of internal diffusion resistance. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to formulate and characterize
   Acitretin loaded Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (ActNLCs), to understand
   in vitro drug release and clinically evaluate the role of the developed
   gel in the topical treatment of psoriasis. ActNLCs were prepared by
   solvent diffusion technique using 32 full factorial design. The mean
   diameter and surface morphology of ActNLC was evaluated. ActNLCs were
   lyophilized and crystallinity of NLC was characterized by Differential
   Scanning Calorimtery (DSC) and powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The NLCs
   were incorporated in 1\% w/w Carbopol 934 P gel base and in vitro skin
   deposition studies in Human Cadaver Skin and double-blind clinical
   studies in psoriatic patients were conducted. The optimized ActNLCs were
   spherical in shape, with average particle size of 223(+/-8.92) nm, zeta
   potential of -26.4 (+/-0.86) mV and EE of 63.0(+/-1.54)\%. DSC and XRD
   data confirmed the formation of NLCs. Significantly higher deposition of
   Acitretin was found in human cadaver skin from ActNLC gel (81.38 +/-
   1.23\%) as compared to Act plain gel (47.28 +/- 1.02\%). Clinical
   studies demonstrated significant improvement in therapeutic response and
   reduction in local side effects with ActNLCs loaded gel indicated its
   effectiveness in the topical treatment of Psoriasis. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Title = {{Combination of long term aerated storage and chemical

Pages = {{226-232}},

Abstract = {{Winery wastewaters from white and red wine production were studied, in
   the first stage of this work, by a coagulation/flocculation process
   using four different coagulants (FeSO4, Al-2(SO4)(3), FeCl3 and
   Ca(OH)(2)). The optimal pH and volume of coagulant added were studied.
   From the results achieved it was possible to verify that
   coagulation/flocculation allows, within optimal conditions of pH and
   coagulant dosage, an efficient removal of turbidity (aluminium sulphate,
   92.6\%) and total suspended solids - TSS (calcium hydroxide, 95.4\%).
   However, it revealed small capacity to remove the COD load of winery
   wastewaters even from white or red wine production. As an alternative a
   previous and economical aerobic biological process was evaluated in
   articulation with the coagulation/flocculation process. The long term
   aerated storage (LTAS) was studied with two different aeration periods
   (2.4 h/day and 4.0 h/day) trying to reach a better significant COD
   removal with reduced operational costs. Long term aerated storage
   possibilities obtained a COD degradation of 75\% in 11 weeks for an
   aeration period of 4 h/day. A way of optimizing the LTAS process and
   removing the remaining organic load was the combination with the
   chemical coagulant/flocculant studied in the first stage of this work.
   Therefore, to the LTAS effluent were applied the four coagulants within
   optimal conditions. Calcium hydroxide was selected as the best coagulant
   to apply to the LTAS effluent. Through the combination of the LTAS
   process followed by the calcium hydroxide coagulant an overall removal
   efficiency of 84.5\% was obtained for COD, 96.6\% for turbidity, 98.7\%
   for volatile suspended solids (VSS) and 99.1\% for TSS. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{In this paper(1) we describe the Combined Kalman-Information Filter SLAM
   algorithm (CF SLAM), a judicious combination of Extended Kalman (EKF)
   and Extended Information Filters (EIF) that can be used to execute
   highly efficient SLAM in large environments. CF SLAM is always more
   efficient than any other EKF or EIF algorithm: filter updates can be
   executed in as low as O(log n) as compared with O(n(2)) for Map Joining
   SLAM, O(n) for Divide and Conquer (D\&C) SLAM, and the Sparse Local
   Submap Joining Filter (SLSJF). In the worst cases, updates are executed
   in O(n) for CF SLAM as compared with O(n(2)) for all others. We also
   study an often overlooked problem in computationally efficient SLAM
   algorithms: data association. In situations in which only uncertain
   geometrical information is available for data association, CF SLAM is as
   efficient as D\&C SLAM, and much more efficient than Map Joining SLAM or
   SLSJF. If alternative information is available for data association,
   such as texture in visual SLAM, CF SLAM outperforms all other
   algorithms. In large scale situations, both algorithms based on Extended
   Information filters, CF SLAM and SLSJF, avoid computing the full
   covariance matrix and thus require less memory, but still CF SLAM is the
   most computationally efficient. Both simulations and experiments with
   the Victoria Park dataset, the DLR dataset, and an experiment using
   visual stereo are used to illustrate the algorithms' advantages, also
   with respect to non filtering alternatives such as iSAM, the Treemap and
   Tectonic SAM. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we implemented and compared two different methods to
   impose the rigid-body motion constraint on a solid particle moving
   inside a fluid. We consider a fictitious domain method to easily manage
   the particle motion. As the solid as well as the fluid inertia are
   neglected, the particle can be discretized through its boundary only.
   The rigid-body motion is imposed via Lagrange multipliers on the
   boundary. In the first method, such constraints are imposed in discrete
   points on the boundary (collocation), whereas in the second the
   constraint is imposed in a weak way on elements dividing the particle
   surface.
   Two test problems, that is, a spherical and an ellipsoidal particle in a
   sheared Newtonian fluid, are chosen to compare the methods. In both
   cases, the analysis is carried out in 2D as well as in 3D. The results
   show that for the collocation method an optimal number of collocation
   points exist leading to the smallest error. However, small variations in
   the optimal value can generate large deviations. In the weak
   implementation, the error is only mildly affected by the number of
   elements used to discretize the particle boundary and by the Lagrange
   multiplier's interpolation space. A further analysis is carried out to
   study the effect of an approximated integration of weak constraints.
   A comparison between the two methods showed that the same accuracy can
   be achieved by using less constraints if the weak discretization is
   used. Finally, the rigid-body motion imposed via weak constraints leads
   to better conditioned linear systems. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Background-Cryoablation has emerged as an alternative to radiofrequency
   catheter ablation (RFCA) for the treatment of atrioventricular (AV)
   nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). The purpose of this prospective
   randomized study was to test whether cryoablation is as effective as
   RFCA during both short-term and long-term follow-up with a lower risk of
   permanent AV block.
   Methods and Results-A total of 509 patients underwent slow pathway
   cryoablation (n=251) or RFCA (n=258). The primary end point was
   immediate ablation failure, permanent AV block, and AVNRT recurrence
   during a 6-month follow-up. Secondary end points included procedural
   parameters, device functionality, and pain perception. Significantly
   more patients in the cryoablation group than the RFCA group reached the
   primary end point (12.6\% versus 6.3\%; P=0.018). Whereas immediate
   ablation success (96.8\% versus 98.4\%) and occurrence of permanent AV
   block (0\% versus 0.4\%) did not differ, AVNRT recurrence was
   significantly more frequent in the cryoablation group (9.4\% versus
   4.4\%; P=0.029). In the cryoablation group, procedure duration was
   longer (138 +/- 54 versus 123 +/- 48 minutes; P=0.0012) and more device
   problems occurred (13 versus 2 patients; P=0.033). Pain perception was
   lower in the cryoablation group (P<0.001).
   Conclusions-Cryoablation for AVNRT is as effective as RFCA over the
   short term but is associated with a higher recurrence rate at the
   6-month follow-up. The risk of permanent AV block does not differ
   significantly between cryoablation and RFCA. The potential benefits of
   cryoenergy relative to ablation safety and pain perception are
   counterbalanced by longer procedure times, more device problems, and a
   high recurrence rate.}},

   The knowledge acquired was applied to the development of Lewis base
   catalyzed bromo- and iodocycloetherification reactions. The ability of
   some of the surveyed catalysts to influence the cyclization selectivity
   of halolactonization reactions demonstrates their presence in the
   transition structure of the product-determining cyclization step. This
   observation implies that chiral derivatives of these catalysts have the

Title = {{Associations between Dopamine D4 Receptor Gene Variation with Both
   Infidelity and Sexual Promiscuity}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Human sexual behavior is highly variable both within and
   between populations. While sex-related characteristics and sexual
   behavior are central to evolutionary theory (sexual selection), little
   is known about the genetic bases of individual variation in sexual
   behavior. The variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism in exon
   III of the human dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) has been correlated
   with an array of behavioral phenotypes and may be predicatively
   responsible for variation in motivating some sexual behaviors,
   particularly promiscuity and infidelity.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We administered an anonymous survey on
   personal history of sexual behavior and intimate relationships to 181
   young adults. We also collected buccal wash samples and genotyped the
   DRD4 VNTR. Here we show that individuals with at least one 7-repeat
   allele (7R+) report a greater categorical rate of promiscuous sexual
   behavior (i.e., having ever had a ``one-night stand'') and report a more
   than 50\% increase in instances of sexual infidelity.
   Conclusions/Significance: DRD4 VNTR genotype varies considerably within
   and among populations and has been subject to relatively recent, local
   selective pressures. Individual differences in sexual behavior are
   likely partially mediated by individual genetic variation in genes
   coding for motivation and reward in the brain. Conceptualizing these
   findings in terms of r/K selection theory suggests a mechanism for
   selective pressure for and against the 7R+ genotype that may explain the
   considerable global allelic variation for this polymorphism.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Previous reports suggest that mortality resulting from
   congenital heart disease (CHD) among infants and young children has been
   decreasing. There is little population-based information on CHD
   mortality trends and patterns among older children and adults.
   Methods and Results-We used data from death certificates filed in the
   United States from 1999 to 2006 to calculate annual CHD mortality by age
   at death, race-ethnicity, and sex. To calculate mortality rates for
   individuals >= 1 year of age, population counts from the US Census were
   used in the denominator; for infant mortality, live birth counts were
   used. From 1999 to 2006, there were 41 494 CHD-related deaths and 27 960
   deaths resulting from CHD (age-standardized mortality rates, 1.78 and
   1.20 per 100 000, respectively). During this period, mortality resulting
   from CHD declined 24.1\% overall. Mortality resulting from CHD
   significantly declined among all race-ethnicities studied. However,
   disparities persisted; overall and among infants, mortality resulting
   from CHD was consistently higher among non-Hispanic blacks compared with
   non-Hispanic whites. Infant mortality accounted for 48.1\% of all
   mortality resulting from CHD; among those who survived the first year of
   life, 76.1\% of deaths occurred during adulthood (>= 18 years of age).
   Conclusions-CHD mortality continued to decline among both children and
   adults; however, differences between race-ethnicities persisted. A large
   proportion of CHD-related mortality occurred during infancy, although
   significant CHD mortality occurred during adulthood, indicating the need
   for adult CHD specialty management. (Circulation. 2010;122:2254-2263.)}},

Abstract = {{The equivalence of inertial and gravitational masses is a defining
   feature of general relativity. Here, we clarify the status of the
   equivalence principle for interactions mediated by a universally coupled
   scalar, motivated partly by recent attempts to modify gravity at
   cosmological distances. Although a universal scalar-matter coupling is
   not mandatory, once postulated, it is stable against classical and
   quantum renormalizations in the matter sector. The coupling strength
   itself is subject to renormalization, of course. The scalar equivalence
   principle is violated only for objects for which either the graviton
   self-interaction or the scalar self-interaction is important-the first
   applies to black holes, while the second type of violation is avoided if
   the scalar is Galilean symmetric.}},

Title = {{Novel intron markers to study the phylogeny of closely related mammalian
   species}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Multilocus phylogenies can be used to infer the species tree
   of a group of closely related species. In species trees, the nodes
   represent the actual separation between species, thus providing
   essential information about their evolutionary history. In addition,
   multilocus phylogenies can help in analyses of species delimitation,
   gene flow and genetic differentiation within species. However, few
   adequate markers are available for such studies.
   Results: In order to develop nuclear markers that can be useful in
   multilocus studies of mammals, we analyzed the mammalian genomes of
   human, chimpanzee, macaque, dog and cow. Rodents were excluded due to
   their unusual genomic features. Introns were extracted from the
   mammalian genomes because of their greater genetic variability and ease
   of amplification from the flanking exons. To an initial set of more than
   10,000 one-to-one orthologous introns we applied several filters to
   select introns that belong to single-copy genes, show neutral
   evolutionary rates and have an adequate length for their amplification.
   This analysis led to a final list of 224 intron markers randomly
   distributed along the genome. To experimentally test their validity, we
   amplified twelve of these introns in a panel of six mammalian species.
   The result was that seven of these introns gave rise to a PCR band of
   the expected size in all species. In addition, we sequenced these bands
   and analyzed the accumulation of substitutions in these introns in five
   pairs of closely related species. The results showed that the estimated
   genetic distances in the five species pairs was quite variable among
   introns and that this divergence cannot be directly predicted from the
   overall intron divergence in mammals.
   Conclusions: We have designed a new set of 224 nuclear introns with
   optimal features for the phylogeny of closely related mammalian species.
   A large proportion of the introns tested experimentally showed a perfect
   amplification and enough variability in most species, indicating that
   this marker set can be very helpful in multilocus phylogenetics of
   mammals. Due to the lower variability and stronger stochasticity of
   nuclear markers with respect to mitochondrial genes, studies should be
   designed to make use of several markers like the ones designed here.}},

Title = {{A Climatic Stability Approach to Prioritizing Global Conservation
   Investments}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is impacting species and ecosystems globally. Many
   existing templates to identify the most important areas to conserve
   terrestrial biodiversity at the global scale neglect the future impacts
   of climate change. Unstable climatic conditions are predicted to
   undermine conservation investments in the future. This paper presents an
   approach to developing a resource allocation algorithm for conservation
   investment that incorporates the ecological stability of ecoregions
   under climate change. We discover that allocating funds in this way
   changes the optimal schedule of global investments both spatially and
   temporally. This allocation reduces the biodiversity loss of terrestrial
   endemic species from protected areas due to climate change by 22\% for
   the period of 2002-2052, when compared to allocations that do not
   consider climate change. To maximize the resilience of global
   biodiversity to climate change we recommend that funding be increased in
   ecoregions located in the tropics and/or mid-elevation habitats, where
   climatic conditions are predicted to remain relatively stable.
   Accounting for the ecological stability of ecoregions provides a
   realistic approach to incorporating climate change into global
   conservation planning, with potential to save more species from
   extinction in the long term.}},

Abstract = {{Transparent conductive oxide (TCO) films have been widely used in
   various applications, such as for transparent electrodes in flat-panel
   displays, and in solar cells, optoelectronic devices, touch panels and
   IR reflectors. Among these, tin doped zinc oxide (ZTO) and indium doped
   zinc oxide (ZIO) have attracted considerable attention. Particularly,
   IZO thin film is the best candidate for high-quality transparent
   conducting electrodes in OLEDs and flexible displays. In this work zinc
   indium oxide (ZIO) thin films were deposited on glass substrate with
   varying concentration (ZnO:In2O3 - 100:0, 90:10, 70:30 and 50:50 wt.\%)
   at room temperature by flash evaporation technique. These deposited ZIO
   films were annealed in vacuum to study the thermal stability and to see
   the effects on the physical properties. The XRF spectra revealed the
   presence of zinc and indium with varying concentration in ZIO thin
   films, while the surface composition and oxidation state were analyzed
   by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The core level spectra were
   deconvoluted to see the effect of chemical changes, while the valance
   band spectra manifest the electronic transitions. The surface morphology
   studies of the films using atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed the
   formation of nanostructured ZIO thin films. The optical band gap was
   also found to be decreased for both types of films with increasing
   concentration of In2O3. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: The non-receptor tyrosine kinases c-Abl and c-Src are
   overexpressed in various solid human tumours. Inhibition of their
   hyperactivity represents a molecular rationale in the combat of
   cancerous diseases. Here we examined the effects of a new family of
   pyrazolo {[}3,4-d] pyrimidines on a panel of 11 different murine lung
   tumour progenitor cell lines, that express stem cell markers, as well as
   on the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, the human hepatoma cell
   line HepG2 and the human colon cancer cell line CaCo2 to obtain insight
   into the mode of action of these experimental drugs.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Treatment with the dual kinase
   inhibitors blocked c-Abl and c-Src kinase activity efficiently in the
   nanomolar range, induced apoptosis, reduced cell viability and caused
   cell cycle arrest predominantly at G0/G1 phase while western blot
   analysis confirmed repressed protein expression of c-Abl and c-Src as
   well as the interacting partners p38 mitogen activated protein kinase,
   heterogenous ribonucleoprotein K, cyclin dependent kinase 1 and further
   proteins that are crucial for tumour progression. Importantly, a
   significant repression of the epidermal growth factor receptor was
   observed while whole genome gene expression analysis evidenced
   regulation of many cell cycle regulated genes as well integrin and focal
   adhesion kinase (FAK) signalling to impact cytoskeleton dynamics,
   migration, invasion and metastasis.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our experiments and recently published in vivo
   engraftment studies with various tumour cell lines revealed the dual
   kinase inhibitors to be efficient in their antitumour activity.}},

Title = {{Sex Differential Genetic Effect of Chromosome 9p21 on Subclinical
   Atherosclerosis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chromosome 9p21 has recently been shown to be a risk region
   for a broad range of vascular diseases. Since carotid intima-media
   thickness (IMT) and plaque are independent predictors for vascular
   diseases, the association between 9p21 and these two phenotypes was
   investigated.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Carotid segment-specific IMT and plaques
   were obtained in 1083 stroke-and myocardial infarction-free volunteers.
   We tested the genotypes and haplotypes of key single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 9p21 for the associations with
   carotid IMT and plaque. Multivariate permutation analyses demonstrated
   that carriers of the T allele of SNP rs1333040 were significantly
   associated with thicker common carotid artery (CCA) IMT (p = 0.021) and
   internal carotid artery (ICA) IMT (p = 0.033). The risk G allele of SNP
   rs2383207 was associated with ICA IMT (p = 0.007). Carriers of the C
   allele of SNP rs1333049 were found to be significantly associated with
   thicker ICA IMT (p = 0.010) and the greater risk for the presence of
   carotid plaque (OR = 1.57 for heterozygous carriers; OR = 1.75 for
   homozygous carriers). Haplotype analysis showed a global p value of
   0.031 for ICA IMT and 0.115 for the presence of carotid plaque.
   Comparing with the other haplotypes, the risk TGC haplotype yielded an
   adjusted p value of 0.011 and 0.017 for thicker ICA IMT and the presence
   of carotid plaque respectively. Further analyzing the data separated by
   sex, the results were significant only in men but not in women.
   Conclusions: Chromosome 9p21 had a significant association with carotid
   atherosclerosis, especially ICA IMT. Furthermore, such genetic effect
   was in a gender-specific manner in the Han Chinese population.}},

Abstract = {{Previous post-mortem and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   studies in patients with alcohol dependence have demonstrated
   abnormalities of brain white matter. The present study investigated the
   microstructural integrity in the corpus callosum and the associations of
   this integrity with neurobehavioral assessments. Twenty-five male cases
   fulfilling the DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol dependence and 15 male
   control subjects were scanned using a 3T MRI system. Callosal fiber
   tracts were reconstructed by diffusion spectrum imaging tractography and
   were subdivided into seven functionally distinct segments. The
   microstructural integrity was quantified in terms of generalized
   fractional anisotropy (GFA). Compared with normal subjects, men with
   alcohol dependence showed lower GFA values on all segments of the corpus
   callosum. The segment interconnecting the bilateral orbitofrontal
   cortices was the most affected. The score on the Barratt Impulsivity
   Scale showed an inverse relationship with GFA on the callosal fiber
   tracts connecting the bilateral orbitofrontal cortices. Furthermore, the
   duration of regular use was negatively associated with GFA on the
   callosal fiber tracts connecting the bilateral temporal and parietal
   cortices. Our findings suggest that a high self-rated impulsivity level
   was associated with low anisotropy in white matter of corpus callosum
   sectors extending to the orbitofrontal cortex. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland

Title = {{Membrane topology analysis of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp41}},
Journal = {{RETROVIROLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: The gp41 subunit of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env)
   has been widely regarded as a type I transmembrane protein with a single
   membrane-spanning domain (MSD). An alternative topology model suggested
   multiple MSDs. The major discrepancy between the two models is that the
   cytoplasmic Kennedy sequence in the single MSD model is assigned as the
   extracellular loop accessible to neutralizing antibodies in the other
   model. We examined the membrane topology of the gp41 subunit in both
   prokaryotic and mammalian systems. We attached topological markers to
   the C-termini of serially truncated gp41. In the prokaryotic system, we
   utilized a green fluorescent protein (GFP) that is only active in the
   cytoplasm. The tag protein (HaloTag) and a membrane-impermeable ligand
   specific to HaloTag was used in the mammalian system.
   Results: In the absence of membrane fusion, both the prokaryotic and
   mammalian systems (293FT cells) supported the single MSD model. In the
   presence of membrane fusion in mammalian cells (293CD4 cells), the data
   obtained seem to support the multiple MSD model. However, the region
   predicted to be a potential MSD is the highly hydrophilic Kennedy
   sequence and is least likely to become a MSD based on several
   algorithms. Further analysis revealed the induction of membrane
   permeability during membrane fusion, allowing the membrane-impermeable
   ligand and antibodies to cross the membrane. Therefore, we cannot
   completely rule out the possible artifacts. Addition of membrane fusion
   inhibitors or alterations of the MSD sequence decreased the induction of
   membrane permeability.
   Conclusions: It is likely that a single MSD model for HIV-1 gp41 holds
   true even in the presence of membrane fusion. The degree of the

Abstract = {{The abiotic cathodes usually require a catalyst such as Pt to enhance
   power production increasing the cost and lowering the operational
   sustainability In this paper the performance of a biocathode microbial
   fuel cell biocatalyzed by ferro/manganese-oxidizing bacteria was
   investigated A scanning electron microscopy with an energy-dispersive
   spectrometer (SEM-EDS) was used to characterize the cathode and analyze
   the element of cathode The amount of ferro/manganese-oxidizing bacteria
   in the biocathode was examined In batch-fed systems the maximum open
   circuit voltage (ON) was between 700 and 800 mV and the maximum cell
   potential difference was higher than 609 mV with an external resistance
   of 100 Omega The maximum power density was 32 W m(-3) MFC for batch-fed
   systems (20-40\% Coulombic yield) and 28W m(-3) MFC for a continuous
   system with an acetate loading rate of 1 0 kg COD m(-3) day(-1) The
   results of SEM-EDS clearly showed that cathode was impregnated with iron
   and manganese The amount of ferro/manganese-oxidizing bacteria was (7
   5-20 0) x 10(5) MPN mL(-1) in the biocathode Biocathodes alleviate the
   need to use noble catalysts for the reduction of oxygen which step

   Design Studies in male mice of four inbred strains AJ C57BL/6 DBA and
   PWD EEG/EMG were recorded for 24 h and scored Independently in 4-s and
   10-s epochs
   Measurements and results Distribution of bout durations of wakefulness
   NREM and REM sleep in mice has two distinct components i e short and
   longer bouts This is described as a spike (short bouts) and slab (longer
   bouts) distribution a particular type of mixture model The distribution
   in any state depends on the state the mouse is transitioning from and
   can be characterized by three parameters the number of such bouts
   conditional on the previous state the size of the spike and the average
   length of the slab While conventional statistics such as time spent in
   state average bout duration and number of bouts show some differences
   between inbred strains this new statistical approach reveals more major
   differences The major difference between strains is their ability to
   sustain long bouts of NREM sleep or wakefulness Scoring mouse sleep/wake
   in 4-s epochs offered little new information when using conventional
   metrics but did when evaluating the microarchitecture based on this new
   approach
   Conclusions Standard statistical approaches do not adequately
   characterize the microarchitecture of mouse behavioral state Approaches
   based on a spike-and-slab provide a quantitative description (C) 2010

Journal = {{LIPIDS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: PUFAs are potent inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
   coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, an enzyme catalyzing the conversion of
   HMGCoA to mevalonate, the rate limiting step in cholesterol
   biosynthesis. Statins represent a class of drugs that are widely used to
   treat hypercholesterolemia for their ability to inhibit cholesterol
   biosynthesis and to up-regulate the synthesis of Low Density Lipoprotein
   (LDL) receptors in the liver. PUFAs mediate many, if not all, actions of
   statins and this could be one mechanism by which they lower cholesterol
   levels. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether combined
   treatment with Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and lovastatin enhanced the
   regulatory effect on gene expression of HMGCoA reductase and LDL
   receptor in HepG2 cell line.
   Results: The combined treatment with EPA and lovastatin enhanced the
   regulatory effect on gene expression of HMGCoA reductase and LDL
   receptor in HepG2 cell line. Moreover, we detected a synergistic effect
   on the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation obtained by combination
   of EPA and Lovastatin.
   Conclusions: The use of EPA, in combination with low doses of Lovastatin
   may have potential value in treatment of neoplastic diseases.}},

Title = {{Researching Barriers to Cultural Change for Those in Loco Parentis}},
Journal = {{SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH ONLINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Drawing on recent research on professional fears around touching
   children, and also on the consequences for those professionals who find
   themselves the subject of a false allegation of abuse, this paper
   considers some of the barriers to changing the `parenting' culture of
   those in loco parentis. It consists of three linked sections. The first
   sets the scene by describing briefly the research relating to `touch'
   and to `false allegation' as well as outlining the particular ethical
   and methodological approach of the latter. This leads into the central
   section of the paper which comprises a first person account of the
   experiences of a male teacher who was wrongly accused and convicted of
   touching young children inappropriately in the classroom, serving a
   prison sentence before being found not guilty. In spite of this verdict
   his career is ruined and he will not be able to teach or work with
   children/vulnerable adults in the future. The final section reflects on
   the implications of this and other accounts, and offers tentative
   suggestions as to how accusations could be dealt with in a more
   appropriate way. The challenge is to identify principles and practices
   which are in keeping with our joint responsibility in relation to human
   rights (ie those of both children and professionals), and which also
   contribute towards encouraging the changes required in the `parenting'
   culture of those in loco parentis.}},

Title = {{Role of SHIP-1 in the Adaptive Immune Responses to Aeroallergen in the
   Airway}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Th2-dominated inflammatory response in the airway is an
   integral component in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. Accumulating
   evidence supports the notion that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
   pathway is involved in the process. We previously reported that SHIP-1,
   a negative regulator of the PI3K pathway, is essential in maintaining
   lung immunohomeostasis, potentially through regulation of innate immune
   cells. However, the function of SHIP-1 in adaptive immune response in
   the lung has not been defined. We sought to determine the role of SHIP-1
   in adaptive immunity in response to aeroallergen stimulation in the
   airway.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: SHIP-1 knockout (SHIP-1(-/-)) mice on
   BALB/c background were immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) plus aluminum
   hydroxide, a strong Th2-inducing immunization, and challenged with OVA.
   Airway and lung inflammation, immunoglobulin response, Th2 cytokine
   production and lymphocyte response were analyzed and compared with wild
   type mice. Even though there was mild spontaneous inflammation in the
   lung at baseline, SHIP-1(-/-) mice showed altered responses, including
   less cell infiltration around the airways but more in the parenchyma,
   less mucus production, decreased Th2 cytokine production, and diminished
   serum OVA-specific IgE, IgG1, but not IgG2a. Naive and OVA sensitized
   SHIP-1(-/-) T cells produced a lower amount of IL-4. In vitro
   differentiated SHIP-1(-/-) Th2 cells produced less IL-4 compared to wild
   type Th2 cells upon T cell receptor stimulation.
   Conclusions/Significance: These findings indicate that, in contrast to
   its role as a negative regulator in the innate immune cells, SHIP-1 acts
   as a positive regulator in Th2 cells in the adaptive immune response to
   aeroallergen. Thus any potential manipulation of SHIP-1 activity should
   be adjusted according to the specific immune response.}},

Abstract = {{An excess of ferricytochrome c protects purified mitochondrial
   cytochrome c oxidase and bound cardiolipin from hydrogen
   peroxide-induced oxidative modification. All of the peroxide-induced
   changes within cytochrome c oxidase, such as oxidation of Trp(19,IV) and
   Trp(48,VIIc), partial dissociation of subunits VIa and VIIa, and
   generation of cardiolipin hydroperoxide, no longer take place in the
   presence of ferricytochrome c. Furthermore, ferricytochrome c suppresses
   the yield of H2O2-induced free radical detectable by electron
   paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy within cytochrome c oxidase. These
   protective effects are based on two mechanisms. The first involves the
   peroxidase/catalase-like activity of ferricytochrome c, which results in
   the decomposition of H2O2, with the apparent bimolecular rate constant
   of 5.1 +/- 1.0 M-1 s(-1). Although this value is lower than the rate
   constant of a specialized peroxidase, the activity is sufficient to
   eliminate H2O2-induced damage to cytochrome c oxidase in the presence of
   an excess of ferricytochrome c. The second mechanism involves
   ferricytochrome c-induced quenching of free radicals generated within
   cytochrome c oxidase. These results suggest that ferricytochrome c may
   have an important role in protection of cytochrome c oxidase and
   consequently the mitochondrion against oxidative damage. Published by

   initiating role in the development of the autoimmune neuropathy,
   Guillain-Barre syndrome, by induction of anti-neural cross-reactive
   antibodies through ganglioside molecular mimicry.
   Results: Herein we describe the existence and heterogeneity of multiple
   LOS forms in C. jejuni strains of human and chicken origin grown at 37
   degrees C and 42 degrees C, respectively, as determined on sodium
   dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels with
   carbohydrate-specific silver staining and blotting with anti-ganglioside
   ligands, and confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
   The C. jejuni NCTC 11168 original isolate (11168-O) was compared to its
   genome-sequenced variant (11168-GS), and both were found to have a
   lower-M(r) LOS form, which was different in size and structure to the
   previously characterized higher-M(r) form bearing GM(1) mimicry. The
   lower-M(r) form production was found to be dependent on the growth
   temperature as the production of this form increased from similar to
   5\%, observed at 37 degrees C to similar to 35\% at 42 degrees C. The
   structure of the lower-M(r) form contained a beta-D-Gal-(1 ->
   3)-beta-D-GalNAc disaccharide moiety which is consistent with the
   termini of the GM(1), asialo-GM(1), GD(1), GT(1) and GQ(1) gangliosides,
   however, it did not display GM(1) mimicry as assessed in blotting
   studies but was shown in NMR to resemble asialo-GM(1). The production of
   multiple LOS forms and lack of GM(1) mimicry was not a result of phase
   variation in the genes tested of NCTC 11168 and was also observed in
   most of the human and chicken isolates of C. jejuni tested.
   Conclusion: The presence of differing amounts of LOS forms at 37 and 42
   degrees C, and the variety of forms observed in different strains,
   indicate that LOS form variation may play a role in an adaptive
   mechanism or a stress response of the bacterium during the colonization
   of different hosts.}},

Title = {{Osmosis-induced swelling of Eurobitum bituminized radioactive waste in
   constant total stress conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{406}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{304-316}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{In geological disposal conditions, contact of Eurobitum bituminized
   radioactive waste, which contains high amounts of the hygroscopic and
   highly soluble NaNO(3), with groundwater will result in water uptake and
   swelling of the waste, and in subsequent leaching of the embedded
   NaNO(3) and radionuclides. The swelling of and the NaNO(3) leaching from
   non-radioactive Eurobitum samples, comprised between two stainless steel
   filters and in contact with 0.1 M KOH, was studied in restricted
   (semi-confined) swelling conditions, i.e. under a constant total stress,
   or counterpressure, of 2.2, 3.3, or 4.4 MPa (i.e. oedometer conditions).
   Four tests were stopped after hydration times between 800 and 1500 days,
   and the samples were analyzed by micro-focus X-ray Computer Tomography
   (mu CT) and by Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM). The
   complete set of data enabled a consistent interpretation of the
   observations and lead to an improved understanding of the phenomenology
   of the water uptake, swelling, and NaNO(3) leaching in restricted
   swelling conditions. Under the studied conditions, the bituminous matrix
   surrounding the NaNO(3) crystals and pores with NaNO(3) solution behaved
   as a highly efficient semipermeable membrane, i.e. osmotic processes
   occurred. In the main part of the leached layers, a high average NaNO(3)
   concentration and related to this a high osmotic pressure prevailed,
   explaining why in the studied range the swelling was not measurably
   affected by the counterpressure. At the interface with the stainless
   steel filters, a low permeable re-compressed bitumen layer was formed,
   contributing to the slow release of NaNO(3) compared to the water uptake
   rate. A fully coupled Chemo-Hydro-Mechanical (CHM) constitutive model
   has been developed that integrates the key processes involved and that
   reproduces satisfactorily the results; this is presented in another
   work. Combination of the experimental and the modelling study allow to
   conclude that under semi-confined conditions the swelling of the
   bituminized waste, and its evolution with time, is the result of several
   transient processes (salts dissolution, diffusion of salts and water,
   advection, creep, involving a low permeability material with evolving
   thickness and properties) that moreover are non-linear and strongly
   coupled. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we have synthesized high quality TiO2 nanocrystallites by
   sol-gel method (TiO2 white (w)) and compared its properties with the
   ones synthesized by the simple hydrolysis method in aqueous solution
   (TiO2 transparent (t)). The TiO2/MEH-PPV nanocomposites are formed
   mainly by two ways: (i) Prepared in the form of the colloidal solution
   by adding the known concentration of the TiO2 in MEH-PPV and then
   sonicate it well; (ii) In the thin film form by depositing the above
   solution over a glass substrate by spin coating. The properties of the
   resulting dispersions could be tailored by varying the composition and
   concentration of TiO2 nanoparticles in CP's. The TiO2 nanoparticles
   prepared by both methods show anatase character of TiO2 as elucidated by
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM)
   studies reveal that the transparent colloidal suspension of TiO2
   exhibits agglomeration of TiO2 nanoparticles (size similar to 150-300
   nm) and this trend is maintained in the MEH-PPV matrix for TiO2/MEH-PPV
   composites as well. However, the composite obtained by mixing MEH-PPV
   with sol-gel prepared TiO2(w) shows uniform nanoscale dispersion of TiO2
   (size similar to 20 nm) in MEH-PPV matrix. The UV-VIS absorption,
   photoluminescence (PL) and lifetime studies confirm the presence of
   dynamic quenching effect indicating efficient photoinduced charge
   transfer in TiO2/MEH-PPV hybrid composites particularly with white TiO2.
   It is conjectured that the devices containing TiO2/MEH-PPV composites
   for TiO2 prepared by the sol-gel method should lead to significant
   improvement in the photovoltaic performance of TiO2/MEH-PPV hybrid solar
   cells. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Uncoupling of complex regulatory patterning during evolution of larval
   development in echinoderms}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Conservation of orthologous regulatory gene expression
   domains, especially along the neuroectodermal anterior-posterior axis,
   in animals as disparate as flies and vertebrates suggests that common
   patterning mechanisms have been conserved since the base of Bilateria.
   The homology of axial patterning is far less clear for the many marine
   animals that undergo a radical transformation in body plan during
   metamorphosis. The embryos of these animals are microscopic, feeding
   within the plankton until they metamorphose into their adult forms.
   Results: We describe here the localization of 14 transcription factors
   within the ectoderm during early embryogenesis in Patiria miniata, a sea
   star with an indirectly developing planktonic bipinnaria larva. We find
   that the animal-vegetal axis of this very simple embryo is surprisingly
   well patterned. Furthermore, the patterning that we observe throughout
   the ectoderm generally corresponds to that of ``head/anterior brain{''}
   patterning known for hemichordates and vertebrates, which share a common
   ancestor with the sea star. While we suggest here that aspects of
   head/anterior brain patterning are generally conserved, we show that
   another suite of genes involved in retinal determination is absent from
   the ectoderm of these echinoderms and instead operates within the
   mesoderm.
   Conclusions: Our findings therefore extend, for the first time, evidence
   of a conserved axial pattering to echinoderm embryos exhibiting maximal
   indirect development. The dissociation of head/anterior brain patterning
   from ``retinal specification{''} in echinoderm blastulae might reflect
   modular changes to a developmental gene regulatory network within the
   ectoderm that facilitates the evolution of these microscopic larvae.}},

Title = {{A Dynamic Analysis of Tuberculosis Dissemination to Improve Control and
   Surveillance}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Detailed analysis of the dynamic interactions among
   biological, environmental, social, and economic factors that favour the
   spread of certain diseases is extremely useful for designing effective
   control strategies. Diseases like tuberculosis that kills somebody every
   15 seconds in the world, require methods that take into account the
   disease dynamics to design truly efficient control and surveillance
   strategies. The usual and well established statistical approaches
   provide insights into the cause-effect relationships that favour disease
   transmission but they only estimate risk areas, spatial or temporal
   trends. Here we introduce a novel approach that allows figuring out the
   dynamical behaviour of the disease spreading. This information can
   subsequently be used to validate mathematical models of the
   dissemination process from which the underlying mechanisms that are
   responsible for this spreading could be inferred.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The method presented here is based on
   the analysis of the spread of tuberculosis in a Brazilian endemic city
   during five consecutive years. The detailed analysis of the
   spatio-temporal correlation of the yearly geo-referenced data, using
   different characteristic times of the disease evolution, allowed us to
   trace the temporal path of the aetiological agent, to locate the sources
   of infection, and to characterize the dynamics of disease spreading.
   Consequently, the method also allowed for the identification of
   socio-economic factors that influence the process.
   Conclusions/Significance: The information obtained can contribute to
   more effective budget allocation, drug distribution and recruitment of
   human skilled resources, as well as guiding the design of vaccination
   programs. We propose that this novel strategy can also be applied to the
   evaluation of other diseases as well as other social processes.}},

Abstract = {{We construct and analyze a microscopic model for insulating rocksalt
   ordered double perovskites, with the chemical formula A(2)BB'O-6, where
   the B' atom has a 4d(1) or 5d(1) electronic configuration and forms a
   face-centered-cubic lattice. The combination of the triply degenerate
   t(2g) orbital and strong spin-orbit coupling forms local quadruplets
   with an effective spin moment j=3/2. Moreover, due to strongly
   orbital-dependent exchange, the effective spins have substantial
   biquadratic and bicubic interactions (fourth and sixth order in the
   spins, respectively). This leads, at the mean-field level, to three main
   phases: an unusual antiferromagnet with dominant octupolar order, a
   ferromagnetic phase with magnetization along the {[}110] direction, and
   a nonmagnetic but quadrupolar ordered phase, which is stabilized by
   thermal fluctuations and intermediate temperatures. All these phases
   have a two-sublattice structure described by the ordering wave vector
   Q=2 pi(001). We consider quantum fluctuations and argue that in the
   regime of dominant antiferromagnetic exchange, a nonmagnetic
   valence-bond solid or quantum-spin-liquid state may be favored instead.
   Candidate quantum-spin-liquid states and their basic properties are
   described. We also address the effect of single-site anisotropy driven
   by lattice distortions. Existing and possible future experiments are
   discussed in light of these results.}},

Title = {{Human Herpesvirus-8 Infection Leads to Expansion of the
   Preimmune/Natural Effector B Cell Compartment}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) is the etiological agent of
   Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and of some lymphoproliferative disorders of B
   cells. Most malignancies develop after long-lasting viral dormancy, and
   a preventing role for both humoral and cellular immune control is
   suggested by the high frequency of these pathologies in immunosuppressed
   patients. B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells of peripheral
   lymphoid organs and blood represent the major reservoir of HHV-8. Due to
   the dual role of B cells in HHV-8 infection, both as virus reservoir and
   as agents of humoral immune control, we analyzed the subset distribution
   and the functional state of peripheral blood B cells in HHV-8-infected
   individuals with and without cKS.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Circulating B cells and their subsets
   were analyzed by 6-color flow cytometry in the following groups: 1-
   patients HHV-8 positive with classic KS (cKS) (n = 47); 2- subjects
   HHV-8 positive and cKS negative (HSP) (n = 10); 3- healthy controls,
   HHV-8 negative and cKS negative (HC) (n = 43). The number of B cells
   belonging to the preimmune/natural effector compartment, including
   transitional, pre-naive, naive and MZ-like subsets, was significantly
   higher among HHV-8 positive subjects, with or without cKS, while was
   comparable to healthy controls in the antigen-experienced T-cell
   dependent compartment. The increased number of preimmune/natural
   effector B cells was associated with increased resistance to spontaneous
   apoptosis, while it did not correlate with HHV-8 viral load.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate that long-lasting HHV-8
   infection promotes an imbalance in peripheral B cell subsets, perturbing
   the equilibrium between earlier and later steps of maturation and
   activation processes. This observation may broaden our understanding of
   the complex interplay between viral and immune factors leading
   HHV-8-infected individuals to develop HHV-8-associated malignancies.}},

Title = {{Functional and Pathogenic Differences of Th1 and Th17 Cells in
   Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: There is consensus that experimental autoimmune
   encephalomyelitis (EAE) can be mediated by myelin specific T cells of
   Th1 as well as of Th17 phenotype, but the contribution of either subset
   to the pathogenic process has remained controversial. In this report, we
   compare functional differences and pathogenic potential of
   ``monoclonal{''} T cell lines that recognize myelin oligodendrocyte
   glycoprotein (MOG) with the same transgenic TCR but are distinguished by
   an IFN-gamma producing Th1-like and IL-17 producing Th17-like cytokine
   signature.
   Methods and Findings: CD4(+) T cell lines were derived from the
   transgenic mouse strain 2D2, which expresses a TCR recognizing MOG
   peptide 35-55 in the context of I-A(b). Adoptive transfer of Th1 cells
   into lymphopenic (Rag2(-/-)) recipients, predominantly induced
   ``classic{''} paralytic EAE, whereas Th17 cells mediated ``atypical{''}
   ataxic EAE in approximately 50\% of the recipient animals. Combination
   of Th1 and Th17 cells potentiated the encephalitogenicity inducing
   classical EAE exclusively. Th1 and Th17 mediated EAE lesions differed in
   their composition but not in their localization within the CNS. While
   Th1 lesions contained IFN-gamma, but no IL-17 producing T cells, the T
   cells in Th17 lesions showed plasticity, substantially converting to
   IFN-gamma producing Th1-like cells. Th1 and Th17 cells differed
   drastically by their lytic potential. Th1 but not Th17 cells lysed
   autoantigen presenting astrocytes and fibroblasts in vitro in a
   contact-dependent manner. In contrast, Th17 cells acquired cytotoxic
   potential only after antigenic stimulation and conversion to IFN-gamma
   producing Th1 phenotype.
   Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that both Th1 and Th17 lineages
   possess the ability to induce CNS autoimmunity but can function with
   complementary as well as differential pathogenic mechanisms. We propose
   that Th17-like cells producing IL-17 are required for the generation of
   atypical EAE whereas IFN-gamma producing Th1 cells induce classical EAE.}},

Abstract = {{Evapotranspiration is an important hydrological process and its
   estimation usually needs measurements of many weather variables such as
   atmospheric pressure, wind speed, air temperature, net radiation and
   relative humidity. Those weather variables are not easily obtainable
   from in situ measurements in practical water resources projects. This
   study explored a potential application of downscaled global reanalysis
   weather data using mesoscale modelling system 5 (MM5). The MM5 is able
   to downscale the global data down to much finer resolutions in space and
   time for use in hydrological investigations. In this study, the ERA-40
   reanalysis data are downscaled to the Brue catchment in southwest
   England. The results are compared with the observation data. Among the
   studied weather variables, atmospheric pressure could be derived very
   accurately with less than 0.2\% error. On the other hand, the error in
   wind speed is about 200-400\%. The errors in other weather variables are
   air temperature (<10\%), relative humidity (5-21\%) and net radiation
   (4-23\%). The downscaling process generally improves the data quality
   (except wind speed) and provides higher data resolution in comparison
   with the original reanalysis data. The evapotranspiration values
   estimated from the downscaled data are significantly overestimated
   across all the seasons (27-46\%) based on the FAO Penman-Monteith
   equation. The dominant weather variables are net radiation (during the
   warm period) and relative humidity (during the cold period). There are
   clear patterns among some weather variables and they could be used to
   correct the biases in the downscaled data from either short-term in situ
   measurements or through regionalization from surrounding weather
   stations. Artificial intelligence tools could be used to map the
   downscaled data directly into evapotranspiration or even river runoff if
   rainfall data are available. This study provides hydrologists with
   valuable information on downscaled weather variables and further
   exploration of this potentially valuable data source by the hydrological
   community should be encouraged. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons,

Title = {{Helicobacter pylori from Peruvian Amerindians: Traces of Human
   Migrations in Strains from Remote Amazon, and Genome Sequence of an
   Amerind Strain}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Background: The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is extraordinary in
   its genetic diversity, the differences between strains from
   well-separated human populations, and the range of diseases that
   infection promotes.
   Principal Findings: Housekeeping gene sequences from H. pylori from
   residents of an Amerindian village in the Peruvian Amazon, Shimaa, were
   related to, but not intermingled with, those from Asia. This suggests
   descent of Shimaa strains from H. pylori that had infected the people
   who migrated from Asia into The Americas some 15,000+ years ago. In
   contrast, European type sequences predominated in strains from
   Amerindian Lima shantytown residents, but with some 12\% Amerindian or
   East Asian-like admixture, which indicates displacement of ancestral
   purely Amerindian strains by those of hybrid or European ancestry. The
   genome of one Shimaa village strain, Shi470, was sequenced completely.
   Its SNP pattern was more Asian-than European-like genome-wide,
   indicating a purely Amerind ancestry. Among its unusual features were
   two cagA virulence genes, each distinct from those known from elsewhere;
   and a novel allele of gene hp0519, whose encoded protein is postulated
   to interact with host tissue. More generally, however, the Shi470 genome
   is similar in gene content and organization to those of strains from
   industrialized countries.
   Conclusions: Our data indicate that Shimaa village H. pylori descend
   from Asian strains brought to The Americas many millennia ago; and that
   Amerind strains are less fit than, and were substantially displaced by,
   hybrid or European strains in less isolated communities. Genome
   comparisons of H. pylori from Amerindian and other communities should
   help elucidate evolutionary forces that have shaped pathogen populations
   in The Americas and worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{Biosensors with increasingly high sensitivity are crucial for probing
   small scale properties. The asynchronous magnetic bead rotation (AMBR)
   sensor is an emerging sensor platform, based on magnetically actuated
   rotation. Here the frequency dependence of the AMBR sensor's sensitivity
   is investigated. An asynchronous rotation frequency of 145 Hz is
   achieved. This increased frequency will allow for a calculated detection
   limit of as little as a 59 nm change in bead diameter, which is a
   dramatic improvement over previous AMBR sensors and further enables
   physical and biomedical applications. (C) 2010 American Institute of

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Volume = {{82}},

Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{We study a model of a lattice gas with orientational degrees of freedom
   which resemble the formation of hydrogen bonds between the molecules. In
   this model, which is the simplified version of the Henriques-Barbosa
   model, no distinction is made between donors and acceptors in the
   bonding arms. We solve the model in the grand-canonical ensemble on a
   Husimi lattice built with hexagonal plaquettes with a central site. The
   ground state of the model, which was originally defined on the
   triangular lattice, is exactly reproduced by the solution on this Husimi
   lattice. In the phase diagram, one gas and two liquid {[}high density
   liquid (HDL) and low density liquid (LDL)] phases are present. All phase
   transitions (GAS-LDL, GAS-HDL, and LDL-HDL) are discontinuous, and the
   three phases coexist at a triple point. A line of temperatures of
   maximum density in the isobars is found in the metastable GAS phase, as
   well as another line of temperatures of minimum density appears in the
   LDL phase, part of it in the stable region and another in the metastable
   region of this phase. These findings are at variance with simulational
   results for the same model on the triangular lattice, which suggested a
   phase diagram with two critical points. However, our results show very
   good quantitative agreement with the simulations, both for the
   coexistence loci and the densities of particles and of hydrogen bonds.
   We discuss the comparison of the simulations with our results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the p-maxian problem on interval graphs where each
   interval has a positive weight. First we propose a linear time algorithm
   which is similar to the algorithm of Bespamyatnikh for the unweighted
   1-median problem on interval graphs to solve the weighted 1-maxian
   problem. For a 2-maxian problem, we show that two intervals with the
   minimum right endpoint and the maximum left endpoint, respectively, are
   an optimal solution. It can be easily extended to the p-maxian problem
   (p >= 3). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper is a continuation of the author's work (Hachenberger
   (2001) {[}3]) on primitivity and complete normality. For certain 2-power
   extensions E over a Galois field F-q, we are going to establish the
   existence of a primitive element which simultaneously generates a normal
   basis over every intermediate field of E/F-q. The main result is as
   follows: Let q equivalent to 3 mod 4 and let m(q) >= 3 be the largest
   integer such that 2(m(q)) divides q(2) - 1; if E = F-q21, where l >=
   m(q) + 3, then there exists a primitive element in E that is completely
   normal over F-q.
   Our method not only shows existence but also gives a fairly large lower
   bound on the number of primitive completely normal elements. In the
   above case this number is at least 4. (q - 1)(21-2). We are further
   going to discuss lower bounds on the number of such elements in r-power
   extensions, where r = 2 and q equivalent to 1 mod 4, or where r is an
   odd prime, or where r is equal to the characteristic of the underlying
   field. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{A general theoretical framework of two-dimensional time-domain
   second-order and third-order terahertz spectroscopy has been presented.
   The theoretical treatment is based on a classical and phenomenological
   model with weak nonlinearities. Three types of nonlinearity sources,
   anharmonicity, nonlinear coupling, and nonlinear damping, were
   considered. The second-order THz spectroscopy has an exact
   correspondence to fifth-order off-resonance Raman spectroscopy, and it
   has been shown that the present treatment gives exactly the same results
   as of the quantum mechanical theory under the weak nonlinearity
   condition. General expressions for the nonlinear signal have been
   obtained for a single-mode system, and numerical calculations for
   delta-function incident terahertz pulses were shown. For the third-order
   signal, two-level systems were also considered for comparison.
   Contributions of two types of incident pulse sequences have been studied
   separately in the third-order signals. Profiles of the two-dimensional
   signals were found to depend on the origin and order of the nonlinearity
   and also on the pulse sequence. The results of the present study show
   that the two-dimensional signal features of second-and third-order
   nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy can clarify the nature of the system
   which is not accessible using linear spectroscopy. (C) 2010 American

Abstract = {{The eastern Mediterranean faces a severe water crisis: water supply
   decreases due to climate change, while demand increases due to rapid
   population growth. The GLOWA Jordan River project generates
   science-based management strategies for maximizing water productivity
   under global climate change. We use a novel definition of water
   productivity as the full range of services provided by landscapes per
   unit blue (surface) and green (in plants and soil) water. Our combined
   results from climatological, ecological, economic and hydrological
   studies suggest that, in Israel, certain landscapes provide high returns
   as ecosystem services for little input of additional blue water.
   Specifically, cultural services such as recreation may by far exceed
   that of food production. Interestingly, some highly valued landscapes
   (e. g. rangeland) appear resistant to climate change, making them an
   ideal candidate for adaptive land management. Vice versa, expanding
   irrigated agriculture is unlikely to be sustainable under global climate
   change. We advocate the inclusion of a large range of ecosystem services
   into integrated land and water resources management. The focus on
   cultural services and integration of irrigation demand will lead to
   entirely different but productive water and land allocation schemes that
   may be suitable for withstanding the problems caused by climate change.}},

Abstract = {{The virulence properties of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli

   serotypes, using PCR and conventional serotyping methods. E coli strains
   isolated from 297 faecal samples, from 200 diarrhoeic and 97
   non-diarrhoeic calves, were screened by multiplex PCR assay for the
   stxt, stx2, eoe and Ehly virulence genes. STECs were recovered from 8
   per cent of diarrhoeic calves and 10.3 per cent of non-diarrhoeic
   calves. The predominant virulence gene profile was stxl/eae/Ehly (47.3
   per cent) among isolates from diarrhoeic calves and eae/Ehly (36.8 per
   cent) among isolates from non-diarrhoeic calves. Among three tested
   serogroups, the predominant serogroup was 026 (18.4 per cent), and
   0157:H7 was not detected. Intimin subtyping by restriction fragment
   length polymorphism analysis revealed only three intinnin subtypes
   (beta, gamma and theta). A significant difference was observed in the
   distribution of Int-theta between two groups. Int-theta was present in
   50 per cent of the isolates from diarrhoeic calves and in 11.1 per cent
   of the isolates from non-diarrhoeic calves; this difference was
   statistically significant (P=0.01).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy
   regimens, it is crucial to consider their long-term benefits to risk
   ratios among HIV-infected persons. The impact of protease inhibitors on
   the cardiovascular risk is controversial.
   Design: This observational cohort was designed to investigate the
   cardiovascular impact of boosted atazanavir (ATV/r), a protease
   inhibitor that does not provide major dyslipidemia or insulin
   resistance.
   Setting: This study was carried out at the University Hospital of Brest
   (France).
   Patients: Among the 229 HIV-infected persons of the cohort, 33 cases
   treated by ATV/r-containing regimen since less than 6 months were
   compared to 99 age-matched and sex-matched ATV/r naive controls.
   Intervention: None.
   Main outcome measure: The main outcome measure was carotid intima-media
   thickness (cIMT) at the baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months.
   Results: Although the cIMT was not different at inclusion (0.633 +/-
   0.05 vs. 0.666 +/- 0.09, P = 0.07), the cIMT course significantly
   decreased (P = 0.018) in cases at 18 months. The differences remained
   significant even after adjustment on the variables that differed between
   cases and controls (P < 0.1) at inclusion (high-density lipoprotein
   cholestrol, cardiovascular family history) and the cumulated and current
   exposure to the nucleosidic reverse transcriptase inhibitor,
   nonnucleosidic reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and protease inhibitor
   class.
   Conclusion: Despite similar HIV and cardiovascular characteristics at
   baseline, cIMT decreased after 6 months of follow-up among the patients
   exposed to ATV/r, even after adjustment for the exposure to the three
   antiretroviral classes. Considering the short-comings of this study,
   especially the absence of randomization and the heterogeneity of the
   control group, the benefit of ATV/r treatment in patients with high
   cardiovascular should be confirmed by randomized trials. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Background. There has been a marked recent increase in the proportion of
   kidneys transplanted from live donors (LD) and donors after cardiac
   death (DCD) compared with donors after brain death (DBD). The purpose of
   this study was to compare the incidence of major urologic complications
   (MUCs: urinary leak and ureteric stenosis {[}US]) in kidney transplants
   procured from LD, DCD, and DBD and to identify the factors associated
   with MUCs.
   Methods. We studied 901 consecutive renal transplants (LD: 181, DCD:
   198, and DBD: 522) performed in the Cambridge Transplant Centre during
   1998 to 2008 by retrieving data from a prospective, cross-audited
   database, and detailed case note review. An ureteroneocystostomy over a
   double pigtail ureteric stent was performed in all transplants, and
   ureteric stents were removed after approximately 6 weeks. All ureteric
   stenoses were treated by surgical reconstruction.
   Results. Three patients developed urine leak, and 21 developed US. There
   was no significant difference in the incidence of US in kidneys
   retrieved from LD (2.8\%), DBD (1.7\%), or DCD (3.5\%; P=0.28).
   Recipients with US had a higher incidence of acute rejection (48\% vs.
   27\%; hazard ratio 3.2, P=0.005) and urinary tract infections before the
   diagnosis of US (48\% vs. 19\%; hazard ratio 3.0, P=0.01). The incidence
   of delayed graft function (38\% vs. 26\%), cold ischemia times (12.9 vs.
   13.5 hr), and graft survival was not significantly associated with US.
   Conclusions. The incidence of MUCs is similar in kidneys transplanted
   from LD, DCD, and DBD. When complications do occur, they can be treated
   successfully by surgical reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{In this work a fast solver for large-scale three-dimensional
   elastodynamic crack problems is presented, implemented, and tested. The
   dual boundary element method in the Laplace transform domain is used for
   the accurate dynamic analysis of cracked bodies. The fast solution
   procedure is based on the use of hierarchical matrices for the
   representation of the collocation matrix for each computed value of the
   Laplace parameter. An ACA (adaptive cross approximation) algorithm is
   used for the population of the low rank blocks and its performance at
   varying Laplace parameters is investigated. A preconditioned GMRES is
   used for the solution of the resulting algebraic system of equations.
   The preconditioners are built exploiting the hierarchical arithmetic and
   taking full advantage of the hierarchical format. An original strategy,
   based on the computation of some local preconditioners only, is
   presented and tested to further speed up the overall analysis. The
   reported numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   technique for both uncracked and cracked solids and show significant
   reductions in terms of both memory storage and computational time.

Abstract = {{Accumulating evidence implicates nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide
   phosphate (NAADP) in the control of Ca2+-dependent functions. Little,
   however, is known concerning its role in the vascular endothelium, a
   major regulator of blood pressure. Here, we show that NAADP
   acetoxymethyl ester (NAADP-AM), a cell-permeant NAADP analog, increases
   cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in aortic endothelial cells. We demonstrate
   that these signals and those evoked by acetylcholine are blocked by
   disrupting acidic organelles with bafilomycin A1. In contrast, Ca2+
   signals in response to thrombin are only partially inhibited by
   bafilomycin A1 treatment, and those to ATP were insensitive, suggesting
   that recruitment of acidic stores is agonist-specific. We further show
   that NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signals hyperpolarize endothelial cells and
   generate NO. Additionally, we demonstrate that NAADP dilates aortic
   rings in an endothelium- and NO-dependent manner. Finally, we show that
   intravenous administration of NAADP-AM into anesthetized rats decreases
   mean arterial pressure. Our data extend the actions of NAADP to the
   endothelium both in vitro and in vivo, pointing to a previously
   unrecognized role for this messenger in controlling blood pressure.}},

Title = {{Bipartite entanglement in continuous variable cluster states}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{A study of the entanglement properties of Gaussian cluster states,
   proposed as a universal resource for continuous variable (CV) quantum
   computing is presented in this paper. The central aim is to compare
   mathematically idealized cluster states defined using quadrature
   eigenstates, which have infinite squeezing and cannot exist in nature,
   with Gaussian approximations that are experimentally accessible.
   Adopting widely used definitions, we first review the key concepts, by
   analysing a process of teleportation along a CV quantum wire in the
   language of matrix product states. Next we consider the bipartite
   entanglement properties of the wire, providing analytic results. We
   proceed to grid cluster states, which are universal for the qubit case.
   To extend our analysis of the bipartite entanglement, we adopt the
   entropic-entanglement width, a specialized entanglement measure
   introduced recently by Van den Nest et al (2006 Phys. Rev. Lett. 97
   150504), adapting their definition to the CV context. Finally, we
   consider the effects of photonic loss, extending our arguments to mixed
   states. Cumulatively our results point to key differences in the
   properties of idealized and Gaussian cluster states. Even modest loss
   rates are found to strongly limit the amount of entanglement. We discuss
   the implications for the potential of CV analogues for measurement-based
   quantum computation.}},

Abstract = {{Protein aggregation is a hallmark of many neuronal disorders, including
   the polyglutamine disorder spinocerebellar ataxia 3 and peripheral
   neuropathies associated with the K141E and K141N mutations in the small
   heat shock protein HSPB8. In cells, HSPB8 cooperates with BAG3 to
   stimulate autophagy in an eIF2 alpha-dependent manner and facilitates
   the clearance of aggregate-prone proteins (Carra, S., Seguin, S. J.,
   Lambert, H., and Landry, J. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 1437-1444; Carra,
   S., Brunsting, J. F., Lambert, H., Landry, J., and Kampinga, H. H.
   (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 5523-5532). Here, we first identified
   Drosophila melanogaster HSP67Bc (Dm-HSP67Bc) as the closest functional
   ortholog of human HSPB8 and demonstrated that, like human HSPB8,
   Dm-HSP67Bc induces autophagy via the eIF2 alpha pathway. In vitro, both
   Dm-HSP67Bc and human HSPB8 protected against mutated ataxin-3-mediated
   toxicity and decreased the aggregation of a mutated form of HSPB1
   (P182L-HSPB1) associated with peripheral neuropathy. Upregulation of
   both Dm-HSP67Bc and human HSPB8 protected and down-regulation of
   endogenous Dm-HSP67Bc significantly worsened SCA3-mediated eye
   degeneration in flies. The K141E and K141N mutated forms of human HSPB8
   that are associated with peripheral neuropathy were significantly less
   efficient than wild-type HSPB8 in decreasing the aggregation of both
   mutated ataxin 3 and P182L-HSPB1. Our current data further support the
   link between the HSPB8-BAG3 complex, autophagy, and folding diseases and
   demonstrate that impairment or loss of function of HSPB8 might
   accelerate the progression and/or severity of folding diseases.}},

Title = {{Determinants of the intention of elementary school nurses to adopt a
   redefined role in health promotion at school}},
Journal = {{IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: The quest for greater efficiency in the provision of primary
   healthcare services and the implementation of a ``health-promoting
   school{''} approach encourage the optimal redefinition of the role of
   school nurses. School nurses are viewed as professionals who might be
   significant actors in the promotion of youth health. The aim of this
   study was to identify the determinants of the intention of elementary
   school nurses to adopt a new health-promotion role as a strategic option
   for the health-promoting school.
   Methods: This study was based on an extended version of the theory of
   planned behaviour (TPB). A total of 251 respondents (response rate of
   70\%) from 42 school health programs across the Province of Quebec
   completed a mail survey regarding their intention to adopt the proposed
   health-promotion role. Multiple hierarchical linear regression analyses
   were performed to assess the relationship between key independent
   variables and intention. A discriminant analysis of the beliefs was
   performed to identify the main targets of action.
   Results: A total of 73\% of respondents expressed a positive intention
   to accept to play the proposed role. The main predictors were perceived
   behavioural control (beta = 0.36), moral norm (beta = 0.27), attitude
   (beta = 0.24), and subjective norm (beta = 0.21) (ps < .0001),
   explaining 83\% of the variance. The underlying beliefs distinguishing
   nurses who had a high intention from those who had a low intention
   referred to their feelings of being valued, their capacity to overcome
   the nursing shortage, the approval of the school nurses' community and
   parents of the students, their leadership skills, and their gaining of a
   better understanding of school needs.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that leadership is a skill that should be
   addressed to increase the ability of school nurses to assume the
   proposed role. Findings also indicate that public health administrators
   need to ensure adequate nurse staffing in the schools in order to
   increase the proportion of nurses willing to play such a role and avoid
   burnout among these human resources.}},

Abstract = {{Formally annotated pi-helices are rare in protein structures but have
   been correlated with functional sites. Here, we analyze protein
   structures to show that pi-helices are the same as structures known as
   alpha-bulges, alpha-aneurisms, pi-bulges, and looping outs, and are
   evolutionarily derived by the insertion of a single residue into an
   alpha-helix. This newly discovered evolutionary origin explains both why
   pi-helices are cryptic, being rarely annotated despite occurring in 15\%
   of known proteins, and why they tend to be associated with function. An
   analysis of pi-helices in the diverse ferritin-like superfamily
   illustrates their tendency to be conserved in protein families and
   identifies a putative pi-helix-containing primordial precursor, a
   ``missing link{''} intermediary form of the ribonucleotide reductase
   family, vestigial pi-helices, and a novel function for pi-helices that
   we term a ``peristaltic-like shift.{''} This new understanding of
   pi-helices paves the way for this generally overlooked motif to become a
   noteworthy feature that will aid in tracing the evolution of many
   protein families, guide investigations of protein and pi-helix
   functionality, and contribute additional tools to the protein
   engineering toolkit. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anglotensin II (Ang II) one of the main vasoactive hormones of the
   renin-angiotensin system contributes to the development and progression
   of atherosclerosis by inducing vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)
   migration Although previous studies have shown that Ang II upregulates
   low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) expression in
   VSMCs and increases VSMCs migration the role of LRP1 in Ang II-induced
   VSMCs migration remains unclear Here we reveal a novel mechanism by
   which LRP1 induces the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2)
   and thereby promotes the migration of rat aortic SMCs (RAoSMCs)
   Knockdown of LRP1 expression greatly decreased RAoSMCs migration which
   was rescued by forced expression of a functional LRP1 minireceptor
   suggesting that LRP1 is a key regulator of Ang II-induced RAoSMCs
   migration Inhibition of ligand binding to LRP1 by the specific
   antagonist receptor-associated protein (RAP) also led to reduced RAoSMCs
   migration Because MMPs play critical roles in RAoSMCs migration we
   examined the expression of several MMPs and found that the expression of
   functional MMP2 was selectively increased by Ang II treatment and
   decreased in LRP1-knockdown RAoSMCs More interestingly reduced MMP2
   expression in LRP1-knockdown cells was completely rescued by exogenous
   expression of mLRP4 suggesting that MMP2 is a downstream regulator of
   LRP1 in Ang II-induced RAoSMCs migration Together our data strongly
   suggest that LRP1 promotes the migration of RAoSMCs by regulating the
   expression and function of MMP2 (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights

Abstract = {{Speleothems are increasingly used as an archive of past climate but some
   of the proxy signals encoded in these deposits reflect hydrological
   characteristics of the karst aquifer (and not necessarily climate
   variability) A central aspect in karst hydrology is the time required
   for the rainwater to reach the point of discharge in a cave e g the tip
   of the stalactite One promising approach in determining this residence
   time is drip-water dating by tritium (H-3) In contrast to traditional
   tritium dating we do not refer directly to tritium concentrations in
   precipitation as input function but to an infiltration-weighted annual
   mean of the rainwater values Using concentration differences between
   this infiltration-weighted mean and the drip water an age is calculated
   from the radioactive decay law assuming piston flow
   The approach was tested in three adjacent caves in northwestern Germany
   which were monitored for about two years All of the studied drip sites
   yielded drip water ages between 2 and 4 years with uncertainties on the
   order of 1 year These results were confirmed at several drip sites by
   oxygen isotope data which show rather constant values with insignificant
   intra-annual variability Attempts to apply the H-3-He-3 method resulted
   in comparable ages despite several complicating factors (C) 2010

Title = {{DNA Methyltransferase 1-associated Protein (DMAP1) Is a Co-repressor

Abstract = {{Correction of double strand DNA breaks proceeds in an error-free pathway
   of homologous recombination (HR), which can result in gene silencing of
   half of the DNA molecules caused by action by DNA methyltransferase 1
   (DNMT1) (Cuozzo, C., Porcellini, A., Angrisano, T., Morano, A., Lee, B.,
   Di Pardo, A., Messina, S., Iuliano, R., Fusco, A., Santillo, M. R.,
   Muller, M. T., Chiariotti, L., Gottesman, M. E., and Avvedimento, E. V.
   (2007) PLoS Genet. 3, e110). To explore the mechanism that leads to
   HR-induced silencing, a genetic screen was carried out based on the
   silencing of a GFP reporter to identify potential partners. DMAP1, a
   DNMT1 interacting protein, was identified as a mediator of this process.
   DMAP1 is a potent activator of DNMT1 methylation in vitro, suggesting
   that DMAP1 is a corepressor that supports the maintenance and de novo
   action of DNMT1. To examine critical roles for DMAP1 in vivo, lentiviral
   shRNA was used to conditionally reduce cellular DMAP1 levels. The shRNA
   transduced cells grew poorly and eventually ceased their growth.
   Analysis of the tumor suppressor gene p16 methylation status revealed a
   clear reduction in methylated CpGs in the shRNA cells, suggesting that
   reactivation of a tumor suppressor gene pathway caused the slow growth
   phenotype. Analysis of HR, using a fluorescence-based reporter, revealed
   that knocking down DMAP1 also caused hypomethylation of the DNA repair
   products following gene conversion. DMAP1 was selectively enriched in
   recombinant GFP chromatin based on chromatin immunoprecipitation
   analysis. The picture that emerges is that DMAP1 activates DNMT1
   preferentially at sites of HR repair. Because DMAP1 depleted cells
   display enhanced HR, we conclude that it has additional roles in genomic
   stability.}},

Abstract = {{Ga2O3 nanowires (NWs) incorporated into capacitance-based room
   temperature gas sensors were functionalized with acetic and pyruvic acid
   (AC and PA, respectively) with the goal of achieving higher selectivity
   toward different groups of hydrocarbons. Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to determine the geometry of the resulting
   adsorbate complexes. A bridge-like geometry was observed for adsorbed AC
   and a mixture of different geometries for PA, some of which had
   hydrogen-bonded OH groups. In addition, FTIR studies showed evidence of
   the enolic form of PA adsorbed on the surface. The AC-functionalized NWs
   showed a significant decrease in response to such common analytes as
   acetone and nitromethane as well as to triethylamine (TEA). In the case
   of PA-functionalized NWs, no response was observed to nitromethane,
   however, the response to TEA increased one order of magnitude compared
   to the bare NWs. FTIR spectroscopy was used to obtain more insight into
   the mechanism of interaction of AC- and PA-functionalized NWs with these
   analytes. This work demonstrates the use of a bifunctional molecule (PA)
   to modify the response of an oxide sensor in a way that a monofunctional
   molecule (AC) cannot. A significant result of this work is that the
   functionalization chemistry does not presume the existence of OH groups
   on the initial oxide surface. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the existence of bound trion states in
   fractional dimensional nanostructures, in terms of variational calculus.
   We start with trial states, then we refine the result with the help of
   the Hartree-Fock approximation and finally we use a partial basis
   expansion. We show that Hartree-Fock significantly underestimates the
   trion binding energy and that the correlation energy is comparable with
   the trion binding energy. Furthermore we calculate the binding energies
   of positive and negative trions restricted to a large subspace of
   functions, which we expect to span the low-lying eigenstates of the full
   Hamiltonian. We find that the difference between the positive and
   negative trion binding energies varies very little for the electron-hole
   mass fractions m(e)/m(h) = sigma is an element of {[}0.8; 1.0] and that
   the difference between the positive and negative trion energies grows as
   the dimension decreases. Finally, we compare a cylindrical
   effective-mass model of a typical carbon nanotube, with a fractional
   dimensional model with D = 1.71. We find very good agreement between the
   trion binding energies predicted by the two models.}},

   polyphosphoric acid (PPA). The influences of the structural isomers of
   PDA on the PyPBI copolymerization and properties were elucidated by
   characterizing the resulting copolymers. The solubility of PDA monomers
   in PPA and the overall monomer concentration in the polymerization were
   found to be the deciding factors. The higher molecular weight PyPBI were
   obtained for higher para content copolymers due to the low solubility of
   para PDA in PPA. The introduction of para structure had enhanced the
   conjugation along the polymer chain. NMR study showed that the
   reactivity ratio of para PDA was not identical for all the three sets of
   PyPBI copolymers, it varied upon the positions of the dicarboxylic acids
   in the pyridine ring of meta PDAs (structural isomeric effect) with
   which 2,5 PDA is forming the copolymer. Introduction of para structure
   and meta PDAs structural isomers affected the thermal stability,
   flexibility and the photophysical properties of the PyPBI copolymers.

Abstract = {{Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is a common neurodegenerative disorder
   of the aging population characterized by alpha-synuclein accumulation in
   cortical and subcortical regions. Although neuropathology in advanced
   age has been investigated in dementias such as Alzheimer Disease (AD),
   severity of the neuropathology in the oldest old with DLB remains
   uncharacterized. For this purpose we compared characteristics of DLB
   cases divided into three age groups 70-79, 80-89 and >= 90 years (oldest
   old). Neuropathological indicators and levels of synaptophysin were
   assessed and correlated with clinical measurements of cognition and
   dementia severity. These studies showed that frequency and severity of
   DLB was lower in 80-89 and >= 90 year cases compared to 70-79 year old
   group but cognitive impairment did not vary with age. The extent of AD
   neuropathology correlated with dementia severity only in the 70-79 year
   group, while synaptophysin immunoreactivity more strongly associated
   with dementia severity in the older age group in both DLB and AD. Taken
   together these results suggest that the oldest old with DLB might
   represent a distinct group. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An ad hoc network is the assortment of cooperative wireless nodes
   without existence of any access point or infrastructure. Many ad hoc
   network routing protocols have been proposed in the literature. However,
   none of them deal with the issues of security. The presence of malicious
   nodes in an ad hoc network deteriorates the network performance. A novel
   approach for enhanced intrusion detection system for malicious node is
   proposed here to protect against attacks in ad hoc on-demand distance
   vector routing protocol. The proposed approach employs a method for
   determining conditions under which malicious node should be monitored.
   Apart from identification of malicious node, it has been observed that
   this approach leads to less conservation and less communication breakage
   in ad hoc routing. The experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed approach can effectively detect malicious nodes. This approach
   has been found beneficial for identifying malicious nodes in black hole
   attack, neighbour attack, sequence number attack and packet forwarding
   attack up to 700 nodes.}},

Abstract = {{A pan-Nordic dataset of 151 streamflow records was analysed to detect
   spatial and temporal changes in streamflow Prior to undertaking analyses
   all streamflow records with significant levels of autocorrelation were
   pre-whitened to remove the adverse effect of temporal autocorrelation on
   the test results The Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to study
   changes in annual and seasonal streamflow as well as floods and droughts
   for three periods 1920-2005 1941-2005 and 1961-2000 Field significance
   was evaluated to determine the percentage of stations that are expected
   to show a trend due to the effect of cross-correlation The period
   analysed and the selection of stations influenced the regional patterns
   found but the overall picture was that trends of increased streamflow
   dominate annual values and the winter and spring seasons Trends
   identified in summer flows differed between the three periods analysed
   whereas no trend was found for the autumn season In all three periods a
   signal towards earlier snowmelt floods was clear as was the tendency
   towards more severe summer droughts in southern and eastern Norway These
   trends in streamflow result from changes in both temperature and
   precipitation but the temperature induced signal is stronger than
   precipitation influences This is evident because the observed trends in
   winter and spring where snowmelt is the dominant process are greater
   than the annual trends A qualitative comparison of the findings with
   available streamflow projections for the region showed that the
   strongest trends found are generally consistent with future changes
   expected in the projection periods for example increased winter
   discharge and earlier snowmelt floods However there are predicted
   changes that are not reflected in past trends such as the expected
   increase in autumn discharge in Norway Hence the changes expected
   because of increased temperatures are reflected in the observed trends
   whereas changes anticipated due to increases in precipitation are not

   59.5 keV gamma-rays from a Am-241 annular radioactive source. K X-rays
   emitted by samples were counted by an Ultra-LEGe detector with a
   resolution of 150 eV at 5.9 keV. The effect of alloying on the
   fluorescence parameters of Ni and Mo, phase structure, and corrosion
   behavior were investigated. The X-ray fluorescence parameters of Ni and

   enhanced antiviral potency. The trihydroxyphenyl analogue 14 was 30-fold

Abstract = {{The phase diagrams of the ionic liquid (IL) N-butyl-4-methylpyridinium
   bis\{ (trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl\} imide ({[}(BMPy)-Py-4]{[}NTf2]) with
   water, an alcohol (1-butanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, 1-decanol), an
   aromatic hydrocarbon (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, n-propylbenzene),
   an alkane (n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane), or cyclohexane have been
   measured at atmospheric pressure using a dynamic method. This work
   includes the characterization of the synthesized compound by water
   content and also by differential scanning calorimetry. Phase diagrams
   for the binary systems of {[}(BMPy)-Py-4]{[}NTf2] with all solvents
   reveal eutectic systems with regards to (solid-liquid) phase equilibria
   and show immiscibility in the liquid phase region with an upper critical
   solution temperature (UCST) in most of the mixtures. The phase
   equilibria (solid, or liquid liquid) for the binary systems containing
   aliphatic hydrocarbons reported here exhibit the lowest solubility and
   the highest immiscibility gap, a trend which has been observed for all
   ILs. The reduction of experimental data has been carried out using the
   nonrandom two-liquid (NRTL) correlation equation. The phase diagrams
   reported here have been compared with analogous phase diagrams reported
   previously for systems containing the It N-butyl-4-methylpyridinium
   tosylate and other pyridinium-based ILs. The influence of the anion of
   the IL on the phase behavior has been discussed.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient plasma source has been established by arranging a hot
   hollow cathode electron emitter in a strong axial magnetic field,
   allowing for a reduction of working gas flow by one order of magnitude
   without loss of discharge stability. Moreover, with the reduction of gas
   flow not only an increase of the discharge impedance was observed, but
   also a multiplication of ion current density together with a highly
   expanded volume of the plasma plume.
   By means of spatially resolved Langmuir probe measurements, combined
   with the usage of an energy-resolved mass-spectrometer, plasma density
   profiles and energy distribution functions of electrons and ions have
   been measured. Generally, with an increase of the magnetic field and
   with the reduction of the working gas flow ion energy distribution
   functions shift from mean values of a few eV to 10 eV and more, while
   charge carrier densities increase from 10(9) cm(-3) to more than 10(12)
   cm(-3). A strongly increased ability to dissociate and ionize reactive
   gases was observed.
   Two promising applications related to the coating of tools and
   components are discussed: the sputter etching with argon ions and the
   reactive pulse magnetron sputter deposition of wear-resistant chromium
   nitride layers. Whereas the first mentioned process provides pre-heating
   and etching rates higher than all actually used in tool coating
   industry, the second one offers advantages for film growth kinetics
   leading to significant improvements in composition, structure, surface
   morphology, and hardness of the deposited layers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A TaqMan (R) assay for the causative agent of chytridiomycosis in
   amphibians (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) can be inhibited by phenolic
   compounds, including humic and tannic acids, resulting in false
   negatives. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is known to reduce inhibition of
   PCR when samples are contaminated with these inhibitors. We assessed the
   effect of BSA in reducing inhibition of the TaqMan (R) assay when
   analyzing skin swabs for B. dendrobatidis. We found that the addition of
   BSA to the TaqMan (R) reaction reduced inhibition to insignificant
   levels. BSA did not appreciably affect the efficiency or analytical
   sensitivity of the TaqMan (R) reaction in the analysis of standard DNA
   solutions free from environmental inhibitors. We recommend the addition
   of 400 ng mu l(-1) of BSA to the standard TaqMan (R) assay to reduce
   inhibition associated with sampling wild amphibians.}},

Title = {{Mixing by shear instability at high Reynolds number}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Shear instability is the dominant mechanism for converting fluid motion
   to mixing in the stratified ocean and atmosphere. The transition to
   turbulence has been well characterized in laboratory settings and
   numerical simulations at moderate Reynolds number-it involves ``rolling
   up{''}, i.e., overturning of the density structure within the cores of
   the instabilities. In contrast, measurements in an energetic estuarine
   shear zone reveal that the mixing induced by shear instability at high
   Reynolds number does not primarily occur by overturning in the cores;
   rather it results from secondary shear instabilities within the zones of
   intensified shear separating the cores. This regime is not likely to be
   observed in the relatively low Reynolds number flows of the laboratory
   or in direct numerical simulations, but it is likely a common occurrence
   in the ocean and atmosphere. Citation: Geyer, W. R., A. C. Lavery, M. E.

Abstract = {{Presented herein is a first density functional theory (DFT) (ZORA,
   STO-TZP) survey of ruthenium(IV) porphyrins with monoanionic nitrogen
   ligands, modeled after experimentally observed ruthenium porphyrin
   bis(amido), bis(methyleneamido), and bis(pyrazolato) complexes. Three
   exchange correlation functionals-PW91, OLYP, and B3LYP, which often
   behave somewhat differently-provide good, consistent descriptions of the
   lowest singlet and triplet states. For ruthenium porphyrin bis(amido)
   and bis(methyleneamido) complexes, the calculations reproduce the
   experimentally observed S = 0 ground states, with the triplet states
   only a few tenths of an electron-volt higher in energy. The
   singlet-triplet energy gaps decrease somewhat along the series PW91 >
   OLYP > B3LYP. Molecular orbital (MO) analyses also provide a qualitative
   explanation for the singlet ground states of these complexes, which may
   be contrasted with the triplet states of heme protein compound II
   intermediates and their synthetic iron(IV) models. Amido and
   methyleneamido ligands have a single pi-lone pair, unlike hydroxide,
   alkoxide, and thiolate ligands, which have two. The former therefore
   engage in a single pi-bonding interaction with one of the Ru d(pi)
   orbitals, resulting in an S = 0 d(4) electronic configuration. In
   contrast, the O or S ligands present in compound II engage in pi-bonding
   with both d(pi) orbitals, resulting in an S = I ground state. For the
   ruthenium(IV) bis(methyleneamido) complexes, our MO analysis indicates a
   somewhat different bonding description, relative to that proposed by the
   experimental researchers, who invoked Ru(d(pi)) ->
   N-methyleneamido(pi{*}) backbonding to explain Ru-N-methyleneamido
   multiple bond character. Instead, we found that the metal-methyleneamido
   pi-bonding almost exclusively involves N-to-Ru pi-donation and thus is
   qualitatively very similar to metal-amido pi-bonding. Ruthenium(IV)
   bis(pyrazolato) complexes provide rare examples of ruthenium(IV) centers
   with all-nitrogen ligation that are paramagnetic. OLYP successfully
   captures this ``inverse{''} spin state energetics; PW91 and B3LYP do so
   less well.}},

Abstract = {{Within the healthy population, there is substantial, heritable, and
   interindividual variability in the platelet response. We explored
   whether a proportion of this variability could be accounted for by
   interindividual variation in gene expression. Through a correlative
   analysis of genome-wide platelet RNA expression data from 37 subjects
   representing the normal range of platelet responsiveness within a cohort
   of 500 subjects, we identified 63 genes in which transcript levels
   correlated with variation in the platelet response to adenosine
   diphosphate and/or the collagen-mimetic peptide, crosslinked
   collagen-related peptide. Many of these encode proteins with no reported
   function in platelets. An association study of 6 of the 63 genes in 4235
   cases and 6379 controls showed a putative association with myocardial
   infarction for COMMD7 (COMM domain-containing protein 7) and a major
   deviation from the null hypothesis for LRRFIP1 {[}leucinerich repeat (in
   FLII) interacting protein 1]. Morpholino-based silencing in Danio rerio
   identified a modest role for commd7 and a significant effect for lrrfip1
   as positive regulators of thrombus formation. Proteomic analysis of
   human platelet LRRFIP1-interacting proteins indicated that LRRFIP1
   functions as a component of the platelet cytoskeleton, where it
   interacts with the actin-remodeling proteins Flightless-1 and Drebrin.
   Taken together, these data reveal novel proteins regulating the platelet
   response. (Blood. 2010; 116(22): 4646-4656)}},

   a monoelectronic transfer from an electron rich olefin:
   1,1',3,3'-tetramethyl- 2,2'-bisimidazolidine (ERO). The reaction
   involves the transient formation of a

   obtained by another way, reacting imidazolidinium chloride with
   polyalkyl-hydro-s-indacenyl lithium, and also generates the

   polyalkyl-hydro-s-indacenyl radicals studied present an unsymmetrical
   spin distribution and, in ESR, hyperfine couplings smaller than those
   usually observed in similar aromatic radical anions. They were
   identified from their dimerization products and also by trapping on
   2,4,6-tri-tert-butylnitrosobenzene. A rhodium complex radical analog was
   also studied. (c) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

   of pyrrol-2-carboxaldehyde with \{2-{[}2-(2-aminophenoxy)ethoxy]

   {[}2-(\{2-{[}(2-aminophenyl)thio]ethyl\} thio)phenyl]amine and
   {[}2-(\{4-{[}(2-aminophenyl)thio]butyl\}thio)phenyl]amine respectively.
   Reaction of these ligands with nickel(II) and copper(II) acetate gave
   complexes of the form MLm (m = 1-4), and the synthesized ligands and
   their complexes have been characterized by a variety of physico-chemical
   techniques. The solid and solution states investigations show that the
   complexes are neutral. The molecular structures of NiL3 and CuL2, which
   have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction, indicate that
   the NiL3 complex has a distorted octahedral coordination environment
   around the metal while the CuL2 complex has a seesaw coordination
   geometry. DFT calculations were used to analyse the electronic structure
   and simulation of the electronic absorption spectrum of the CuL2 complex
   using TDDFT gives results that are consistent with the measured
   spectroscopic behavior of the complex. Cyclic voltammetry indicates that
   all copper complexes are electrochemically inactive but the nickel
   complexes with softer thioethers are more easily oxidized than their
   oxygen analogs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A redox induced structural transformation for 2 monolayers of vanadia on
   alpha-TiO2(110) (rutile) was studied by in situ X-ray standing waves and

   atomic layer deposition. Oxidation and reduction were carried out by
   annealing in O-2 and H-2, respectively. We found that an epitaxial
   rutile VO2 film was formed in the reduced phase with V4+ cations in
   lateral alignment with Ti lattice positions. Oxidation was found to
   produce V5+ cations uncorrelated to the substrate lattice in the
   oxidized phase. The redox induced structural and oxidation state
   transformation proved reversible and involved the entire film; not just
   the surface layer. The current study suggests that the structural order
   needs to be considered in order to study the activity of supported
   vanadium oxide catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Using a mesoscopic stochastic model, the effect of interplay of external
   and internal noise on the dynamics of calcium oscillations was studied.
   When the system was tuned near a Hopf bifurcation point and driven by
   external noise or internal noise only, the existence of external noise
   coherence resonance (ENCR) or internal-noise stochastic resonance (INSR)
   was found, respectively. When both of the noises were considered, it was
   found that ENCR could be suppressed by internal noise, while INSR could
   be enhanced by external noise in a certain range of external noise
   intensity. It was also interesting to note that the optimal system size
   can be regulated by the external noise when the INSR occurs. The cell
   system may adapt to adjust the optimal size according to the external
   noise, indicating some kind of self-tuning mechanism involved in
   stochastic calcium dynamics. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   have been used to study metals undergoing plastic deformation in situ,

   Debye-Scherrer rings, showing reflections from individual crystallites,
   is analyzed to obtain grain statistics, mosaic spread and grain
   orientation. Upon cold deformation, coarse grained materials show
   fingerprints of subgrain formation, grain rotation, grain refinement and
   the evolution from a single grain into the asymptotic texture. Lattice
   strain, its partition and anisotropy can be simultaneously revealed.
   Heating of metals under continuous load drives the observation through
   the regimes of phase transformation and grain relationships therein,
   grain coarsening, dynamic recovery and dynamic recrystallization.
   Examples on copper, magnesium, twinning induced plasticity steel,
   zirconium alloy and titanium aluminium intermetallics are shown. Crown

Abstract = {{A computational modeling (in gas phase) to study the disposition of the
   homologous surfactants in a bidimensional simple model of mixed and
   homogeneous micelles was performed for the case of R-trimethylammonium
   bromide surfactants with different linear R lengths from R = C-5 to
   C-17. First, the bidimensional homogeneous (one component) micelle was
   modeled, and as a second step, heterogeneous (two components)
   bidimensional micelles were modeled. The difference in the number of
   carbon atoms between hydrocarbon chains of the surfactants in the
   heterogeneous micelles, Delta n(C), ranged from 2 to 8. Results were
   contrasted with experimental data obtained at our own laboratory. The
   exothermic values of the steric energy changes showed strong attraction
   between components of homologous surfactants mixture, especially when
   one of the surfactants has a long chain. It may be argued that the
   inclusion of a shorter surfactant in the mixture and the twisting of the
   longer surfactant makes the bidimensional arrangement formation more
   exothermic. All predictions were in agreement with previous experimental
   results.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure of layered thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) with three
   coating layers in the bond and top coats, respectively, prepared using a
   specialized coating system (TriplexPro (TM)-200), was controlled and its
   mechanical properties were investigated, which were then compared with
   the common TBCs with a single layer in each coat. The bond and top coats
   were coated with 100 and 200 mu m for each feedstock, resulting in 300
   and 600 mu m thicknesses in the bond and top coats, respectively. The
   microstructure of the top coat could be controlled by changing the
   feedstock and using a multiple hopper system-dense/intermediate/porous
   layers from surface to interface or reverse microstructure. In the case
   of the bond coat, a compositional gradient was achieved. The adhesive
   strength values of the top coats were strongly dependent on the
   microstructure, whereas the values for the bond coat were similar. The
   hardness and toughness values gradually changed from surface to
   interface, indicating that the mechanical properties corresponded well
   with the microstructure of the TBCs. The indentation stress-strain
   curves of both TBCs with the layered structure were located between the
   curves for TBCs with the single structure of relatively dense and porous
   microstructures. Damage on the surface and subsurface was strongly
   affected by the microstructure of the top coat, showing a similar trend
   with the stress-strain behavior. This evidence allowed us to propose an
   efficient coating in protecting the substrate from mechanical
   environments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present work focused on investigation of different modifiers, such
   as Si, Al, Bi, and Pb on the tungstated zirconia catalysts. First, the
   different modifier precursors were introduced onto the nanocrystal
   zirconia having molar ratio (metal: Zr) at 0.01:1. Then, the 15 wt\% of
   tungsten (W) was impregnated onto the modified zirconia. The
   physicochemical properties influenced by the modifiers were determined
   using the N-2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and
   electron spin resonance (ESR). In order to measure the catalytic
   activity, esterification of acetic acid and 1-heptanol was performed. It
   was found that the modifiers apparently resulted in dramatically
   decreased activity due to decreased acidity of the catalysts. It can be
   proposed that the modifiers had three major roles; (i) inhibit the phase
   transformation, (ii) enhance the presence of F-center (electrons
   stabilized in oxygen vacancy), and (iii) increase strong interaction of
   adsorbed species on zirconia. The third effect was the key factor
   leading to pronounced decrease in acidity of the catalysts. (C) 2010 The

Abstract = {{The influence of the lubricant magnesium stearate (MgSt) on the powder
   and tablet properties of chitin-Mg silicate coprecipitate was examined
   and compared with lubricated Avicel (R) 200 and Avicel-Mg silicate
   coprecipitate. Crushing strength and disintegration time studies were
   conducted in order to evaluate tablet properties at different
   compression pressures. Lubrication of chitin-Mg silicate powder with
   MgSt was evaluated using a high speed rotary tablet press. The
   compactability and disintegration time of chitin-Mg silicate are
   unaffected by the possible deleterious action of up to 2\% (w/w) MgSt.
   The deleterious effect of MgSt on Avicel (R) 200 compaction was found to
   be minimized when magnesium silicate was coprecipitated onto Avicel (R)
   200. Lubrication of chitin-Mg silicate with MgSt does not enhance
   particle agglomeration, whereas the opposite is the case for Avicel (R)
   200; the foregoing was ascertained by measurements of the fixed bulk
   density, constant powder porosity using Kawakita analysis and by the
   absence of variation in particle size distribution in the presence of up
   to 5\% (w/w) MgSt. In the case of chitin-Mg silicate tablets the
   ejection force was greatly reduced at a compression speed of 150,000
   tablet/h at a MgSt concentration of 0.5\% (w/w). The physical properties
   and drug dissolution profile of ibuprofen tablets were found to be
   unaffected when chitin-Mg silicate was lubricated up to 5\% (w/w) with
   MgSt. Optimal drug dissolution was attained for gemfibrozil tablets
   using 3\% (w/w) MgSt when compared to a reference (Lopid tablets). (C)

Abstract = {{We propose a network-based method for determining basins and barriers of
   complex free energy surfaces (e.g., the protein folding landscape) from
   the time series of a single intramolecular distance. First, a network of
   transitions is constructed by clustering the points of the time series
   according to the short-time distribution of the signal. The transition
   network, which reflects the short-time kinetics, is then used for the
   iterative determination of individual basins by the minimum-cut-based
   free energy profile, a barrier-preserving one-dimensional projection of
   the free energy surface. The method is tested using the time series of a
   single C-beta-C-beta distance extracted from equilibrium molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations of a structured peptide (20 residue
   three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet). Although the information of
   only one distance is employed to describe a system with 645 degrees of
   freedom, both the native state and the unfolding barrier of about 10
   kJ/mol are determined with remarkable accuracy. Moreover, non-native
   conformers are identified by comparing long-time distributions of the
   same distance. To examine the applicability to single-molecule Forster
   resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, a time series of donor and
   acceptor photons is generated using the MD trajectory. The native state
   of the beta-sheet peptide is determined accurately from the emulated
   FRET signal. Applied to real single-molecule FRET measurements on a
   monomeric variant of lambda-repressor, the network-based method
   correctly identifies the folded and unfolded populations, which are
   clearly separated in the minimum-cut-based free energy profile.}},

Abstract = {{Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) is characterized by systemic vasculitis and
   blood and tissue eosinophilia. Blood eosinophilia correlates with
   disease activity, and activated T cells from CSS patients are
   predominantly T helper 2 (Th2). Interleukin (IL)-25 has been shown to
   link innate and adaptive immunity by enhancing Th2 cytokine production.
   We sought to determine the involvement of IL-25 and its receptor IL-17RB
   in the pathogenesis of CSS. We found increased levels of IL-25 in the
   serum of active CSS patients (952 +/- 697 vs 75 +/- 49 pg/mL in inactive
   patients and 47 +/- 6 pg/mL in healthy donors). IL-25 was correlated
   with disease activity and eosinophil level. Eosinophils were the main
   source of IL-25, whereas activated CD4(+) memory T cells were the
   IL-17RB-expressing cells in CSS. IL-25 enhanced the production of IL-4,
   IL-5, and IL-13 by activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. IL-25
   and IL-17RB were observed within the vasculitic lesions of patients with
   CSS, and IL-17RB colocalized with T cells. Increased expression of
   IL-17RB, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6, and JunB in
   vasculitic lesions of CSS underscored the IL-25-mediated activation,
   whereas up-regulation of GATA3 and IL-10 supported Th2 differentiation.
   Our findings suggest that eosinophils, through the production of IL-25,
   exert a critical role in promoting Th2 responses in target tissues of
   CSS. (Blood. 2010;116(22):4523-4531)}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated whether BAY
   41-2272(5-cyclopropyl-2-{[}1-(2-fluoro-benzyI)-1H-pyrazolo
   {[}3,4-b]pyridin-3-yl]-pyrimidin-4-ylamine), a novel pyrazolopyridine
   that activates guanylyl cyclase and sensitizes the enzyme towards nitric
   oxide (NO), inhibits the development of pulmonary hypertension. BAY
   41-2272 (1 or 10 mg/kg/day) was administered intraperitoneally, and
   sildenafil (25 mg/kg/day), an inhibitor phosphodiesterase type 5, was
   given in the drinking water to rats kept under chronic hypobaric hypoxia
   for two weeks. Right ventricular systolic pressure and hypertrophy,
   degree of muscularization and relaxation of pulmonary arteries were
   measured, and immunoblotting was performed. Chronic hypoxia increased
   right ventricular systolic pressure and expression of soluble guanylyl
   cyclase and phosphorylated vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein
   (VASP-P-ser239). BAY 41-2272 prevented hypoxia-induced increase in right
   ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy to the
   same extent as sildenafil. Only sildenafil significantly decreased
   hypoxia-induced muscularization of pulmonary arteries. Expressed
   relative to soluble guanylyl cyclase expression, VASF-P-ser239 was
   increased in lungs from rats treated with BAY 41-2272. Acutely BAY
   41-2272 caused pulmonary as well as systemic vasodilatation. In the
   chronic setting systemic blood pressure was not different to baseline at
   trough after intraperitoneally administered BAY 41-2272. BAY 41-2272
   vasorelaxation in isolated pulmonary resistance arteries was inhibited
   by an inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase, ODQ
   (1H-{[}1,2,4]oxadiazolo{[}4,3-a]quinoxaline-1-one), and of
   Na+-K+-ATPase, ouabain. In conclusion, in an adult rat model of chronic
   hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, BAY 41-2272 to a similar degree as
   sildenafil prevents pulmonary hypertension. Thus, BAY 41-2272 may
   provide a novel therapeutic compound for treating chronic hypoxic
   pulmonary hypertension. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   evolution during aging of a Fe-1.34 at.\%Cu alloy in details. It has
   been demonstrated that the heating process only affects the nucleation
   period. After the beginning of the bcc -> 9R transformation, the
   microstructure evolution can be divided into three stages: bcc -> 9R
   transformation, no transformation and 9R -> bcc transformation. In the
   late stage of aging, almost all particles are of 9R structure. The mean
   particle radius varies linearly with the cube root of time and the
   particle number density varies linearly with the reciprocal of time. (C)

Abstract = {{Overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins is commonly
   related with tumor maintenance, progression, and chemoresistance.
   Inhibition of these antiapoptotic proteins is an attractive approach for
   cancer therapy. Guided by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) binding
   assays, a series of 5,5' substituted compound 6a (Apogossypolone)
   derivatives was synthesized and identified pan-active antagonists of
   antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, with binding potency in the low
   micromolar to nanomolar range. Compound 6f inhibits the binding of BH3
   peptides to Bcl-X-L, Bcl-2, and Mel-1 with IC50 values of 3.10, 3.12,
   and 2.05 mu M, respectively. In a cellular assay, 6f potently inhibits
   cell growth in several human cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent
   manner. Compound 6f further displays M vivo efficacy in transgenic mice
   and demonstrated superior single-agent antitumor efficacy in a PPC-1
   mouse xenograft model. Together with its negligible toxicity, compound
   6f represents a promising drug lead for the development of novel
   apoptosis-based therapies for cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Multifunctional materials combining the high energy density of metal
   fuels with the ability to generate biocidal combustion products are of
   interest for defeat of stockpiles of biological weapons. In this study,
   new Al-I composites are prepared and investigated, which are expected to
   combust similarly to Al powder while releasing biocidal
   iodine-containing reaction products. Materials are prepared by
   mechanical milling of pure Al powder and iodine at cryogenic
   temperatures. Prepared materials are stable at room temperature and
   contain more than 10 wt \% of iodine. Two samples with the same nominal
   compositions were prepared using different milling conditions.
   Thermogravimetric measurements at different heating rates were used to
   characterize reactions of iodine release and oxidation of the prepared
   materials. Oxidation was studied with O-2 serving as an oxidizer.
   Ignition of the prepared materials was studied by coating them onto an
   electrically heated filament and using optical diagnostics to identify
   ignition temperatures at different heating rates. It was observed that
   iodine is released from the prepared materials in several steps. At low
   temperatures, iodine release is similar to volatilization of elemental
   iodine and AlI3. Substantial amounts of iodine are retained to higher
   temperatures and begin to volatilize when the sample temperature
   approaches the Al melting point. Oxidation of the prepared materials in
   O-2 begins at lower temperatures than that for pure Al. Melting of Al
   accelerates both oxidation and iodine release rates. Prepared materials
   ignite at substantially lower temperatures than pure Al, and a
   correlation between ignition and iodine release is identified.}},

Title = {{Speeding up tandem mass spectrometry-based database searching by longest
   common prefix}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Tandem mass spectrometry-based database searching has become
   an important technology for peptide and protein identification. One of
   the key challenges in database searching is the remarkable increase in
   computational demand, brought about by the expansion of protein
   databases, semi-or non-specific enzymatic digestion, post-translational
   modifications and other factors. Some software tools choose peptide
   indexing to accelerate processing. However, peptide indexing requires a
   large amount of time and space for construction, especially for the
   non-specific digestion. Additionally, it is not flexible to use.
   Results: We developed an algorithm based on the longest common prefix
   (ABLCP) to efficiently organize a protein sequence database. The longest
   common prefix is a data structure that is always coupled to the suffix
   array. It eliminates redundant candidate peptides in databases and
   reduces the corresponding peptide-spectrum matching times, thereby
   decreasing the identification time. This algorithm is based on the
   property of the longest common prefix. Even enzymatic digestion poses a
   challenge to this property, but some adjustments can be made to this
   algorithm to ensure that no candidate peptides are omitted. Compared
   with peptide indexing, ABLCP requires much less time and space for
   construction and is subject to fewer restrictions.
   Conclusions: The ABLCP algorithm can help to improve data analysis
   efficiency. A software tool implementing this algorithm is available at

Abstract = {{The double-peak structure observed in soft-hard hadron correlations is
   commonly interpreted as a signature for a Mach cone generated by a
   supersonic jet interacting with the hot and dense medium created in
   ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. We show that it can also arise
   due to averaging over many jet events in a transversally expanding
   background. We find that the jet-induced away-side yield does not depend
   on the details of the energy-momentum deposition in the plasma, the jet
   velocity, or the system size. Our claim can be experimentally tested by
   comparing soft-hard correlations induced by heavy-flavor jets with those
   generated by light-flavor jets.}},

Abstract = {{We report observations of neutral and ion temperatures at approximately
   240 km altitude above Poker Flat, Alaska, taken during the stratospheric
   warming event of January and February 2009. Neutral temperatures were
   recorded by a single-etalon Fabry-Perot spectrometer observing the
   nighttime airglow and aurora at 630 nm wavelength, whereas ion
   temperatures were obtained with the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar,
   mostly during daylight. Neutral and ion temperatures generally tracked
   each other closely; both data sets exhibited a similar overall seasonal
   trend during January to April 2009 and even showed similar short-term
   day-to-day fluctuations. Further, the daily fluctuations correlated
   highly with geomagnetic activity. Both the short-term temperature
   fluctuations and their overall seasonal trend matched expectations based
   on the MSIS model evaluated for this period at hourly intervals. A
   cooling response was seen in neutral temperature over a 2-3 week period
   during the main phase of the stratospheric warming. The magnitude of
   this cooling was around 50 K relative to the seasonal trend. A
   corresponding signature was also discernible in the ion temperatures,
   although it was less prominent than the neutral response. This was
   largely because the cooling was masked by ion temperature perturbations
   driven by magnetic activity. The strength of the response in ion
   temperature was observed to depend on the local time of the
   observations, which is consistent with results presented previously.}},

Title = {{The Functional-765G -> C Polymorphism of the COX-2 Gene May Reduce the
   Risk of Developing Crohn's Disease}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a key enzyme involved in the
   conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. COX-2 is mainly
   induced at sites of inflammation in response to proinflammatory
   cytokines such as interleukin-1 alpha/beta, interferon-gamma and tumor
   necrosis factor-alpha produced by inflammatory cells.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the possible modulating
   effect of the functional COX-2 polymorphisms -1195 A -> G and -765G -> C
   on the risk for development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a
   Dutch population.
   Methods: Genomic DNA of 525 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 211
   patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 973 healthy controls was
   genotyped for the -1195 A -> G (rs689466) and -765G -> C (rs20417)
   polymorphisms. Distribution of genotypes in patients and controls were
   compared and genotype-phenotype interactions were investigated.
   Results: The genotype distribution of the -1195A -> G polymorphism was
   not different between the patients with CD or UC and the control group.
   The -765GC genotype was more prevalent in CD patients compared to
   controls with an OR of 1.33 (95\% CI 1.04-1.69, p < 0.05). The -765GC
   and -765CC genotype carriers showed a tendency to be less frequent in
   patients with CD compared to controls, with ORs of 0.78 (95\% CI:
   0.61-1.00) and 0.49 (95\% CI 0.22-1.08), respectively. Combining
   homozygous and heterozygous patients with the -765C allele showed a
   reduced risk for developing CD, with an OR of 0.75 (95\% CI: 0.59-0.96).
   In the context of this, the G(-1195)G(-765)/A(-1195)C(-765) diplotype
   was significantly less common in patients with CD compared to controls,
   with an OR of 0.62 (95\% CI: 0.39-0.98). For UC however, such an effect
   was not observed. No correlation was found between COX-2 diplotypes and
   clinical characteristics of IBD.
   Conclusions: The -765G -> C polymorphism was associated with a reduced
   risk for developing Crohn's disease in a Dutch population.}},

Title = {{DISTRIBUTION AND MORPHOLOGY OF THE CATECHOLAMINERGIC NEURAL ELEMENTS IN
   THE HUMAN HYPOTHALAMUS}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{171}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have demonstrated that catecholaminergic, tyrosine
   hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive (IR) perikarya and fibers are widely
   distributed in the human hypothalamus. Since TH is the key and
   rate-limiting enzyme for catecholaminergic synthesis, these IR neurons
   may represent dopaminergic, noradrenergic or adrenergic neural elements.
   However, the distribution and morphology of these neurotransmitter
   systems in the human hypothalamus is not entirely known. Since the
   different catecholaminergic systems can be detected by identifying the
   neurons containing the specific key enzymes of catecholaminergic
   synthesis, in the present study we mapped the catecholaminergic elements
   in the human hypothalamus using immunohistochemistry against the
   catecholaminergic enzymes, TH, dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and
   phenylethanolamine-N-methltransferase (PNMT). Only a few, PNMT-IR,
   adrenergic neuronal elements were found mainly in the infundibulum and
   the periventricular zone. DBH-IR structures were more widely distributed
   in the human hypothalamus occupying chiefly the
   infundibulum/infundibular nucleus, periventricular area, supraoptic and
   paraventricular nuclei. Dopaminergic elements were detected by utilizing
   double label immunohistochemistry. First, the DBH-IR elements were
   visualized; then the TH-IR structures, that lack DBH, were detected with
   a different chromogen. In our study, we conclude that all of the
   catecholaminergic perikarya and the majority of the catecholaminergic
   fibers represent dopaminergic neurons in the human hypothalamus. Due to
   the extremely small number of PNMT-IR, adrenergic structures in the
   human hypothalamus, the DBH-IR fibers represent almost exclusively
   noradrenergic neuronal processes. These findings suggest that the
   juxtapositions between the TH-IR and numerous peptidergic systems
   revealed by previous reports indicate mostly dopaminergic synapses. (C)

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},

Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{The parameter W-a, which characterizes nuclear-spin-dependent parity
   violation (PV) in the molecular spin-rotational Hamiltonian, was
   computed with a quasirelativistic Hartree-Fock approach for radium
   fluoride (RaF) and found to be one of the largest absolute values
   predicted so far. The peculiar electronic structure of RaF leads to
   highly diagonal Franck-Condon matrices between the energetically lowest
   two electronic states, which qualifies RaF for direct laser cooling. A
   subset of diatomic molecules with a wide range of internal structures
   suitable for this cooling technique is also indicated. As trapped cold
   molecules offer superior coherence times, RaF can be considered
   promising for high-precision experiments aimed at molecular PV.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{46}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Ultrafast electron-phonon coupling dynamics in ZnO are investigated by
   degenerate pump-probe reflectivity measurements using near resonant 400
   nm light. Because of the below-gap excitation, photocarriers are excited
   primarily from deep levels of intrinsic point defects. At least six
   coherent phonon modes, including two E-2 modes and their combination,
   longitudinal optical (LO) mode and its overtone (2LO), are observed.
   Unlike the previous resonant Raman studies using 325 nm light, the
   intensity of the polar LO phonons is only moderately enhanced by the
   Frohlich interaction. The non-polar E-2 phonons decay considerably
   faster than under visible excitation, indicative of strong deformation
   potential interaction with photocarriers. The overdamped oscillation
   centered at around 20 THz is tentatively attributed to the upper branch
   of the plasmon-phonon coupled mode. The pump-polarization dependence of
   the phonon amplitudes is consistent with the impulsive Raman generation.}},

Title = {{Electrical properties and reduced Debye temperature of polycrystalline
   thin gold films}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{46}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{The temperature-dependent electrical properties of four suspended
   polycrystalline thin gold films with thicknesses of 20.0, 23.0, 36.0 and
   54.0 nm have been measured in the temperature range 100-310 K. The
   measured results show that the electrical resistivity of the films
   significantly increases while the corresponding temperature dependence
   decreases compared with bulk gold. The significantly increased
   electrical resistivity indicates that grain boundary scattering
   dominates over surface scattering in the studied films. However, fixing
   the Debye temperature to the bulk value will lead to an erroneous
   temperature dependence of resistivity. Taking into account the reduced
   characteristic Debye temperature along with the surface and grain
   boundary scattering, the electrical properties of the films can be well
   described in the whole temperature range. The extracted grain boundary
   reflection coefficient is 0.3 +/- 0.03, within the range of the previous
   reported values, 0.1-0.45. The films' characteristic Debye temperatures
   decrease from the bulk value of 165 K to between 83 and 121 K and tend
   to increase with increasing film thickness. This tendency coincides with
   the previous studies on thin gold, copper, platinum, silver films or
   wires, and cobalt/nickel superlattices. The possible mechanism
   responsible for the reduced Debye temperature is phonon softening at the
   surfaces, grain boundaries, disorder, defects and impurities, part of
   which has been demonstrated in other studies.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{We examine the feasibility of generating continuous-variable
   multipartite entanglement in an intracavity concurrent downconversion
   scheme that has been proposed for the generation of cluster states by
   Menicucci et al. {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 130501 (2008)]. By calculating
   optimized versions of the van Loock-Furusawa correlations we demonstrate
   genuine quadripartite entanglement and investigate the degree of
   entanglement present. Above the oscillation threshold the basic cluster
   state geometry under consideration suffers from phase diffusion. We
   alleviate this problem by incorporating a small injected signal into our
   analysis. Finally, we investigate squeezed joint operators. While the
   squeezed joint operators approach zero in the undepleted regime, we find
   that this is not the case when we consider the full interaction
   Hamiltonian and the presence of a cavity. In fact, we find that the
   decay of these operators is minimal in a cavity, and even depletion
   alone inhibits cluster state formation.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Volume = {{82}},

Abstract = {{Polar liquids like water carry a characteristic nanometric length scale,
   the correlation length of orientation polarizations. Continuum theories
   that can capture this feature commonly run under the name of
   ``nonlocal{''} electrostatics since their dielectric response is
   characterized by a scale-dependent dielectric function epsilon(q), where
   q is the wave vector; the Poisson(-Boltzmann) equation then turns into
   an integro-differential equation. Recently, ``local{''} formulations
   have been put forward for these theories and applied to water, solvated
   ions, and proteins. We review the local formalism and show how it can be
   applied to a structured liquid in slit and plate geometries, and solve
   the Poisson-Boltzmann theory for a charged plate in a structured solvent
   with counterions. Our results establish a coherent picture of the local
   version of nonlocal electrostatics and show its ease of use when
   compared to the original formulation.}},

Abstract = {{Biofunctionalization of silicon substrates is important to the
   development of silicon-based biosensors and devices. Compared to
   conventional organosiloxane films on silicon oxide intermediate layers,
   organic monolayers directly bound to the nonoxidized silicon substrates
   via Si-C bonds enhance the sensitivity of detection and the stability
   against hydrolytic cleavage. Such monolayers presenting a high density
   of terminal alkynyl groups for bioconjugation via copper-catalyzed
   azide-alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC, a ``click{''} reaction)
   were reported. However, yields of the CuAAC reactions on these monolayer
   platforms were low. Also, the nonspecific adsorption of proteins on the
   resultant surfaces remained a major obstacle for many potential
   biological applications. Herein, we report a new type of ``clickable{''}
   monolayers grown by selective, photoactivated surface hydrosilylation of
   alpha,omega-alkenynes, where the alkynyl terminal is protected with a
   trimethylgermanyl (TMG) group, on hydrogen-terminated silicon
   substrates. The TMG groups on the film are readily removed in aqueous
   solutions in the presence of Cu(I). Significantly, the degermanylation
   and the subsequent CuAAC reaction with various azides could be combined
   into a single step in good yields. Thus, oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG)
   with an azido tag was attached to the TMG-alkyne surfaces, leading to
   OEG-terminated surfaces that reduced the nonspecific adsorption of
   protein (fibrinogen) by >98\%. The CuAAC reaction could be performed in
   microarray format to generate arrays of mannose and biotin with varied
   densities on the protein-resistant OEG background. We also demonstrated
   that the monolayer platform could be functionalized with mannose for
   highly specific capturing of living targets (EScherichia coli expressing
   fimbriae) onto the silicon substrates.}},

Abstract = {{In previous studies we demonstrated that green and roasted coffee
   contains low molecular weight (LMW) compounds capable of inhibiting the
   ability of Streptococcus mutans, the major causative agent of human
   dental caries, to adhere to hydroxyapatite (HA) beads. This study
   addressed the ability of the whole high molecular weight coffee fraction
   (cHMW) and of its melanoidin and non-melanoidin components (GFC1-5),
   applied at concentrations that occur in coffee beverages, to (i) inhibit
   S. mu fans growth; (ii) affect S. mu fans sucrose-dependent adhesion to
   and detachment from saliva-coated HA beads (sHA); and (iii) inhibit
   biofilm development on microtiter plates. The results indicated that
   only cHMW is endowed with antimicrobial activity. The cHMW fraction and
   each of the five GFC components inhibited S. mutans adhesion, the
   strongest effect being exerted by cHMW (91\%) and GFC1 (88\%). S. mutans
   detachment from sHA was four times greater (similar to 20\%) with cHMW
   and the GFC1 and GFC4 melanoidins than with controls. Finally, biofilm
   production by S. mutans was completely abolished by cHMW and was reduced
   by 20\% by the melanoidin components GFC2 and GFC4 and by the
   non-melanoidin component GFC5 compared with controls. Altogether these
   findings show that coffee beverage contains both LMW compounds and HMW
   melanoidin and non-melanoidin components with a strong ability to
   interfere in vitro with the S. mutans traits relevant for cariogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{The advances in bioorthogonal ligation methods have provided new
   opportunities for proteomic analysis of newly synthesized proteins,
   posttranslational modifications, and specific enzyme families using
   azide/alkyne-functionalized chemical reporters and activity-based
   probes. Efficient enrichment and elution of azide/alkyne-labeled
   proteins with selectively cleavable affinity tags are essential for
   protein identification and quantification applications. Here, we report
   the synthesis and comparative analysis of Na2S2O4-cleavable
   azobenzene-based affinity tags for bioorthogonal chemical proteomics. We
   demonstrated that ortho-hydroxyl substituent is required for efficient
   azobenzene-bond cleavage and show that these cleavable affinity tags can
   be used to identify newly synthesized proteins in bacteria targeted by
   amino acid chemical reporters as well as their sites of modification on
   endogenously expressed proteins. The azobenzene-based affinity tags are
   compatible with in-gel, in-solution, and on-bead enrichment strategies
   and should afford useful tools for diverse bioorthogonal proteomic
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{We derive general properties of the linear-response functions of

   extension of the results which were recently found in Hamiltonian
   systems {[}A. Shimizu and T. Yuge, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 79, 013002
   (2010)]. We discuss one of the properties, the sum rule for the response
   function, in particular detail. We show that the sum rule for the
   response function of the velocity holds in the underdamped case, whereas
   it is violated in the overdamped case. This implies that the overdamped
   Langevin models should be used with great care. We also investigate the
   relation of the sum rule to an equality on the energy dissipation in
   nonequilibrium Langevin systems, which was derived by Harada and Sasa.}},

Abstract = {{Amphiphilic block copolymers poly(ethylene glycol)-block-oligo(vinyl

   effective surfactants for CO2 in-water (C/W) emulsions However, the high
   cost and difficulty of synthesis process can render the economics of CO2
   process unfavorable In this work, by reversible addition fragmentation
   chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, a series of well-defined CO2
   philic triblock copolymers X-OVAc b-PEG-b-OVAc-X (where X stands for
   xanthate group) were synthesized The structures and molecular weights of
   these copolymers were characterized by H-1 NMR and GPC The results of
   GPC analysis exhibited relatively narrow polydispersity (PDI < 1 35) The
   process of preparation of X-OVAc based surfactants was much more simple,
   inexpensive and also easy to control, which could promote
   industrial-scale applications The X-OVAc-based surfactants were found
   effectively to produce highly concentrated stable C/W emulsions Porous
   emulsion-templated materials were prepared by the polymerization of the
   continuous phase of C/W emulsions The open-cell morphology of the
   emulsion templated materials was evidenced by scanning electron
   microscope To tune the morphology of the porous structures, the
   influence of the surfactant concentration and molecular weight of OVAc
   block were also investigated It was shown that X-OVAc-based surfactants
   can outperform perfluorinated surfactants and approach OVAc based
   surfactants for such applications}},

Journal = {{NEUROLOGY}},

Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{1896-1903}},

Abstract = {{Background: Late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an
   autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that causes severe
   demyelination of the nervous system. The neuronal metabolite
   N-acetylaspartate (NAA) serves as a source of acetyl groups for myelin
   lipid synthesis in oligodendrocytes and is known as a marker for
   neuronal and axonal loss. NAA and other metabolite levels measured by
   proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) correlate with performance
   of the brain in normal children. There is a need for sensitive measures
   of disease progression in patients with MLD to enable development of
   future treatments.
   Methods: A cross-section of 13 children with late infantile MLD were
   examined by proton MRS. Signals from NAA, total choline, and total
   creatine in the deep white matter were measured and correlated with the
   results of cognitive and motor function tests.
   Results: The NAA signal decreased as the disease process advanced. Motor
   function, measured by the Gross Motor Function Measure-88, varied from
   13 (only head movement in the supine position) to 180 (able to walk)
   across the study cohort, demonstrating a wide range in functional
   status. Similarly, varied decreases were observed in cognitive function.
   We report strong positive correlations between standardized measures of
   motor and cognitive function and NAA levels in the deep white matter.
   Conclusions: We suggest that NAA levels could serve as a sensitive
   biomarker in children with MLD. Proton MRS may provide a valuable tool
   for measuring the effects of treatment interventions in this disorder.

Abstract = {{Biotin synthase (BS) is a member of the ``SAM radical{''} superfamily of
   enzymes, which catalyze reactions in which the reversible or
   irreversible oxidation of various substrates is coupled to the reduction
   of the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) sulfonium to generate methionine
   and 5'-deoxyadenosine (dAH). Prior studies have demonstrated that these
   products are modest inhibitors of BS and other members of this enzyme
   family. In addition, the in vivo catalytic activity of Escherichia coli
   BS requires expression of
   5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine nucleosidase, which
   hydrolyzes 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA), S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine
   (AdoHcy), and dAH. In the present work, we confirm that dAH is a modest
   inhibitor of BS (K-i = 20 mu M) and show that cooperative binding of dAH
   with excess methionine results in a 3-fold enhancement of this
   inhibition. However, with regard to the other substrates of MTA/AdoHcy
   nucleosidase, we demonstrate that AdoHcy is a potent inhibitor of BS
   (K-i <= 650 nM) while MTA is not an inhibitor. Inhibition by both dAH
   and AdoHcy likely accounts for the in vivo requirement for MTA/AdoHcy
   nucleosidase and may help to explain some of the experimental
   disparities between various laboratories studying BS. In addition, we
   examine possible inhibition by other AdoMet-related biomolecules present
   as common contaminants in commercial AdoMet preparations and/or
   generated during an assay, as well as by sinefungin, a natural product
   that is a known inhibitor of several AdoMet-dependent enzymes. Finally,
   we examine the catalytic activity of BS with highly purified AdoMet in
   the presence of MTAN to relieve product inhibition and present evidence
   suggesting that the enzyme is half-site active and capable of undergoing
   multiple turnovers in vitro.}},

Abstract = {{The origin of eusociality is often regarded as a change of
   macroevolutionary proportions {[}1,2] Its hallmark is a reproductive
   division of labor between the members of a society some individuals

   of others (queens') In the Hymenoptera (ants, bees, wasps), there have
   been many transitions in both directions between solitary nesting and
   sociality {[}2-5] How have such transitions occurred? One possibility is
   that multiple transitions represent repeated evolutionary gains and
   losses of the traits underpinning sociality A second possibility,
   however, is that once sociality has evolved, subsequent transitions
   represent selection at just one or a small number of loci controlling
   developmental switches between preexisting alternative phenotypes
   {[}2,6] We might then expect transitional populations that can express
   either sociality or solitary nesting, de pending on environmental
   conditions Here, we use held transplants to directly induce transitions
   in British and Irish populations of the sweat bee Halictus rubicundus
   Individual variation in social phenotype was linked to time available
   for offspring production, and to the genetic benefits of sociality,
   suggesting that helping was not simply misplaced parental care {[}7] We

Title = {{Self-regulated fluctuations in the ablation of a snow patch over four
   decades}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{We describe four decades of temporal fluctuations in the ablation of the
   Hamaguriyuki snow patch in the northern Japan Alps. Annual ablation
   depth through the melting season shows a significant correlation with
   the initial depth (at the beginning of the melting season), whereas a
   less significant correlation is found with a temperature index that is
   generally believed to correlate well with ablation. The scale effect of
   the snow patch, which appears to modify the wind speed over the patch,
   has a more significant effect on snow ablation than does the radiation
   shadowing effect of surrounding mountains. In the case of a thinner and
   therefore smaller initial springtime snow patch, the speed of the local
   wind may be reduced over the snow surface, thereby suppressing ablation,
   whereas wind speed is not reduced (and ablation is not suppressed) in
   the case of a thicker snow patch. This self-regulating feedback means
   that over the past four decades, the thickness of the snow patch has
   fluctuated in a manner that is largely independent of summertime
   temperature. Our findings also suggest that the self-regulating
   feedback, which influences ablation, allows some small wind-drifted
   glaciers to survive, whereas previous studies reported enhanced
   accumulation at such glaciers via a similar topographic effect on wind
   speed and suppressed ablation via the shading effect of surrounding
   mountains on solar radiation.}},

Abstract = {{Background The vertebrate limb is a classical model for understanding
   patterning of three-dimensional structures during embryonic development
   Although decades of research have elucidated the tissue and molecular
   interactions within the limb bud required for patterning and
   morphogenesis of the limb, the cellular and molecular events that shape
   the limb bud itself have remained largely unknown Results We show that
   the mesenchymal cells of the early limb bud are not disorganized within
   the ectoderm as previously thought but are instead highly organized and
   polarized Using time-lapse video microscopy, we demonstrate that cells
   move and divide according to this orientation The combination of
   oriented cell divisions and movements drives the proximaldistal
   elongation of the limb bud necessary to set the stage for subsequent
   morphogenesis These cellular events are regulated by the combined
   activities of the WNT and FGF pathways We show that WNT5A/JNK is
   necessary for the proper orientation of cell movements and cell division
   In contrast, the FGF/MAPK signaling pathway, emanating from the apical
   ectodermal ridge, does not regulate cell orientation in the limb bud but
   instead establishes a gradient of cell velocity enabling continuous
   rearrangement of the cells at the distal tip of the limb Conclusions
   Together these data shed light on the cellular basis of vertebrate limb
   bud morphogenesis and uncover new layers to the sequential signaling
   pathways acting during vertebrate limb development}},

Title = {{Aviation response to a widely dispersed volcanic ash and gas cloud from
   the August 2008 eruption of Kasatochi, Alaska, USA}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{The extensive volcanic cloud from Kasatochi's 2008 eruption caused
   widespread disruptions to aviation operations along Pacific oceanic,
   Canadian, and U.S. air routes. Based on aviation hazard warnings issued
   by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Geological
   Survey, the Federal Aviation Administration, and Meteorological Service
   of Canada, air carriers largely avoided the volcanic cloud over a 5 day
   period by route modifications and flight cancellations. Comparison of
   time coincident GOES thermal infrared (TIR) data for ash detection with
   Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) ultraviolet data for SO2 detection
   shows congruent areas of ash and gas in the volcanic cloud in the 2 days
   following onset of ash production. After about 2.5 days, the area of SO2
   detected by OMI was more extensive than the area of ash indicated by TIR
   data, indicating significant ash depletion by fall out had occurred.
   Pilot reports of visible haze at cruise altitudes over Canada and the
   northern United States suggested that SO2 gas had converted to sulfate
   aerosols. Uncertain about the hazard potential of the aging cloud,
   airlines coped by flying over, under, or around the observed haze layer.
   Samples from a nondamaging aircraft encounter with Kasatochi's nearly 3
   day old cloud contained volcanic silicate particles, confirming that
   some fine ash is present in predominantly gas clouds. The aircraft's
   exposure to ash was insufficient to cause engine damage; however,
   slightly damaging encounters with volcanic clouds from eruptions of
   Reventador in 2002 and Hekla in 2000 indicate the possibility of
   lingering hazards associated with old and/or diffuse volcanic clouds.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer-based nanocomposites were prepared by solution blending of
   polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane with phenethyl substituents
   (PhenethylPOSS) into poly(bisphenol A carbonate) (PBAC) First
   investigations focused on structure, morphology and dynamics addressed
   mainly by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy are substantially extended
   in this study by the investigation of the CO2 gas transport behavior of
   these materials, i e, permeation experiments using the time lag
   technique as well as gravimetric gas sorption measurements The
   nanocomposite materials were prepared with nanofiller contents ranging
   from 0 to about 40 wt \% by solution blending and films of about 50-100
   mu m thickness were cast from this solution and used for the
   investigation of gas transport properties after drying and annealing
   From the time lag measurements the permeability and an effective
   diffusion coefficient for CO2 is obtained in dependence of FOSS
   concentration and temperature As main results, both, the permeability
   and the diffusivity, increase whereas the solubility decreases with
   increasing POSS concentration These findings are discussed in the
   framework of a microphase separated morphology of the nanocomposite
   systems for POSS concentrations greater than a value C-POSS(crit) of ca
   7 wt \% consisting of a polycarbonate-rich matrix and POSS rich domains
   which are surrounded by an interfacial layer The experimental solubility
   data suggest that the POSS-rich domains are more or less impermeable for
   CO2 On the basis of this assumption a quantitative model is provided to
   correct the solubility data for the phase separated morphology Moreover
   the importance of the interfacial layer between the POSS particles or
   its domains for the properties of nanocomposites especially for the gas
   transport behavior is addressed by analyzing the sorption isotherms
   Also, for the first time results from gas transport measurements and
   dielectric spectroscopy were quantitatively related to each other by
   taking the activation energies of CO2 diffusion and of the dielectric
   beta relaxation into consideration The obtained clear correlation
   indicates that the CO2 gas transport is due to localized molecular
   fluctuations As a further result, the diffusion coefficient obtained
   from time lag and gas sorption measurements is in good agreement with
   respect to both their absolute values and in their concentration
   dependence}},

Abstract = {{Reward-related mesolimbic dopamine is thought to play an important role
   in guiding animal behaviour, biasing approach towards potentially
   beneficial environmental stimuli and away from objects unlikely to
   garner positive outcome. This is considered to result in part from an
   impact on perceptual and attentional processes: dopamine initiates a
   series of cognitive events that result in the priming of
   reward-associated perceptual features. We have provided behavioural and
   electrophysiological evidence that this mechanism guides human vision in
   search, an effect we refer to as reward priming. We have also
   demonstrated that there is substantial individual variability in this
   effect. Here we show that behavioural differences in reward priming are
   predicted remarkably well by a personality index that captures the
   degree to which a person's behaviour is driven by reward outcome.
   Participants with reward-seeking personalities are found to be those who
   allocate visual resources to objects characterized by reward-associated
   visual features. These results add to a rapidly developing literature
   demonstrating the crucial role reward plays in attentional control. They
   additionally illustrate the striking impact personality traits can have
   on low-level cognitive processes like perception and selective

Abstract = {{Objectives We sought to investigate the clinical prognostic value of
   longitudinal and circumferential strain (S) and strain rate (SR) in
   patients after high-risk myocardial infarction (MI).
   Background Left ventricular (LV) contractile performance after MI is an
   important predictor of long-term outcome. Tissue deformation imaging
   might more closely reflect myocardial contractility than traditional
   measures of systolic functions.
   Methods The VALIANT (Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial)
   Echo study enrolled 603 patients with LV dysfunction, heart failure, or
   both 5 days after MI. We measured global peak longitudinal S and
   systolic SR (SRs) from apical 4- and 2-chamber views and global
   circumferential S and SRs from parasternal short-axis view with speckle
   tracking software (Velocity Vector Imaging, Siemens, Inc., Mountain
   View, California). We related global S and SRs to LV remodeling at
   20-month follow-up and to clinical outcomes.
   Results Both longitudinal (mean: -5.1 +/- 1.6 100/ms) and
   circumferential SRs (mean: -8.0 +/- 2.8 100/ms) were predictive of death

   to 1.4, p < 0.001, respectively) after adjustment for clinical
   covariates by Cox proportional hazards, and longitudinal SRs further
   improved in predicting 18-month survivor on a model based on clinical
   and standard echocardiographic measures (increase in area under the
   receiver-operator characteristic curve: 0.13, p = 0.009). With
   multivariable logistic regression, circumferential SRs, but not
   longitudinal SRs, was strongly predictive of remodeling (odds ratio:
   1.3, 95\% CI: 1.1 to 1.4, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions Both longitudinal and circumferential SRs were independent
   predictors of outcomes after MI, whereas only circumferential SRs was
   predictive of remodeling, suggesting that preserved circumferential
   function might serve to restrain ventricular enlargement after MI. (J Am

Abstract = {{Organic photodiodes are presented that utilize solution-processed
   perylene diimide bulk heterojunctions as the device photoactive layer.
   The polymer (9,9'-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole; F8BT) is used as
   the electron donor and the N,N'-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-3,4,9,10-perylene
   tetracarboxylic diimicle (PDI) derivative is used as the electron
   acceptor. The thickness-dependent study of the main device parameters,
   namely of the external quantum efficiency (EQE), the short-circuit
   current (I-SC), the open-circuit voltage (V-OC), the fill factor (FF),
   and the dark current (I-D) is presented. In as-spun F8BT:PDI devices the
   short-circuit EQE reaches the maximum of 17\% and the Voc value is as
   high as 0.8 V. Device I-D is in the nA mm(-2) regime and it correlates
   with the topography of the F8BT:PDI layer. For a range of annealing
   temperatures I-D is monitored as the morphology of the photoactive layer
   changes. The changes in the morphology of the photoactive layer are
   monitored via atomic force microscopy. The thermally induced coalescence
   of the PDI domains assists the dark conductivity of the device. I-D
   values as low as 80 pA mm(-2) are achieved with a corresponding EQE of
   9\%, when an electron-blocking layer (EB) is used in bilayer EB/F8BT:PDI
   devices. Electron injection from the hole-collecting electrode to the
   F8BT:PDI medium is hindered by the use of the EB layer. The temperature
   dependence of the I-D value of the as-spun F8BT:PDI device is studied in
   the range of 296-216 K. In combination with the thickness and the
   composition dependence of to, the determined activation energy E-a
   suggests a two-step mechanism of I-D generation; a
   temperature-independent step of electric-field-assisted carrier
   injection from the device contacts to the active-layer medium and a
   thermally activated step of carrier transport across the device
   electrodes, via the PDI domains of the photoactive layer. Moreover,
   device I-D is found to be sensitive to environmental factors.}},

Title = {{Molecular basis for the dosing time-dependency of anti-allodynic effects
   of gabapentin in a mouse model of neuropathic pain}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR PAIN}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Neuropathic pain is characterized by hypersensitivity to
   innocuous stimuli (tactile allodynia) that is nearly always resistant to
   NSAIDs or even opioids. Gabapentin, a GABA analogue, was originally
   developed to treat epilepsy. Accumulating clinical evidence supports the
   effectiveness of this drug for diverse neuropathic pain. In this study,
   we showed that the anti-allodynic effect of gabapentin was changed by
   the circadian oscillation in the expression of its target molecule, the
   calcium channel alpha 2 delta-1 subunit.
   Results: Mice were underwent partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSL) to
   create a model of neuropathic pain. The paw withdrawal threshold (PWT)
   in PSL mice significantly decreased and fluctuated with a period length
   about 24 h. The PWT in PSL mice was dose-dependently increased by
   intraperitoneal injection of gabapentin, but the antiallodynic effects
   varied according to its dosing time. The protein levels of alpha 2
   delta-1 subunit were up-regulated in the DRG of PSL mice, but the
   protein levels oscillated in a circadian time-dependent manner. The
   time-dependent oscillation of alpha 2 delta-1 subunit protein correlated
   with fluctuations in the maximal binding capacity of gabapentin. The
   anti-allodynic effect of gabapentin was attenuated at the times of the
   day when alpha 2 delta-1 subunit protein was abundant.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that the dosing time-dependent
   difference in the anti-allodynic effects of gabapentin is attributable
   to the circadian oscillation of alpha 2 delta-1 subunit expression in
   the DRG and indicate that the optimizing its dosing schedule helps to
   achieve rational pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain.}},

Abstract = {{The activity and stability of the tumor suppressor p53 are regulated by
   interactions with key cellular proteins such as MDM2 and CBP/p300. The
   transactivation domain (TAD) of p53 contains two subdomains (AD1 and
   AD2) and interacts directly with the N-terminal domain of MDM2 and with
   several domains of CBP/p300. Here we report the NMR structure of the
   full-length p53 TAD in complex with the nuclear coactivator binding
   domain (NCBD) of CBP. Both the p53 TAD and NCBD are intrinsically
   disordered and fold synergistically upon binding, as evidenced by the
   observed increase in helicity and increased level of dispersion of the
   amide proton resonances. The p53 TAD folds to form a pair of helices
   (denoted P alpha 1 and P alpha 2), which extend from Phe19 to Leu25 and
   from Pro47 to Trp53, respectively. In the complex, the NCBD forms a
   bundle of three helices (C alpha 1, residues 2066-2075; C alpha 2,
   residues 2081-2092; and C alpha 3, residues 2095-2105) with a
   hydrophobic groove into which p53 helices P alpha 1 and P alpha 2 dock.
   The polypeptide chain between the p53 helices remains flexible and makes
   no detectable intermolecular contacts with the NCBD. Complex formation
   is driven largely by hydrophobic contacts that form a stable
   intermolecular hydrophobic core. A salt bridge between D49 of p53 and
   R2105 of NCBD may contribute to the binding specificity. The structure
   provides the first insights into simultaneous binding of the AD1 and AD2
   motifs to a target protein.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging and controlling reactions in molecules and materials at the
   level of electrons is a grand challenge in science, relevant to our
   understanding of charge transfer processes in chemistry, physics, and
   biology, as well as material dynamics. Direct access to the dynamic
   electron density as electrons are shared or transferred between atoms in
   a chemical bond would greatly improve our understanding of molecular
   bonding and structure. Using reaction microscope techniques, we show
   that we can capture how the entire valence shell electron density in a
   molecule rearranges, from molecular-like to atomic-like, as a bond
   breaks. An intense ultra-short laser pulse is used to ionize a bromine
   molecule at different times during dissociation, and we measure the
   total ionization signal and the angular distribution of the ionization
   yield. Using this technique, we can observe density changes over a
   surprisingly long time and distance, allowing us to see that the
   electrons do not localize onto the individual Br atoms until the
   fragments are far apart (similar to 5.5 angstrom), in a region where the
   potential energy curves for the dissociation are nearly degenerate. Our
   observations agree well with calculations of the strong-field ionization
   rates of the bromine molecule.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of
   cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with respect to heart failure
   etiology among patients in the REVERSE (REsynchronization reVErses
   Remodeling in Systolic Left vEntricular Dysfunction) study.
   Background CRT improves outcomes in New York Heart Association
   functional class III/IV heart failure with wide QRS with a more
   pronounced effect on left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling in
   nonischemic patients.
   Methods A total of 277 patients with nonischemic heart disease (IHD) and
   333 with IHD etiology in New York Heart Association functional class I
   or II with QRS >= 120 ms and left ventricular ejection fraction <= 40\%
   received a CRT (+/- implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) and were
   randomized to CRT-ON or CRT-OFF for 12 months. The primary end point was
   the percentage of patients worsened by the HF clinical composite
   response, and multiple prespecified secondary end points were evaluated
   regarding etiology using univariable and multivariable analysis.
   Results At baseline, IHD patients were significantly older and had more
   comorbidities and less dyssynchrony than non-IHD patients. In non-IHD
   patients, 10\% worsened in CRT-ON compared with 19\% in CRT-OFF (p =
   0.01). In IHD patients, 20\% worsened in the CRT-ON compared with 24\%
   in the CRT-OFF group (p = 0.10). Non-IHD patients assigned to CRT-ON
   improved more in left ventricular end-systolic volume index than IHD
   patients. Randomization to CRT, left bundle branch block, and wider QRS
   duration independently predicted response to both end points, whereas
   non-IHD etiology was an independent predictor only for left ventricular
   end-systolic volume index.
   Conclusions This substudy of REVERSE shows that CRT reverses left
   ventricular remodeling with a more extensive effect on nonischemic

Abstract = {{In order to further develop the understanding of photopolymer materials,
   a more complete physical model has become necessary In particular, a
   more accurate description of the photochemical mechanisms occuring
   during the photopolymerization processes is needed Generally, in
   photopolymers the photosensitizer absorbs light of an appropriate
   wavelength, becoming excited and causing the production of primary
   radicals R In free radical polymerization systems the generation of R is
   a key factor in determining how much monomer is polymerized This in turn
   is closely related to the refractive index modulation formed during
   holographic recording In this article we Incorporate a detailed
   photoinitiation model into the nonlocal photopolymerization driven
   diffusion (NPDD) model This model describes the following (1) Photon
   absorption behavior and primary radical generation during initiation,
   (2) nonlocal macro radical chain growth through propagation, (3) oxygen
   diffusion and replenishment for inhibition (4) multiple termination
   mechanisms This extended model is experimentally validated for high
   intensity holographic exposures to a polyvinylalcohol/acrylamide based

Title = {{Energy dependence of elliptic flow from heavy-ion collision models}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW C}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{We have compared the experimental data on charged-particle elliptic flow
   parameter (v(2)) in Au+Au collisions at midrapidity for root s(NN) =
   9.2, 19.6, 62.4, and 200 GeV with results from various models in
   heavy-ion collisions such as the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular
   dynamics (UrQMD) model, a multiphase transport model (AMPT), and
   heavy-ion jet interaction generator (HIJING). We observe that the
   average v(2) (< v(2)>) from the transport model UrQMD agrees well with
   the measurements at root s(NN) = 9.2 GeV but increasingly falls short of
   the experimental < v(2)> values as the beam energy increases. The
   difference in < v(2)> is of the order of 60\% at root s(NN) = 200 GeV.
   The < v(2)> results from HIJING are consistent with zero, while those
   from AMPT with default settings, a model based on HIJING with additional
   initial-and final-state rescattering effects included, give a < v(2)>
   value of about 4\% for all the beam energies studied. This is in
   contrast to an increase in < v(2)> with beam energy for the experimental
   data. A different version of the AMPT model, which includes partonic
   effects and quark coalescence as a mechanism of hadronization, gives
   higher values of < v(2)> among the models studied and is in agreement
   with the measured < v(2)> values at root s(NN) = 200 GeV. These studies
   show that the experimental < v(2)> has substantial contribution from
   partonic interactions at root s(NN) = 200 GeV, whose magnitude reduces
   with decrease in beam energy. We also compare the available data on the
   transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependence of v(2) to those from
   these models.}},

Title = {{Probabilistic principal component analysis for metabolomic data}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Data from metabolomic studies are typically complex and
   high-dimensional. Principal component analysis (PCA) is currently the
   most widely used statistical technique for analyzing metabolomic data.
   However, PCA is limited by the fact that it is not based on a
   statistical model.
   Results: Here, probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) which
   addresses some of the limitations of PCA, is reviewed and extended. A
   novel extension of PPCA, called probabilistic principal component and
   covariates analysis (PPCCA), is introduced which provides a flexible
   approach to jointly model metabolomic data and additional covariate
   information. The use of a mixture of PPCA models for discovering the
   number of inherent groups in metabolomic data is demonstrated. The
   jackknife technique is employed to construct confidence intervals for
   estimated model parameters throughout. The optimal number of principal
   components is determined through the use of the Bayesian Information
   Criterion model selection tool, which is modified to address the high
   dimensionality of the data.
   Conclusions: The methods presented are illustrated through an
   application to metabolomic data sets. Jointly modeling metabolomic data
   and covariates was successfully achieved and has the potential to
   provide deeper insight to the underlying data structure. Examination of
   confidence intervals for the model parameters, such as loadings, allows
   for principled and clear interpretation of the underlying data
   structure. A software package called MetabolAnalyze, freely available
   through the R statistical software, has been developed to facilitate
   implementation of the presented methods in the metabolomics field.}},

Title = {{Multiple mycobacterial antigens are targets of the adaptive immune
   response in pulmonary sarcoidosis}},
Journal = {{RESPIRATORY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease for
   which the association with mycobacteria continues to strengthen. It is
   hypothesized that a single, poorly degradable antigen is responsible for
   sarcoidosis pathogenesis. Several reports from independent groups
   support mycobacterial antigens having a role in sarcoidosis
   pathogenesis. To identify other microbial targets of the adaptive immune
   response, we tested the ability of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to recognize
   multiple mycobacterial antigens.
   Methods: Fifty-four subjects were enrolled in this study: 31 sarcoidosis
   patients, nine non-tuberculosis mycobacterial (NTM) infection controls,
   and 14 PPD- controls. Using flow cytometry, we assessed for Th1 immune
   responses to ESAT-6, katG, Ag85A, sodA, and HSP.
   Results: Alveolar T-cells from twenty-two of the 31 sarcoidosis patients
   produced a CD4+ response to at least one of ESAT-6, katG, Ag85A, sodA,
   or HSP, compared to two of 14 PPD-controls (p = 0.0008) and five of nine
   NTM controls (p = 0.44), while eighteen of the 31 sarcoidosis subjects
   tested produced a CD8+ response to at least one of the mycobacterial
   antigens compared to two of 14 PPD-controls (p = 0.009) and three of
   nine NTM controls (0.26). Not only did the BAL-derived T cells respond
   to multiple virulence factors, but also to multiple, distinct epitopes
   within a given protein. The detection of proliferation upon stimulation
   with the mycobacterial virulence factors demonstrates that these
   responses are initiated by antigen specific recognition.
   Conclusions: Together these results reveal that antigen-specific CD4+
   and CD8+ T cells responses to multiple mycobacterial epitopes are
   present within sites of active sarcoidosis involvement, and that these
   antigen-specific responses are present at the time of diagnosis.}},

   the Flory type scaling approach The numerical SCF modeling indicates
   that the effective exponent of the power law dependence for the height

   within the Flory type approximation This is explained by changing of the
   intramolecular elastic tension distribution upon an increase in grafting
   density The distributions of end and branching points are wide and
   exhibit multiple maxima pointing to a broad distribution in the chain
   stretching This distribution leads to monotonically decreasing overall
   density profiles The theoretical results are in line with experimental

Abstract = {{The main gas phase intermediates, leading the efficient chemical vapor
   deposition (CVD) growth of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), have
   been explored through systematic experimental and theoretical studies.
   The growth efficiencies of the basic radical/neutral species (sp(2) C-2:
   C2H3/C2H4, sp(2) C-2: C2H3/C2H4 sp(3) C-2: C2H5/C2H6, and sp(3) C-1:
   CH3/CH4) have been compared by supplying C2H4, C2H6, and CH4, as carbon
   sources to grow SWCNTs. The gaseous composition of the exhaust was
   analyzed by an in situ direct sampling mass spectrometric technique
   using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)-single photon ionization
   (SPI)-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS). For verification via
   theoretical prediction, a CHEMKIN calculation was performed. A kinetic
   analysis of the experimental and theoretical results was compared with
   thermal decomposition phenomena of the used hydrocarbons, and hence, it
   was concluded that the key gas phase intermediates produced from the
   complex gas phase reactions as a final and efficient species capable of
   initiating the CVD growth of SWCNTs are sp(2)C(2) species, C2H3/C2H4.
   Additional significance is the production of highly pure SWCNTs from
   C2H6 since to date production of either only multiwall carbon nanotubes
   (MWCNTs) or a mixture of MWCNTs and SWCNTs have been reported. This
   result will be beneficial for selecting suitable hydrocarbons for the
   efficient growth of SWCNTs.}},

Abstract = {{The receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (RANK) and its ligand
   RANKL, which belong to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor- ligand
   family, mediate osteoclastogenesis. The crystal structure of the RANKL
   ectodomain (eRANKL) in complex with the RANK ectodomain (eRANK) combined
   with biochemical assays of RANK mutants indicated that three RANK loops
   (Loop1, Loop2, and Loop3) bind to the interface of a trimeric eRANKL.
   Loop3 is particularly notable in that it is structurally distinctive
   from other TNF-family receptors and forms extensive contacts with RANKL.
   The disulfide bond (C125-C127) at the tip of Loop3 is important for
   determining the unique topology of Loop3, and docking E126 close to
   RANKL, which was supported by the inability of C127A or E126A mutants of
   RANK to bind to RANKL. Inhibitory activity of RANK mutants, which
   contain loops of osteoprotegerin (OPG), a soluble decoy receptor to
   RANKL, confirmed that OPG shares the similar binding mode with RANK and
   OPG. Loop3 plays a key role in RANKL binding. Peptide inhibitors
   designed to mimic Loop3 blocked the RANKL-induced differentiation of
   osteoclast precursors, suggesting that they could be developed as
   therapeutic agents for the treatment of osteoporosis and bone-related
   diseases. Furthermore, some of the RANK mutations associated with
   autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO) resulted in reduced
   RANKL-binding activity and failure to induce osteoclastogenesis. These
   results, together with structural interpretation of eRANK-RANKL
   interaction, provided molecular understanding for pathogenesis of ARO.}},

Title = {{Oral tolerance inhibits pulmonary eosinophilia in a cockroach allergen
   induced model of asthma: a randomized laboratory study}},
Journal = {{RESPIRATORY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Antigen desensitization through oral tolerance is becoming
   an increasingly attractive treatment option for allergic diseases.
   However, the mechanism(s) by which tolerization is achieved remain
   poorly defined. In this study we endeavored to induce oral tolerance to
   cockroach allergen (CRA: a complex mixture of insect components) in
   order to ameliorate asthma-like, allergic pulmonary inflammation.
   Methods: We compared the pulmonary inflammation of mice which had
   received four CRA feedings prior to intratracheal allergen sensitization
   and challenge to mice fed PBS on the same time course. Respiratory
   parameters were assessed by whole body unrestrained plethysmography and
   mechanical ventilation with forced oscillation. Bronchoalveolar lavage
   fluid (BAL) and lung homogenate (LH) were assessed for cytokines and
   chemokines by ELISA. BAL inflammatory cells were also collected and
   examined by light microscopy.
   Results: CRA feeding prior to allergen sensitization and challenge led
   to a significant improvement in respiratory health. Airways
   hyperreactivity measured indirectly via enhanced pause (Penh) was
   meaningfully reduced in the CRA-fed mice compared to the PBS fed mice
   (2.3 +/- 0.4 vs 3.9 +/- 0.6; p = 0.03). Directly measured airways
   resistance confirmed this trend when comparing the CRA-fed to the
   PBS-fed animals (2.97 +/- 0.98 vs 4.95 +/- 1.41). This effect was not
   due to reduced traditional inflammatory cell chemotactic factors, Th2 or
   other cytokines and chemokines. The mechanism of improved respiratory
   health in the tolerized mice was due to significantly reduced eosinophil
   numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (43300 +/- 11445 vs 158786
   +/- 38908; p = 0.007) and eosinophil specific peroxidase activity in the
   lung homogenate (0.59 +/- 0.13 vs 1.19 +/- 0.19; p = 0.017). The
   decreased eosinophilia was likely the result of increased IL-10 in the
   lung homogenate of the tolerized mice (6320 +/- 354 ng/mL vs 5190 +/-
   404 ng/mL, p = 0.02).
   Conclusion: Our results show that oral tolerization to CRA can improve
   the respiratory health of experimental mice in a CRA-induced model of
   asthma-like pulmonary inflammation by reducing pulmonary eosinophilia.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: A side effect of diagnostic needle biopsies is the
   possibility to disseminate tumour cells into the needle track, which may
   cause concern in certain malignant tumour types.
   METHODS: In order to prevent tumour cell dissemination we developed a
   technology that uses radiofrequency (RF) pulses to sterilise the needle
   track and denaturate tumour cells. To determine feasibility, we applied
   this technology to fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and used breast
   cancer as a model tumour. Routine FNAB was performed in 88 patients with
   adenocarcinoma and blood droplets passing the skin orifice were
   cytomorphologically analysed for the presence of tumour cells.
   RESULTS: The analysis showed the presence of tumour cells in 65/88 cases
   (74\%). When using an experimental anti-seeding device in a subset of
   patients viable tumour cells were found in 0/31 cases (P<0.001). In all
   31 patients blood passing the skin orifice was sparse. No degrading
   effect on the cytological sample inside the needle was detected and pain
   caused by the RF pulses was comparable to that of the biopsy procedure
   itself.
   CONCLUSION: The herein presented method has the potential to prevent the
   dissemination of viable tumour cells in the needle track and minimize
   bleeding without additional pain or degradation of the aspirate. British

Abstract = {{In this work, we offer a novel and flexible approach of spectral
   switches which can be handled more simply by controlling the phase of
   the diffracted light field of a completely spatially coherent incident
   beam with spectral profile from a one-dimensional phase step. This
   scheme has the benefit of easy implementation by simply varying the
   height of a one-dimensional phase step which causes spectral switches to
   occur when the step height reaches certain critical values without
   modulating any properties of the light source. To illustrate this
   effect, an explicit and analytical expression at an observation point
   corresponding to the step edge is obtained and some numerical examples
   are given and examined experimentally. Finally, based on the obtained
   results, it is shown that this method with the capability of very short
   response time can be easily applied to information encoding and
   transmission. (C) 2010 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{LHC phenomenology of lowest massive Regge recurrences in the

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},

Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{We consider string realizations of the Randall-Sundrum effective theory
   for electroweak symmetry breaking and explore the search for the lowest
   massive Regge excitation of the gluon and of the extra (color singlet)
   gauge boson inherent in D-brane constructions. In these curved
   backgrounds, the higher-spin Regge recurrences of standard model fields
   localized near the IR brane are warped down to close to the TeV range
   and hence can be produced at collider experiments. Assuming that the
   theory is weakly coupled, we make use of four gauge boson amplitudes
   evaluated near the first Regge pole to determine the discovery potential
   of LHC. We study the inclusive dijet mass spectrum in the central
   rapidity region vertical bar y(jet)vertical bar < 1.0 for dijet masses M
   >= 2.5 TeV. We find that with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb(-1),
   the 5 sigma discovery reach can be as high as 4.7 TeV. Observations of
   resonant structures in pp -> direct gamma + jet can provide interesting
   corroboration for string physics up to 3.0 TeV. We also study the ratio
   of dijet mass spectra at small and large scattering angles. We show that
   with the first fb(-1) such a ratio can probe lowest-lying Regge states
   for masses similar to 2.5 TeV.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main drawbacks of the swept source optical coherence
   tomography (SS-OCT) is its limited axial range. A novel interferometer
   configuration is proposed, equipped in each arm with an adjustable path
   length ring. By compensating the losses in the rings using semiconductor
   optical amplifiers, multiple paths A-scans can be obtained which when
   combined axially, can lead to an extremely long overall axial range. The
   effect of the re-circulation loops is equivalent with extending the
   coherence length of the swept source. In this way, the axial imaging
   range in SS-OCT can be pushed well beyond the limit imposed by the
   coherence length of the laser, to exceed in principle many centimeters.

Abstract = {{Room temperature acetalization of aldehydes with methanol has been
   carried out using metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as solid heterogeneous
   catalysts. Of the MOFs tested, a copper-containing MOF {[}Cu-3(BTC)(2)]
   (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) showed better catalytic activity
   than an iron-containing MOF {[}Fe(BTC)] and an aluminium containing MOF
   {[}Al-2(BDC)(3)] (BDC=1,4-benzenedicarboxylate). The protocol was
   validated for a series of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes and used to
   protect various aldehydes into commercially important acetals in good
   yields without the need of water removal. In addition, the reusability
   and heterogeneity of this catalytic system was demonstrated. The
   structural stability of MOF was further studied by characterization with
   powder X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area
   measurements and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopic analysis of
   a deactivated catalyst used to convert a large amount of benzaldehyde.
   The performance of copper MOF as acetalization catalyst compares
   favourably with those of other conventional homogeneous and
   heterogeneous catalysts such as zinc chloride, zeolite and clay.}},

Abstract = {{We performed H-2 plasma treatment of hydrogenated amorphous silicon
   (a-Si:H) thin films and followed by in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry
   measurements the kinetics of hydrogen-induced film modifications at
   temperatures varying from 100 to 250 degrees C. The time-dependence of
   the H-modified layer thickness d(H)(t) follows an exponential relation
   of the form d(H)(0){[}1-exp(-t/tau)]. The temperature-dependence of
   d(H)(0) and tau shows a discontinuity at T=200 degrees C. While the
   activation energy of d(H)(0) changes from 0.19 eV at T<200 degrees C to
   0.05 eV at higher temperatures, the activation energy of tau suddenly
   changes from 0.15 eV to a negative value (-0.26 eV). Such a
   discontinuity should be linked to the thermal equilibrium temperature of
   undoped a-Si:H. Moreover, we found that the rate of formation of the
   H-modified layer r(H)=d(H)(0)/tau varies in inverse proportion to the

Abstract = {{The electronic structure of superoxide KO2 was investigated by employing
   soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and core-level photoemission
   spectroscopy (PES). The clean and single component was observed in both
   the O 1s and K 2p core-level PES spectra of KO2, which confirms the good

   spectrum was compared with the calculated density of states (DOSs),
   obtained from the first-principles electronic-structure calculations
   that include both the spin-orbit (SO) effect and the on-site Coulomb
   interaction (U) between O 2p electrons. In the O 1s XAS, both the
   unoccupied O 2p antibonding pi(g) and sigma(u) states are identified. It
   is found that the unoccupied states, observed in the O 1s XAS, agree
   reasonably well with the calculated DOSs, which suggests the importance
   of the SO and U effects for KO2 having the high-symmetry tetragonal

Title = {{Ectopic T Cell Receptor-alpha Locus Control Region Activity in B Cells
   Is Suppressed by Direct Linkage to Two Flanking Genes at Once}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The molecular mechanisms regulating the activity of the TCR alpha gene
   are required for the production of the circulating T cell repertoire.
   Elements of the mouse TCR alpha locus control region (LCR) play a role
   in these processes. We previously reported that TCR alpha LCR DNA
   supports a gene expression pattern that mimics proper thymus-stage, TCR
   alpha gene-like developmental regulation. It also produces transcription
   of linked reporter genes in peripheral T cells. However, TCR alpha
   LCR-driven transgenes display ectopic transcription in B cells in
   multiple reporter gene systems. The reasons for this important deviation
   from the normal TCR alpha gene regulation pattern are unclear. In its
   natural locus, two genes flank the TCR alpha LCR, TCR alpha (upstream)
   and Dad1 (downstream). We investigated the significance of this gene
   arrangement to TCR alpha LCR activity by examining transgenic mice
   bearing a construct where the LCR was flanked by two separate reporter
   genes. Surprisingly, the presence of a second, distinct, reporter gene
   downstream of the LCR virtually eliminated the ectopic B cell expression
   of the upstream reporter observed in earlier studies. Downstream
   reporter gene activity was unaffected by the presence of a second gene
   upstream of the LCR. Our findings indicate that a gene arrangement in
   which the TCR alpha LCR is flanked by two distinct transcription units
   helps to restrict its activity, selectively, on its 5'-flanking gene,
   the natural TCR alpha gene position with respect to the LCR. Consistent
   with these findings, a TCR alpha/Dad1 locus bacterial artificial
   chromosome dual-reporter construct did not display the ectopic upstream
   (TCR alpha) reporter expression in B cells previously reported for
   single TCR alpha transgenes.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that an ultra-fast CMOS camera combined with a photon
   counting image intensifier can be used to determine photon arrival times
   well below the exposure time of the camera. We can obtain a time
   resolution down to around 1\% of the exposure time, i.e. of the order of
   40 ns with microsecond exposure times. This is achieved by exploiting
   the invariant phosphor decay of the image intensifier's phosphor screen:
   Developing a suitable mathematical framework, we show that the relative
   intensities of the phosphor decay in successive frames following the
   photon detection uniquely determine the photon arrival time. This
   approach opens a way to measuring fast luminescence decays in parallel
   in many pixels. Possible applications include oxygen and ion
   concentration imaging using probes with luminescence lifetimes in the
   range of 100 ns to microseconds. (C) 2010 Optical Society of America}},

   networks were utilized for in situ cobalt nanoparticle synthesis by
   reduction of metal ions absorbed into the hydrogel network with a

   perhaps relaxed through tilting of the imidazole rings and rotation of
   the flexible CH2 spacer, which connects the imidazole ring and the
   glucopyranoside group. The palladium(II) complexes were further
   hydrolyzed to produce water-soluble hydrolysates. Preliminary catalytic
   studies show that these hydrolyzed palladium precatalysts are efficient
   in the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction between phenylboronic acid and a
   hydrophilic substrate, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, in aqua medium. In the
   presence of tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB), these precatalysts
   also display efficient catalytic properties in the reaction of
   phenylboronic acid with both the hydrophilic substrate
   1-chloro-3-nitrobenzene and the hydrophobic substrate 2-chlorophenol. In
   all cases, the catalytic systems are stable, which allow them to be
   reused for at least three cycles. This catalytic system also facilitates
   the separation of products from the catalyst and, therefore, is
   environmentally benign.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of twist during the spinning of carbon nanotubes from
   their arrays (forests) has been widely applied in making ultrastrong,
   stiff and lightweight nanotube fibers. Here, for the first time, an
   important observation of a double-peak behavior of the tensile
   properties, as a function of the twist angle, that is different from the
   single peak of traditional.fibers is reported. Raman spectra show that
   the new peak arises from the collapse of nanotubes, showing a strong
   ``nano{''} element in applying the ancient draw-and-twist technique,
   besides the downsizing. A qualitative continuum model is also presented
   to describe the collapse-induced enhancement as well as traditional
   fibers. Our combined experimental and theoretical studies indicate the
   direction of full utilization of the nano element in improving the
   mechanical properties of nanotube fibers.}},

Abstract = {{The diffusion coefficient of lipid molecules is usually much smaller
   than that of water, and it is demonstrated here how this difference can
   be exploited for robust fat suppression in magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI). In contrast to the prevailing methods, diffusion-based fat
   suppression does not rely on chemical shift differences between water
   and lipids and can therefore be applied easily in low or inhomogeneous
   magnetic fields. It is also independent of relaxation times and can
   therefore be incorporated in experiments requiring conventional
   T-1-weighted contrast. Diffusion-based fat suppression (DIFFSUP)
   consists of subtracting the signals acquired at low and high b-values,
   where the high b-value is ideally designed to achieve full suppression
   of the water and negligible attenuation of the lipid signal. Since high
   b-value images may be particularly affected by motion artifacts, a
   version of DIFFSUP incorporating first-order velocity compensation is
   also proposed and demonstrated. Results from phantoms and live mice at
   field strengths of 4.7 T and 1.0 T are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Isolated cobalt-alcohol cluster anions containing n=1-4 cobalt and m=1-3
   alcohol molecules (alcohol=methanol, ethanol, propanol) are produced in
   a supersonic beam by using a laser ablation source. By applying IR
   photodissociation spectroscopy vibrational spectra in the OH stretching
   region are obtained. Several structures in different spin states are
   discussed for the (n,m) clusters. In comparison with density functional
   theory calculations applied to both the Co/alcohol clusters and the
   naked Co cluster anions, an unambiguous structural assignment is
   achieved. It turns out that structures are preferred with a maximum
   number of hydrogen bonds between the OH groups and the Co center dot
   center dot center dot Co units. These hydrogen bonds are typical for
   anionic species leading to an activation of the OH groups which is
   indicated by large red-shifts of the OH stretching frequencies compared
   to the naked alcohols. For each (n,m) cluster, the frequency shifts
   systematically with respect to the different alcohols, but the type of
   structure is identical for all alcohol ligands. The application of IR
   spectroscopy turns out to be an ideal tool not only as a probe for
   structures but also for spin states which significantly influence the
   predicted OH stretching frequencies. (C) 2010 American Institute of

Abstract = {{AIM: To study the efficacy and safety of entecavir (ETV) as first-line
   therapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation due to
   immunosuppression.
   METHODS: Four patients that were treated with different
   immunosuppressive regimens for hematological malignancies, who presented
   with HBV reactivation were treated with ETV. Clinical outcome,
   biochemical and virological factors, including quantitative hepatitis B
   surface antigen (HBsAg) were studied.
   RESULTS: In all patients, ETV induced suppression of HBV, and rapid
   clinical improvement without side effects. In one patient with an
   alanine aminotransferase (ALT) flare, tenofovir was added after 3 mo of
   treatment. Until death from disease progression at 6 mo after treatment
   initiation, this patient did not clear HBV infection. Retrospectively,
   it is highly probable that the patient had been non-adherent. In the
   other three patients, the virological responses were associated with an
   expeditious decrease in quantitative HBsAg titers with negativity after
   2 mo, and all three had HBsAg seroconversion. In one patient, HBV DNA
   reached a plateau after 3 mo, before becoming undetectable after 1 year,
   despite early ALT normalization and undetectable quantitative HBsAg.
   CONCLUSION: EN seems to be effective and safe treatment for HBV
   reactivation. Monitoring of quantitative HBsAg might be an additional
   useful tool to monitor treatment response. (C) 2010 Baishideng. All

Abstract = {{AIM: To search the independent factors determining gastric juice acidity
   and to investigate the acidity of gastric juices in various benign and
   malignant upper gastrointestinal diseases.
   METHODS: Fasting gastric juice acidity of 165 healthy subjects and 346
   patients with esophageal ulcer (n = 21), gastric ulcer (n = 136),
   duodenal ulcer (n = 100) or gastric cancer (n = 89) were measured and
   compared. Additionally, gastric specimens were taken from the antrum and
   body for rapid urease test and histological examination.
   RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed that bile stain of gastric
   juice, high acute inflammatory score of the corpus, and atrophy of the
   corpus were independent risk factors for the development of gastric
   hypoacidity with odds ratios of 3.1 (95\% CI: 1.3-7.3), 3.1 (95\% CI:
   1.2-7.9) and 3.5 (95\% CI: 1.3-9.2). Esophageal ulcer and duodenal ulcer
   patients had a lower pH level (1.9 and 2.1 vs 2.9, both P < 0.05) of
   gastric juices than healthy subjects. In contrast, gastric ulcer and
   gastric cancer patients had a higher pH level (3.4 and 6.6 vs 2.9, both
   P < 0.001) than healthy controls. Hypoacidity existed in 22\%, 5\%,
   29\%, 5\% and 88\% of healthy subjects, esophageal ulcer, gastric ulcer,
   duodenal ulcer and gastric cancer patients, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: Bile reflux, atrophy and dense neutrophil infiltrate of the

   energies above 10 eV results in the formation of CO2, as revealed by
   TDS. The extended irradiation of a 3 ML film (25 nA, 240 min) results in

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Osteogenesis imperfecta is a rare disease
   with abnormal synthesis of type 1 collagen that affects diverse
   extra-skeletal tissues. Aortic root dilatation and valvular dysfunction
   have been described. Our purpose was to evaluate the prevalence of
   cardiac abnormalities in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta in
   comparison with an age and sex-matched control group of healthy people.
   Patients and methods: We prospectively studied 26 patients with
   osteogenesis imperfecta and compared them with 25 healthy people. All
   patients underwent a transthoracic standard M-mode, 2D and colour
   Doppler study.
   Results: We did not find significant differences between both groups in
   the left ventricular diastolic and systolic function and the incidence
   of valvulopathies. The dimensions of the aortic root, left atrium and
   left ventricle when indexed by body surface area were significantly
   larger in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta compared with the
   control group, which was probably due to the reduced body surface of
   these patients. However there was a significant difference in the aortic
   root/telediastolic diameter of left ventricle ratio independent of the
   body surface, which was higher in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta.
   Conclusions: The incidence of valvular disease in osteogenesis
   imperfecta is similar to that of the normal population. However aortic
   root is larger in the former patients and is related to the left
   ventricular diastolic diameter. (c) 2009 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All

Abstract = {{Nukacin 3299 (formerly designated simulancin 3299), produced by a
   Staphylococcus simulans strain involved in bovine mastitis in Brazil, is
   the first peptide bacteriocin described in this staphylococcal species.
   With the intent to elucidate some aspects of its biology, nukacin 3299
   was purified and characterized. The mass of the purified bacteriocin was
   shown to be 2957.3 Da, and the peptide N-terminal amino acids (KKKSGVI)
   were identified by Edman degradation. The nukacin 3299 structural gene,
   nukA, was detected by PCR and DNA sequencing, showing that this
   bacteriocin is identical to nukacin ISK-1, a 27-amino acid type-A (II)
   lantibiotic produced by Staphylococcus warneri ISK-1, isolated from a
   ``nukadoko{''}, in Japan. The genes involved in nukacin 3299
   biosynthesis are located on plasmid pRJ97 (>27 kb). They have an
   organization similar to that of the nukacin ISK-1 gene cluster, excepted
   for the presence of an IS257/431 element (791 bp) present between the
   orf1 and nukA genes of the nukacin 3299 gene cluster. The presence of
   this insertion sequence is expected to affect the expression of orf1,
   whose function is presently unknown. Nukacin 3299 proved to be sensitive
   to proteolytic enzymes and relatively stable at different temperatures
   and between pH 3.0-9.0. Nukacin 3299 exhibited activity towards
   staphylococcal strains involved in bovine mastitis, showing a potential
   application on mastitis control, a disease with great economic impact.

   payoffs. This holds despite the fact that the stochastic game
   representation of the alternating move repeated game is
   ``non-generic{''} in the larger space of state dependent payoffs. We

Abstract = {{Iron/calcium-hydroxyapatite catalysts containing different amounts of
   iron - Fe(x)/CaHAp - were prepared by cation exchange in aqueous media
   and characterized by XRD, IR, UV-vis, Mossbauer. XPS spectroscopies and
   temperature programmed reduction (TPR). The iron was found in the
   samples exclusively as isolated Fe3+ species distributed in CaHAp
   between distorted octahedral and lower coordination sites.
   These catalysts were tested in butan-2-ol conversion with and without
   oxygen in the reaction mixture. The increase of iron content enhanced
   the acid properties of the catalysts and the butan-2-ol dehydration
   (butenes yield around 55\%) in the presence of O-2. In propane oxidative
   dehydrogenation (ODH), they exhibit good propene selectivity (35-90\%)
   but with limited conversion. The maximum propene yield (6.2\%) is
   obtained at low Fe content whereas the dehydrogenation of butan-2-ol
   into methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) in the presence of dioxygen is much
   higher on pure CaHAp than on Fe(x)/CaHAp. The sites generated at low Fe
   content were identified as Fe3+-O-Ca2+ species. Those sites, contrarily
   to Fe3+-O-Fe3+ which appear at high iron loadings, provide a reasonable
   performance in propane ODH, most likely because they maintain the needed
   basicity for the hydrogen abstraction from the propane. This confirms
   the essential role played by the acid-base properties in the
   dehydrogenation processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   with Y-substituted benzylammes (Y = p-OCH3, p-CH3, H,p-Cl) in MeOH-MeCN
   mixtures were measured by conductometry at 25 degrees C It was observed
   that the rate constant increased in the order of X = NO2>CN>CF3 and in
   the order of Y = p-OCH3>p-CH3>H>p-Cl When the solvent composition was
   varied, the rate constant increased in the order of 100\% MeOH <50\%
   (v/v) MeOH-MeCN < 100\% MeCN These results may be ascribed to the
   formation of hydrogen bonds between the alcoholic hydrogen and nitrogen
   of benzylammes in groud state (GS) We conclude that the reaction takes
   place via SNAr base on the transition state parameters rho x, rho y,
   beta(nuc), and solvent effects}},

Abstract = {{We present a measurement technique to determine the thickness of a
   transparent glass plate (GP) by using a lateral shearing cyclic path
   optical configuration (CPOC) setup and polarization phase shifting
   interferometry (PPSI). In the technique, the GP introduces a
   longitudinal shift in the focus of the beam and, as a result, a
   spherical wavefront emerges from the lens, which is otherwise set for
   producing a collimated beam. Using CPOC, two laterally sheared
   orthogonally polarized beams are generated from the incident spherical
   wavefront. By applying PPSI, the slope of the optical path difference
   variation between the laterally sheared interfering beams is evaluated,
   and the radius of the spherical wavefront and the longitudinal shift of
   the beam focus are calculated. The thickness of the GP is determined
   from the standard relation between the longitudinal shift of the focus
   introduced by the GP and the thickness of the GP. Results obtained for a
   GP of 9.810 mm thickness are presented. (C) 2010 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Background Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common impairment among older
   men, and the prevalence rates increase sharply after age of 60 years
   Most studies have focused on the prevalence rate or dangerouse factors
   The aim of this study was to investigate the basic epidemiologic data
   about ED patients with different ED courses The purpose of this researth
   was to understand the therapeutic effect of phosphodiesterase type 5
   inhibitor (PDE5-I) and see how and why the ED course impact the progress
   of ED and the therapeutic effect of PDE5-I treatment
   Methods From June 2008 to June 2009, 4252 questionnaires (Quality of
   Erection Questionnaire, QEQ) were gathered from 46 centers by urology or
   andrology doctors all around China Patients with ED (age 20 years)
   filled in first half of the questionnaires when they came for the first
   time, and then completed the second half 4 weeks after PDE5-I therapy
   Results ED courses of most patients were less than 5 years (< 5 years,
   740\%, 5-10 years 20 8\%, > 10 years, 52\%) As ED course increasing, the
   incidence of the risk factors of ED, such as smoking, drinking,
   hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and hyperlipidemia also increase
   (P <= 0 01) PDE5-I was effective in improving the quality of sexual
   activities (P 50 01) Administration of PDE5-I improves satisfaction,
   enjoyment and frequency of sexual activities The longer the ED course,
   the worse the therapeutic effect (< 5 years, 96 1\%, 5-10 years, 94 9\%,
   > 10 years, 89 0\%) (P <= 0 01)
   Conclusions The ED course greatly affected the therapeutic effect of
   PDE5-1, the patients with ED should consult doctor at early stage of the
   disease Admistration of PDE5-I effectively improves the penile erection
   and the quality of sexual life of the patients hence should be
   considered as first-line medicine in the treatment of ED Chin Med J

Abstract = {{Brain stroke trauma and motor neuron disease each can result in cortical
   motoneuron (CMN) death or impairment Glutamate excitotoxicity Induces
   motor neuron damage in both acute motor neuron loss and chronic motor
   neuron degeneration It is necessary to find effective strategies to
   protect CMNs from excitotoxicity in a variety of pathological conditions
   5 6-Dihydrocyclopenta-1 2-dithiole-3-thione (CPDT) is one of the phase
   II enzyme inducers In our previous report CPDT was shown to have
   neuroprotective effects on the spinal cord by activating the Nrf2/ARE
   pathway to increase antioxidative capacity In this study in order to
   figure out whether CPDT can prevent CMN s from THA-Induced death, we set
   up an organotypic brain slice culture system Threo-hydroxyaspartate
   (THA) a glutamate transport inhibitor was added to the culture medium to
   induce CMN death by glutamate excitotoxicity Brain slices were
   pretreated with CPDT for 48 h then treated with CPDT and THA
   simultaneously for 3 weeks We found that pretreatment with CPDT
   significantly increased CMN survival Glutamate concentration in the
   culture medium was significantly greater following THA treatment whereas
   no significant decrease was found in the CPDT pretreatment group However
   both Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expression was significantly elevated in the
   CPDT pretreatment group and Nrf2 protein translocated to the nucleus
   after CPDT stimulation These findings suggest that CPDT can protect CMNs
   from THA-Induced motor neuron death by activating the Nrf2 pathway and
   increasing HO-1 protein expression Therefore increasing antioxidative
   defense capacity should benefit to upper motor neuron survival following
   a glutamate excitotoxicity insult (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights

Abstract = {{In the last decades, response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial
   neural network (ANN) has become the most preferred methods for
   non-parametric modeling and optimization of separation processes in
   chemical engineering. This paper presents a comparative study between
   RSM and ANN for reactive extraction optimization. Reactive extraction of
   tartaric acid from aqueous solution using Amberlite LA-2 (amine) has
   been chosen as the case study. The extraction efficiency was modeled and
   optimized as a function of three input variables, i.e. tartaric acid
   concentration in aqueous phase C(AT) (g/L), pH of aqueous solution and
   amine concentration in organic phase C(A/O) (\% v/v). Both methodologies
   have been compared for their modeling and optimization abilities.
   According to analysis of variance (ANOVA) the coefficient of multiple
   determination of 0.841 was obtained for RSM and 0.974 for ANN. The
   optimal conditions offered by RSM and genetic algorithm (GA) have led to
   an experimental extraction efficiency of 83.06\%.
   On the other hand, the ANN model coupled with GA has conducted to an
   experimental reactive extraction efficiency of 96.08\% for the following
   optimal conditions of {*}C(AT)=5.58 g/L; ({*})pH 1.84 and
   ({*})C(A/O)=6.99 (\% v/v). The value of 96.08\% is the maximal value of
   extraction efficiency obtained throughout this work. Thus, ANN-GA has
   demonstrated the ability to overcome the limitation of quadratic
   polynomial model in solving optimization problem for this case study.
   Both models have been employed for construction of response/output
   surface plots in order to reveal the influence of input variables on
   extraction efficiency as well as to figure out the interaction effects
   between variables. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have spectroscopically discovered a pair of twin, nitrogen-type,
   hydrogen-rich, Wolf-Rayet stars (WN8-9h) that are both surrounded by
   circular, mid-infrared-bright nebulae detected with the Spitzer Space
   Telescope and MIPS instrument. The emission is probably dominated by a
   thermal continuum from cool dust, but alsomay contain contributions from
   atomic line emission. There is no counterpart at shorter Spitzer/IRAC
   wavelengths, indicating a lack of emission from warm dust. The two
   nebulae are probably wind-swept stellar ejecta released by the central
   stars during a prior evolutionary phase. The nebulae partially overlap
   on the sky and we speculate on the possibility that they are in the
   early stage of a collision. Two other evolved massive stars have also
   been identified within the area subtended by the nebulae, including a
   carbon-type Wolf-Rayet star (WC8) and an O7-8 III-I star, the latter of
   which appears to be embedded in one of the larger WN8-9h nebulae. The
   derived distances to these stars imply that they are coeval members of
   an association lying 4.9 +/- 1.2 kpc from Earth, near the intersection
   of the Galaxy's Long Bar and the Scutum-Centaurus spiral arm. This new
   association represents an unprecedented display of complex interactions
   between multiple stellar winds, outflows, and the radiation fields of
   evolved massive stars.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the requirements of lithium-air cathodes, which
   directly influence discharge capacity The cathodes of Li-air cell are
   made by using five different carbon materials, such as Ketjen black
   EC600JD, Super P, Ketjen black EC300JD, Denka black, and Ensaco 250G The
   Ketjen black EC600JD provides discharge capacity of 2600 mAh/g per
   carbon weight, while that of Ensaco 2500 shows only 579 mAh/g To figure
   out the differences of discharge capacity from carbon materials, their
   surface area and pore volume are analyzed These are found out to be the
   critical factors in determining discharge capacity Furthermore, carbon
   loading on Ni foam and amounts of electrolyte are significant factors
   that affect discharge capacity In order to investigate catalyst effect,
   electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD) is incorporated and delivered 4307
   mAh/g per carbon weight This infers that EMD facilitates to break O-2

Abstract = {{Saquinavir (SQV) is a weak base compound, whose solubility is strongly
   influenced by pH variations. Thus, in the present work, we thought it
   worthy of interest to investigate in-depth the combined effect of pH
   control and cyclodextrin (CyD) complexation on SQV solubilization.
   Phase-solubility studies were performed by adding excess drug to
   buffered (pH from 1.1 to 7.4) aqueous solutions containing increasing
   concentrations of Methyl-Beta-CyD (M-beta-CyD) in order to evaluate the
   role of the unionized species of SQV in improving solubility by CyD
   complexation and to be able to select the most suitable conditions for
   optimizing drug solubilization. Our study reveals that the integrated
   approach of pH adjustment and CyD complexation can be successfully used
   for improving the CyD solubilizing power towards an ionizable drug such
   as SQV, thus allowing a smaller quantity of CyD to solubilize a given
   amount of drug, offering clear economic and technologic advantages as
   well.
   When biopharmaceutics of the optimized cyclodextrin-based formulation of
   SQV was studied in Wistar rats after intravenous and oral
   administrations, we found that inclusion of SQV into M-beta-CyD could
   dramatically improve its oral bioavailability and decrease the variation
   of its oral pharmacokinetics. Compared to the control, the presence of
   M-beta-CyD significantly increased the area under the plasma
   concentration-time curve (439.7 +/- 161.35 to 2312.03 +/- 159.53, p <
   0.01) and the peak plasma concentration (117.24 +/- 35.77 to 1347.88 +/-
   276.76, p < 0.01) of orally administered SQV.
   The modulating effect of M-beta-CyD on the bidirectional transport of
   SQV was also investigated using a modified Ussing chamber system. The
   results demonstrated that the enhancing effect of M-beta-CyD on the oral
   bioavailability of SQV is due not only to its solubilizing effect on SQV
   but also, at least in part, to the inhibitory effect of M-beta-CyD on
   the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated efflux of SQV in the gastrointestinal
   tract.
   The present results suggest that M-beta-CyD is particularly useful in
   designing oral preparations of SQV with an enhanced bioavailability and
   a reduced variability in absorption. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Boltzmann transport equation using an expansion of the distribution
   function in spherical harmonics. A complexity analysis shows that
   traditional implementations using higher-order expansions suffer from
   huge memory requirements, especially for two- and three-dimensional
   devices. To overcome these complexity limitations, a compressed matrix
   storage scheme using Kronecker products is proposed, which reduces the
   asymptotic memory requirements for the storage of the system matrix
   significantly. The total memory requirements are then dominated by the
   memory required for the unknowns. Numerical results demonstrate the

Abstract = {{This paper describes the use of Bayesian latent variable models in the
   context of studies investigating the short term effects of air pollution
   on health Traditional Poisson or quasi-likelihood regression models used
   in this area assume that consecutive outcomes are independent (although
   the latter allows for overdispersion), which in many studies may be an
   untenable assumption as temporal correlation is to be expected We
   compare this traditional approach with two Bayesian latent process
   models, which acknowledge the possibility of short-term autocorrelation
   These include an autoregressive model that has previously been used in
   air pollution studies and an alternative based on a moving average
   structure that we describe here A simulation study assesses the
   performance of these models when there are different forms of
   autocorrelation in the data Although estimated risks are largely
   unbiased, the results show that assuming Independence can produce
   confidence intervals that are too narrow Failing to account for the
   additional uncertainty which may be associated with (positive)
   correlation can result in confidence/credible intervals being too narrow
   and thus lead to Incorrect conclusions being made about the significance
   of estimated risks The methods are Illustrated within a case study of

Abstract = {{New complex {[}Mn(II)H-1 L-5](2){[}Mn(II)H3L](2)(ClO4)(5) 3H(2)O (1),
   where H3L is tris\{2-(4-imidazolyl)methyliminoethyl\} amine (imtren),
   has been prepared by reacting manganese(II) perchlorate hexahydrate with
   the imtren ligand in methanol X-ray crystallographic study revealed that
   the imtren ligand hexadentately binds to Mn(II) ion through the three
   Schiff-base imine N atoms and three imidazole N atoms with a distorted
   octahedral geometry and the apical tertiary amine N atom of the ligand
   pseudo-coordinates to Mn(II), forming overall a pseudo-seven
   coordination environment The hydrogen-bonds between imidazole and
   imidazolate of {[}Mn(II)H-1 L-5] (0 5+) complex ions are extended to
   build a 2D puckered network with trigonal voids {[}Mn(II)H3L](2+)
   complex ions constitutes another extended 2D puckered layer without
   hydrogen bonds Two layers are wedged each other to constitute overall
   stack of the crystal Peroxidase activity of complex 1 was examined by
   observing the oxidation of
   2,2'-azinobis(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) with
   hydrogen peroxide in the presence of complex 1 Generation of ABTS(+) was
   observed by UV-vis and EPR spectroscopies indicating that the complex 1,
   a fully-coordinated mononuclear Mn(II) complex with nitrogen-only
   ligand, has a heme-independent peroxidase activity}},

Abstract = {{Galaxy formation is significantly modulated by energy output from
   supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies which grow in highly
   efficient luminous quasar phases. The timescale on which black holes
   transition into and out of such phases is, however, unknown. We present
   the first measurement of the shutdown timescale for an individual quasar
   using X-ray observations of the nearby galaxy IC 2497, which hosted a
   luminous quasar no more than 70,000 years ago that is still seen as a
   light echo in ``Hanny's Voorwerp,{''} but whose present-day radiative
   output is lower by at least two, and more likely by over four, orders of
   magnitude. This extremely rapid shutdown provides new insight into the
   physics of accretion in supermassive black holes and may signal a
   transition of the accretion disk to a radiatively inefficient state.}},

Title = {{Properties and distribution of paired candidate stony meteorites at
   Meridiani Planum, Mars}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{The Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity investigated four rocks,
   informally dubbed Barberton, Santa Catarina, Santorini, and Kasos, that
   are possible stony meteorites. Their chemical and mineralogical
   composition is similar to the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite group
   but with additional metal, similar to mesosiderite silicate clasts.
   Because of their virtually identical composition and because they appear
   to represent a relatively rare group of meteorites, they are probably
   paired. The four rocks were investigated serendipitously several
   kilometers apart, suggesting that Opportunity is driving across a larger
   population of similar rock fragments, maybe a meteorite strewn field.
   Small amounts of ferric Fe are a result of weathering. We did not
   observe evidence for fusion crusts. Four iron meteorites were found
   across the same area. Although mesosiderites are stony irons, a genetic
   link to these irons is unlikely. The stony meteorites probably fell
   later than the irons. The current atmosphere is sufficiently dense to
   land such meteorites at shallow entry angles, and it would disperse
   fragments over several kilometers upon atmospheric breakup.
   Alternatively, dispersion by spallation from an impacting meteoroid may
   have occurred. Santa Catarina and a large accumulation of similar rocks
   were found at the rim of Victoria crater. It is possible that they are
   associated with the impactor that created Victoria crater, but our
   limited knowledge about their distribution cannot exclude mere
   coincidence.}},

   coupling reaction of the diethyl vinylphosphonate with aryl or

   (1.3 mol\% {[}Pd(NH(3))(4)]/NaY, DMF. K(2)CO(3), 110-140 degrees C),
   various aryl and heteroaryl halides were engaged in this reaction
   leading in all cases good to high yields. Interestingly, when using
   activated aryl bromides the palladium loading could be lowered to only
   0.25 mol\%. While highly active when coupling aryl iodides (i.e. only
   0.15 mol\% required), the PdO/SiO(2) catalyst was found to be inactive
   when considering aryl bromides. Deep study of this catalytic material
   revealed that in the case of aryl bromides, absence of in situ reduction
   of the catalyst precursor prevents the cross-coupling reaction with this
   latter material. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The avian H5N1 influenza virus has the potential to cause a new
   pandemic. The increasing number of recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic
   avian influenza H5N1 in birds and humans emphasizes the urgent need to
   develop a potent H5N1 vaccine. Here, we studied the immunogenicity and
   protective effect of a vaccine prepared from H5N1 inactivated whole
   virus. This vaccine was intranasally co-administered in mice with
   phosphate buffered saline, recombinant cholera toxin B subunit (rCTB),
   cholera toxin (CT), rCTB containing a trace amount of holotoxin
   (rCTB/CT), polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid double-stranded RNA
   (polyI:C), or MF59 as an adjuvant. Intranasal administration of H5N1
   inactivated whole virus vaccine with rCTB, CT, rCTB/CT, polyI:C, and
   MF59 elicited an immunological response with both secretory IgA (sIgA)
   in nasal, lung, and vaginal lavage, and IgG antibody in serum, showing
   protective immunity against lethal H5N1 infection. Cross-clade
   protection was also observed in animals immunized with a vaccine derived
   from Anhui/01/2005(H5N1) with rCTB, CT, rCTB/CT, polyI:C, or MF59 as

Abstract = {{Grain filling, a crucial stage of grain yield formation in rice, is
   usually affected by the panicle nitrogen (N) fertilization. Field and
   pot culture experiments were conducted to explore the underlying
   mechanisms of N effect. Two rice cultivars with high lodging resistance
   were grown in the field and pot. Four panicle N fertilization treatments
   were conducted in 2006 and repeated in 2007. The result showed that
   medium level of panicle N fertilization treatment (NM) enhanced the
   accumulation and translocation of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) in
   the stem and sheath. Compared with non-nitrogen treatment (N0), NM
   promoted the translocation of labeled C-13 from stem and sheath to
   grain. But, low level of panicle N fertilization treatment (NL) and high
   level of panicle N fertilization treatment (NH) showed the negative
   effect. The endosperm cell, grain length, and grain width of NM
   increased more quickly than that of NO from 4 to 10 d after anthesis.
   During the early period of grain filling, sucrose-phosphate synthase (EC
   2.4.1.14, SPS) activity were significantly higher for the NM treatment
   than those of the NL and NH treatments. Sucrose synthase (EC 2.4.1.13,
   SuSase) activity in the grains was substantially enhanced by NM, with
   the duration of higher activity being longer than those of the other
   treatments. At maturing stage, NM significantly increased the filled
   grain number, the seed-setting rate, and the grain weight compared with
   NL and NH. The results suggest that NM have a positive effect on the
   activities of enzymes of physiological importance, thereby increasing
   the grain size and promoting grain filling.}},

Abstract = {{In preparation of inorganic particles filled polymer membranes, coupling
   agents can help to improve the compatibility between inorganic filler
   and polymer matrix. In this paper, surface modification of silicalite-1
   was performed by a coupling agent, vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS), and
   hybrid pervaporation membranes were prepared by incorporating the
   unmodified or VTMS-modified silicalite-1 into polydimethylsiloxane
   (PDMS). The VTMS-modified silicalite-1 particles and hybrid membranes
   were characterized by FT-IR, Si-29 CP MAS NMR, DSC, TGA, XRD and SEM.
   The results showed that the coupling agent VTMS was readily grafted on
   the surface of silicalite-1 by hydrolysis reaction and condensation
   reaction, and the chemical linking between the -CH=CH2 group on the
   surface-modified silicalite-1 and -Si-H on the PDMS substantially
   eliminated the nonselective voids inside the membrane. When used to
   separate acetone, butanol, ethanol (ABE) from aqueous solution, a higher
   selectivity was obtained with the VTMS-modified silicalite-1/PDMS hybrid
   membrane. Moreover, the surface modification of silicalite-1 improved
   its dispersion in PDMS and increased the maximal loading of silicalite-1
   in membrane preparation, and thus further enhanced the separation factor
   of the membrane. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The exponential blueshift associated with the event horizon of a black
   hole makes conformal symmetry play a fundamental role in accounting for
   its thermal properties. Using a derivation based on two-point functions,
   we show that the full spectrum of thermal radiation of scalar particles
   by Kerr black holes can be explicitly derived on the basis of a
   conformal symmetry arising in the wave equation near the horizon. The
   simplicity of our approach emphasizes the depth of the connection
   between conformal symmetry and black hole radiance.}},

Abstract = {{The U21 open reading frame from human herpesvirus-7 encodes a membrane
   protein that associates with and redirects class I MHC molecules to the
   lysosomal compartment. The mechanism by which U21 accomplishes this
   trafficking excursion is unknown. Here we have examined the contribution
   of localization, glycosylation, domain structure, and the absence of
   substrate class I MHC molecules on the ability of U21 to traffic to
   lysosomes. Our results suggest the existence of a cellular protein
   necessary for U21-mediated rerouting of class I MHC molecules.}},

Pages = {{571-576}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{In an attempt to discover novel adipokines, we performed proteomics
   analyses using culture medium from differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and
   first identified GM2AP The levels of GM2AP mRNA and protein were
   augmented by adipogenesis in cultured adipocytes and expression in
   adipose tissue and serum of obese mice or human subjects was found to be
   significantly higher than in lean counterparts. Exposure of 3T3-L1
   adipocytes to GM2AP protein accelerated dissociation of insulin
   receptor-beta (IR beta) from caveolin-1, and interrupted insulin signal
   transduction Abrogation of GM2AP function by specific antibodies
   augmented glucose uptake. Furthermore, treatment of rat pheochromocytoma
   PC12 NS1 cells with GM2AP impaired NGF signal transduction Taken
   together, these results provide novel insights into the physiological
   functions of GM2AP in obesity (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the metal-assisted electrochemical etching of silicon is
   introduced. By electrochemical measurement and sequent simulation, it is
   revealed that the potential of the valence band maximum at the
   silicon/metal interface is more negative than that of the
   silicon/electrolyte interface. Accordingly, holes injected from the back
   contact are driven preferentially to the silicon/metal interface.
   Consequently, silicon below metal is electrochemically etched much
   faster than a naked silicon surface without metal coverage. Metals such
   as Ag and Cu have been utilized to catalyze the electrochemical etching.
   Feature sizes as small as 30 nm can be achieved by metal-assisted
   electrochemical etching. Meanwhile, the metal-assisted electrochemical
   etching method enables convenient control over the etching direction of
   non-(100) substrates, and facilitates the fabrication of
   orientation-modulated silicon nanostructures.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Resonances in the superconducting properties, in a regime of crossover
   from BCS to mixed Bose-Fermi superconductivity, are investigated in a
   two-band superconductor where the chemical potential is tuned near the
   band edge of the second miniband generated by quantum confinement
   effects. The shape resonances at T=0 in the superconducting gaps
   (belonging to the class of Feshbach-like resonances) is manifested by
   interference effects in the superconducting gap at the first large Fermi
   surface when the chemical potential is in the proximity of the band edge
   of the second miniband. The case of a superlattice of quantum wells is
   considered and the amplification of the superconducting gaps at the
   Lifshitz transition of the type neck-collapsing of Fermi surface
   topology is clearly shown. The results are found to be in good agreement
   with available experimental data on a superlattice of honeycomb boron
   layers intercalated by Al and Mg spacer layers.}},

Title = {{Biodiversity of the Deep-Sea Continental Margin Bordering the Gulf of
   Maine (NW Atlantic): Relationships among Sub-Regions and to Shelf
   Systems}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: In contrast to the well-studied continental shelf region of
   the Gulf of Maine, fundamental questions regarding the diversity,
   distribution, and abundance of species living in deep-sea habitats along
   the adjacent continental margin remain unanswered. Lack of such
   knowledge precludes a greater understanding of the Gulf of Maine
   ecosystem and limits development of alternatives for conservation and
   management.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We use data from the published
   literature, unpublished studies, museum records and online sources, to:
   (1) assess the current state of knowledge of species diversity in the
   deep-sea habitats adjacent to the Gulf of Maine (39-43 degrees N, 63-71
   degrees W, 150-3000 m depth); (2) compare patterns of taxonomic
   diversity and distribution of megafaunal and macrofaunal species among
   six distinct sub-regions and to the continental shelf; and (3) estimate
   the amount of unknown diversity in the region. Known diversity for the
   deep-sea region is 1,671 species; most are narrowly distributed and
   known to occur within only one sub-region. The number of species varies
   by sub-region and is directly related to sampling effort occurring
   within each. Fishes, corals, decapod crustaceans, molluscs, and
   echinoderms are relatively well known, while most other taxonomic groups
   are poorly known. Taxonomic diversity decreases with increasing distance
   from the continental shelf and with changes in benthic topography. Low
   similarity in faunal composition suggests the deep-sea region harbours
   faunal communities distinct from those of the continental shelf.
   Non-parametric estimators of species richness suggest a minimum of 50\%
   of the deep-sea species inventory remains to be discovered.
   Conclusions/Significance: The current state of knowledge of biodiversity
   in this deep-sea region is rudimentary. Our ability to answer questions
   is hampered by a lack of sufficient data for many taxonomic groups,
   which is constrained by sampling biases, life-history characteristics of
   target species, and the lack of trained taxonomists.}},

Abstract = {{The human secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) is an 11 7 kD
   cysteine-rich protein that has been shown to possess anti-protease,
   anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties By using a Pichia
   pastoris strain that overproduces protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), we
   obtained greater than fivefold higher levels of SLPI than in strains
   expressing normal levels of PDI and containing multiple copies of the
   SLPI gene Elevated levels of PDI also enhanced the specific activity of
   the secreted SLPI by helping it achieve a proper tertiary structure Mass
   spectrometry analysis indicated a greater number of disulfide bonds in
   the SLPI produced by the PDI overexpression strain compared to the SLPI
   produced in strains with normal PDI levels Although others have utilized
   a similar strategy to increase yield, we believe that this is the first
   example of PDI overexpression being demonstrated to enhance the folding
   and thus increase the biological activity of a protein produced in the

   Selective substitution of the unsymmetrical isotruxene core with two
   diarylamino donors and one cyanocarboxylic acid acceptor was achieved by
   using a prefunctionalized dibromoisotruxene building block The
   ortho-para-branched isotruxene core allows strong electronic couplings

   dyes display reversible anodic waves in cyclic voltammagrams with both

   fabricated with these cone-shaped organic dyes exhibited high
   open-circuit voltages (0 67-0 76 V) and fill factors (0 67-0 72) with a

Abstract = {{Na+-coupled ascorbic acid transporter-2 (SVCT2) activity is impaired at
   acid pH, but little is known about the molecular determinants that
   define the transporter pH sensitivity. SVCT2 contains six histidine
   residues in its primary sequence, three of which are exofacial in the
   transporter secondary structure model. We used site-directed mutagenesis
   and treatment with diethylpyrocarbonate to identify histidine residues
   responsible for SVCT2 pH sensitivity. We conclude that five histidine
   residues, His(109), His(203), His(206), His(269), and His(413), are
   central regulators of SVCT2 function, participating to different degrees
   in modulating pH sensitivity, transporter kinetics, Na+ cooperativity,
   conformational stability, and subcellular localization. Our results are
   compatible with a model in which (i) a single exofacial histidine
   residue, His413, localized in the exofacial loop IV that connects
   transmembrane helices VII-VIII defines the pH sensitivity of SVCT2
   through a mechanism involving a marked attenuation of the activation by
   Na+ and loss of Na+ cooperativity, which leads to a decreased V-max
   without altering the transport K-m; (ii) exofacial histidine residues
   His(203), His(206), and His(413) may be involved in maintaining a
   functional interaction between exofacial loops II and IV and influence
   the general folding of the transporter; (iii) histidines 203, 206, 269,
   and 413 affect the transporter kinetics by modulating the apparent
   transport K-m; and (iv) histidine 109, localized at the center of
   transmembrane helix I, might be fundamental for the interaction of SVCT2
   with the transported substrate ascorbic acid. Thus, histidine residues
   are central regulators of SVCT2 function.}},

Abstract = {{A new mode of liquid-phase microextraction based on a ferrofluid has
   been developed. The ferrofluid was composed of silica-coated magnetic
   particles and 1-octanol as the extractant solvent. The 1-octanol was
   firmly confined within the silica-coated particles, preventing it from
   being lost during extraction. Sixteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs) were used as model compounds in the development and evaluation of
   the extraction procedure in combination with gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry. Parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were
   investigated in detail. The optimal conditions were as follows: 20 mL
   sample volume, 10 mg of the silica-coated magnetic particles (28 mg of
   ferrofluid), agitation at 20 Hz, 20 min extraction time, and 2 min by
   sonication with 100 mu L acetonitrile as the final extraction solvent.
   Under optimal extraction conditions, enrichment factors ranging from
   102- to 173-fold were obtained for the analytes. The limits of detection
   and the limits of quantification were in the range of 16.8 and 56.7 pg
   mL(-1) and 0.06 and 0.19 ng mL(-1), respectively. The linearities were
   between 0.5-100 and 1-100 ng mL(-1) for different PAHs. As the
   ferrofluid can respond to and be attracted by a magnet, the extraction
   can be easily achieved by reciprocating movement of an external magnet
   that served to agitate the sample. No other devices were needed in this
   new approach of extraction. This new technique is affordable, efficient
   and convenient for microextraction, and offers portability for potential
   onsite extraction. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Auxin is a crucial phytohormone for precise control of growth and
   development of plants. Due to its low concentration in plant tissues
   which are rich in interfering substances, the accurate determination of
   auxins remains a challenge. In this paper, a new strategy for isolation
   and enrichment of auxins from plant tissues was obtained by the magnetic
   molecularly imprinted polymer (mag-MIP) beads, which were prepared by
   microwave heating initiated suspension polymerization using
   indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) as template. In order to obtain higher
   selective recognition cavities, an enhanced imprinting method based on
   binary functional monomers, 4-vinylpyridine (4-VP) and beta-cyclodextrin
   (beta-CD), was adopted for IAA imprinting. The morphological and
   magnetic characteristics of the mag-MIP beads were characterized by
   scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
   and vibrating sample magnetometry. A majority of resultant beads were
   within the size range of 80-150 mu m. Porous surface morphology and good
   magnetic property were observed. Furthermore, the mag-MIP beads
   fabricated with 4-VP and beta-CD as binary functional monomers exhibited
   improved recognition ability to IAA, as compared with the mag-MIP beads
   prepared with the individual monomer separately. Competitive rebinding
   experiment results revealed that the mag-MIP beads exhibited a higher
   specific recognition for the template than the non-imprinted polymer
   (mag-NIP) beads. An extraction method by mag-MIP beads coupled with high
   performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed for determination
   of IAA and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) in plant tissues. Linear ranges
   for IAA and IBA were in the range of 7.00-100.0 mu g L-1 and 10.0-100.0
   mu g L-1, and the detection limits were 3.9 and 7.4 mu g L-1,
   respectively. The analytical performance was also estimated by seedlings
   or immature embryos samples from three different plant tissues, pea,
   rice and wheat. Recoveries were in the range of 70.1-93.5\%. The results
   show that the present imprinting method is a promising approach for
   preparation of selective adsorbents for sample preparation of auxin
   analysis in plant tissues. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Earlier studies suggest that aerosol-cloud interactions may have
   contributed to the increase in surface air temperature recently observed
   in the Arctic. While those studies focused on longwave effects of strong
   pollution events around Barrow, Alaska, we use a global climate model
   (CAM-Oslo) to study the annual and seasonal net radiative effect of
   aerosol-cloud interactions over the entire Arctic region. The model is
   validated against and adjusted to match observations from the Surface
   Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean campaign along with measuring stations
   within the Arctic region. Several sensitivity experiments were conducted
   which included changes in both cloud properties and aerosol
   concentrations. Results show that the longwave indirect effect at the
   surface lies between 0.10 and 0.85 W/m(2) averaged annually north of 71
   degrees N, while the shortwave indirect effect lies between -1.29 W/m(2)
   and -0.52 W/m(2). Due to longwave dominance in winter, 6 of 11
   simulations give a positive change in net cloud forcing between October
   and May (-0.16 to 0.29 W/m(2)), while the change in forcing averaged
   over the summer months is negative for all model simulations (from -2.63
   to -0.23 W/m(2)). The annually averaged change in net cloud forcing at
   the surface is negative in 10 of 11 simulations, lying between -0.98 and
   0.12 W/m(2). In conclusion, our results point to a small decrease in the
   surface radiative flux due to the aerosol indirect effect in the Arctic,
   but these estimates are subject to uncertainties in the frequency of
   thin clouds and biases in the estimated cloud cover.}},

Abstract = {{Cement dust pollution is one of the sources of atmospheric pollution.
   The main impacts of the cement activity to the environment are the
   broadcasts of dusts and gases. The objective of this study is to
   determine the effects of cement dust pollution, which was generated by
   cement plant, on soil microbial population, microbial respiration, and
   some enzyme activities in cultivated wheat (CT) and no-till (NT) soils.
   The fields are located at distances of 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15 km away
   from the cement plant. In dominant wind direction, three replicated 36
   soil samples were taken from a depth of 0 to 20 cm and analyzed for
   chemical, physical and microbiological properties. Soil microbial
   population and CO2-C production showed significant (p < 0.05) positive
   correlation in CT and NT soils. The highest microbial population and
   CO2-C production was observed at 15 km away from the cement plant in CT
   and NT soils. Acid phosphatase, urease and dehydrogenase enzyme
   activities of the soils showed significant (p < 0.01) positive
   correlation with distance in CT and NT (r(2) = 0.80-0.86; r(2) = 0.90 to
   0.92; r(2) = 0.79 to 0.82, respectively). There was negative correlation
   between alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity and distance in CT and NT

Abstract = {{A general method to treat non-Gaussian vacuum wave functionals in the
   Hamiltonian formulation of a quantum field theory is presented. By means
   of Dyson-Schwinger techniques, the static Green functions are expressed
   in terms of the kernels arising in the Taylor expansion of the exponent
   of the vacuum wave functional. These kernels are then determined by
   minimizing the vacuum expectation value of the Hamiltonian. The method
   is applied to Yang-Mills theory in Coulomb gauge, using a vacuum wave
   functional whose exponent contains up to quartic terms in the gauge

Abstract = {{Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) due to warm-acting IgA autoantibodies
   is rare. We explored the pathogenic mechanisms underlying destruction of
   red blood cells (RBCs) in a patient with severe AIHA mediated
   exclusively by polymeric immunoglobulin A (pIgA) anti-Band 3
   autoantibodies. The follow-up period was 17 months. RBCs were not
   destroyed by complement activation as no deposition of complement was
   observed on the patient's RBCs. pIgA eluted from the patient's RBCs did
   not induce RBC destruction through phagocytosis by monocytes or
   antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity by natural killer cells.
   Induction of eryptosis (ie, RBC apoptosis) due to direct alteration of
   the RBC membrane by pIgA autoantibodies was also excluded. By contrast,
   upon incubation with pIgA-opsonized RBCs, substantial RBC membrane
   transfers (ie, trogocytosis) to monocytes were observed that might
   contribute to RBC immune destruction. This effect was poorly inhibited
   by blockers of Fc receptors, excluding a major contribution of Fc alpha
   RI to this process. Histologic analysis revealed a massive accumulation
   of agglutinated RBCs with little sign of erythrophagocytosis in the
   spleen. These results, together with the efficacy of splenectomy 17
   months after AIHA onset, suggest that the trapping and subsequent
   sequestration of agglutinated RBCs in the spleen are the principal
   pathogenic mechanisms of pIgA-mediated AIHA.

Abstract = {{High-resolution (2 km and hourly) observations of surface currents from
   High-Frequency Radars are analyzed in terms of sea level anomalies (SLA)
   and compared with data from two satellite altimeter ground tracks.
   Purpose is to investigate whether ocean submesoscale processes can be
   observed with satellite altimetry. Our results highlight two major
   problems that must be overcome before being able to resolve submesoscale
   processes with altimetry: (i) signal contamination from high-frequency
   motions and in particular from incoherent internal tides (near-inertial
   oscillations have no effect on SLA), and (ii) measurement noise which
   prevents the computation of accurate cross-track currents on scales O
   (10 km). The latter may be overcome by future satellite altimeter
   missions, but the former will require taking into account the effect of
   mesoscale variability on internal tide propagation in regions where
   internal tides are significant. Citation: Chavanne, C. P., and P. Klein

Abstract = {{Protein unfolding in aqueous solution is usually accompanied by an

   unfolding (Delta C-p) are unusual in comparison to values observed for
   order-disorder (melting) transitions in other organic substances. The
   consequences for protein stability, including cold denaturation,
   enthalpy-entropy compensation, and the temperature of maximum stability,
   may seem counterintuitive but should not be unexpected. Nevertheless,

   structural modifications of ARS, the coating also concentrates the
   hydrophobic dye close enough to the SERS active interface enabling the
   observation of excellent Raman spectra of ARS in aqueous environment at

Abstract = {{Finding an effective treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains
   a challenge, and all cellular processes that are deregulated in AML
   cells should be considered in the design of targeted therapies. We show
   in our current study that the LKB1/AMPK/TSC tumor suppressor axis is
   functional in AML and can be activated by the biguanide molecule
   met-formin, resulting in a specific inhibition of mammalian target of
   rapamycin (mTOR) catalytic activity. This induces a multisite
   dephosphorylation of the key translation regulator, 4E-BP1, which
   markedly inhibits the initiation step of mRNA translation. Consequently,
   metformin reduces the recruitment of mRNA molecules encoding oncogenic
   proteins to the polysomes, resulting in a strong antileukemic activity
   against primary AML cells while sparing normal hematopoiesis ex vivo and
   significantly reducing the growth of AML cells in nude mice. The
   induction of the LKB1/AMPK tumor-suppressor pathway thus represents a
   promising new strategy for AML therapy. (Blood. 2010;116(20):4262-4273)}},

Abstract = {{Autophagy influences numerous cellular processes, including innate and
   adaptive immunity against intracellular pathogens. However, some
   viruses, including dengue virus (DENV), usurp autophagy to enhance their
   replication. The mechanism for a positive role of autophagy in DENV
   infection is unclear. We present data that DENV induction of autophagy
   regulates cellular lipid metabolism. DENV infection leads to an
   autophagy-dependent processing of lipid droplets and triglycerides to
   release free fatty acids. This results in an increase in cellular
   beta-oxidation, which generates ATP. These processes are required for
   efficient DENV replication. Importantly, exogenous fatty acids can
   supplant the requirement of autophagy in DENV replication. These results
   define a role for autophagy in DENV infection and provide a mechanism by
   which viruses can alter cellular lipid metabolism to promote their
   replication.}},

Abstract = {{We report the successful control of an outbreak caused by
   imipenem-resistant VIM-1-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (IR-Kp) in
   France. This outbreak occurred in a care centre for abdominal surgery
   that includes a 15-bed liver intensive care unit and performs more than
   130 liver transplantations per year. The index case was a patient with
   acute liver failure transferred from a hospital in Greece for urgent
   liver transplantation who was carrying IR-Kp at admission as revealed by
   routine culture of a rectal swab. Infection control measures were
   undertaken and included contact isolation and promotion of hand hygiene
   with alcohol-based hand rub solution. Nevertheless, secondary IR-Kp
   cases were identified during the six following months from 3 December
   2003 to 2 June 2004. From 2 June to 21 October, extended infection
   control measures were set up, such as cohorting IR-Kp carriers, contact
   patients and new patients in distinct sections with dedicated staff,
   limiting ward admission, and strict control of patient transfer. They
   led to a rapid control of the outbreak. The global attack rate of the
   IR-Kp outbreak was 2.5\%, 13\% in liver transplant patients and 0.4\% in
   the other patients in the care centre (p<0.005). Systematic screening
   for IR-Kp of all patients admitted to the care centre is still
   maintained to date and no secondary IR-Kp case has been detected since 2
   June 2004.}},

   oxidation This paper reports the covalent attachment of I onto
   nanoparticulate TiO2 surfaces using a robust chromophoric linker L L a
   phenylterpy ligand attached to a 3-phenyl-acetylacetonate anchoring
   moiety via an amide bond absorbs visible light and leads to photoinduced
   interfacial electron transfer into the TiO2 conduction band We
   characterize the electronic and structural properties of the 1-L-TiO2,
   assemblies by using a combination of methods, including computational
   modeling and UV-visible IR and EPR spectroscopies We show that the
   Mn(III,IV) state of 1 can be reversibly advanced to the Mn(IV,IV) state
   by visible-light photoexcitation of 1-L-TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) and
   recombines back to the Mn(III,IV) state in the dark, in the absence of
   electron scavengers Our findings also indicate that a high degree of
   crystallinity of the TiO2 NPs is essential for promoting photooxidation
   of the adsorbates by photoinduced charge separation when the TiO2 NPs
   serve as electron acceptors in artificial photosynthetic assemblies The
   reported results are particularly relevant to the development of
   photocatalytic devices for oxidation chemistry based on inexpensive
   materials (e g, TiO2 and Mn complexes) that arc robust under aqueous and

Abstract = {{Recent fluorescence studies of DNA duplexes with a simple repetitive
   base sequence have revealed important collective effects which are very
   sensitive to comformational disorder. In contrast to the monomeric
   chromophores, whose fluorescence lifetimes are shorter than 1 ps, the
   fluorescence decays of duplexes span several decades of time. The
   occurrence of excitation energy transfer, evidenced by the decay of the
   fluoresence anisotropy on the femtosecond time scale, is a common
   feature of all of the examined systems. It is explained by the existence
   of Franck-Condon exciton states, in line with the UV absorption spectra.
   Understanding the nature of the long lived excited states, whose
   emission dominates the steady-state fluoresence spectrum of natural DNA,
   will be one of the challenges for the years to come.}},

   factors of the pluripotency network and Tsix regulation has remained
   unclear(5,6). Here we show that Tsix upregulation in embryonic stem
   cells depends on the recruitment of the pluripotent marker Rex1, and of
   the reprogramming-associated factors Klf4 and c-Myc, by the DXPas34
   minisatellite associated with the Tsix promoter. Upon deletion of
   DXPas34, binding of the three factors is abrogated and the
   transcriptional machinery is no longer efficiently recruited to the Tsix
   promoter. Additional analyses including knockdown experiments further
   demonstrate that Rex1 is critically important for efficient
   transcription elongation of Tsix. Hence, distinct
   embryonic-stem-cell-specific complexes couple X-inactivation
   reprogramming and pluripotency, with Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2 repressing
   Xist to facilitate the reactivation of the inactive X, and Klf4, c-Myc
   and Rex1 activating Tsix to remodel Xist chromatin(7-10) and ensure
   random X-inactivation upon differentiation(1). The holistic pattern of
   Xist/Tsix regulation by pluripotent factors that we have identified
   suggests a general direct governance of complex epigenetic processes by
   the machinery dedicated to pluripotency.}},

Abstract = {{544 weekly body weight records of strains of New Zealand white rabbits
   were analyzed to model the growth of rabbits for improved breeding. The
   weekly body weights were collected from 2 to 22 weeks of age when the
   rabbits were sexually matured. Results of correlation analysis showed
   higher and highly significant (P<0.01) correlation coefficient values
   among body weights at early ages (0.79 to 0.91) than values obtained for
   higher ages (0.25 to 0.73). The R(2) (\%) value of all polynomial
   functions used were above 93\% except that of logarithmic thus
   suggesting good fit of the models. However, because animals cannot be
   exposed to an environment that will have abundant resources and growth
   cannot be at a constant rate hence the logistic model which incorporated
   these factors is assumed to have better predicted the growth of rabbits
   used in this study. The logistic model exhibited adequate fit with
   coefficient of determination of over 93.}},

Abstract = {{Jasmonates are a family of plant hormones that regulate plant growth,
   development and responses to stress. The F-box protein CORONATINE
   INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) mediates jasmonate signalling by promoting
   hormone-dependent ubiquitylation and degradation of transcriptional
   repressor JAZ proteins. Despite its importance, the mechanism of
   jasmonate perception remains unclear. Here we present structural and
   pharmacological data to show that the true Arabidopsis jasmonate
   receptor is a complex of both COI1 and JAZ. COI1 contains an open pocket
   that recognizes the bioactive hormone (3R, 7S)-jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine
   (JA-Ile) with high specificity. High-affinity hormone binding requires a
   bipartite JAZ degron sequence consisting of a conserved a-helix for COI1
   docking and a loop region to trap the hormone in its binding pocket. In
   addition, we identify a third critical component of the jasmonate
   co-receptor complex, inositol pentakisphosphate, which interacts with
   both COI1 and JAZ adjacent to the ligand. Our results unravel the
   mechanism of jasmonate perception and highlight the ability of F-box
   proteins to evolve as multi-component signalling hubs.}},

Abstract = {{High quality data transmission services are an important issue for
   broadband wireless access (BWA) systems. This paper deals with the
   design issues of a real-time wireless data transmission which provides
   unequal error protection (UEP) over an additive white Gaussian noise
   (AWGN) channel. Traditionally, transmission is made from a one bit
   stream at one level of power (for example, pulse amplitude modulation
   (PAM)) but using different techniques to exploit the available
   bandwidth. Using superposition coding, the real time data bit stream can
   be divided into two bit streams. The first bit stream represents the
   region of high priority (HP) while the second represents low priority
   (LP) region. These two bit streams are modulated separately, and
   superimposed together with two different levels of power to achieve the
   UEP at the receiver side. Feedback of the channel state information
   (CSI) is used by adaptive channel in the physical layer such that the
   current available bandwidth is used efficiently. In this proposed
   scheme, the same design metrics, namely time, bandwidth and power are
   used to increase the transmission efficiency. The performance of the
   proposed scheme is compared with the traditional, 2-PAM and 4-PAM
   schemes. Unlike the traditional schemes, the results show that our
   scheme provides a higher data rate at an acceptable bit error rate (BER)
   when the channel is in good condition. When channel quality is degraded,
   a reduced data rate is applied in contrast with the traditional schemes.
   As compared with the traditional 4-PAM scheme, the proposed scheme gives
   a good error performance for the HP bit stream with 0.2 dB gain increase
   at BER of 10(-5), and exhibited a 4 dB gain when the channel condition
   is bad.}},

   microscopy showed formation of nanoparticles of good crystallinity with
   their size ranging from 4 to 5 nm X-ray powder diffraction spectra
   showed peaks which were attributable to the chalcopyrite structure, and
   their peaks were continuously shifted to higher angle as the Ga to In
   ratio increased. Photoluminescence and absorption spectra were also
   blue-shifted as the ratio of Ga increased due to the larger band gap of
   AgGaS2 compared with that of AgInS2. The quantum yield was almost
   maintained in the composition range of 0.4 < y < 1.0, below which it
   decreased largely. The mechanism of such behaviour was investigated

Abstract = {{An estimated 6\% to 7\% of the earth's population carries a mutation
   affecting red blood cell function. The beta-thalassemias and sickle cell
   disease are the most common monogenic disorders caused by these
   mutations. Increased levels of gamma-globin ameliorate the severity of
   these diseases because fetal hemoglobin (HbF; alpha 2 gamma 2) can
   effectively re-place adult hemoglobin (HbA; alpha 2 beta 2) and
   counteract polymerization of sickle hemoglobin (HbS; alpha 2 beta(S)2).
   Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism of globin switching is
   of biologic and clinical importance. Here, we show that the recently
   identified chromatin factor Friend of Prmt1 (FOP) is a critical
   modulator of gamma-globin gene expression. Knockdown of FOP in adult
   erythroid progenitors strongly induces HbF. Importantly, gamma-globin
   expression can be elevated in cells from beta-thalassemic patients by
   reducing FOP levels. These observations identify FOP as a novel
   therapeutic target in beta-hemoglobinopathies. (Blood.

Abstract = {{Neuronal circuits comprise the foundation for neuronal physiology and
   synaptic plasticity, and thus for consequent behaviors and learning, but
   our knowledge of neocortical circuits is incomplete. Mapping neocortical
   circuits is a challenging problem because these circuits contain large
   numbers of neurons, a high density of synapses, and numerous classes and
   subclasses of neurons that form many different types of synapses.
   Expression of specific genetic tracers in small numbers of specific
   subclasses of neocortical neurons has the potential to map neocortical
   circuits. Suitable genetic tracers have been established in neurons in
   subcortical areas, but application to neocortical circuits has been
   limited. Enabling this approach, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1) plasmid
   (amplicon) vectors can transduce small numbers of neurons in a specific
   neocortical area. Further, expression of a particular genetic tracer can
   be restricted to specific subclasses of neurons; in particular, the
   vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (VGLUT1) promoter supports expression
   in VGLUT1-containing glutamatergic neurons in rat postrhinal (POR)
   cortex. Here, we show that expression of an axon-targeted
   beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from such vectors supports mapping
   specific commissural and associative projections of the transduced
   neurons in POR cortex. Further, coexpression of wheat germ agglutinin
   (WGA) and an axon-targeted beta-gal supports mapping both specific
   projections of the transduced neurons and identifying specific
   postsynaptic neurons for the transduced neurons. The neocortical circuit
   mapping capabilities developed here may support mapping specific
   neocortical circuits that have critical roles in cognitive learning. (C)

Abstract = {{For the problem of content-based information filtering, this paper
   introduces genetic algorithm to solve this problem, because it could
   find optimal solutions within global context. In order to illustrate the
   effectiveness of this approach, it gives a new approach based on set

   the experimental results, we could see that the method is feasible and
   could obtain better information filtering results. With the development
   of information technology, the Information world provides several
   network information to computer users, however, people are also
   inevitably exposed to a lot of spam, while they enjoy the convenience of
   information. Hence, the network information filtering arises at this
   historic moment. The text information filtering (Belkin and Croft, 1992;
   Liddy et al., 1994; Xuan-Jing, 2003) is a process that extracts the

Title = {{Doxorubicin Plus Sorafenib vs Doxorubicin Alone in Patients With

Abstract = {{Context In a randomized phase 3 trial, 400 mg of sorafenib twice daily
   prolonged overall survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular
   carcinoma (HCC) and Child-Pugh A disease. In a phase 1 study, sorafenib
   combined with doxorubicin, 60 mg/m(2), was well tolerated by patients
   with refractory solid tumors. The combination of sorafenib and
   doxorubicin in patients with advanced HCC has not been evaluated in a
   phase 2 or 3 trial.
   Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of doxorubicin plus
   sorafenib compared with doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced HCC
   and Child-Pugh A disease.
   Design, Setting, and Patients In a double-blind phase 2 multinational
   study, conducted from April 2005 to October 2006, 96 patients (76\%
   male; median age, 65 years {[}range, 38-82 years]) with advanced HCC,
   Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, Child-Pugh
   A status, and no prior systemic therapy were randomly assigned to
   receive 60 mg/m2 of doxorubicin intravenously every 21 days plus either
   400 mg of sorafenib or placebo orally twice a day. The date of the last
   patient's follow-up was April 2008.
   Main Outcome Measure Time to progression as determined by independent
   review.
   Results Following complete accrual, an unplanned early analysis for
   efficacy was performed by the independent data monitoring committee, so
   the trial was halted. The 2 patients remaining in the placebo group at
   that time were offered sorafenib. Based on 51 progressions, 63 deaths,
   and 70 events for progression-free survival, median time to progression
   was 6.4 months in the sorafenib-doxorubicin group (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI], 4.8-9.2), and 2.8 months (95\% CI, 1.6-5) in the
   doxorubicin-placebo monotherapy group (P=.02). Median overall survival
   was 13.7 months (95\% CI, 8.9-not reached) and 6.5 months (95\% CI,
   4.5-9.9; P=.006), and progression-free survival was 6.0 months (95\% CI,
   4.6-8.6) and 2.7 months (95\% CI, 1.4-2.8) in these groups, respectively
   (P=.006). Toxicity profiles were similar to those for the single agents.
   Conclusions Among patients with advanced HCC, treatment with sorafenib
   plus doxorubicin compared with doxorubicin monotherapy resulted in
   greater median time to progression, overall survival, and
   progression-free survival. The degree to which this improvement may
   represent synergism between sorafenib and doxorubicin remains to be
   defined. The combination of sorafenib and doxorubicin is not yet
   indicated for routine clinical use.}},

Title = {{A 450 year record of spring-summer flood layers in annually laminated
   sediments from Lake Ammersee (southern Germany)}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{A 450 year spring-summer flood layer time series at seasonal resolution
   has been established from the varved sediment record of Lake Ammersee
   (southern Germany), applying a novel methodological approach. The main
   results are (1) the attainment of a precise chronology by microscopic
   varve counting, (2) the identification of detrital layers representing
   flood-triggered fluxes of catchment material into the lake, and (3) the
   recognition of the seasonality of these flood layers from their
   microstratigraphic position within a varve. Tracing flood layers in a
   proximal and a distal core and correlating them by application of the
   precise chronology provided information on the depositional processes.
   Comparing the seasonal flood layer record with daily runoff data of the
   inflowing River Ammer for the period from 1926 to 1999 allowed the
   definition of an approximate threshold in flood magnitude above which
   the formation of flood layers becomes very likely. Moreover, it was
   possible for the first time to estimate the ``completeness{''} of the
   flood layer time series and to recognize that mainly floods in spring
   and summer, representing the main flood seasons in this region, are well
   preserved in the sediment archive. Their frequency distribution over the
   entire 450 year time series is not stationary but reveals maxima for
   colder periods of the Little Ice Age when solar activity was reduced.
   The observed spring-summer flood layer frequency further shows trends
   similar to those of the occurrence of flood-prone weather regimes since
   A. D. 1881, probably suggesting a causal link between solar variability
   and changes in midlatitude atmospheric circulation patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Desulfurization of heavy straight-run gasoline (HSRG) was accomplished
   over Ni-(II)-Y zeolite. Na-Y zeolite, a nanoporous adsorbent, was
   synthesized and ion-exchanged with NH4NO3 to obtain NH4-Y zeolite. The
   obtained material was then converted to H-Y zeolite by calcination. Ni-Y
   zeolite was prepared by solid-state ion exchange (SSIE) of H-Y zeolite
   using Ni(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O. The breakthrough curve for
   desulfurization of HSRG containing about 140 ppmw of sulfur compounds
   was obtained in a batch reactor at ambient conditions. The effects of
   temperature, Ni content in the zeolite framework, and aging of the
   zeolite on the desulfurization process were investigated. Ni-Y zeolite
   exhibited a high capability for the desulfurization of gasoline at
   ambient conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This present study investigated the temporal effects of type 1 diabetes
   mellitus (T1DM) on adolescent skeletal muscle growth, morphology and
   contractile properties using a 90\% partial pancreatecomy (Px) model of
   the disease. Four week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly
   assigned to Px (n = 25) or Sham (n = 24) surgery groups and euthanized
   at 4 or 8 weeks following an in situ assessment of muscle force
   production. Compared to Shams, Px were hyperglycemic (>15 mM) and
   displayed attenuated body mass gains by days 2 and 4, respectively (both
   P<0.05). Absolute maximal force production of the gastrocnemius
   plantaris soleus complex (GPS) was 30\% and 50\% lower in Px vs. Shams
   at 4 and 8 weeks, respectively (P<0.01). GP mass was 35\% lower in Px vs
   Shams at 4 weeks (1.24 +/- 0.06 g vs. 1.93 +/- 0.03 g, P<0.05) and 45\%
   lower at 8 weeks (1.57 +/- 0.12 vs. 2.80 +/- 0.06, P<0.05). GP fiber
   area was 15-20\% lower in Px vs. Shams at 4 weeks in all fiber types. At
   8 weeks, GP type I and II fiber areas were similar to 25\% and 40\%
   less, respectively, in Px vs. Shams (group by fiber type interactions,
   P<0.05). Phosphorylation states of 4E-BP1 and S6K1 following leucine
   gavage increased 2.0- and 3.5-fold, respectively, in Shams but not in
   Px. Px rats also had impaired rates of muscle protein synthesis in the
   basal state and in response to gavage. Taken together, these data
   indicate that exposure of growing skeletal muscle to uncontrolled T1DM
   significantly impairs muscle growth and function largely as a result of
   impaired protein synthesis in type II fibers.}},

Abstract = {{Many pathogenic bacteria are able to survive attack by the host's immune
   system because of antioxidant systems that mitigate the effects of
   reactive oxygen species. Dps is a hollow 12-subunit protein nanocage
   that prevents oxidative damage by oxidizing and sequestering
   intracellular Fe2+; the resulting Fe3+ forms an iron oxyhydroxide
   nanoparticle in the cage interior. Charged sites on the protein nanocage
   create an electrostatic gradient that guides ions through well-defined
   pores that connect the cage interior with the surrounding solution and
   toward nucleation sites on the cage interior. In this study, we use
   all-atom molecular dynamics to simulate the motion of simple cations
   into the dodecameric cage formed by the Dps protein from Listeria
   monocytogenes. Ion trajectories are analyzed by using a novel, to our
   knowledge, genetic algorithm to determine the temporal sequence of
   ion-protein interactions. Ions enter Dps through well-defined pores at
   the ferritinlike C-3 axes, with negatively-charged residues on the
   outside of the cage forming a fairly well-defined entrance pathway. This
   method of trajectory analysis may be broadly applicable in situations
   where the spatial localization of ions or other small molecules is
   electrostatically driven by a biomolecule.}},

Abstract = {{Cu2S-CuInS2 hybrid nanostructures as well as pure CuInS2 (CIS)
   nanocrystals were synthesized by methods of colloidal chemistry. The
   structure, the shape and the composition of these nanomaterials were
   investigated with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), powder X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). By
   changing the reaction conditions, CuInS2 nanorods with different aspect
   ratio, dimeric nanorods as well as hexagonal discs and P-shaped
   particles could be synthesized. Under our reaction conditions, CIS
   nanoparticles crystallize in the hexagonal wurtzite structure, as
   confirmed by Rietveld analysis of the X-ray diffraction patterns. The
   formation of Cu2S-CuInS2 hybrid nanostructures turned out to be an
   essential intermediate step in the growth of CIS nanoparticles, the
   copper sulphide part of the hybrid material playing an important role in
   the shape control of the CIS nanocrystals. By a treatment of Cu2S-CuInS2
   with 1,10-phenanthroline, Cu2S parts of the hybrid nanostructures could
   be removed, and pure CIS nanoparticles with shapes not accessible with
   other methods can be obtained. Our synthetic procedure turned out to be
   suitable to synthesize also other compounds, like CuInS2-ZnS alloys, and
   to modify, in this way, the optical properties of the nanocrystals.}},

Abstract = {{Background Brachymetatarsia is the presence of an abnormally short
   metatarsal, and distraction osteogenesis has been used for its treatment
   The purpose of the present study was to compare the outcomes of patients
   who underwent distraction osteogenesis for the treatment of first and/or
   fourth brachymetatarsia
   Methods The data from forty eight patients (sixty four feet, seventy
   four metatarsals) who underwent distraction osteogenesis for the
   treatment of brachymetatarsia were reviewed The indications for surgery
   included a metatarsal that was at least 10 mm shorter than the adjacent
   metatarsal and that had an unacceptable cosmetic appearance The study
   group comprised thirty two first brachymetatarsia in nineteen patients
   (Group A) and forty two fourth brachymetatarsia in twenty-nine patients
   (Group B) The average age was twenty years in Group A and eighteen years
   in Group B The average duration of follow up was 58 1 months in Group A
   and 56 1 in Group B Metatarsal length, lengthening gain, healing time
   and index, and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society hallux
   metatarsophalangeal interphalangeal and lesser metatarsophalangeal
   interphalangeal scores were evaluated
   Results All patients were satisfied with the final length of the
   metatarsal and all had achieved bone union at the time of the last
   follow up The mean lengthening gain was 17 2 mm (42 9\%) in Group A and
   16 3 mm (37 3\%) in Group B The mean healing index was 71 0 days/cm in
   Group A and 67 3 days/cm in Group B The mean American Orthopaedic Foot
   and Ankle Society score was 91 2 points in Group A and 92 8 points in
   Group B at the last follow up (twenty two excellent, nine good, and one
   fair results in Group A, and twenty nine excellent, eleven good, and two
   fair results in Group B) The most common complication was
   metatarsophalangeal joint stiffness, which occurred in thirteen rays in
   Group A and in twelve rays in Group B, malalignment of the lengthened
   metatarsal was observed six times in each group No significant
   intergroup differences in the outcomes were found
   Conclusions Distraction osteogenesis for first and/or fourth
   brachymetatarsia provided successful lengthening of a metatarsal with
   eventual osseous union and was associated with similar outcomes in terms
   of healing index, function score, and the prevalence of complications
   between the two groups, although frequent complications were encountered
   and no improvement in foot function was found}},

Abstract = {{ADP-ribosylation is an important post-translational modification
   involved in processes including cellular replication, DNA repair, and
   cell death. Despite these roles, the functions of ADP-ribosylation, in
   particular mono-ADP-ribosylation, remain poorly understood. The
   development of a technique to generate large amounts of site-specific,
   ADP-ribosylated peptides would provide a useful tool for deconvoluting
   the biochemical roles of ADP-ribosylation. Here we demonstrate that
   synthetic histone H2B tail peptides, incorporating aminooxy or N-methyl
   aminooxy functionalized amino acids, can be site-specifically conjugated
   to ADP-ribose. These peptides are recognized as substrates by the
   ADP-ribosylation biochemical machinery (PARP1), can interact with the
   ADP-ribose binding proteins macroH2A1.1 and PARP9, and demonstrate
   superior enzymatic and chemical stability when compared to ester-linked
   ADP-ribose. In addition, the incorporation of benzophenone
   photo-cross-linkers into these peptides is demonstrated to provide a
   means to probe for and enrich ADP-ribose binding proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Compounds of Sr1-xLaxFe2As2 were synthesized by solid-state reaction at
   1273 K, under pressures of 2 or 3 GPa. The Sr1-xLaxFe2As2 phase was
   dominant up to x=0.5 and superconductivity was observed at x >= 0.2. A
   maximum critical temperature T-c of 22 K and a maximum shielding volume
   fraction of similar to 70\% were obtained at x=0.4. This is the first
   experimental demonstration of electron-doped superconductivity in
   122-type iron pnictides, where electrons were doped through aliovalent
   substitution at the site of the alkaline-earth metal. The optimal T-c
   was slightly higher than that for the Co-doped (directly electron-doped)
   samples (19K) and much lower than that for the hole-doped case (37K).
   The bulk superconductivity range was narrower than that for the
   Co-substituted case and both ranges were much narrower than that for the
   hole-doped case. These observations revealed that differences in the
   electron-doping mode (direct or indirect) did not have a prominent
   effect on the optimal T-c or superconductivity range, compared with
   differences in carrier polarity.}},

Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Transport of spherical Brownian particles of finite size possessing
   radii R <= R(max) through narrow channels with varying cross-section
   width is considered. Applying the so-called Fick-Jacobs approximation,
   i.e. assuming fast equilibration in the direction orthogonal to the
   channel axis, the 2D problem can be described in terms of a 1D effective
   dynamics in which bottlenecks cause entropic barriers. Geometrical
   confinements result in entropic barriers which the particles have to
   overcome in order to proceed in the transport direction. The analytic
   findings for the nonlinear mobility for the transport are compared with
   precise numerical simulation results. The dependence of the nonlinear
   mobility on the particle size exhibits a striking resonance-like
   behavior as a function of the relative particle size rho = R/R(max);
   this latter feature renders possible new effective particle separation
   scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{fUltrasonic velocity measurement is a reliable procedure that allows
   quick and easy determination of solvent concentrations in mixtures. This
   paper presents data of ultrasonic velocities and isentropic
   compressibilities of (glycylglcyine-FeCl3) in aqueous ethanol mixture at
   T = (293.15, 303.15, and 313.15) K. Various acoustical parameters were
   calculated, because of their importance in the study of specific
   molecular interactions. A less-compressible phase of the fluid and a
   closer packing of molecules is observed with changes in the
   intermolecular free length. Quantitative investigation suggests that the
   mixing of ethanol with an aqueous glycylglycine-FeCl3 solution causes
   the rupture of hydrogen bonds, with increasing delta kappa(S) and L-f
   values (where the former represents the change in isentropic
   compressibility and the latter represents the intermolecular free
   length). Theoretically computed values of isentropic compressibility in
   the studied mixture using different models indicate the superiority of
   the very complex procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Rhomboids are intramembrane proteases that use a catalytic dyad of
   serine and histidine for proteolysis. They are conserved in both
   prokaryotes and eukaryotes and regulate cellular processes as diverse as
   intercellular signalling, parasitic invasion of host cells, and
   mitochondrial morphology. Their widespread biological significance and
   consequent medical potential provides a strong incentive to understand
   the mechanism of these unusual enzymes for identification of specific
   inhibitors. In this study, we describe the structure of Escherichia coli
   rhomboid GlpG covalently bound to a mechanism-based isocoumarin
   inhibitor. We identify the position of the oxyanion hole, and the S-1-
   and S-2'-binding subsites of GlpG, which are the key determinants of
   substrate specificity. The inhibitor-bound structure suggests that
   subtle structural change is sufficient for catalysis, as opposed to
   large changes proposed from previous structures of unliganded GlpG.
   Using bound inhibitor as a template, we present a model for substrate
   binding at the active site and biochemically test its validity. This
   study provides a foundation for a structural explanation of rhomboid
   specificity and mechanism, and for inhibitor design.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of silica colloids on calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum,
   CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O) crystallization are studied using feed
   solutions of varying degrees of supersaturation. A combination of light
   transmittance and electrical conductivity measurements is employed to
   characterize various aspects of the crystallization process. The
   induction time, nucleation rate, surface energy, and rate of
   crystallization of gypsum crystals are measured as functions of the
   saturation and the presence of noncrystallizing (SiO2) colloids.
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging is used to characterize the
   morphology of formed crystals. The induction time and the rate of
   crystallization are both shown to increase when gypsum crystal formed
   from solutions containing suspended colloids. The findings are
   rationalized in terms of a mechanistic model that links the random
   motion of colloids with nucleation and crystal growth processes. The
   results have important implications for a variety of industrially
   relevant processes such as heat exchange and membrane separation and

Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{We study the equilibrium structure of large but finite aggregates of
   magnetic dipoles, representing a colloidal suspension of magnetite
   particles in a ferrofluid. With increasing system size, the structural
   motif evolves from chains and rings to multi-chain and multi-ring
   assemblies. Very large systems form single-and multi-wall coils, tubes
   and scrolls. These structural changes result from a competition between
   various energy terms, which can be approximated analytically within a
   continuum model. We also study the effect of external parameters such as
   magnetic field on the relative stability of these structures. Our

Abstract = {{The energetics of mixing and defect ordering in solid solutions of
   fluorite-structured ThO2 with oxides of trivalent cations (Sc, In, Y,
   Nd, and La) are investigated by electronic density-functional theory
   (DFT). Through DFT calculations of structures enumerated by
   lattice-algebra techniques, we identify the lowest energy patterns for
   defect clustering for four separate dopant concentrations. The most
   stable structures are characterized by a repulsive interaction between
   nearest-neighbor vacancies on the oxygen sublattice. The enthalpies of
   formation with respect to constituent oxides are positive for all
   dopants considered, and show a tendency to decrease in magnitude as the
   size and electronegativity of the trivalent dopant decrease. Due to the
   small positive formation enthalpies and low oxygen-vacancy binding
   energy with La dopants, La2O3-ThO2 solid solutions are predicted to have
   relatively high ionic conductivities relative to those for the other
   aliovalent dopants considered. Our results are compared with those for
   the more widely studied ZrO2 and CeO2 fluorite-structured solid
   solutions with trivalent cations.}},

Title = {{Tyr(682) in the Intracellular Domain of APP Regulates Amyloidogenic APP
   Processing In Vivo}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is attributed to
   misfolding of Amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides. A beta is generated during
   amyloidogenic processing of A beta-precursor protein (APP). Another
   characteristic of the AD brain is increased phosphorylation of APP amino
   acid Tyr(682). Tyr(682) is part of the Y-682 ENPTY687 motif, a docking
   site for interaction with cytosolic proteins that regulate APP
   metabolism and signaling. For example, normal A beta generation and
   secretion are dependent upon Tyr(682) in vitro. However, physiological
   functions of Tyr(682) are unknown.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To this end, we have generated an APP
   Y682G knock-in (KI) mouse to help dissect the role of APP Tyr(682) in
   vivo. We have analyzed proteolytic products from both the amyloidogenic
   and non-amyloidogenic processing of APP and measure a profound shift
   towards non-amyloidogenic processing in APP KI mice. In addition, we
   demonstrate the essential nature of amino acid Tyr(682) for the APP/Fe65
   interaction in vivo.
   Conclusions/Significance: Together, these observations point to an
   essential role of APP intracellular domain for normal APP processing and
   function in vivo, and provide rationale for further studies into
   physiological functions associated with this important phosphorylation
   site.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of bulk toluene and toluene confined in the

   spin-lattice relaxation time 7(1) was measured as a function of the
   magnetic field strength and temperature. The observed dispersion in the
   frequency range 10(4)-10(6) Hz for the relaxation rate of toluene in the
   gel system give evidence of the interaction between the toluene and the
   gelator aggregates. The data were interpreted in terms of the
   two-fraction fast-exchange model. Additionally it was also shown that a
   cooling rate during gel preperation process influences the gel
   microstructure and leads to different gelator-solvent interactions as
   reflected in a different behavior of the proton spin-lattice relaxation
   rate of toluene within the gel observed at the low frequency range.}},

Abstract = {{It is estimated that by 2050 more than one in five people will be aged
   65 or over. In this age group, falls are one of the most serious
   life-threatening events that can occur. Their automatic detection would
   help reduce the time of arrival of medical attention, thus reducing the
   mortality rate and in turn promoting independent living.
   This study evaluated a variety of existing and novel fall-detection
   algorithms for a waist-mounted accelerometer based system. In total, 21
   algorithms of varying degrees of complexity were tested against a
   comprehensive data-set recorded from 10 young healthy volunteers
   performing 240 falls and 120 activities of daily living (ADL) and 10
   elderly healthy volunteers performing 240 scripted ADL and 52.4 waking
   hours of continuous unscripted normal ADL.
   Results show that using an algorithm that employs thresholds in
   velocity, impact and posture (velocity+impact+posture) achieves 100\%
   specificity and sensitivity with a false-positive rate of less than 1
   false-positive (0.6 false-positives) per day of waking hours. This
   algorithm is the most suitable method of fall-detection, when tested
   using continuous unscripted activities performed by elderly healthy
   volunteers, which is the target environment for a fall-detection device.

Abstract = {{The large application ranges of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and
   poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) based materials justify the importance of
   controlling polymer surface properties including morphology and
   wettability behavior. However, it appears that the reported contact
   angle values of PDMS surfaces show significant scattering which cannot
   always be interpreted in terms of sole chemical data. In addition, few
   values are reported concerning pure PEO surfaces, since the polymer
   generally swells in the presence of water. Thus, in order to correlate
   surface properties with sample preparation. several single PDMS and PEO
   polymer networks were synthesized with varying cross-linkers and
   different cross-linking densities. First, the sample surface topography
   was systematically analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). It was
   proven that the removal process of the polymer film from the mold plays
   a significant role in surface topography according to the vitreous or
   rubbery state of the given polymer network at room temperature
   irrespective of mold surface treatment. AFM-scale smooth surfaces can be
   obtained for all the samples by removing them systematically from the
   mold at a temperature below the alpha-relaxation temperature. Dynamic
   water contact angles were then measured and the values analyzed as a
   function of cross-linker nature and cross-linking density.}},

Abstract = {{Toll-like receptors (TLRs) trigger intestinal inflammation when the
   epithelial barrier is breached by physical trauma or pathogenic
   microbes. Although it has been shown that TLR-mediated signals are
   ultimately protective in models of acute intestinal inflammation {[}such
   as dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis], it is less clear which
   cells mediate protection. Here we demonstrate that TLR signaling in the
   nonhematopoietic compartment confers protection in acute DSS-induced
   colitis. Epithelial cells of MyD88/Trif-deficient mice express
   diminished levels of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands
   amphiregulin (AREG) and epiregulin (EREG), and systemic
   lipopolysaccharide administration induces their expression in the colon.
   N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutations in Adam17 (which is
   required for AREG and EREG processing) and in Egfr both produce a strong
   DSS colitis phenotype, and the Adam17 mutation exerts its deleterious
   effect in the nonhematopoietic compartment. The effect of abrogation of
   TLR signaling is mitigated by systemic administration of AREG. A
   TLR-->MyD88-->AREG/EREG-->EGFR signaling pathway is represented in
   nonhematopoietic cells of the intestinal tract, responds to microbial
   stimuli once barriers are breached, and mediates protection against
   DSS-induced colitis.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers collecting gait kinematic data during treadmill locomotion
   are often interested in determining the times of toe off and heel strike
   for each stride. In the absence of additional hardware, only position
   data collected with motion-capture equipment may be available. Others
   have published methods for using kinematic data for detecting overground
   gait events. However, during treadmill locomotion, especially running,
   overground methods may not possess sufficient accuracy. The purpose of
   this paper is to describe a method for using kinematic data to determine
   the time of toe off during treadmill locomotion. Ten subjects walked and
   ran on a treadmill while a motion-capture system collected positional
   data from heel and toe markers. The treadmill was equipped with force
   platforms that allowed an accurate determination of foot-ground contact.
   The time of toe off was determined using the vertical component of the
   toe marker, and this method was found to have greater accuracy for event
   detection than other published methods. Researchers can use the
   described method to determine times of heel strike and toe off during
   treadmill locomotion using only kinematic data. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Quantitative analysis of biochemical networks often requires
   consideration of both spatial and stochastic aspects of chemical
   processes. Despite significant progress in the field, it is still
   computationally prohibitive to simulate systems involving many reactants
   or complex geometries using a microscopic framework that includes the
   finest length and time scales of diffusion-limited molecular
   interactions. For this reason, spatially or temporally discretized
   simulations schemes are commonly used when modeling intracellular
   reaction networks. The challenge in defining such coarse-grained models
   is to calculate the correct probabilities of reaction given the
   microscopic parameters and the uncertainty in the molecular positions
   introduced by the spatial or temporal discretization. In this paper we
   have solved this problem for the spatially discretized
   Reaction-Diffusion Master Equation; this enables a seamless and
   physically consistent transition from the microscopic to the macroscopic
   frameworks of reaction-diffusion kinetics. We exemplify the use of the
   methods by showing that a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation motif,
   commonly observed in eukaryotic signaling pathways, is predicted to
   display fluctuations that depend on the geometry of the system.}},

   thermodynamics}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{We present a thermodynamic analysis of the effect of nonhydrostatic
   stresses on solid-fluid equilibrium in single-component systems. The
   solid is treated in the small-strain approximation and anisotropic
   linear elasticity. If the latent heat of the solid-fluid transformation
   is nonzero and pressure in the fluid is fixed, the shift of the
   equilibrium temperature relative to hydrostatic equilibrium is shown to
   be quadratic in nonhydrostatic components of the stress. If atomic
   volumes of the phases are different and temperature is fixed, the shift
   of the equilibrium liquid pressure relative to a hydrostatic state is
   quadratic in nonhydrostatic components of the stress in the solid. The
   stress effects at special points, at which either the latent heat or the
   volume difference turn to zero, have also been analyzed. Our theoretical
   predictions for the temperature and pressure shifts are quantitatively
   verified by atomistic computer simulations of solid-liquid equilibrium
   in copper using molecular dynamics with an embedded-atom potential. The
   simulations also demonstrate spontaneous crystallization of liquid on
   the surface of a stressed solid with the formation of solid-solid
   interfaces with the same crystallographic orientation of the solid
   layers. The lattice mismatch between the stressed and unstressed regions
   is accommodated by misfit dislocations dissociated in a zigzag pattern.}},

Abstract = {{Along with recent progress of nanotechnology, concern has risen about
   biological impacts of nanoparticles deriving from their interaction with
   cell membranes. Nanoparticles tend to adsorb proteins in vivo.
   Therefore, the physical properties of the conjugates to cell membranes

   examined whether one-dimensional protein-based nanoparticles induce
   liposome leakage in physiological saline. Carbon nanotube conjugates
   with adsorbed lysozyme interacted with the liposome through
   electrostatic interaction, leading to liposome leakage. Surprisingly,
   amyloid fibrils of lysozyme resembled the conjugate in terms of their
   effects on liposome leakage. Results described herein provide new
   insight into the interaction between nanoparticles and cell membranes in
   terms of their shape, mechanical properties, and noncovalent

Abstract = {{Given a network N(V,A,u,c) and a feasible flow x(0), an inverse minimum
   cost flow problem is to modify the cost vector as little as possible to
   make x(0) form a minimum cost flow of the network. The modification can
   be measured by different norms. In this paper, we consider the inverse
   minimum cost flow problems, where the modification of the arcs is
   measured by the weighted Hamming distance. Both the sum-type and the
   bottleneck-type cases are considered. For the former, it is shown to be
   APX-hard due to the weighted feedback arc set problem. For the latter,
   we present a strongly polynomial algorithm which can be done in O(n .

Abstract = {{The electronic and electromechanical properties of complex oxide
   superlattices are closely linked to the evolution of the structure and
   electrical polarization of the component layers in applied electric
   fields. Efforts to deduce the responses of the individual components of
   the superlattice to applied fields have focused on theoretical
   approaches because of the limitations of available experimental
   techniques. Time-resolved x-ray microdiffraction provides a precise
   crystallographic probe of each component using the shift in wave vector
   and change in intensity of superlattice satellite reflections. We report
   in detail the methods to measure and analyze the x-ray diffraction
   patterns in applied electric field and their application to a
   2-unit-cell BaTiO(3)/4-unit-cell CaTiO(3) superlattice. We find that the
   overall piezoelectric distortion is shared between the two components.
   Theoretical predictions of the electromechanical properties of a
   superlattice with the same composition constrained to tetragonal
   symmetry are in excellent agreement with the experiments. Lattice
   instability analysis, however, suggests that the low-temperature ground
   state could exhibit antiferrodistortive rotations of TiO(6) octahedra
   within and/or at the interfaces of the CaTiO(3) component.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the impact of a digital channel for experience goods on the
   profitability and behavior of players in the supply chain and on piracy.
   We consider a firm which can sell an experience good in physical form,
   in digitized form, or both. We analyze different pricing schemes - price
   for whole album on the retail channel and linear and nonlinear pricing
   for songs on the digital channel. Consumers are divided into a
   retail-captive segment whose consumers are limited to the retail channel
   and a hybrid segment whose consumers have access to both retail and
   digital channels. Our findings indicate that for realistic problems, the
   dual distribution channel is most profitable. The profitability of the
   retail channel increases with the size of the retail-captive segment and
   the number of desirable songs on an album relative to the total number
   of songs on it. We show that a skimming pricing strategy is best for the
   retail channel. The ability to sell the product in digitized form on the
   Internet erodes much of the power once enjoyed by the record labels. The
   digital channel may be the best way to promote new artists, especially
   when the hybrid consumer segment is large. We also find that piracy has
   a significant effect on channel profits for both the retail and digital
   channels. Piracy has the strongest negative impact on the exclusive
   retail channel. Consumers' access to the digital channel reduces piracy
   in both digital and dual-channel distribution. Dual channel suffers
   least from piracy because it allows retail-captive consumers to still
   legally obtain the product. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The upcoming global mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation
   and forest degradation in developing countries should include and
   prioritize tropical peatlands. Forested tropical peatlands in Southeast
   Asia are rapidly being converted into production systems by introducing
   perennial crops for lucrative agribusiness, such as oil-palm and
   pulpwood plantations, causing large greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for GHG Inventory
   on Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Uses provide an adequate
   framework for emissions inventories in these ecosystems; however,
   specific emission factors are needed for more accurate and
   cost-effective monitoring. The emissions are governed by complex
   biophysical processes, such as peat decomposition and compaction,
   nutrient availability, soil water content, and water table level, all of
   which are affected by management practices. We estimate that total
   carbon loss from converting peat swamp forests into oil palm is 59.4 +/-
   10.2 Mg of CO2 per hectare per year during the first 25 y after land-use
   cover change, of which 61.6\% arise from the peat. Of the total amount
   (1,486 +/- 183 Mg of CO2 per hectare over 25 y), 25\% are released
   immediately from land-clearing fire. In order to maintain high palm-oil
   production, nitrogen inputs through fertilizer are needed and the
   magnitude of the resulting increased N2O emissions compared to CO2
   losses remains unclear.}},

Abstract = {{The phase behavior of amphiphiles, e.g., lipids and surfactants, at low
   water content is of great interest for many technical and pharmaceutical
   applications. When put in contact with air having a moderate relative
   humidity. amphiphiles often exhibit coexistence between solid and liquid
   crystalline phases, making their complete characterization difficult.
   This study describes a (13)Csolid-state NMR technique for the
   investigation of amphiphile phase behavior in the water-poor regime.
   While the C-13 chemical shift is an indicator oft molecular
   conformation, the C-13 signal intensities obtained with the CP and INEPT
   polarization transfer schemes yield information on molecular dynamics. A
   theoretical analysis incorporating the effect or molecular segment
   reorientation, with the correlation time tau(c) and order parameter S.
   shows that INEPT is most efficient for mobile segments with tau(c) <
   0.01 mu s and S < 0.05, while CP yields maximal signal for rigid
   segments with tau(c) > 10 mu s and/or S > 0.5 under typical solid-state
   NMR experimental conditions. For liquid crystalline phases, where tau(c)
   < 0.01 mu s and 0 < S < 0.3, the observed CP and IN EFT intensities
   serve as a gauge of S. The combination of information on molecular
   conformation and dynamics permits facile phase diagram determination for
   systems with solid crystalline, solid amorphous, anisotropic liquid
   crystalline, and isotropic liquid (crystalline) phases as demonstrated
   by experiments on a series of reference systems with known phase
   structure. Three solid phases (anhydrous crystal, dihydrate, gel), two
   anisotropic liquid crystalline phases (normal hexagonal, lamellar), and
   two isotropic liquid crystalline phases (micellar cubic, bicontinuous
   cubic) are identified in the temperature-composition phase diagram of
   the cetyltrimethylammonium succinate/water system. Replacing the
   succinate counterion with DNA prevents the formation of phases other
   than hexagonal and leads to a general increase of tau(c).}},

Abstract = {{People at risk of falling exhibit increased gait variability, which may
   predict future falls. However, the causal mechanisms underlying these
   correlations are not well known. Increased neuronal noise associated
   with aging likely leads to increased gait variability, which could in
   turn lead to increased fall risk. This paper presents a model of how
   changes in neuromuscular noise independently affect gait variability and
   probability of falling, and aims to determine the extent to which
   changes in gait variability directly predict fall risk. We used a
   dynamic walking model that incorporates a lateral step controller to
   maintain lateral stability. Noise was applied to this controller to
   approximate neuromuscular noise in humans. Noise amplitude was varied
   between low amplitudes that did not induce falls and high amplitudes for
   which the model always fell. With increases in noise amplitude, the
   model fell more often and after fewer steps. Gait variability increased
   with noise amplitude and predicted increased probability of falling.
   Importantly, these relationships were not linear. At either low gait
   variability or very high gait variability, small increases in noise and
   variability affected probability of falling very little. Conversely, at
   intermediate noise and/or variability levels, the same small increases
   resulted in large increases in probability of falling. Our results
   validate the idea that age-related increases in neuromuscular noise
   likely play a direct contributing role in increasing fall risk. However,
   neuromuscular noise remains only one of many important factors that need
   to be considered. These findings have important implications for fall
   prevention research and practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Strain rate dependence of the mechanical response of hard tissues has
   led to a keen interest in their dynamic properties. The current study
   attempts to understand the high strain rate characteristics of rabbit
   femur bones. The testing was conducted using a split-Hopkinson pressure
   bar equipped with a high speed imaging system to capture the fracture
   patterns. The bones were also characterized under quasi-static
   compression to enable comparison with the high strain rate results. The
   quasi-static compressive moduli of the epiphyseal and diaphyseal regions
   were measured to be in the range of 2-3 and 5-7 GPa, respectively. Under
   high strain rate loading conditions the modulus is observed to increase
   with strain rate and attains values as high as 15 GPa for epiphyseal and
   30 GPa for diaphyseal regions of the femur. The strength at high strain
   rate was measured to be about twice the quasi-static strength value. A
   large number of small cracks initiated on the specimen surface close to
   the incident bar. Coalescence of crack branches leading to fewer large
   cracks resulted in specimen fragmentation. In comparison, the
   quasi-static failure was due to shear cracking. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Hybrid micelles from polystyrene-block-polyglycidol (PS-h-PG) copolymers
   with chemically cross-linked cores by titanium tetraisopropoxide
   (Ti(OC3H7)(4)) were prepared in toluene solution. Additionally.
   micellization of PS-h-PG copolymers with different mass fractions of
   polyglycidol (x(PG)). was studied by static and dynamic light scattering
   as well as small-angle X-ray scattering. It was observed that copolymers
   with x(PG) smaller than 0.5 self-assembled in toluene into spherical
   core-shell micelles with hydrodynamic radii R-h, between 12 and 23 nm.
   On the other hand. copolymers with larger PG content formed particles
   with R-h = 50-70 nm and aggregation numbers of several thousands. The
   presence of these aggregates in solution was attributed to the
   nonequilibrated form of block copolymers upon dissolving, most probably
   due to hydrogen bonding. In the following, spherical PS-h-PG micelles
   were loaded in toluene with hydrochloric acid and titanium
   tetraisopropoxide. Confined hydrolysis or Ti(OC3H7)(4) induced by HCl in
   the micellar core was confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering
   experiments. The subsequent condensation of the precursor with hydroxyl
   groups of polyglycidol chains led to covalently stabilized hybrid
   organic-inorganic particles. The presence of cross-linked PS-h-PG
   micelles was proven in two ways. First, micelles with ``frozen{''} core
   showed stable hydrodynamic size in time upon dilution below critical
   micellization concentration while non-cross-linked PS-h-PG micelles
   underwent disintegration under the same conditions within several hours.
   Second, light scattering experiments revealed the presence of stable,
   swollen particles in N,N-dimethylformamide, which is a good solvent for
   both blocks.}},

Title = {{Calcium phosphate cement augmentation of cancellous bone screws can

Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{2869-2874}},

Abstract = {{An obvious means to improve the fixation of a cancellous bone screw is
   to augment the surrounding bone with cement. Previous studies have shown
   that bone augmentation with Calcium Phosphate (Cap) cement significantly
   improves screw fixation. Nevertheless, quantitative data about the
   optimal distribution of CaP cement is not available. The present study
   aims to show the effect of cement distribution on the screw fixation
   strength for various cortical thicknesses and to determine the
   conditions at which cement augmentation can compensate for the absence
   of cortical fixation in osteoporotic bone. In this study, artificial
   bone materials were used to mimic osteoporotic cancellous bone and
   cortical bone of varying thickness. These bone constructs were used to
   test the fixation strength of cancellous bone screws in different
   cortical thicknesses and different cement augmentation depths. The
   cement distribution was measured with microCT. The maximum pullout force
   was measured experimentally. The microCT analysis revealed a
   pseudo-conic shape distribution of the cement around the screws. While
   the maximum pullout strength of the screws in the artificial bone only
   was 30 +/- 7 N, it could increase up to approximately 1000 N under
   optimal conditions. Cement augmentation significantly increased pullout
   force in all cases. The effect of cortical thickness on pullout force
   was reduced with increased cement augmentation depth. Indeed, cement
   augmentation without cortical fixation increased pullout forces over
   that of screws without cement augmentation but with cortical fixation.
   Since cement augmentation significantly increased pullout force in all
   cases, we conclude that the loss of cortical fixation can be compensated
   by cement augmentation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Tumour auto-antibody screening: performance of protein microarrays using
   SEREX derived antigens}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: The simplicity and potential of minimal invasive testing
   using serum from patients make autoantibody based biomarkers a very
   promising tool for use in diagnostics of cancer and auto-immune disease.
   Although several methods exist for elucidating candidate-protein
   markers, immobilizing these onto membranes and generating so called
   macroarrays is of limited use for marker validation. Especially when
   several hundred samples have to be analysed, microarrays could serve as
   a good alternative since processing macro membranes is cumbersome and
   reproducibility of results is moderate.
   Methods: Candidate markers identified by SEREX (serological
   identification of antigens by recombinant expression cloning) screenings
   of brain and lung tumour were used for macroarray and microarray
   production. For microarray production recombinant proteins were
   expressed in E. coli by autoinduction and purified His-tag
   (histidine-tagged) proteins were then used for the production of protein
   microarrays. Protein arrays were hybridized with the serum samples from
   brain and lung tumour patients.
   Result: Methods for the generation of microarrays were successfully
   established when using antigens derived from membrane-based selection.
   Signal patterns obtained by microarrays analysis of brain and lung
   tumour patients' sera were highly reproducible (R = 0.92-0.96). This
   provides the technical foundation for diagnostic applications on the
   basis of auto-antibody patterns. In this limited test set, the assay
   provided high reproducibility and a broad dynamic range to classify all
   brain and lung samples correctly.
   Conclusion: Protein microarray is an efficient means for
   auto-antibody-based detection when using SEREX-derived clones expressing
   antigenic proteins. Protein microarrays are preferred to macroarrays due
   to the easier handling and the high reproducibility of auto-antibody
   testing. Especially when using only a few microliters of patient samples
   protein microarrays are ideally suited for validation of auto-antibody
   signatures for diagnostic purposes.}},

Abstract = {{The wavelength at which a dune pattern emerges from a flat sand bed is
   controlled by the sediment transport saturation length, which is the
   length needed for the sand flux to adapt to a change in wind strength.
   The influence of the wind shear velocity on this saturation length and
   on the subsequent dune initial wavelength has remained controversial. In
   this paper, we present direct measurements of the saturation length
   performed in a wind tunnel experiment. Complementary to this, initial
   dune wavelengths are measured under different wind conditions - in
   particular after storms. Using the linear stability analysis of dune
   formation, it is then possible to deduce the saturation length from
   field data. Both direct and indirect measurements agree that the
   saturation length is almost independent of the wind strength. This
   result supports the idea that grain inertia is the dominant dynamical
   mechanism limiting sediment transport saturation on dunes. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{We consider geometric process (GP) when the distribution of the first
   occurrence time of an event is assumed to be Weibull. Explicit
   estimators of the parameters in GP are derived by using the method of
   modified maximum likelihood (MML) proposed by Tiku {[}24]. Asymptotic
   distributions and consistency properties of these estimators are
   obtained. We show that our estimators are more efficient than the widely
   used modified moment (MM) estimators via Monte Carlo simulation study.
   Further, two real life examples are given at the end of the paper. (C)

   -Mn/Zn, and -Fe/Zn, where the first and second metals indicate the metal
   center for the porphyrin core and paddlewheel cluster, respectively.
   These compounds exhibit 3D MOFs in which 2D layers are pillared by a
   sterically controlled bipyridine, leaving the metal centers inside the

Abstract = {{We assessed population incidence rates 1998-2002 and 5-year survival
   rates of 317 primary gallbladder cancer (GBC) entered in the
   population-based cancer registry in Valdivia. We analyzed GBC incidence
   (Poisson regression) and GBC survival (Cox regression). Cases were
   identified by histology (69.4\%), clinical work-up (21.8\%), or death
   certificate only (8.8\%). Main symptoms were abdominal pain (82.8\%),
   jaundice (53.6\%) nausea (42.6\%), and weight loss (38.2\%); at
   diagnosis, 64\% had Stage TNM IV. In the period, 4\% of
   histopathological studies from presumptively benign cholecystectomies
   presented GBC. GBC cases were mainly females (76.0\%), urban residents
   (70.3\%), Hispanic (83.7\%) of low schooling <4 years (64.0\%). GBC
   standardized incidence rate per 100,000 (SIR) were all 17.5 (95\%CI:
   15.5-19.4), women 24.3, and men 8.6 (p < 0.00001); Mapuche 25.0,
   Hispanic 16.2 (p = 0.09). The highest SIRs were in Mapuche (269.2) and
   Hispanic women (199.6) with <4 years of schooling. Lowest SIRs were
   among Hispanic men (19.8) and women (21.9) with >8 years of schooling.
   Low schooling, female and urban residence were independent risk factors.
   By December 31, 2007, 6 (1.9\%) cases were living, 280 (88.3\%) died
   from GBC, 32 (10.1\%) were lost of follow-up. Kaplan Meier Global 5-year
   survival was: 10.3\%, 85\% at stage I and 1.9\% at stage IV; median
   survival: 3.4 months. Independent poor prognostic factors were TNM IV,
   jaundice and nonincidental diagnoses. Our results suggest that women of
   Mapuche ancestry with low schooling (>50 years) are at the highest risk
   of presenting and dying from GBC and should be the target for early
   detection programs.}},

Abstract = {{Hydroxyapatite coatings with proper thickness were coated on
   fusion-cage-like carbon fiber reinforced carbon composite implants for
   bone tissue reconstruction by the plasma spraying technique.
   Autogenously bone filled fusion-cage-like implants were grafted in
   hybrid goats' tibia for 328 days. By means of X-ray photography,
   histological observation and scanning electron microscopy, the
   biological behaviors of the coating were compared with the pure carbon
   fiber reinforced carbon composites and the bone defect healing effect of
   the implants was evaluated. The results indicated that hydroxyapatite
   coating has more obvious osteoconductive effect than the pure carbon
   fiber reinforced carbon composites with surface bioinert. The calcium
   and phosphorus ions leached from HA provide a suitable biological
   mineralization environment that accelerates the metabolism of bone, the
   osteoblast differentiation and collagen synthesis. The coating can
   significantly speed up the bone defect healing process and improve the
   surface bioactivity of carbon fiber reinforced carbon composites. (C)

Abstract = {{We report the spatial imaging of the photon transition probability of a
   single molecule at submolecular resolution. Photon imaging of a ringlike
   pattern is further resolved as two orthogonal vibronic transitions after
   incorporating spectral selectivity. A theoretical model and the
   calculated intensity images reveal that the transition probability is
   dominated by the symmetry of the positions of the tip and the transition
   dipole moment. This imaging technique enables the probing of the
   electronic and optical properties in the interior of a single molecule.}},

Abstract = {{Gas-liquid interfacial pulse discharge plasmas are generated in the wide
   range of gas pressures, where an ionic liquid is used as the liquid
   electrode. By analyzing the characteristics of discharge voltage and
   current, the discharge mechanisms at low and high pressures are found to
   be dominated by secondary electron emission and first Townsend
   ionization, respectively. Therefore, the discharge properties at low and
   high pressures are mainly determined by the cathode material and the
   discharge gas type, respectively. Furthermore, the plasma properties are
   investigated by a double Langmuir probe. The density of the positive
   pulse plasma is found to be much smaller than that of the negative pulse
   plasma, although the discharge voltage and current of the negative and
   positive pulse plasmas are of the same order of magnitude. The positive
   pulse discharge plasma is considered to quickly diffuse onto the chamber
   wall from the radially central region due to its high plasma potential
   compared with that in the peripheral region. (C) 2010 American Institute

Abstract = {{Both gain and loss of function studies have identified the Polo like
   kinase Plk4/Sak as a crucial regulator of centriole biogenesis, but the
   mechanisms governing centrosome duplication are incompletely under stood
   In this study, we show that the pericentriolar material protein, Cep152,
   interacts with the distinctive cryptic Polo box of Plk4 via its N
   terminal domain and is required for Plk4 induced centriole
   overduplication Reduction of endogenous Cep152 levels results in a
   failure in centriole duplication, loss of centrioles, and formation of
   mono polar mitotic spindles Interfering with Cep152 function prevents
   recruitment of Plk4 to the centrosome and promotes loss of CPAP, a
   protein required for the control of centriole length in Plk4 regulated
   centriole biogenesis Our results suggest that Cep152 recruits Plk4 and
   CPAP to the centrosome to ensure a faithful centrosome duplication

Abstract = {{The dynamics of cadmium uptake and subcellular partitioning were studied
   in laboratory experiments conducted on Pyganodon grandis, a freshwater
   unionid bivalve that shows promise as a biomonitor for metal pollution.
   Bivalves were collected from an uncontaminated lake, allowed to
   acclimate to laboratory conditions (>= 25 days), and then either exposed
   to a low, environmentally relevant, concentration of dissolved Cd (5 nM;
   6, 12 and 24 h), or fed Cd-contaminated algae (similar to 70 nmol Cd
   g(-1) dry weight; 4 x 4 h). In this latter case, the bivalves were
   allowed to depurate for up to 8 days after the end of the feeding phase.
   As anticipated, the gills were the main target organ during the aqueous
   Cd exposure whereas the intestine was the initial site of Cd
   accumulation during the dietary exposure; during the subsequent
   depuration period, the dietary Cd accumulated in both the digestive
   gland and in the gills. For the gills, the distribution of Cd among the
   subcellular fractions (i.e., granules > heat-denatured proteins (HOP)
   similar to heat-stable proteins (HSP) > mitochondria similar to
   lysosomes + microsomes) was insensitive to the exposure route; both
   waterborne and diet-borne Cd ended up largely bound to the granule
   fraction. The subcellular distribution of Cd in the digestive gland
   differed markedly from that in the gills (HDP > HSP similar to granules
   similar to mitochondria > lysosomes + microsomes), but as in the case of
   the gills, this distribution was relatively insensitive to the exposure
   route. For both the gills and the digestive gland, the subcellular
   distributions of Cd differed from those observed in native bivalves that
   are chronically exposed to Cd in the field - in the short-term
   experimental exposures of P. grandis, metal detoxification was less
   effective than in chronically exposed native bivalves. (C) 2010 Elsevier

   Brains were obtained from 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats, and sections
   were randomly assigned to control and hypoxia/ischemia groups.
   Hematoxylin-eosin staining revealed karyorrhexis and karyopyknosis in
   cells from the hypoxia/ischemia group. Under electron microscopy,
   mitochondria swelling and neuropil edema were observed in the
   hypoxia/ischemia group. Olig-1 mRNA and protein expressions were
   increased at 1 day after hypoxia and ischemia treatment. These results

Abstract = {{We consider a family of self-adjoint Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators Ea in
   an infinite dimensional Hilbert space H having the same gaussian
   invariant measure p, for all alpha is an element of {[}0, 1]. We study
   the Dirichlet problem for the equation lambda phi - L-alpha(phi) = f in
   a closed set K, with f is an element of L-2(K, mu). We first prove that
   the variational solution, trivially provided by the Lax-Milgram theorem,
   can be represented, as expected, by means of the transition semigroup
   stopped to K. Then we address two problems: 1) the regularity of the
   solution phi (which is by definition in a Sobolev space W-alpha(1,2)(K,
   mu)) of the Dirichlet problem; 2) the meaning of the 2 Dirichlet
   boundary condition. Concerning regularity, we are able to prove interior
   W-alpha(2,) (2) regularity results; concerning the boundary condition we
   consider both irregular and regular boundaries. In the first case we
   content to have a solution whose null extension outside K belongs to
   W-alpha(1,2)(H, mu). In the second case we exploit the Malliavin's
   theory of surface integrals which is recalled in Appendix A of the
   paper, then we are able to give a meaning to the trace of phi at partial
   derivative K and to show that it vanishes, as it is natural. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Adenosine A(3) receptor (A(3)AR) is involved in a variety of key
   physio-pathological processes and its agonists are potential therapeutic
   agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, dry eye disorders,
   asthma, as anti-inflammatory agents, and in cancer therapy. Recently
   reported MECA (5'-N-methylcarboxamidoadenosine) derivatives bearing a
   methyl group in N-6-position and an arylethynyl substituent in
   2-position demonstrated to possess sub-nanomolar affinity and remarkable
   selectivity for the human A(3)AR, behaving as full agonists of this
   receptor. In this study, we made an attempt to get a rationalization of
   the high affinities and selectivities of these molecules for the human
   A(3)AR, by using adenosine receptor (AR) structural models based on the
   A(2A)AR crystal structure and molecular docking analysis. Post-docking
   analysis allowed to evaluate the ability of modeling tools in predicting
   AA(3)R affinity and in providing interpretation of compound substituents

Abstract = {{There is an intense ongoing debate regarding the potential scale of
   biofuel production without creating adverse effects on food supply. We
   explore the possibility of three land-efficient technologies for
   producing food (actually animal feed), including leaf protein
   concentrates, pretreated forages, and double crops to increase the total
   amount of plant biomass available for biofuels. Using less than 30\% of
   total U.S. cropland, pasture, and range, 400 billion liters of ethanol
   can be produced annually without decreasing domestic food production or
   agricultural exports. This approach also reduces U.S. greenhouse gas
   emissions by 670 Tg CO(2)-equivalent per year, or over 10\% of total
   U.S. annual emissions, while increasing soil fertility and promoting
   biodiversity. Thus we can replace a large fraction of U.S. petroleum
   consumption without indirect land use change.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the surface morphology and structure of dentin after
   ablation by ultra-short pulses were evaluated using environmental
   scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
   The dentin specimens examined were irradiated by a
   chirped-pulse-amplification (CPA) Ti:sapphire laser (800 nm) and the
   optimal conditions for producing various nanostructures were determined.
   Based on the ESEM results, it was possible to identify an energy density
   range as the ablation threshold for dentin. The laser-induced damage was
   characterized over the fluence range 1.3-2.1 J/cm(2). The results
   demonstrate that by selecting suitable parameters one can obtain
   efficient dentin surface preparation without evidence of thermal damage,
   i.e., with minimized heat affected zones and reduced collateral damage,
   the latter being normally characterized by formation of microcracks,
   grain growth and recrystallization in the heat affected zones. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The ability of the DeNitrification DeComposition (DNDC) model to predict
   CO2 and water vapour fluxes at the CarboEurope cropland site Oensingen
   on the Swiss Plateau was tested for the years 2004-2009. DNDC was able
   to simulate the seasonal trends of CO2 and water vapour fluxes quite
   well. Also the cumulative fluxes for winter wheat, winter barley, winter
   rapeseed, potato and cover crop were mostly well estimated in comparison
   with direct eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements. However, some
   specific problems of DNDC were found. (i) Net CO2 uptake was
   overestimated during winter, when EC measurements indicated C loss; this
   was probably due to a strong response of assimilation to temperature.
   (ii) Net CO2 uptake was also overestimated for crops sown in autumn; we
   interpreted these problems as a result of inadequate consideration of
   the photoperiod of these crops. Being aware of these minor limitations
   in DNDC, the model was used to predict the net ecosystem exchange (NEE)
   of CO2 of 2009 with higher temperature (+2 degrees C and +4 degrees C in
   yearly mean temperature). The model predicted NEE of -610 gC m(-2) in
   2009 under current conditions, -604 gC m(-2) for +2 degrees C and -458
   gC m(-2) for +4 degrees C. This was due to a faster development of the
   main crop (winter wheat). These tests indicated that DNDC could become a
   valid tool to predict the consequences of climate change on NEE in
   cropland agroecosystems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A Total FETI (TFETI) based domain decomposition algorithm with
   preconditioning by a natural coarse grid of rigid body motions is
   adapted to the solution of two-dimensional multibody contact problems of
   elasticity with the Coulomb friction and proved to be scalable for the
   Tresca friction. The algorithm finds an approximate solution at the cost
   asymptotically proportional to the number of variables provided the
   ratio of the decomposition parameter and the discretization parameter is
   bounded The analysis is based on the classical results by Farhat,
   Mandel, and Roux on scalability of FETI with a natural coarse grid for
   linear problems and on our development of optimal quadratic programming
   algorithms for bound and equality constrained problems The algorithm
   preserves parallel scalability of the classical FETI method Both
   theoretical results and numerical experiments indicate a high efficiency
   of our algorithm In addition, its performance is illustrated on analysis
   of the yielding clamp connection with the Coulomb friction. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Patients with early chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk
   for cardiovascular disease. Aldosterone levels are elevated and might
   impair ventricular function through adverse myocardial and vascular
   proinflammatory and fibrotic effects. In the Chronic Renal Impairment in
   Birmingham II (CRIB II) study, it was hypothesized that
   mineralocorticoid receptor blockade with spironolactone in addition to
   angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor
   blockers would improve left ventricular (LV) function and markers of
   inflammation, ventricular stretch, and collagen turnover in early CKD. A
   total of 112 patients with early CKD were randomized to spironolactone
   25 mg/day or placebo for 40 weeks. Ventricular function was assessed by
   echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging tagging.
   High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic
   peptide, and aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen were
   measured. Spironolactone improved LV long-axis systolic function (Sm 8.2
   +/- 1.4 vs 7.7 +/- 1.3 cm/s, p <0.05), torsion (7.77 +/- 1.61 degrees vs
   6.77 +/- 1.48 degrees, p <0.05), and myocardial deformation (strain rate
   1.14 +/- 0.24 ys 1.09 +/- 0.20 s(-1) p <0.05) compared to placebo,
   without a change in the ejection fraction. Markers of LV relaxation
   (E/e' ratio 7.2 +/- 2.3 vs 8.5 +/- 2.3, p <0.05) and suction (M-mode
   propagation velocity 56 +/- 12 vs 50 +/- 12 cm/s, p <0.05) were also
   improved. Spironolactone reduced N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic
   peptide (24.8 pmol/L {[}range 0.4 to 122.4] vs 39.4 pmol/L {[}range 10.8
   to 102.41, p <0.01) and attenuated an increase in aminoterminal
   propeptide of type III procollagen observed with placebo. In conclusion,
   spironolactone improves markers of regional LV systolic and diastolic
   function in early CKD. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. (Am J

Abstract = {{A low-cost yet highly sensitive colorimetric sensor array for the
   detection and identification of toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) has
   been developed. The sensor consists of a disposable array of
   cross-responsive nanoporous pigments whose colors are changed by diverse
   chemical interactions with analytes. Clear differentiation among 20
   different TICs has been easily achieved at both their IDLH (immediately
   dangerous to life or health) concentration within 2 min of exposure and
   PEL (permissible exposure limit) concentration within 5 min of exposure
   with no errors or misclassifications. Detection limits are generally
   well below the PEL (in most cases below 5\% of PEL) and are typically in
   the low ppb range. The colorimetric sensor array is not responsive to
   changes in humidity or temperature over a substantial range. The printed
   arrays show excellent batch to batch reproducibility and long shelf life
   (greater than 3 months).}},

Abstract = {{It is unknown how dendritic cells (DCs) become specialized as mucosal
   DCs and maintain intestinal homeostasis. We report that a subset of bone
   marrow cells freshly isolated from C57BL/6 mice express the retinoic
   acid (RA)-synthesizing enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily
   A2 (ALDH1a2) and are capable of providing RA to DC precursors in the
   bone marrow microenvironment. RA induced bone marrow-derived DCs to
   express CCR9 and ALDH1a2 and conferred upon them mucosal DC functions,
   including induction of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, IgA-secreting B
   cells, and gut-homing molecules. This response of DCs to RA was
   dependent on a narrow time window and stringent dose effect. RA promoted
   bone marrow-derived DC production of bioactive TGF-beta by inhibiting
   suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 expression and thereby enhancing
   STAT3 activation. These RA effects were evident in vivo, in that mucosal
   DCs from vitamin A-deficient mice had reduced mucosal DC function,
   namely failure to induce Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. Furthermore, MyD88
   signaling enhanced RA-educated DC ALDH1a2 expression and was required
   for optimal TGF-beta production. These data indicate that RA plays a
   critical role in the generation of mucosal DCs from bone marrow and in
   their functional activity. The Journal of Immunology, 2010, 185:

Abstract = {{Vulnerability of motoneurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
   arises from a combination of several mechanisms, including protein
   misfolding and aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative
   damage. Protein aggregates are found in motoneurons in models for ALS
   linked to a mutation in the gene coding for Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase
   (SOD1) and in ALS patients as well. Aggregation of mutant SOD1 in the
   cytoplasm and/or into mitochondria has been repeatedly proposed as a
   main culprit for the degeneration of motoneurons. It is, however, still
   debated whether SOD1 aggregates represent a cause, a correlate or a
   consequence of processes leading to cell death. We have exploited the
   ability of glutaredoxins (Grxs) to reduce mixed disulfides to protein
   thiols either in the cytoplasm and in the IMS (Grx1) or in the
   mitochondrial matrix (Grx2) as a tool for restoring a correct redox
   environment and preventing the aggregation of mutant SOD1. Here we show
   that the overexpression of Grx1 increases the solubility of mutant SOD1
   in the cytosol but does not inhibit mitochondrial damage and apoptosis
   induced by mutant SOD1 in neuronal cells (SH-SY5Y) or in immortalized
   motoneurons (NSC-34). Conversely, the overexpression of Grx2 increases
   the solubility of mutant SOD1 in mitochondria, interferes with
   mitochondrial fragmentation by modifying the expression pattern of
   proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics, preserves mitochondrial
   function and strongly protects neuronal cells from apoptosis. The
   toxicity of mutant SOD1, therefore, mostly arises from mitochondrial
   dysfunction and rescue of mitochondrial damage may represent a promising
   therapeutic strategy.}},

   instantly obtained and ready for application Since no additional
   substrate was required as fuel for electricity generation these PMCs
   were different from typical microbial fuel cells PMCs were examined
   under various operating conditions and they performed under high open
   circuit voltage (OCV) with high power output in the dark short electrode
   spacing (2 cm) low pH value (5 5) and high temperature (40 degrees C)
   conditions According to Ohm s Law and the Nernst equation the superior
   OCV and power output were caused by high ionic strength low internal
   resistance and high temperature Additionally two equal-sized PMCs were
   arranged in serial and parallel configurations The former yielded higher
   voltage while the latter yielded higher current density (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The influences of biaxial and uniaxial strain on the ultraviolet
   emission efficiencies of both c- and m-plane AlxGa1-xN films with
   different Al concentrations are investigated under the framework of k .
   p perturbation theory. The optimal high efficiency windows, for
   ultraviolet light emissions are quantitatively estimated. c-plane
   AlxGa1-xN modified by uniaxial strain, shows more advantages over
   biaxial-strained AlxGa1-xN. This is due to the relatively more flexible
   tuning range and the advantage of obtaining pure linear polarization,
   which can be utilized to design polarized emission devices. For m-plane
   AlxGa1-xN, there are always in-plane polarized emissions under both
   biaxial and uniaxial strain conditions, thus, it is more likely to
   obtain high surface emission efficiency. (C) 2010 American Institute of

Abstract = {{To develop novel multi-component molten salt systems more effectively,
   we developed a simulative technique using the CALPHAD (Calculation of
   Phase Diagram and Thermodynamics) method to estimate the ionic
   conductivity and the melting point. The validity of this new simulative
   technique was confirmed by comparing the simulated ionic conductivities
   and melting points of typical high-temperature molten salts, such as
   LiF-LiCl-LiBr, LiF-LiBr-KBr, LiCl-LiBr-KBr, and LiCl-LiBr-Lil, with
   those reported data in the literature or experimentally obtained.
   This simulative technique was used to develop new quaternary molten salt
   systems for use as electrolytes in high-temperature molten salt
   batteries (called thermal batteries). The targets of the ionic
   conductivity and the melting point were set at 2.0 S cm(-1) and higher
   at 500 degrees C, and in the range of 350-430 degrees C, respectively,
   to replace the LiCl-KCl system (1.85 S cm(-1) at 500 degrees C) within
   the conventional design of the heat generation system for thermal
   batteries. Using the simulative method, six kinds of novel quaternary
   systems, LiF-LiCl-LiBr-MX (M = Na and K; X = F, Cl, and Br), which
   contain neither environmentally instable anions such as iodides nor
   expensive cations such as Rb(+) and Cs(+), were proposed. Experimental
   results showed that the LiF-LiCl-LiBr-0.10NaX (X = Cl and Br) and
   LiF-LiCl-LiBr-0.10KX (X = F, Cl, and Br) systems meet our targets of
   both the ionic conductivity and the melting point. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The objectives of soil remediation processes are usually based on
   threshold levels of soil contaminants. However, during remediation
   processes, changes in bioavailability and metabolite production can
   occur, making it necessary to incorporate an ecotoxicity assessment to
   estimate the risk to ecological receptors. The evolution of contaminants
   and soil ecotoxicity of artificially phenanthrene-contaminated soil
   (1000 mg/kg soil) during soil treatment through bioventing was studied
   in this work. Bioventing was performed in glass columns containing 5.5
   kg of phenanthrene-contaminated soil and uncontaminated natural soil
   over a period of 7 months. Optimum conditions of mineralisation
   (humidity= 60\% WHC; C/N/P= 100:20:1) were determined in a previous
   work. The evolution of oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production,
   phenanthrene concentration and soil toxicity were studied on sacrificed
   columns at periods of 0, 3 and 7 months. Toxicity to soil and aquatic
   organisms was determined using a multispecies system in the soil columns
   (MS-3). In the optimal bioventing treatability test, we obtained a
   reduction rate in phenanthrene concentration higher that 93\% after 7
   months of treatment. The residual toxicity obtained at the end of the
   treatment was not attributed to the low phenanthrene concentration, but
   to the ammonia used to restore the optimal C/N ratio. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{One of the most used methods for studying the rigidification of polymer
   matrices in composite membranes is differential scanning calorimetry.
   Glass-transition temperatures give information about filler polymer
   interaction and the rigidity of the polymer matrix. In this study,
   optical microscopy, mechanical property testing, and X-ray diffraction,
   instead of differential scanning calorimetry, were used to study both
   poly(ether imide) (PEI) matrix rigidification and activated carbon PEI
   interfacial adhesion. Then, the permselective properties of the mixed
   matrix membranes were interpreted. The change in rigidity in these
   composite membranes was in agreement with the decrease in the
   flexibility of the composite materials as the filler content increased.
   This fact was confirmed by the tension and elongation data and X-ray
   diffraction (DRX) measurements. However, the Young's modulus value
   decreased as the carbon content increased. There was an increase in all
   of the gas permeability coefficients measured in the composites compared
   with that of PEI. As the particle size grew, a low particle surface area
   and a poor interfacial adhesion were observed. The carbon agglomerates
   acted as sites of stress concentration within the polymeric matrix. This
   decreased the intercatenary distances and limited the movement of
   polymer chains, which resulted in a more rigid matrix. The higher
   selectivity of the H-2/CH4, H-2/CO2 and O-2/N-2 systems observed in the
   composite membranes revealed that there were both a preferential
   sorption of certain gases in the carbon surface or carbon polymer
   interface and a molecular size exclusion, which were responsible for
   that increment, despite the poor interfacial adhesion. (C) 2010 Wiley

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{We propose a resonant leptogenesis scenario in a U(1)(B-L) gauge
   extension of the standard model to generate large lepton asymmetries for
   cosmological baryon asymmetry and dark matter. After the B - L number is
   spontaneously broken, the inflaton can pick up a small vacuum
   expectation value for the mass splits of three pairs of
   quasidegenerately heavy Majorana neutrinos and the masses of three
   sterile neutrinos. With thermal mass effects of sphalerons, the observed
   small baryon asymmetry can be converted from large lepton asymmetries of
   individual flavors, although total lepton asymmetry is assumed zero. The
   mixing between sterile and active neutrinos is elegantly suppressed by
   the heavy Majorana neutrinos. Before the active neutrinos start their
   strong flavor conversions, the sterile neutrinos as warm dark matter can
   be produced by resonant active-sterile neutrino oscillations to
   reconcile x-ray and Lyman-alpha bounds. Small neutrino masses are
   naturally realized by seesaw contributions from the heavy Majorana
   neutrinos and the sterile neutrinos.}},

Pages = {{3863-3871}},

Abstract = {{ATF1 (activating transcription factor 1), a stimulus-induced CREB family
   transcription factor, plays important roles in cell survival and
   proliferation. Phosphorylation of ATF1 at Ser63 by PKA (cAMP-dependent
   protein kinase) and related kinases was the only known
   post-translational regulatory mechanism of ATF1. Here, we found that
   HIPK2 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2), a
   DNA-damage-responsive nuclear kinase, is a new ATF1 kinase that
   phosphorylates Ser198 but not Ser63. ATF1 phosphorylation by HIPK2
   activated ATF1 transcription function in the GAL4-reporter system. ATF1
   is a transcriptional repressor of ferritin H, the major intracellular
   iron storage gene, through an ARE (antioxidant-responsive element).
   HIPK2 overrode the ATF1-mediated ARE repression in a
   kinase-activity-dependent manner in HepG2 cells. Furthermore,
   DNA-damage-inducing agents doxorubicin, etoposide and sodium arsenite
   induced ferritin H mRNA expression in HIPK2(+/+) MEF cells, whereas it
   was significantly impaired in HIPK2(-/-) MEF cells. Induction of other
   ARE-regulated detoxification genes such as NQO1 (NADPH quinone
   oxidoreductase 1), GST (glutathione S-transferase) and HO1 (heme
   oxygenase 1) by genotoxic stress was also decreased in HIPK2-deficient
   cells. Taken together, these results suggest that HIPK2 is a new ATF1
   kinase involved in the regulation of ferritin H and other antioxidant
   detoxification genes in genotoxic stress conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which has attracted a great deal of
   attention as a global optimization method in recent years, has the
   drawback that continuous search based on its excellent dynamic
   characteristics cannot be performed stably until the end of computation
   due to its very strong tendency to convergence. In this paper, we
   propose a ``Repetitive Search Guideline{''} which differs from the
   common guidelines in the improved methods which have since been proposed
   and by which the continuous search in PSO is achieved without losing
   PSO's excellent dynamic characteristics due to repetitive search in a
   promising area where the objective function values are expected to be
   small. We consider four improved methods based on the proposed
   guidelines, then confirm their effectiveness by application to
   100-variable multipeaked benchmark problems. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals,

Title = {{Multi-temporal monitoring of wetland water levels in the Florida

Abstract = {{Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques can
   successfully detect phase variations related to the water level changes
   in wetlands and produce spatially detailed high-resolution maps of water
   level changes. Despite the vast details, the usefulness of the wetland
   InSAR observations is rather limited, because hydrologists and water
   resources managers need information on absolute water level values and
   not on relative water level changes. We present an InSAR technique
   called Small Temporal Baseline Subset (STBAS) for monitoring absolute
   water level time series using radar interferograms acquired successively
   over wetlands. The method uses stage (water level) observation for
   calibrating the relative InSAR observations and tying them to the
   stage's vertical datum. We tested the STBAS technique with two-year long
   Radarsat-1 data acquired during 2006-2008 over the Water Conservation
   Area 1 (WCA1) in the Everglades wetlands, south Florida (USA). The
   InSAR-derived water level data were calibrated using 13 stage stations
   located in the study area to generate 28 successive high spatial
   resolution maps (50 m pixel resolution) of absolute water levels. We
   evaluate the quality of the STBAS technique using a root mean square
   error (RMSE) criterion of the difference between InSAR observations and
   stage measurements. The average RMSE is 6.6 cm, which provides an
   uncertainty estimation of the STBAS technique to monitor absolute water
   levels. About half of the uncertainties are attributed to the accuracy
   of the InSAR technique to detect relative water levels. The other half
   reflects uncertainties derived from tying the relative levels to the
   stage stations' datum. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic scattering rates in metals after ultrashort pulsed laser
   heating can be drastically different than those predicted from free
   electron theory. The large electron temperature achieved after
   ultrashort pulsed absorption and subsequent thermalization can lead to
   excitation of subconduction band thermal excitations of electron
   orbitals far below the Fermi energy. In the case of noble metals, which
   all have a characteristic flat d-band several electron volts well below
   the Fermi energy, the onset of d-band excitations has been shown to
   increase electron-phonon scattering rates by an order of magnitude. In
   this paper, we investigate the effects of these large electronic thermal
   excitations on the ultrafast thermoelectric transport properties of
   gold, a characteristic noble metal. Under conditions of strong
   electron-phonon nonequilibrium (relatively high electron temperatures
   and relatively low lattice temperatures, T-e >> T-L), we find that the
   Wiedemann-Franz law breaks down and the Seebeck coefficient is massively
   enhanced. Although we perform representative calculations for Au, these
   results are expected to be similar for the other noble metals (Ag and
   Cu) due to the characteristic large d-band separation from the Fermi
   energy. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Volume = {{468}},

Abstract = {{Z9 Desaturases catalyse the formation of a cis-unsaturated bond in the
   Delta 9 position of the saturated fatty acids stearate and palmitate.
   They are considered essential enzymes in eukaryotic organisms as their
   Z9 unsaturated fatty acid products are required for homeostatic roles
   such as maintenance of membrane fluidity. Two putative Z9 acyl
   Coenzyme-A desaturase genes were identified in the red flour beetle,
   Tribolium castaneum, genome (TcasZ9desA and B) based on their similarity
   to acyl CoA-desaturases of other insects. TcasZ9desA and B share 75\%
   nucleic acid sequence identity and appear to be functionally conserved;
   the genes were cloned and expressed in the yeast strain Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae (ole1); both genes complemented the yeast requirement for Z9
   fatty acids and produced substantial quantities of Z9 desaturated
   products with a stearate>palmitate chain length preference. Quantitative
   PCR analysis of transcripts in RNA obtained from adult, larval and pupal
   stages of the beetles show TcasZ9desA and B are expressed at similar
   levels in all stages, with the pupal stage having the lowest expression.

Abstract = {{The growth of mass populations of toxin-producing cyanobacteria is a
   serious concern for the ecological status of inland waterbodies and for
   human and animal health. In this study we examined the performance of
   four semi-analytical algorithms for the retrieval of chlorophyll a (Chl
   a) and phycocyanin (C-PC) from data acquired by the Compact Airborne
   Spectrographic Imager-2 (CASI-2) and the Airborne Imaging Spectrometer
   for Applications (AISA) Eagle sensor. The retrieval accuracies of the
   semi-analytical models were compared to those returned by optimally
   calibrated empirical band-ratio algorithms. The best-performing
   algorithm for the retrieval of Chl a was an empirical band-ratio model
   based on a quadratic function of the ratio of reflectance at 710 and 670
   nm (R-2 = 0.832; RMSE =29.8\%). However, this model only provided a
   marginally better retrieval than the best semi-analytical algorithm. The
   best-performing model for the retrieval of C-PC was a semi-analytical
   nested band-ratio model (R-2 = 0.984; RMSE = 3.98 mg m(-3)). The
   concentrations of C-PC retrieved using the semi-analytical model were
   correlated with cyanobacterial cell numbers (R-2 = 0.380) and the
   particulate and total (particulate plus dissolved) pools of microcystins
   (R-2 = 0.858 and 0.896 respectively). Importantly, both the empirical
   and semi-analytical algorithms were able to retrieve the concentration
   of C-PC at cyanobacterial cell concentrations below current warning
   thresholds for cyanobacteria in waterbodies. This demonstrates the
   potential of remote sensing to contribute to early-warning detection and
   monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms for human health protection at
   regional and global scales. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) for immune tolerance is
   well recognized, yet the signaling molecules influencing their
   suppressive activity are relatively poorly understood. In this article,
   through in vivo studies and complementary ex vivo studies, we make
   several important observations. First, we identify the cytoplasmic
   tyrosine phosphatase Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase
   1 (SHP-1) as an endogenous brake and modifier of the suppressive ability
   of Tregs; consistent with this notion, loss of SHP-1 expression strongly
   augments the ability of Tregs to suppress inflammation in a mouse model.
   Second, specific pharmacological inhibition of SHP-1 enzymatic activity
   via the cancer drug sodium stibogluconate potently augmented Treg
   suppressor activity both in vivo and ex vivo. Finally, through a
   quantitative imaging approach, we directly demonstrate that Tregs
   prevent the activation of conventional T cells and that SHP-1-deficient
   Tregs are more efficient suppressors. Collectively, our data reveal
   SHP-1 as a critical modifier of Treg function and a potential
   therapeutic target for augmenting Treg-mediated suppression in certain
   disease states. The Journal of Immunology, 2010, 185: 6115-6127.}},

Abstract = {{We recently demonstrated that interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) increases
   system x(c)(-) (cystine/glutamate antiporter) activity in mixed cortical
   cell cultures, resulting in an increase in hypoxic neuronal injury when
   glutamate clearance is impaired. Herein, we demonstrate that neurons,
   astrocytes, and microglia all express system x(c)(-) subunits (xCT,
   4F2hc, RBAT) and are capable of cystine import. However, IL-1 beta
   stimulation increases mRNA for xCT-the light chain that confers
   substrate specificity-in astrocytes only; an effect blocked by the
   transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. Additionally, only astrocytes
   show an increase in cystine uptake following IL-1 beta exposure; an
   effect associated with a change in xCT protein. The increase in cystine
   uptake that follows IL-1 beta is lacking in astrocytes derived from mice
   harboring a mutation in Slc7a11 (sut gene), which encodes for xCT, and
   in wild-type astrocytes treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor
   cycloheximide. IL-1 beta does not regulate the light chain of the amino
   acid transporter, LAT2, or the expression and function of astrocytic
   excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), demonstrating some target
   selectivity. Finally, the enhanced neuronal vulnerability to hypoxia
   that followed IL-1 beta treatment in our mixed culture system was not
   observed in chimeric cultures consisting of wild-type neurons plated on
   top of sut astrocytes. Nor was it observed in wild-type cultures treated
   with a system x(c)(-) inhibitor or an NMDA receptor antagonist. Overall,
   our data demonstrate that IL-1 beta selectively regulates system x(c)(-)
   activity in astrocytes and that this change is specifically responsible
   for the deleterious, excitotoxic effects of IL-1 beta found under
   hypoxic conditions. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Although triploid oysters Crassostrea gigas have generally been
   considered to be sterile, gametogenesis events are sometimes recorded.
   We aimed to establish a new classification adapted for the description
   of gametogenesis in triploid oysters and their comparison with diploid
   animals. From stage I to stage III, two types of gametogenic pattern
   were identified: a-pattern, corresponding to animals displaying numerous
   proliferating gonia (PCNA labelling at stage l), resulting in abundant
   gametes at stage III and p-pattern, which was associated with locked
   gametogenesis (only few mature gametes at sexual maturity) with
   accumulation of abnormal gonia from stage I to III. The granular aspect
   of TUNEL labelling in the perinuclear area of stage Ice animals suggests
   either the occurrence of apoptotic events or the possibility of
   chromosome number regulation (chromosome extrusion).
   Reproductive effort was evaluated by quantitative approaches in order to
   evaluate the possible contribution of triploid oysters to recruitment in
   the natural environment. For mature a triploid animals, the ratio of
   gonadal area over total area on histological slide preparations reached
   almost 50\% that of diploid counterparts. Moreover, the gonadal area
   contained numerous mature germinal cells as in diploids. Future
   ecological studies should consider the involvement of triploids in spat
   recruitment in the case of spawning by these animals. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Alendronate, a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, has been used as a
   first-choice drug for the treatment of hypercalcemia and osteoporosis.
   In the present study, we examined the absorption and safety of
   alendronate after intrapulmonary administration in rats. The
   bioavailability (BA) of alendronate after intrapulmonary administration
   was 47\% at a dose of 5 mg/kg, while the BA after oral administration
   was only 2.9\% at a dose of 50 mg/kg in rats. Plasma calcium level, an
   index of the pharmacological effect of alendronate, was effectively
   reduced after intrapulmonary administration of alendronate. Furthermore,
   alendronate continuously reduced the increase in plasma calcium levels
   for 9 days after a single intrapulmonary administration in rats with 1
   alpha-hydroxyvitamin-D-3-induced hypercalcemia. Intrapulmonary
   administration of alendronate also effectively suppressed the decrease
   in bone mass in a rat model of osteoporosis. Alendronate significantly
   increased the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in bronchoalveolar
   lavage fluid (BALF), indicating that pulmonary mucosal damage was
   induced by intrapulmonary administration of alendronate. However,
   co-administration of superoxide dismutase (SOD) with alendronate
   completely suppressed the alendronate-induced increase in LDH activity
   in BALF, while maintaining sufficient pulmonary absorption and
   therapeutic effects of alendronate in rats with alpha
   a-hydroxyvitamin-D-3-induced hypercalcemia. These findings indicated
   that the lung is a promising, noninvasive alternative route for the
   delivery of alendronate in the treatment of bone diseases. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of shortwave net radiation (S-n) at a high spatial
   resolution is critical for regional and global land surface models.
   Current surface radiation budget products have fine temporal
   resolutions, but only coarse spatial resolutions that are not suitable
   for land applications. A hybrid algorithm was developed in this study to
   estimate S-n from MODIS data under both clear and cloudy sky conditions
   without requiring coarser resolution ancillary data. This algorithm was
   validated using ground measurements at seven sites of the SURFace
   RADiation budget observing network (SURFRAD) in the United States.
   Instantaneous S-n estimated by this method was also compared with
   GEWEX/SRB and ISCCP data, and other methods. The results indicate that
   our algorithm can produce S-n at 1-km resolution with improved accuracy
   and is easily implemented to generate operational global products. Daily
   integrated S-n is estimated at 1-km resolution using instantaneous S-n.
   These finer spatial resolution datasets capture the specific sequence of
   the redistribution of the available energy at the Earth's surface.
   Therefore, they support recent high resolution land surface models. (C)

Abstract = {{Tubule formation in vitro using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)
   epithelial cells consists mainly of two processes. First, the cells
   undergo a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (pEMT), losing
   polarity and migrating. Second, the cells redifferentiate, forming cords
   and then tubules with continuous lumens. We have shown previously that
   extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation is required for pEMT.
   However, the mechanism of how the pEMT phase is turned off and the
   redifferentiation phase is initiated is largely unknown. To address the
   central question of the sequential control of these two phases, we used
   MDCK cells grown as cysts and treated with hepatocyte growth factor to
   model tubulogenesis. We show that signal transducer and activator of
   transcription (STAT) 1 controls the sequential progression from the pEMT
   phase to the redifferentiation phase. Loss of STAT1 prevents
   redifferentiation. Constitutively active STAT1 allows redifferentiation
   to occur even when cells are otherwise prevented from progressing beyond
   the pEMT phase by exogenous activation of Raf. Moreover, tyrosine
   phosphorylation defective STAT1 partially restored cord formation in
   such cells, suggesting that STAT1 functions in part as nonnuclear

Abstract = {{We present a diffusion-driven and long-range concentration gradient
   generator that uses hydrogel as a porous membrane to prevent convection
   flows but allow the diffusion of cell signaling molecules for the study
   of bacterial chemotaxis in a microfluidic device. Using this device, we
   characterized the critical concentrations associated with the
   chemotactic responses of cells that initially created a population band
   and then migrated in bands in the presence of multiconcentration
   gradients. In addition, this device can be used to study the
   preferential chemotaxis of bacterial cells toward different carbon
   sources: glucose, galactose, and mannose were preferred over arabinose
   and xylose, in this order. This was possible since the device is able to
   simultaneously produce long-range concentration gradients of different
   chemicals as well. The method presented in this study is easy to perform
   and the device is cheap to fabricate, so that we believe that these
   characteristics not only make this device a very useful tool to study
   the chemotaxis of various, motile microorganisms but also permit
   parallel experimentation and reduce the time and effort needed in
   characterizing bacterial responses to various chemicals.}},

Title = {{Genomic Runs of Homozygosity Record Population History and Consanguinity}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The human genome is characterised by many runs of homozygous genotypes,
   where identical haplotypes were inherited from each parent. The length
   of each run is determined partly by the number of generations since the
   common ancestor: offspring of cousin marriages have long runs of
   homozygosity (ROH), while the numerous shorter tracts relate to shared
   ancestry tens and hundreds of generations ago. Human populations have
   experienced a wide range of demographic histories and hold diverse
   cultural attitudes to consanguinity. In a global population dataset,
   genome-wide analysis of long and shorter ROH allows categorisation of
   the mainly indigenous populations sampled here into four major groups in
   which the majority of the population are inferred to have: (a) recent
   parental relatedness (south and west Asians); (b) shared parental
   ancestry arising hundreds to thousands of years ago through long term
   isolation and restricted effective population size (N-e), but little
   recent inbreeding (Oceanians); (c) both ancient and recent parental
   relatedness (Native Americans); and (d) only the background level of
   shared ancestry relating to continental N-e (predominantly urban
   Europeans and East Asians; lowest of all in sub-Saharan African
   agriculturalists), and the occasional cryptically inbred individual.
   Moreover, individuals can be positioned along axes representing this
   demographic historic space. Long runs of homozygosity are therefore a
   globally widespread and under-appreciated characteristic of our genomes,
   which record past consanguinity and population isolation and provide a
   distinctive record of the demographic history of an individual's
   ancestors. Individual ROH measures will also allow quantification of the
   disease risk arising from polygenic recessive effects.}},

Abstract = {{Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS; OMIM 182290) is a neurodevelopmental
   disorder characterized by a well-defined pattern of anomalies. The
   majority of cases are due to a common deletion in chromosome 17p11.2
   that includes the RAI1 gene. In children with SMS, autistic-like
   behaviors and symptoms start to emerge around 18 months of age. This
   study included 26 individuals (15 females and 11 males), with a
   confirmed deletion (del 17p11.2). Parents/caregivers were asked to
   complete the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Social
   Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) both current and lifetime versions.
   The results suggest that 90\% of the sample had SRS scores consistent
   with autism spectrum disorders. Moreover, females showed more impairment
   in total T-scores (P=0.02), in the social cognition (P=0.01) and
   autistic mannerisms (P=0.002) subscales. The SCQ scores are consistent
   to show that a majority of individuals may meet criteria for autism
   spectrum disorders at some point in their lifetime. These results
   suggest that SMS needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of
   autism spectrum disorders but also that therapeutic interventions for
   autism are likely to benefit individuals with SMS. The mechanisms by
   which the deletion of RAI1 and contiguous genes cause psychopathology
   remain unknown but they provide a solid starting point for further
   studies of gene-brain-behavior interactions in SMS and autism spectrum
   disorders. Published 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.dagger}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a one-step approach to prepare lysozyme type
   VI-stabilized gold nanoclusters (Lys VI-AuNCs) for the ultrasensitive
   detection of Hg2+ and CH3Hg+ based on fluorescence quenching. The
   optical properties and size of Lys VI-AuNCs are highly dependent on the
   concentration of Lys VI, which acts as both a reducing and a stabilizing
   agent. With an increase in the concentration of Lys VI, we observed a
   systematic blue shift in the fluorescence maxima, an increase in the
   quantum yields, and a reduction in the particle size. When using 25
   mg/mL Lys VI as a reducing agent, the formed Lys VI-AuNCs (denoted as
   Au-631) were found to be highly stable in a high-concentration
   glutathione or NaCl. Additionally, the Au-631 were capable of sensing
   Hg2+ and CH3Hg+ through the interaction between Hg2+/CH3Hg+ and Au+ on
   the Au surface; the limits of detection (LODs) for Hg2+ and CH3Hg+ were
   3 pM and 4 nM, respectively. The selectivity of this probe is more than
   500-fold for Hg2+ over any metal ions. As compared to bovine serum
   albumin-stabilized AuNCs, Au-631 provided an approximately 330-fold
   improvement in the detection of Hg2+. To the best of our knowledge,
   Au-631 not only provide the first example for detecting CH3Hg+ but also
   have the lowest LOD value for Hg2+ when compared to other AuNC-based
   Hg2+ sensors. Importantly, this probe was successfully applied to the
   determination of Hg2+ and CH3Hg+ in seawater.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusive dielectric materials such as white paint have been
   demonstrated as effective back reflectors in the photovoltaic
   technology. In this work, a one-dimensional (1D) optical modeling
   approach for simulation of white paint films is developed and
   implemented in a 1D optical simulator for thin-film solar cells. The
   parameters of white paint, such as the paint film thickness, the pigment
   volume concentration (PVC), and the pigment/binder refractive index
   ratio (RIR), are examined and optimized to achieve the required optical
   properties for back reflector application. The simulation trends
   indicate that white paint back reflectors with sufficient film thickness
   and higher PVC and RIR values exhibit improved reflectivity
   characteristics which results in an increased long-wavelength quantum
   efficiency of thin-film silicon solar cells. The simulation results
   based on the 1D model agree very well with the experimental data
   obtained from reflectance measurements of various white paint
   compositions and quantum efficiency measurements of amorphous silicon
   solar cells with white paint back reflectors. (C) 2010 American

Abstract = {{Clay mineralogy of surface samples throughout the northeastern South
   China Sea (SCS) and surrounding fluvial drainage basins has been
   investigated to reveal source and transport of detrital fine-grained
   sediments. Three characteristic end-members in clay mineral compositions
   were observed from three major provenances, respectively: major
   kaolinite and moderate illite and chlorite from the Pearl River,
   predominant illite and chlorite from Taiwan, and principal smectite from
   the Luzon arc system. The transport of four clay mineral species in the
   northeastern SCS is influenced by various mechanisms. Smectite derived
   from the Luzon arc system is transported mainly by surface current with
   significant influence of the Kuroshio intrusion, illite and chlorite
   from Taiwan are mainly carried by deep water current, while kaolinite
   from the Pearl River is affected obviously by the westward Guangdong
   Coastal Current and longshore current. A westerly tongue-shaped
   distribution of high contents of illite and chlorite mainly from Taiwan
   on the eastern shelf may result from the westward Guangdong Coastal
   Current during the winter. The results suggest that clay mineral
   assemblages in the northeastern SCS are mainly controlled by provenance
   supply and current transport and their downcore records do not bear
   contemporaneous paleoclimatic features. The implication of clay minerals
   for proxies of the late Quaternary East Asian monsoon evolution is
   realized through both the provenance supply and current transport
   processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The variations of delta O-17 and delta O-18 in recent meteoric waters
   and in ice cores have proven to be an important tool for investigating
   the present and past hydrologic cycle. In order to close significant
   information gaps in the present distribution of delta O-17 and delta
   O-18 of meteoric water, we have run precise measurements, with respect
   to VSMOW, on samples distributed globally from low to high latitudes.
   Based on the new and existing data, we present the Global Meteoric Water
   Line (GMWL) for delta O-17 and delta O-18 as:
   In(delta O-17 + 1) = 0.528 In(delta O-18 + 1) + 0.000033 (R-2 = 0.99999)
   In addition to meteoric water, we carried out the first measurements of
   seawater from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans with respect to VSMOW. The
   obtained results show that the slope of the trend line In(delta O-17 +
   1) vs. In(delta O-18 + 1) of seawater samples is 0.528, the same as for
   meteoric water, but the regression intercept is -5 per meg. Thus, the
   positive intercept in the GMWL indicates an excess of O-17 in meteoric
   waters with respect to the ocean. An excess (or depletion) of O-17 in
   water is defined as:
   O-17-excess = In(delta O-17 + 1) - 0.528(delta O-18 + 1)
   Most meteoric water samples have positive O-17-excess of varying
   magnitudes with an average of 37 per meg with respect to VSMOW. We
   explain how these positive values originate from evaporation of sea
   water into marine air, which is undersaturated in water vapor, and how
   subsequent increase of O-17-excess occurs when atmospheric vapor
   condenses to form liquid and solid precipitation. We also clarify the
   effect of excessive evaporation on O-17-excess. Finally, based on the
   new results on O-17-excess of seawater we recalculated the relationship
   of delta O-17 vs. delta O-18 in vapor diffusion in air as

Abstract = {{The anisotropy of antiphase boundary (APB) energies in ordered
   L1(2)-Ni3Al is studied, owing to its importance in understanding the
   anomalous flow behavior of this intermetallic compound. We report
   first-principle calculations for two types of APBs in the ordered
   compound: (001) and (111). The magnetic perturbations associated with
   these APBs are calculated as a function of supercell size to ensure that
   their periodic images are isolated both magnetically and elastically.
   The magnetic perturbation associated with the (111) APB is wider than
   that of the (001) APB. The fully relaxed, spin-polarized APB energies
   for (001) and (111) APBs are calculated to be 82 mJ/m(2) and 177
   mJ/m(2), respectively. The resulting anisotropy ratio of
   sigma(111)/sigma(001)=2.16, which is significantly higher than
   previously reported values, suggests that cross-slip between (001) and
   (111) is highly favorable. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Electric discharge between two electrically charged surfaces occurs at a
   well-defined, gas-dependent combination of atmospheric pressure and the
   distance between those two surfaces, as described by Paschen's law. The
   understanding of when the discharge will occur in the conditions present
   on Mars is essential for designing space-flight hardware that will
   operate on the Martian surface as well as understanding electrical
   discharge processes occurring in the Martian atmosphere. Here, we
   present experimentally measured Paschen curves for a gas mixture
   representative of the Martian atmosphere and compare our results to
   breakdown voltages of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and helium as measured
   with our system and from the literature. We will discuss possible
   implications for instrument development as well as implications for
   processes in the Martian atmosphere. The DC voltage at which electric
   discharge occurred between two stainless steel spheres was measured at
   pressures from 10(-2) to 100 torr in all gases. We measured a minimum
   voltage for discharge in the Mars ambient atmosphere of 410 +/- 10 V at
   0.3 torr cm. As an application, the breakdown properties of
   space-qualified, electrical wires to be used in the Sample Analysis at
   Mars (SAM) instrument suite on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) were
   studied. (C) 2010 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine recurrence patterns of glioblastoma treated with
   temozolomide-based chemoradiation.
   Methods: Pretreatment and serial posttreatment magnetic resonance
   imaging scans of 54 patients were retrospectively evaluated. Central
   recurrence (i.e., local progression) and the development of new (i.e.,
   interval appearance of discrete enhancing lesion) in-field, marginal,
   and distant recurrences were assessed, with the pattern of recurrence of
   individual lesions defined relative to the 95\% isodose line (D-95).
   Distant recurrences were defined as lesions completely outside D-95,
   marginal recurrences crossed D-95, and in-field recurrences were
   completely inside D-95.
   Results: At a median follow-up of 17 months, 39 of 54 (72\%) patients
   developed recurrent glioblastoma. Among these 39 patients, central
   recurrence occurred in 80\% (at a median of 7 months from diagnosis);
   new in-field recurrence developed in 33\% (at a median of 14 months);
   marginal recurrences developed in 15\% (at a median of 18 months); and
   distant recurrences developed in 20\% (at a median of 11 months). The
   actuarial rates of central, new in-field, marginal, distant, and any new
   recurrences at 1-year were 46\%, 15\%, 3\%, 14\%, and 25\% respectively,
   whereas at 2 years, the rates were 68\%, 60\%, 32\%, 28\%, and 66\%,
   reflecting an increasing probability of new lesions developing at later
   time points. Ten patients developed subependymal recurrences, of whom 7
   developed multiple subependymal lesions.
   .Conclusions: Whereas central recurrence of glioblastoma treated with
   radiation and temozolomide predominates and persists over time, new
   in-field, marginal, and distant recurrences commonly develop,
   particularly at later time points in patients with longer survival. (C)

Abstract = {{The catalytic mechanism of metmyoglobin (metMb) on the development of
   lipid oxidation in a phospholipid liposome model system was studied.
   Liposome model system was prepared with metMb solutions (2.0, 1.0, 0.5,
   and 0.25 mg metMb/mL) containing none, diethylenetriamine pentaacetic
   acid (DTPA), desferrioxamine (DFO), or ferric chloride and lipid
   oxidation was determined at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min of incubation at
   37 degrees C. Metmyoglobin catalysed lipid oxidation in the liposome
   system, but the rate of lipid oxidation decreased as the concentration
   of metMb increased. The amount of free ionic iron in the liposome
   solution increased as the concentration of metMb increased, but the rate
   of metMb degradation was increased as the concentration of metMb
   decreased. The released free ionic iron was not involved in the lipid
   oxidation of model system because ferric iron has no catalytic effect
   without reducing agents. Both DFO and DTPA showed antioxidant effects,
   but DFO was more efficient than DTPA because of its multifunctional
   antioxidant ability as an iron and haematin chelator and an electron
   donor. The antioxidant activity of DTPA in liposome solution containing
   0.25 mg metMb/mL was two times greater than that with 2 mg metMb/mL due
   to the increased prooxidant activity of DTPA-chelatable compounds. It
   was concluded that ferrylmyoglobin and DTPA-chelatable haematin
   generated from the interaction of metMb and LOOH, rather than free ionic
   iron, were the major catalysts in metMb-induced lipid oxidation in
   phospholipid liposome model system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Broccoli is a nutritious vegetable and a good source of vitamins and
   minerals. It also contains important antioxidant phytochemicals like
   beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol, indoles and isothiocyanates. On the
   other hand, edible sprouts are novel nutritive plant-derived foods, good
   source of flavonoids and other polyphenols (Moreno, Perez-Balibrea, et
   al., 2006).
   Anthocyanins have also been previously isolated from the Cruciferae
   (Brassicaceae) presenting unusually complex structures with one or more
   cinnamic acids but, as far as we are aware, never reported for broccoli
   sprouts. For this purpose, we studied the sprouts of commercial broccoli
   destined for head productions ('Marathon' and `Nubia'), a variety
   produced for edible sprouts ('Intersemillas' sprouts) and a purple
   broccoli sprouts ('Viola').
   Using HPLC-UV photo-diode array detection (PAD)-electrospray ionisation
   (ESI)-MS/MS (HPLC-PAD-ESI-MS/MS), acylated anthocyanins were
   characterised. The main peaks were
   cyanidin-3-O-digluco-side-5-O-glucoside acylated and double acylated
   with p-coumaric, sinapic, caffeic, ferulic or sinapic acids, with at
   least three predominant anthocyanins isomers of cyanidin
   3-O-(acyl)diglucoside-5-O-glucoside, cyanidin
   3-O-(acyl1)(acyl2)diglucoside-5-O-glucoside, and cyanidin
   3-O-(acyl1)(acyl2)diglucoside-5-O-(malonyl)glucoside, within the 17
   different anthocyanins characterised in broccoli sprouts for the first
   time. The qualitative and quantitative differences in the anthocyanin
   composition between the `green head' broccoli cultivars (Marathon,
   Nubia), the green variety-for-sprouts (Intersemillas), and the richest
   variety in anthocyanins, the early purple sprouting broccoli sprouts
   ('Viola'), showed the dependence on cultivar to drive the phytochemical
   load of vegetable foods.
   The broccoli sprouts could be potential naturally-healthy functional
   foods at the seedling stage for delivering significant levels of
   bioactive compounds besides other flavonoids, glucosinolate-derived
   isothiocyanates. together with vitamins and minerals. (C) 2010 Elsevier

   an element of W, where T-g is the integration operator

Abstract = {{Germinal centers (GCs) are specialized microenvironments that generate
   high-affinity Ab-forming cells (AFCs) and memory B cells. Many B cells
   undergo apoptosis during B cell clonal selection in GCs. Although the
   factors that regulate the AFC and GC responses are not precisely
   understood, it is widely believed that dysregulated AFCs and GCs
   contribute to autoimmunity. The Mer receptor tyrosine kinase (Mer)
   facilitates macrophage clearance of apoptotic cells. The Tyro-3, Axl,
   and Mer receptors, including Mer, suppress TLRs and cytokine-mediated
   inflammatory responses. We report in this study that tingible body
   macrophages (TBM phi s) in GCs express Mer. Compared to C57BL/6 (B6)
   controls, Mer-deficient (Mer(-/-)) mice had significantly higher AFC,
   GC, and Th1-skewed IgG2 Ab (especially IgG2c) responses against the T
   cell-dependent Ag (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl) acetyl-chicken gamma
   globulin. Mer(-/-) mice had a significantly higher percentage of GC B
   cells on days 9, 14, and 21 postimmunization compared with B6 controls.
   Significantly increased numbers of apoptotic cells accumulated in
   Mer(-/-) GCs than in B6 GCs, whereas the number of TBM phi s remained
   similar in both strains. Our data are the first, to our knowledge, to
   demonstrate a critical role for Mer in GC apoptotic cell clearance by
   TBM phi s and have interesting implications for Mer in the regulation of
   B cell tolerance operative in the AFC and GC pathways. The Journal of
   Immunology, 2010, 185: 5859-5868.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Phylogenetic study of protein sequences provides unique and
   valuable insights into the molecular and genetic basis of important
   medical and epidemiological problems as well as insights about the
   origins and development of physiological features in present day
   organisms. Consensus phylogenies based on the bootstrap and other
   resampling methods play a crucial part in analyzing the robustness of
   the trees produced for these analyses.
   Methodology: Our focus was to increase the number of bootstrap
   replications that can be performed on large protein datasets using the
   maximum parsimony, distance matrix, and maximum likelihood methods. We
   have modified the PHYLIP package using MPI to enable large-scale
   phylogenetic study of protein sequences, using a statistically robust
   number of bootstrapped datasets, to be performed in a moderate amount of
   time. This paper discusses the methodology used to parallelize the
   PHYLIP programs and reports the performance of the parallel PHYLIP
   programs that are relevant to the study of protein evolution on several
   protein datasets.
   Conclusions: Calculations that currently take a few days on a state of
   the art desktop workstation are reduced to calculations that can be
   performed over lunchtime on a modern parallel computer. Of the three
   protein methods tested, the maximum likelihood method scales the best,
   followed by the distance method, and then the maximum parsimony method.
   However, the maximum likelihood method requires significant memory
   resources, which limits its application to more moderately sized protein
   datasets.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a Timoshenko system with a delay term in the
   feedback and prove a stability result. The beam is clamped at the
   endpoints and has, in addition to an internal damping, a feedback with a
   delay.
   Under an appropriate assumption on the weights of the two feedbacks, we
   prove the well-posedness of the system and establish an exponential
   decay result for the case of equal-speed wave propagation. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{In this letter, a novel technique for direct conversion of an optical
   baseband quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) signal to a
   millimeter-wave wireless signal and subsequent signal demodulation is
   reported. Optical heterodyne mixing of the optical baseband QPSK signal
   with a free-running unmodulated laser for the wireless signal generation
   is employed. To correct for the phase and frequency offset originating
   from the heterodyne mixing of the two free-running lasers, wireless
   signal demodulation based on optical coherent detection in combination
   with baseband digital signal processing is implemented. As a proof of
   concept, 5-Gb/s amplitude-shift keying and up to a 16-Gb/s QPSK wireless
   signal in the band of 75-110 GHz was generated and successfully
   demodulated. All-photonic millimeter-wave wireless signal generation and
   digital coherent detection at baud-rate are employed without complex
   optical phase-locked loop.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Atu027, a novel RNA interference therapeutic, has been shown to
   inhibit lymph node metastasis in orthotopic prostate cancer mouse
   models. The aim of this study is to elucidate the pharmacologic activity
   of Atu027 in inhibiting hematogenous metastasis to the target organ lung
   in four different preclinical mouse models.
   Experimental Design: Atu027 compared with vehicle or control small
   interfering RNA lipoplexes was tested in two experimental lung
   metastasis models (Lewis lung carcinoma, B16V) and spontaneous
   metastasis mouse models (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, mammary fat pad).
   Different dosing schedules (repeated low volume tail vein injections)
   were applied to obtain insight into effective Atu027 treatment. Primary
   tumor growth and lung metastasis were measured, and tissues were
   analyzed by immunohistochemistry and histology. In vitro studies in
   human umbilical vein endothelial cells were carried out to provide an
   insight into molecular changes on depletion of PKN3, in support of
   efficacy results.
   Results: Intravenous administration of Atu027 prevents pulmonary
   metastasis. In particular, formation of spontaneous lung metastasis was
   significantly inhibited in animals with large tumor grafts as well as in
   mice with resected primary mammary fat pad tumors. In addition, we
   provide evidence that an increase in VE-cadherin protein levels as a
   downstream result of PKN3 target gene inhibition may change endothelial
   function, resulting in reduced colonization and micrometastasis
   formation.
   Conclusion: Atu027 can be considered as a potent drug for preventing
   lung metastasis formation, which might be suitable for preventing
   hematogenous metastasis in addition to standard cancer therapy. Clin

Abstract = {{Curcumin and tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) have been found as potent DNMT1
   inhibitors, but they suffer from low oral bioavailability and rapid
   metabolism in vivo. To circumvent these problems, two curcumin analogs:
   1,7-bis(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione (TMC)
   and 1,7-bis(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-cyclohexyl-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione
   (DMCHC) have been synthesized to enhance their stability by blocking the
   two metabolic sites, the phenolic and C4 methylene moieties. Both
   compounds have shown inhibitory activity on M. Sssl similar to that of
   curcumin and THC (Poster, M1114, AAPS, 2009). Preclinical
   pharmacokinetics has yet to be performed. In this paper, a simple liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method was developed for the
   determination of these four curcuminoids in cell medium and mouse
   plasma. The method showed linearity from 1 to 1000 ng/mL with the lower
   limit of quantification of 1 ng/mL in cell medium, and 5 ng/mL in mouse
   plasma for all test curcuminoids. The within-day coefficients of
   variation were found to be below 15\% and the accuracy was in the range
   of 85-115\%. This method was subsequently used to evaluate their
   stability in these matrices and a pilot pharmacokinetics of curcumin,
   DMCHC and TMC in mice after an intraperitoneal (i.p.) cassette dosing of
   10 mg/kg each. Curcuminoids degraded in two phases with terminal half
   lives of 186, 813, 724, and 2000 min for curcumin. THC, TMC, and DMCHC,
   respectively, in cell culture medium. In plasma, their respective half
   lives were 111, 232, 1202 and 3000 min. These data demonstrated that
   their stability is in the order curcumin < THC < TMC < DMCHC in both
   matrices. Following an i.p. cassette dose, both TMC and DMCHC showed the
   prolonged elimination half life (1.0, 1.0 h, respectively vs 0.4 h for
   curcumin) and an increased drug exposure as described by the area under
   the curve (0.64, 0.98 mu M h, respectively vs 0.4 mu M h for curcumin).

   enriched in pathogenic SOD1 accumulate in the spinal cords of transgenic
   mice expressing these proteins, but endogenous mouse SOD1 is not found
   as a component of these aggregates. In the accompanying paper, Karch and
   colleagues analyze aggregation propensities of human/mouse SOD1 chimeras
   in cell culture and identify two sequence elements in the human enzyme
   that seem to enhance its aggregation relative to the mouse enzyme. Here,
   we report the first structure of mouse SOD1 along with those of SOD1
   chimeras in which residues 1-80 come from human SOD1 and residues 81-153
   come from mouse SOD1 and vice versa. Taken together, the structural and
   cell-based data suggest a model in which residues Q42 and Q123 in mouse
   SOD1 modulate non-native SOD1-SOD1 intermolecular interactions at edge
   strands in the SOD1 Greek key beta-barrel. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{A series of photocatalysts TiO2/CFA were prepared using coal fly ash
   (CFA), waste discharged from coal-fired power plant, as substrate, and
   then these photocatalysts were characterized by scanning electron
   microscope, X-ray diffraction analysis, nitrogen adsorption test and
   ultraviolet-visible absorption analysis. The effects of loading percent
   of TiO2 on the photocatalytic activity and re-use property of TiO2/CFA
   were evaluated by the photocatalytic decoloration and mineralization of
   methyl orange solution. The results show that the pore volume and the
   specific surface area of the TiO2/CFA both increased with the increase
   in the loading percent of TiO2, which improved the photocatalytic
   activity of TiO2/CFA. However, when the loading percent of TiO2 was too
   high (up to 54.51\%), superfluous TiO2 was easy to break away from CFA
   in the course of water treatment, which was disadvantaged to the
   recycling property of TiO2/CFA. In this study, the optimal loading
   percent of TiO2 was 49.97\%, and the efficiencies of photocatalytic
   decoloration and mineralization could be maintained above 99\% and 90\%,
   respectively, when the photocatalyst was used repeatedly, without any
   decline, even at the sixth cycle. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   act as an estrogen agonist, however there was strong evidence of
   antagonistic activity as Galaxolide (R) inhibited the estrogenic
   activity of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) In the YES assay based on a
   recombinant strain of yeast containing the human estrogen receptor (i e
   hER alpha), Galaxolide (R) inhibited the effects of E2 in a
   dose-dependent manner (IC50 =1 63 x 10(-5) M) In a luciferase reporter
   gene assay based on the rainbow trout estrogen receptor e rtER)
   transfected into a rainbow trout gonadal (RTG-2) cell line the IC50 for
   the antagonistic effect of Galaxolide (R) was 2 79 x 10-9 M In an in
   vivo assay based on modulation of vitellogenin in rainbow trout
   Galaxolide (R) i p injected into trout at a dose of 3 64 mg/kg caused
   inhibition of E2-induced vitellogenin production That dose is within the
   range of concentrations of Galaxolide (R) that have been detected in
   tissues of fish from contaminated locations (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All

Abstract = {{A consistent chemical equilibrium model that calculates pH from charge
   balance constraints and aluminum and iron speciation in the presence of
   natural organic matter is presented. The model requires input data for
   total aluminum, iron, organic carbon, fluoride, sulfate, and charge
   balance ANC. The model is calibrated to pH measurements (n = 322) by
   adjusting the fraction of active organic matter only, which results in
   an error of pH prediction on average below 0.2 pH units. The small
   systematic discrepancy between the analytical results for the monomeric
   aluminum fractionation and the model results is corrected for separately
   for two different fractionation techniques (n = 499) and validated on a
   large number In = 3419) of geographically widely spread samples all over
   Sweden. The resulting average error for inorganic monomeric aluminum is
   around 1 mu M. In its present form the model is the first internally
   consistent modeling approach for Sweden and may now be used as a tool
   for environmental quality management Soil gibbsite with a log {*}K-s of
   8.29 at 25 degrees C together with a pH dependent loading function that

Abstract = {{Croplands are the largest biospheric source of carbon (C) to the
   atmosphere in Europe each year (similar to 0.3 GtC y(-1)). Moreover, the
   biological dynamics of managed landscapes affect the fluctuations of
   atmospheric CO2 levels on annual and interannual scales. The activity of
   croplands must therefore be included in efforts to quantify, understand
   and regulate the global C cycle. C flux data for croplands, existing
   mostly from similar to 2003 onwards, provide an opportunity to better
   understand the timing and magnitude of C exchanges in croplands and can
   help to improve crop C modelling on various spatiotemporal scales. A
   crucial process to be considered for C budget modelling is crop
   development, to which the C allocation pattern and senescence and
   remobilisation processes are directly linked.
   We developed, parameterised, and tested a new crop C mass balance model
   (SPAc), which included all major developmental stages (DS) and C
   remobilisation. Model results were compared against independent
   observations of C fluxes and biometric data for eight site years, at six
   European sites growing winter wheat and barley. We used a single
   parameterisation for all sites, varying only maximal carboxylation rate
   (V-cmax), maximal photosynthetic electron transport rate (J(max)), and C
   per leaf area (C-la) between wheat and barley. The model effectively
   described the seasonal dynamics of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) through
   simulation of DS. We found high model reliability for predicting daily
   NEE fluxes (mean R-2 = 0.83, mean RMSE = 1.47 gC m(-2) d(-1)). Results
   for cumulative NEE from sowing to harvest were of lower quality (mean
   R-2 = 0.27). The model tended to overpredict leaf area index (LAI, 160\%
   of observed), and underpredict final yield (71\% of observed). The
   introduction of a dead leaf C pool considerably improved at-harvest
   estimates of total leaf C mass. Simulating the shift from green to brown
   above-ground biomass is of potential significance for solving the
   surface energy balance and for future remote sensing studies through an
   improved simulation of crop canopy optical properties. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, partially hydrolyzed ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA)
   copolymers with three hydrolysis degrees (12.2\%, 32.6\% and 46.9\%)
   were obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of EVA copolymer, characterized by
   Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), H-1 NMR and gel
   permeation chromatography (GPC). Paclitaxel-loaded and drug-free films
   based on the partially hydrolyzed EVA copolymers were fabricated. The
   swelling behaviors, crystallinities, mechanical properties of the
   fabricated films were investigated, and the effects of hydrolysis
   degree, film thickness and drug loading dose on in vitro drug release
   from the films were also investigated. In vitro swelling study showed
   that the swelling of partially hydrolyzed EVA films was greater than the
   EVA film and the film with higher hydrolysis degree swelled more
   intensively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results exhibited that the
   crystallinity of the polymer increased with increasing hydrolysis
   degree. In paclitaxel-loaded EVA film, a part of paclitaxel was in
   crystalline form; while in paclitaxel-loaded partially hydrolyzed EVA
   films, paclitaxel was distributed in amorphous form or molecularly
   dispersed. In the in vitro drug release test, the film with higher
   hydrolysis degree and smaller thickness released paclitaxel more
   quickly. With higher drug loading dose, the drug release rate was
   larger. The partially hydrolyzed EVA films were applied for drug
   delivery systems for the first time, and demonstrated to have great
   capability of controlling drug release thanks to the adjustable
   hydrolysis degree. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   improved by the addition of a minor amount of cerium. But this effect is
   much less pronounced for ZA104 + 0.3Ca alloy. Variations of the

   production Although the mechanics of proplatelet elongation hove been
   studied, the terminal steps of pro platelet maturation and platelet
   release remain poorly understood To elucidate this process, released
   proplatelets were isolated, and their conversion into individual
   platelets was assessed This enabled us to (a) define and quantify the
   different stages in platelet maturation, (b) identify a new intermediate
   stage in platelet production, the preplatelet, (c) delineate the
   cytoskeletal mechanics involved in preplatelet/proplatelet
   interconversion, and (d) model proplatelet fission and platelet release
   Preplatelets are anucleate discoid particles 2-10 mu m across that have
   the capacity to convert reversibly into elongated proplatelets by
   twisting microtubule based forces that can be visualized in proplatelets
   expressing GFP-beta 1 tubulin The release of platelets from the ends of
   proplatelets occurs at an increasing rate in time during culture, as
   larger proplatelets undergo successive fission, and is potentiated by

Abstract = {{It has been well documented that ascorbate enhances iron uptake, with a
   proposed mechanism based on reduction to the more absorbable ferrous
   form. We have performed a study on the effects of ascorbate on ferric
   iron uptake in the human epithelial Caco-2 cell-line. Ascorbate
   increased uptake in a concentration-dependent manner with a significant
   difference between iron uptake and reduction. Uptake kinetics are
   characteristic of a non-essential activator and the formation of an
   Fe3+-ascorbate complex. This investigation provides evidence that
   ascorbate enhances the apical uptake of ferric iron into Caco-2 cells
   through the formation of a Fe3+-ascorbate complex. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The present study was performed to investigate the effect of acidosis on
   the efflux of ATP from skeletal muscle. Infusion of lactic acid to the
   perfused hindlimb muscles of anaesthetised rats produced dose-dependent
   decreases in pH and increases in the interstitial ATP of extensor
   digitorum longus (EDL) muscle: 10 mm lactic acid reduced the venous pH
   from 7.22 +/- 0.04 to 6.97 +/- 0.02 and increased interstitial ATP from
   38 +/- 8 to 67 +/- 11 nm. The increase in interstitial ATP was
   well-correlated with the decrease in pH (r2 = 0.93; P < 0.05). Blockade
   of cellular uptake of lactic acid using alpha-cyano-hydroxycinnamic acid
   abolished the lactic acid-induced ATP release, whilst infusion of sodium
   lactate failed to depress pH or increase interstitial ATP, suggesting
   that intracellular pH depression, rather than lactate, stimulated the
   ATP efflux. Incubation of cultured skeletal myoblasts with 10 mm lactic
   acid significantly increased the accumulation of ATP in the bathing
   medium from 0.46 +/- 0.06 to 0.76 +/- 0.08 mu m, confirming the skeletal
   muscle cells as the source of the released ATP. Acidosis-induced ATP
   efflux from the perfused muscle was abolished by CFTRinh-172, a specific
   inhibitor of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
   (CFTR), or glibenclamide, an inhibitor of both K-ATP channels and CFTR,
   but it was not affected by atractyloside, an inhibitor of the
   mitochondrial ATP transporter. Silencing of the CFTR gene using an siRNA
   abolished the acidosis-induced increase in ATP release from cultured
   myoblasts. CFTR expression on skeletal muscle cells was confirmed using
   immunostaining in the intact muscle and Western blotting in the cultured
   cells. These data suggest that depression of the intracellular pH of
   skeletal muscle cells stimulates ATP efflux, and that CFTR plays an
   important role in the release mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The possibility of improving the performances of new generation re-entry
   vehicles as well as reducing the mission costs is closely connected to
   the development of new thermal protection systems: innovative heat
   shield materials, able to withstand higher temperature during the lift
   re-entry manoeuvre, would permit to improve reusability and easiness of
   maintenance as well as to increase the manoeuvrability and the payload
   of vehicles. UHTC materials, and, among them, Zirconium diboride based
   materials, exhibit outstanding oxidation and thermal shock resistance,
   high emissivity and very high melting temperature: all these properties
   make ZrB2 based materials possible candidates for thermal protection
   systems of atmospheric re-entry vehicles. The experimental activities
   described in the present work were focused on ZrB2 based coatings
   deposited by plasma spray, containing SiC and MoSi2 in different ratios:
   the work aimed at understanding the role of MoSi2 addition in the
   oxidation resistance. XRD analysis was carried out on starting powders
   and plasma sprayed coatings, in order to evaluate the transformations of
   crystalline phases induced by thermal deposition and to analyse the
   possible presence of amorphous phase: XPS was also used to study the
   coatings surface composition and to obtain information about chemical
   bonds in the materials. Oxidation behaviour was studied carrying out
   exposure tests up to 1800 degrees C in static air to compare and model
   the oxidation kinetics of the different compositions: results show the
   better behaviour of materials containing MoSi2. Microstructure of as
   sprayed and oxidised samples was observed by means of SEM and analysed
   by EDS to understand the link between dispersion of Mo containing phases
   and the improved oxidation resistance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Statistical uncertainty in f(tau) is promoted to be an asset via a
   sampling of equivalent f(tau) within the noise, which give rise to
   independent evolutionary processes. In the case of pure superfluid He-4
   we have recovered from exact QMC simulations sharp quasiparticle
   excitations with spectral functions displaying also the multiphonon
   branch. As further applications, we have studied the impuriton branch of

   degrees S-25 degrees N than for the rest of the globe. The average beta
   in this region is 0.35 degrees C (W m(-2))(-1). The models used in the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC

Abstract = {{The provisioning of differentiated Quality-of-Service (QoS) is a key
   objective in the design and deployment of convergent multi-service
   communication networks. Integrated traffic management schemes that
   combine various fundamental scheduling principles have been proposed for
   the QoS differentiation in cellular and IEEE 802.16/WiMAX-based
   broadband wireless networks. In this paper, cost-effective analytical
   performance models are devised for a new hybrid scheduling scheme based
   on the integration of the well-known Priority Queueing (PQ) and Weighted
   Fair Queueing (WFQ) scheduling principles. In these models, traffic
   arrival processes are represented, respectively, by non-bursty Poisson
   process and bursty-correlated Markov-Modulate Poisson Process (MMPP) and
   new closed-form expressions of main performance metrics are derived
   including system fairness, mean number of packets in each buffer, system
   throughput, mean queueing delay and packet loss probability of
   individual traffic flows. The accuracy of the analytical models is
   validated through extensive comparisons between analytical results and
   those obtained from simulation experiments. Finally, these models are
   adopted to investigate the impact of the weights of traffic flows served
   by WFQ and assess the adverse effects of the traffic burstiness and
   correlation on the performance of the integrated scheduling scheme. (C)

Abstract = {{The mitotic kinase Aurora-A (Aur-A) is required to form the bipolar
   spindle and ensure accurate chromosome segregation before cell division.
   Aur-A dysregulation represents an oncogenic event that promotes tumor
   formation. Here, we report that Aur-A promotes breast cancer metastasis.
   Aur-A overexpression enhanced mammary cell migration by
   dephosphorylation and activation of cofilin, which facilitates actin
   reorganization and polymerization. Cofilin knockdown impaired
   Aur-A-driven cell migration and protrusion of the cell membrane.
   Conversely, overexpression of activated cofilin abrogated the effects of
   Aur-A knockdown on cell migration. Moreover, Aur-A overexpession
   increased the expression of the cofilin phosphatase Slingshot-1 (SSH1),
   contributing to cofilin activation and cell migration. We found that
   phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition blocked Aur-A-induced
   cofilin dephosphorylation, actin reorganization, and cell migration,
   suggesting crosstalk with PI3K signaling and a potential benefit of PI3K
   inhibition in tumors with deregulated Aur-A. Additionally, we found an
   association between Aur-A overexpression and cofilin activity in breast
   cancer tissues. Our findings indicate that activation of the
   cofilin-F-actin pathway contributes to tumor cell migration and
   metastasis enhanced by Aur-A, revealing a novel function for mitotic
   Aur-A kinase in tumor progression. Cancer Res; 70(22); 9118-28. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The Guangzhou section of the Pearl River (GSPR) has been seriously
   affected by long-term intensive industrial and urban activities. The
   objectives of this study were to determine the total As (TAs) content
   and the forms of that As in order to investigate the geochemical
   relationships between As forms and sediment mineral phases of the
   surface sediments of the GSPR. Fifteen samples of surface sediment were
   collected and analyzed for TAs as well as As chemical forms. Results
   indicated that TAs in the sediment samples averaged 24.6 mg kg(-1) and
   ranged from 16.7 to 33.4 mg kg(-1). These values are generally higher
   than the probable effect level of 17.0 mg kg(-1). The As was mostly
   associated with iron oxides (53.5\%), followed by association with the
   residual fraction (36.2\%). Amor-Fe bound As and Cry-Fe bound As
   quantities were positively correlated to the Amor-Fe and Cry-Fe
   quantities, respectively. In addition, organic matter(OM), clay and
   Sum-Fe contents were positively correlated to TAs in the sediment
   fractions. The molar ratios of iron oxide-bound As to iron content
   approached the maximum molar ratios of As to Fe for natural hematite,
   magnetite, and goethite. Adverse effects caused by As will likely
   frequently occur at these high levels of As contamination. Thus, it is
   necessary to remediate the sediment of the GSPR to reduce the potential
   risks of As contamination. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The molecules and mechanisms involved in patterning the dorsoventral
   axis of the developing vertebrate spinal cord have been investigated
   extensively and many are well known. Conversely, knowledge of mechanisms
   patterning cellular distributions along the rostrocaudal axis is
   relatively more restricted. Much is known about the rostrocaudal
   distribution of motoneurons and spinal cord cells derived from neural
   crest but there is little known about the rostrocaudal patterning of
   most of the other spinal cord neurons. Here we report data from our
   analyses of the distribution of dorsal longitudinal ascending (DoLA)
   interneurons in the developing zebrafish spinal cord. We show that,
   although apparently distributed irregularly, these cells have cryptic
   organisation. We present a novel cell-labelling technique that reveals
   that DoLA interneurons migrate rostrally along the dorsal longitudinal
   fasciculus of the spinal cord during development. This cell-labelling
   strategy may be useful for in vivo analysis of factors controlling
   neuron migration in the central nervous system. Additionally, we show
   that DoLA interneurons persist in the developing spinal cord for longer
   than previously reported. These findings illustrate the need to
   investigate factors and mechanisms that determine ``irregular{''}
   patterns of cell distribution, particularly in the central nervous
   system but also in other tissues of developing embryos. (C) 2010

   Electrochemical data reveal that Pd NWs can effectively enhance the

   over-potential of AA oxidation. Particularly, the current-time curve
   shows that the catalytic oxidation current is linearly dependent on AA
   concentration in the range of 25 mu M-0.9 mM with a correlation
   coefficient 0.9998, and a detection limit of 0.2 mu M (S/N =3) is
   obtained with an excellent reproducibility. What is more, the present Pd

Abstract = {{Ceramic substrates for power electronic circuits or integrated
   components are usually metallised by cost-intensive thermal processes.
   Simple, flexible and cost-effective solutions are increasingly demanded
   for integrated power electronic devices. Cold gas spraying (CGS) can
   deliver these demands. It is employed to produce dense, well adherent
   and oxide free coatings with properties comparable to the respective
   bulk material. The CGS-metallisation of non-conductive parts for power
   electronic devices permits a direct assembly and contacting of
   semi-conductors.
   Industrially available Al2O3 substrates are first CGS-coated with
   aluminium, which acts as an adhesive layer. In a second step, the
   aluminium layer is coated with copper, which exhibits good electric
   properties. The conductive structure on the ceramic is achieved by using
   a laser cut steel template, which allows for a minimal circuit width of
   about 250 mu m.
   In order to clarify the adhesion mechanisms of cold-gas sprayed
   aluminium on alumina coated samples were subjected to micro-structural
   characterisation with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning
   transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron backscatter
   diffraction (EBSD). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aberrant activation of fatty acid synthesis is a key feature of many
   advanced human cancers. Unlike in classical lipogenic tissues, this
   process has been implicated in membrane production required for rapid
   cell proliferation. Here, to gain further insight into the consequences
   of tumor-associated fatty acid synthesis, we have mimicked the lipogenic
   phenotype of cancer cells in Xenopus embryos by microinjection of RNA
   encoding the lipogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element
   binding protein 1c (SREBP1c). Dramatic morphologic changes were observed
   that could be linked to alterations in Wnt and Hedgehog signaling, and
   ultimately to a distortion of the primary cilium. This is a
   sophisticated microtubular sensory organelle that is expressed on the
   surface of nearly every cell type and that is lost in many cancers.
   SREBP1c-induced loss of the primary cilium could be confirmed in
   mammalian Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and was mediated by
   changes in the supply of fatty acids. Conversely, inhibition of fatty
   acid synthesis in highly lipogenic human prostate cancer cells restored
   the formation of the primary cilium. Lipid-induced ciliary loss was
   associated with mislocalization of apical proteins, distortion of cell
   polarization, and aberrant epithelial tissue development as revealed in
   three-dimensional cultures of MDCK cells and in the developing mouse
   prostate. These data imply that tumor-associated lipogenesis, in
   addition to rendering cells more autonomous in terms of lipid supply,
   disturbs cilium formation and contributes to impaired environmental
   sensing, aberrant signaling, and distortion of polarized tissue
   architecture, which are all hallmarks of cancer. Cancer Res; 70(22);

Title = {{On the Size and Flight Diversity of Giant Pterosaurs, the Use of Birds

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The size and flight mechanics of giant pterosaurs have received
   considerable research interest for the last century but are confused by
   conflicting interpretations of pterosaur biology and flight
   capabilities. Avian biomechanical parameters have often been applied to
   pterosaurs in such research but, due to considerable differences in
   avian and pterosaur anatomy, have lead to systematic errors interpreting
   pterosaur flight mechanics. Such assumptions have lead to assertions
   that giant pterosaurs were extremely lightweight to facilitate flight
   or, if more realistic masses are assumed, were flightless. Reappraisal
   of the proportions, scaling and morphology of giant pterosaur fossils
   suggests that bird and pterosaur wing structure, gross anatomy and
   launch kinematics are too different to be considered mechanically
   interchangeable. Conclusions assuming such interchangeability-including
   those indicating that giant pterosaurs were flightless-are found to be
   based on inaccurate and poorly supported assumptions of structural
   scaling and launch kinematics. Pterosaur bone strength and flap-gliding
   performance demonstrate that giant pterosaur anatomy was capable of
   generating sufficient lift and thrust for powered flight as well as
   resisting flight loading stresses. The retention of flight
   characteristics across giant pterosaur skeletons and their considerable
   robustness compared to similarly-massed terrestrial animals suggest that
   giant pterosaurs were not flightless. Moreover, the term `giant
   pterosaur' includes at least two radically different forms with very
   distinct palaeoecological signatures and, accordingly, all but the most
   basic sweeping conclusions about giant pterosaur flight should be
   treated with caution. Reappraisal of giant pterosaur material also
   reveals that the size of the largest pterosaurs, previously suggested to
   have wingspans up to 13 m and masses up to 544 kg, have been
   overestimated. Scaling of fragmentary giant pterosaur remains have been
   misled by distorted fossils or used inappropriate scaling techniques,
   indicating that 10-11 m wingspans and masses of 200-250 kg are the most
   reliable upper estimates of known pterosaur size.}},

Abstract = {{Both glutaraldehyde (GA) and 1,3-dimethylol-4,5-dihydroxyethyleneurea
   (DMDHEU) can crosslink the cell wall polymers and dimensionally
   stabilize wood particles and the treated wood particles are thus
   expected to enhance the properties of the resulting wood
   particle/polypropylene composites Compared to the composites filled with
   untreated particles, treatments of wood particles with both GA and
   DMDHEU showed a great reduction in water uptake and dimensional swelling
   of the resulting composites up to 39\% and 46\%, respectively. Both the
   flexural and tensile moduli increased due to wood particles treatments
   with GA and DMDHEU. Treatments of wood particles improved the tensile
   strength but moderately weakened the flexural strength and Charpy impact
   strength of the composites. Dynamic mechanical analysis and microscopy
   suggested an improved interfacial compatibility between wood particles
   and matrix due to GA and DMDHEU treatments Chemical treatment resulted
   in smaller particle sizes and altered microscopic fracture appearance
   after composite production as compared to untreated particles.
   Morphological changes were attributed to embrittlement of wood
   particles, which may negatively influence the mechanical properties of
   the resulting composites. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{The North Qilian Shan is an accretion-collision orogenic belt in the
   northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau that connects the North China
   plate to the north with the Tethyan orogenic assemblage to the south Its
   Early Paleozoic temporal-spatial tectonic evolution has been extensively
   studied but the nature and tectonic setting of its Silurian deposition
   is poorly understood Our new petrological analysis suggests that the
   clast composition of fan conglomerates is complex In the Danbanshan and
   Zhongdabanshan sections abundant lenticular conglomerate beds contain
   mainly subrounded-rounded metamorphic clasts whereas the Tongziba and
   Haichaoba sections contain volcanic chert limestone ultramafic and
   granitoid clasts However in the Sunan area clast types are relatively
   simple dominated by basalt and granitoids and at Tongziba gabbro and
   basalt clasts are subrounded and angular indicating two different types
   of provenance Ultramafic limestone and abundant chert clasts in the
   Haichaoba and Tonghe conglomerates indicate an ophiolitic source whereas
   subrounded-rounded quartzite and granitoid gneiss clasts were probably
   derived from the Central Qilian basement Geochemical data from the
   volcanic and granitoid clasts suggest an arc-related source and their
   zircon U-Pb ages of 515-429 Ma suggest that the arc magmatism did not
   end in the Mid-Silurian Sandstone petrology and detrital modes suggest
   that the Silurian sediments were deposited in a forearc basin
   Paleogeographic reconstructions inferred from NNW-NNE paleocurrent data
   indicate that an Island arc was present off the southern margin of the
   Silurian basin and that southward subduction of oceanic crust between
   North China and the Qilian Shan was active or continued in the Silurian

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{17, SI}},
Pages = {{2093-2104}},

Abstract = {{A graph theoretic approach is proposed to formulate communication graphs
   that enable ultrafast information distribution. In our earlier work, we
   reported that Borel Cayley graph (BCG) is a promising candidate as a
   logical topology for fast information distribution. However, the
   practical applications of BCG have been challenging because of its
   inflexible sizes. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective graph
   resizing algorithm that removes nodes from an oversized BCG to achieve a
   desired network size The proposed resizing algorithm consists of two
   parts; a random pruning algorithm that identifies nodes to be removed
   uniformly at random; and a novel cut-through rewiring (CUR) algorithm
   that rewires the remaining nodes. The proposed resizing algorithm
   preserves the superior properties of the original BCGs, including a
   small diameter, a short average path length, a large algebraic
   connectivity, and ultrafast information distribution performance.
   Furthermore, analytical formulae were derived to compute the graph
   disconnection probability of the BCGs after resizing Analytical results
   showed that the resized graphs are almost surely connected even after 80
   similar to 90\% size reduction, depending on the original BCG size (C)

Abstract = {{We study the effect of time delay in the FitzHugh-Nagumo neural model
   with correlations between multiplicative and additive noise terms. Based
   on the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, the explicit expressions of
   the stationary probability distribution function (SPDF), the mean first
   passage time (MFPT) and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are obtained,
   respectively. Research results show that: (i) the system undergoes a
   succession of two phase transitions (i.e., the reentrance phenomenon) as
   the noise correlation parameter is increased and a (single) phase
   transition as the time delay is increased. (ii) The MFPT as a function
   of the multiplicative noise intensity exhibits a maximum. This maximum
   for MFPT identifies the noise enhanced stability (NES) effect, the noise
   correlation parameter intensifies the NES effect while the time delay,
   and the additive noise intensity weakens it. (iii) The existence of a
   maximum in the SNR as a function of the multiplicative noise intensity
   is the identifying characteristic of the stochastic resonance (SR)
   phenomenon, the noise correlation parameter enhances the SR while the
   time delay, and the additive noise intensity weaken it. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Photoionization cross sections for the Ce3+@C-82 endohedral fullerene in
   the energy region 100-150 eV have been studied using our open-shell
   random phase approximation with exchange method and a C-82 model
   potential. The electron affinity (EA) of C-82 has been calculated using
   the density functional theory. The C-82 fullerene was described by an
   attractive short-range spherical well with the potential V (r), given by
   V (r) = -V-0 for r(i) < r < r(0); otherwise V (r) = 0, where r(i) and
   r(0) are, respectively, the inner and outer radii of the spherical
   shell. The potential V-0 was obtained by solving the resultant
   transcendental equation using the calculated EA value. The wavefunctions
   of Ce3+ confined inside C-82 have been calculated by solving the
   Schrodinger equation using both regular and irregular solutions and the
   continuous boundary conditions of the wavefunctions and their
   logarithmic derivatives at r(i) and r(0). The total photoionization
   cross section for Ce3+@C-82 shows both the resonance and suppression
   effects and demonstrates a much weaker resonance peak at 113.0 eV

Abstract = {{In the present paper, we investigate the molecular structure and
   hyperfine couplings of a series of sigma radicals containing first- and
   second-row atoms (H2CN, H2CP, NH2, PH2) for which accurate gas-phase
   microwave results are available. The presence of alpha- and, especially,
   beta-hydrogen atoms makes the evaluation of magnetic properties of these
   radicals particularly challenging. Geometrical parameters have been
   computed by the coupled-cluster ansatz in conjunction with hierarchical
   series of basis sets, thus accounting for extrapolation to the complete
   basis-set limit. Core correlation as well as higher excitations in the
   electronic-correlation treatment have also been taken into account. An
   analogous approach has been employed for evaluating hyperfine coupling
   constants with particular emphasis given to basis-set, correlation, and
   geometrical effects. The corresponding vibrational corrections, required
   for a meaningful comparison to experimental data, have also been
   investigated. The remarkable agreement with experiment confirms the
   reliability of the present computational approach, already validated for
   pi radicals, thus establishing the way for setting up a benchmark
   database for magnetic properties. (C) 2010 American Institute of

Abstract = {{AIM: To investigate the proliferative effect of advanced glycation
   end-products (AGEs) and the role of their cellular receptor (RAGE) on
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, and the inhibitory effects of
   MK615, an extract from Japanese apricot, against AGEs were also
   evaluated.
   METHODS: Two HCC cell lines, HuH7 and HepG2, were used. Expression of
   RAGE was investigated by polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting,
   and flow cytemetry (FACS). The effect of MK615 on RAGE expression was
   also evaluated by FACS. The proliferative effects of a control
   (unglycated bovine serum albumin), glucose-derived AGEs (Glc-AGE), and
   glyceraldehyde-derived AGEs (Glycer-AGE), and the anti-proliferative
   effect of MK615 against AGEs, were evaluated using MTT assays.
   RESULTS: Expression of RAGE was confirmed at both the mRNA and protein
   levels in both HuH7 and HepG2. FACS revealed that the level of RAGE
   expression was higher in HuH7 than in HepG2. Treatment with 0.1 mu g/mL
   MK615 decreased the expression level of RAGE from 24.3\% to 3.7\% in
   HuH7 and from 6.2\% to 4.8\% in HepG2. The growth indices for the
   control, Glc-AGE, and Glycer-AGE were 1.06 +/- 0.08, 0.99 +/- 0.04, and
   1.38 +/- 0.05, respectively, in HuH7 (P = 0.037), and were 1.03 +/-
   0.04, 1.04 +/- 0.03, and 1.07 +/- 0.05, respectively, in HepG2 (P >
   0.05). When the cells were cultured simultaneously with Glycer-AGE and
   MK615, MK615 abrogated the proliferative effect of Glycer-AGE in HuH7.
   CONCLUSION: Only Glycer-AGE has a proliferative effect on HuH7, which
   expresses a higher level of RAGE. MK615 suppresses the proliferative
   effect of Glycer-AGE on HuH7 by decreasing the expression of RAGE. (C)

Title = {{Bioprocess Control in Microscale: Scalable Fermentations in Disposable
   and User-Friendly Microfluidic Systems}},
Journal = {{MICROBIAL CELL FACTORIES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: The efficiency of biotechnological production processes
   depends on selecting the best performing microbial strain and the
   optimal cultivation conditions. Thus, many experiments have to be
   conducted, which conflicts with the demand to speed up drug development
   processes. Consequently, there is a great need for high-throughput
   devices that allow rapid and reliable bioprocess development. This need
   is addressed, for example, by the fiber-optic online-monitoring system
   BioLector which utilizes the wells of shaken microtiter plates (MTPs) as
   small-scale fermenters. To further improve the application of MTPs as
   microbioreactors, in this paper, the BioLector technology is combined
   with microfluidic bioprocess control in MTPs. To realize a user-friendly
   system for routine laboratory work, disposable microfluidic MTPs are
   utilized which are actuated by a user-friendly pneumatic hardware.
   Results: This novel microfermentation system was tested in pH-controlled
   batch as well as in fed-batch fermentations of Escherichia coli. The
   pH-value in the culture broth could be kept in a narrow dead band of
   0.03 around the pH-setpoint, by pneumatically dosing ammonia solution
   and phosphoric acid to each culture well. Furthermore, fed-batch
   cultivations with linear and exponential feeding of 500 g/L glucose
   solution were conducted. Finally, the scale-up potential of the
   microscale fermentations was evaluated by comparing the obtained results
   to that of fully controlled fermentations in a 2 L laboratory-scale
   fermenter (working volume of 1 L). The scale-up was realized by keeping
   the volumetric mass transfer coefficient k(L)a constant at a value of
   460 1/h. The same growth behavior of the E. coli cultures could be
   observed on both scales.
   Conclusion: In microfluidic MTPs, pH-controlled batch as well as
   fed-batch fermentations were successfully performed. The liquid dosing
   as well as the biomass growth kinetics of the process-controlled
   fermentations agreed well both in the microscale and laboratory scale.
   In conclusion, a user-friendly and disposable microfluidic system could
   be established which allows scaleable, fully controlled and fully
   monitored fermentations in working volumes below 1 milliliter.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic diseases especially cardiovascular diseases, diabetes cancer and
   chronic obstructive respiratory diseases, are neglected globally despite
   growing awareness of the serious burden that they cause Global and
   national policies have failed to stop, and in many cases have
   contributed to, the chronic disease pandemic Low cost and highly
   effective solutions for the prevention of chronic diseases are readily
   available the failure to respond is now a political rather than a
   technical issue We seek to understand this failure and to position
   chronic disease centrally on the global health and development agendas
   To identify strategies for generation of increased political priority
   for chronic diseases and to further the involvement of development
   agencies we use an adapted political process model This model has
   previously been used to assess the success and failure of social
   movements On the basis of this analysis we recommend three strategies
   reframe the debate to emphasise the societal determinants of disease and
   the inter relation between chronic disease, poverty, and development,
   mobilise resources through a cooperative and inclusive approach to
   development and by equitably distributing resources on the basis of
   avoidable mortality and build on emerging strategic and political
   opportunities such as the World Health Assembly 2008-13 Action Plan and
   the high level meeting of the UN General Assembly in 2011 on chronic
   disease Until the full set of threats which-include chronic disease-that
   trap poor households in cycles of debt and illness are addressed,
   progress towards equitable human development will remain inadequate}},

Abstract = {{B cell maturation and B cell-mediated antibody response require
   programmed DNA modifications such as the V(D)J recombination, the
   immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination, and the somatic
   hypermutation to generate functional Igs. Many protein factors involved
   in DNA damage repair have been shown to be critical for the maturation
   and activation of B cells. Rad9 plays an important role in both DNA
   repair and cell cycle checkpoint control. However, its role in Ig
   generation has not been reported. In this study, we generated a
   conditional knock-out mouse line in which Rad9 is deleted specifically
   in B cells and investigated the function of Rad9 in B cells. The
   Rad9(-/-) B cells isolated from the conditional knock-out mice displayed
   impaired growth response and enhanced DNA lesions. Impaired Ig
   production in response to immunization in Rad9(-/-) mice was also
   detected. In addition, the Ig class switch recombination is deficient in
   Rad9(-/-) B cells. Taken together, Rad9 plays dual roles in generating
   functional antibodies and in maintaining the integrity of the whole
   genome in B cells.}},

Abstract = {{The Arctic Ocean has experienced an unprecedented reduction in sea ice
   over the last 3 decades, increasing the potential for greater exchange
   of gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) between the atmosphere and the
   upper ocean. The present study utilizes remotely sensed data on
   distributions of both sea ice and chlorophyll a, together with modeled
   temperature and salinity fields, to obtain high-resolution basin-scale
   estimates of the air-sea flux of CO2 (FCO2) in the Arctic Ocean for the
   years 1998-2003. Concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were
   derived from multiple linear regression relationships with sea surface
   temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll a. The partial pressure of carbon
   dioxide (pCO(2)) in surface waters was computed from DIC and alkalinity,
   the latter of which varied with salinity. FCO2 was calculated from the
   air-sea difference in pCO(2) and wind speed. Annual FCO2 was highest in
   the Atlantic-dominated Greenland and Barents sectors due to their lower
   sea ice cover, although area-normalized FCO2 in these sectors was low.
   Only the Siberian sector exhibited a significant increase in annual FCO2
   during the time of our study, due to a corresponding increase in
   ice-free water. Overall, the Arctic Ocean was a net atmospheric sink for
   CO2, with annual FCO2 averaging 118 +/- 7 Tg C yr(-1) during 1998-2003.}},

   hexadecane contact angles both exceed 150 degrees. The morphology of a
   web is modulated by changing the polymer solution concentration from 24
   to 30 wt.-\% with other fixed processing conditions. The fiber diameter
   length depends mainly on the polymer concentration. A web formed from a
   26 wt.-\% solution has the smallest and most uniform fiber diameter; it
   also has the highest robustness parameter on wetting, thus the highest
   water and hexadecane contact angles. This result offers the possibility
   of simple industrial production of an amphiphobic surface.}},

Abstract = {{Protein profiling of cerebrospinal fluid in Guillain-Barre syndrome
   (GBS), an acute and immune-mediated disease affecting the peripheral
   nervous system, was performed by two-dimensional electrophoresis.
   Significant modulated spots in GBS patients vs. control groups (a group
   of multiple sclerosis patients and one of healthy donors) underwent
   MALDI-TOF/TOF investigation. Inflammation-related proteins, such as
   vitamin D-binding protein, beta-2 glycoprotein I (ApoH), and a
   complement component C3 isoform were up-regulated in GBS, whereas
   transthyretin (the monomer and the dimer forms), apolipoprotein E,
   albumin and five of its fragments were down-regulated. Then, we used an
   isoelectric-focusing-dinitrophenylhydrazine-based technique to analyse
   the extent of carbonylation and, as a result, of oxidative damage of GBS
   CSF proteome. We observed a major sensitivity to carbonylation for
   albumin and alpha-glycoprotein in inflammation and a selective increase
   of reactivity for a glycosylated Fab from an IgM globulin in GBS CSF.
   Our results add new proteins to candidate CSF features of GBS, and
   suggest that oxidative stress could contribute to the immunopathological
   mechanisms in this syndrome. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Non-proteolytic activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have
   recently been shown to impact cell migration, but the precise mechanism
   remains to be understood. We previously demonstrated that the hemopexin
   (PEX) domain of MMP-9 is a prerequisite for enhanced cell migration.
   Using a biochemical approach, we now report that dimerization of MMP-9
   through the PEX domain appears necessary for MMP-9-enhanced cell
   migration. Following a series of substitution mutations within the MMP-9
   PEX domain, blade IV was shown to be critical for homodimerization,
   whereas blade I was required for heterodimerization with CD44. Blade I
   and IV mutants showed diminished enhancement of cell migration compared
   with wild type MMP-9-transfected cells. Peptides mimicking motifs in the
   outermost strands of the first and fourth blades of the MMP-9 PEX domain
   were designed. These peptides efficiently blockedMMP-9 dimer formation
   and inhibited motility of COS-1 cells overexpressing MMP-9, HT-1080, and
   MDA-MB-435 cells. Using a shRNA approach, CD44 was found to be a
   critical molecule in MMP-9-mediated cell migration. Furthermore, an axis
   involving a MMP-9-CD44-EGFR signaling pathway in cell migration was
   identified using antibody array and specific receptor tyrosine kinase
   inhibitors. In conclusion, we dissected the mechanism of
   pro-MMP-9-enhanced cell migration and developed structure-based
   inhibitory peptides targeting MMP-9-mediated cell migration.}},

Abstract = {{Contractile dysfunction and diminished response to p-adrenergic agonists
   are characteristics for failing hearts. Chemically donated nitroxyl
   (HNO) improves contractility in failing hearts and thus may have
   therapeutic potential. Yet, there is a need for pharmacologically
   suitable donors. In this study we tested whether the pure and long
   acting HNO donor, 1-nitrosocyclohexyl acetate (NCA), affects contractile
   force in normal and pathological ventricular myocytes (VMs) as well as
   in isolated hearts. VMs were isolated from mice either subjected to
   isoprenaline-infusion (ISO; 30 mu g/g per day) or to vehicle (0.9\%
   NaCl) for 5 days. Sarcomere shortening and Ca(2+) transients were
   simultaneously measured using the IonOptix system. Force of contraction
   of isolated hearts was measured by a Langendorff-perfusion system. NCA
   increased peak sarcomere shortening by + 40-200\% in a
   concentration-dependent manner (EC(50) similar to 55 mu M). Efficacy and
   potency did not differ between normal and chronic ISO VMs, despite the
   fact that the latter displayed a markedly diminished inotropic response
   to acute p-adrenergic stimulation with ISO (1 mu M). NCA (60 mu M)
   increased peak sarcomere shortening and Ca(2+) transient amplitude by
   similar to 200\% and similar to 120\%, respectively, suggesting effects
   on both myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)
   Ca(2+) cycling. Importantly, NCA did not affect diastolic Ca(2+) or SR
   Ca(2+) content, as assessed by rapid caffeine application. NCA (45 mu M)
   increased force of contraction by 30\% in isolated hearts. In
   conclusion, NCA increased contractile force in normal and
   beta-adrenergically desensitized VMs as well as in isolated mouse
   hearts. This profile warrants further investigations of this HNO donor
   in the context of heart failure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Genomic amplification of 19q12 occurs in several cancer types including
   ovarian cancer where it is associated with primary treatment failure. We
   systematically attenuated expression of genes within the minimally
   defined 19q12 region in ovarian cell lines using short-interfering RNAs
   (siRNA) to identify driver oncogene(s) within the amplicon. Knockdown of
   CCNE1 resulted in G1/S phase arrest, reduced cell viability and
   apoptosis only in amplification-carrying cells. Although CCNE1 knockdown
   increased cisplatin resistance in short-term assays, clonogenic survival
   was inhibited after treatment. Gain of 20q11 was highly correlated with
   19q12 amplification and spanned a 2.5 Mb region including TPX2, a
   centromeric protein required for mitotic spindle function. Expression of
   TPX2 was highly correlated with gene amplification and with CCNE1
   expression in primary tumors. siRNA inhibition of TPX2 reduced cell
   viability but this effect was not amplicon-dependent. These findings
   demonstrate that CCNE1 is a key driver in the 19q12 amplicon required
   for survival and clonogenicity in cells with locus amplification.
   Co-amplification at 19q12 and 20q11 implies the presence of a
   cooperative mutational network. These observations have implications for
   the application of targeted therapies in CCNE1 dependent ovarian
   cancers.}},

   propagation is investigated based on the solitonic solution, which has
   the following three aspects: (i) the coefficient of the nonlinear term
   affects the solitonic amplitude; (ii) the coefficient of the dispersive
   term controls the solitonic velocity and propagation trace; (iii) the
   coefficient of the dissipative term acts on both the solitonic amplitude
   and the velocity. We also analyze the variations of velocity and
   pressure of blood flow along the scaled axial coordinate after the
   static deformation in the vicinity of stenosis.}},

Abstract = {{C-reactive protein (CRP) is a phylogenetically conserved protein; in
   humans, it is present in the plasma and at sites of inflammation. At
   physiological pH, native pentameric CRP exhibits calcium-dependent
   binding specificity for phosphocholine. In this study, we determined the
   binding specificities of CRP at acidic pH, a characteristic of
   inflammatory sites. We investigated the binding of fluid-phase CRP to
   six immobilized proteins: complement factor H, oxidized low-density
   lipoprotein, complement C3b, IgG, amyloid beta, and BSA immobilized on
   microtiter plates. At pH 7.0, CRP did not bind to any of these proteins,
   but, at pH ranging from 5.2 to 4.6, CRP bound to all six proteins.
   Acidic pH did not monomerize CRP but modified the pentameric structure,
   as determined by gel filtration, 1-anili-nonaphthalene-8-sulfonic
   acid-binding fluorescence, and phosphocholine-binding assays. Some
   modifications in CRP were reversible at pH 7.0, for example, the
   phosphocholine-binding activity of CRP, which was reduced at acidic pH,
   was restored after pH neutralization. For efficient binding of acidic
   pH-treated CRP to immobilized proteins, it was necessary that the
   immobilized proteins, except factor H, were also exposed to acidic pH.
   Because immobilization of proteins on microtiter plates and exposure of
   immobilized proteins to acidic pH alter the conformation of immobilized
   proteins, our findings suggest that conformationally altered proteins
   form a CRP-ligand in acidic environment, regardless of the identity of
   the protein. This ligand binding specificity of CRP in its acidic
   pH-induced pentameric state has implications for toxic conditions
   involving protein misfolding in acidic environments and favors the
   conservation of CRP throughout evolution.}},

Abstract = {{During sexual reproduction in flowering plants such as Arabidopsis, a
   tip-growing pollen tube (PT) is guided to the synergid cells of the
   female gametophyte, where it bursts and releases the two sperm. Here we
   show that PT reception and powdery mildew (PM) infection, which involves
   communication between a tip-growing hypha and a plant epidermal cell,
   share molecular components. NORTIA (NTA), a member of the MLO family
   originally discovered in the context of PM resistance, and FERONIA
   (FER), a receptor-like kinase, both control PT reception in synergids.
   Homozygous fer mutants also display PM resistance, revealing a new
   function for FER and suggesting that conserved components, such as FER
   and distinct MLO proteins, are involved in both PT reception and PM
   infection.}},

Abstract = {{Major depression (MD) has been projected to be the first leading cause
   of disability worldwide. Still, the pathophysiological processes and
   factors leading to depression remain largely unknown. The present study
   investigated the differential effects of selective medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) lesions on depression-like
   and depression-associated behavior in rats, using the following
   behavioral paradigms: (i) learned helplessness model testing depressive
   behavior, (ii) elevated plus-maze testing anxious behavior, (iii) 8-arm
   radial maze testing cognitive performance and (iv) the open-field
   testing locomotion. Lesion of both, the mPFC or the STN selectively
   increased depression-like behavior in rats. These effects were not
   biased by any effects on depression-associated behavior, such as
   increased anxiety, cognitive impairment or deficits in locomotion. The
   behavioral data presented in this study support a specific involvement
   of the mPFC in the pathophysiology of MD and point towards a potent
   regulatory function of the STN in processing limbic information towards
   cortical and subcortical regions in the brain pathophysiologically
   relevant in the manifestation of MD. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{E2-25K/Hip2 is an unusual ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that interacts
   with the frameshift mutant of ubiquitin B(UBB+1) and has been identified
   as a crucial factor regulating amyloid-beta neurotoxicity. To study the
   structural basis of the neurotoxicity mediated by the E2-25K-UBB+1
   interaction, we determined the three-dimensional structures of UBB+1,
   E2-25K and the E2-25K/ubiquitin, and E2-25K/UBB+1 complex. The
   structures revealed that ubiquitin or UBB+1 is bound to E2-25K via the
   enzyme MGF motif and residues in alpha 9 of the enzyme.
   Poly-ubiquitylation assays together with analyses of various E2-25K
   mutants showed that disrupting UBB+1 binding markedly diminishes
   synthesis of neurotoxic UBB+1-anchored polyubiquitin. These results
   suggest that the interaction between E2-25K and UBB+1 is critical for
   the synthesis and accumulation of UBB+1-anchored polyubiquitin, which
   results in proteasomal inhibition and neuronal cell death.}},

Abstract = {{The orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) GPR124/tumor endothelial
   marker 5 is highly expressed in central nervous system (CNS)
   endothelium. Here, we show that complete null or endothelial-specific
   GPR124 deletion resulted in embryonic lethality from CNS-specific
   angiogenesis arrest in forebrain and neural tube. Conversely, GPR124
   overexpression throughout all adult vascular beds produced CNS-specific
   hyperproliferative vascular malformations. In vivo, GPR124 functioned
   cell-autonomously in endothelium to regulate sprouting, migration, and
   developmental expression of the blood-brain barrier marker Glut1,
   whereas in vitro, GPR124 mediated Cdc42-dependent directional migration
   to forebrain-derived, vascular endothelial growth factor-independent
   cues. Our results demonstrate CNS-specific angiogenesis regulation by an
   endothelial receptor and illuminate functions of the poorly understood
   adhesion GPCR subfamily. Further, the functional tropism of GPR124 marks
   this receptor as a therapeutic target for CNS-related vascular
   pathologies.}},

   display divergences in their expression profile across different
   tissues. Using the bioinformatics-approach of guilt by association (GBA)
   we exploited these variations to predict the function of two so far
   poorly annotated genes: Coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain
   containing 10 (CHCHD10) and glioblastoma amplified sequence (GBAS). We
   predicted both genes to be involved in oxidative phosphorylation.
   Through in vitro experiments using gene-knockdown we could indeed
   confirm this and furthermore we asserted CHCHD 10 to play a role in

Title = {{The evaluation of a health education campaign on the use of leave from
   work during pregnancy}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Italian Protective Maternity Legislation allows a woman
   to apply for early maternity leave from work during pregnancy if she is
   affected by health problems (option A) or if her working conditions are
   incompatible with pregnancy (option B). A community based health
   education program, implemented between 1995 to 1998 in North Eastern
   Italy, provided counseling (by a team of gynecologists, pediatricians,
   geneticists, psychologists and occupational physicians), and an
   information leaflet detailing the risks during pregnancy and the
   governmental benefits available to expectant mothers. This leaflet was
   distributed to women who were under occupational medical surveillance
   and to women attending any healthcare office and outpatient department
   and was also mailed to women working at home as shoemakers.
   The effectiveness of this intervention has been evaluated in this
   investigation using an evidence based approach.
   Methods: A quasi-experimental design was adopted, applying several
   outcome measurements before (1989 to 1994) and after (1999 to 2005) the
   intervention. The outcome (ratio B/A) is the number of women receiving
   approval for B (circumstance where the pregnant woman is employed to
   undertake activities forbidden under the Article 7 of Law 151/2001, and
   it is impossible to change her duties) to those receiving approval for A
   (risky pregnancy due to personal medical conditions, Article 17 of the
   same Law). A linear regression coefficient (for B/A against years) was
   obtained separately for time periods ``before{''} (1989-94) and
   ``after{''} (1999-2005) the intervention program. The two regression
   coefficients were compared using a t-test.
   Results: The trend over-time for the ratio B/A was steady before the
   initial intervention (y = 0.008x - 16.087; t = 2.09; p > 0.05) then
   increased considerably (y = 0.0426x - 84.89; t = 19.55; p < 0.001) in
   coincidence with the start of the education campaign. There was a
   significant difference between the two regression coefficients (t =
   7.58; p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: From a bureaucratic perspective Option B is far more
   complicated than A. In fact it implies an active approach involving an
   arrangement between the claimant and the employer, who has to certify to
   the relevant Authority that the woman's working conditions are
   incompatible with pregnancy. The increasing number of women availing of
   option B, as recommended, therefore suggests the suitability of such
   educational campaign(s).}},

Abstract = {{Prostate cancer is a major cause of mortality in men in developed
   countries. It has been reported that the naturally occurring antioxidant
   alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) attenuates prostate cancer cell
   proliferation in cultured cells and mouse models. We hypothesized that
   overexpression of the tocopherol transfer protein (TTP), a vitamin
   E-binding protein that regulates tocopherol status, will sensitize
   prostate cancer cells to the anti-proliferative actions of the vitamin.
   To test this notion, we manipulated the expression levels of TTP in
   cultured prostate cells (LNCaP, PC3, DU145, and RWPE-1) using
   overexpression and knockdown approaches. Treatment of cells with
   tocopherol caused a time-and dose-dependent inhibition of cell
   proliferation. Overexpression of TTP dramatically sensitized the cells
   to the apoptotic effects of alpha-tocopherol, whereas reduction
   ({''}knockdown{''}) of TTP expression resulted in resistance to the
   vitamin. TTP levels also augmented the inhibitory effects of vitamin E
   on proliferation in semi-solid medium. The sensitizing effects of TTP
   were paralleled by changes in the intracellular accumulation of a
   fluorescent analog of vitamin E and by a reduction in intracellular
   levels of reactive oxygen species and were not observed when a naturally
   occurring, ligand binding-defective mutant of TTP was used. We conclude
   that TTP sensitizes prostate cancer cells to the anti-proliferative
   effects of vitamin E and that this activity stems from the ability of
   protein to increase the intracellular accumulation of the antioxidant.
   These observations support the notion that individual changes in the
   expression level or activity of TTP may determine the responsiveness of
   prostate cancer patients to intervention strategies that utilize vitamin
   E.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) are chemically reactive greenhouse
   gases with well-documented atmospheric concentration increases that are
   attributable to anthropogenic activities. We quantified the link between
   N2O and CH4 emissions through the coupled chemistries of the
   stratosphere and troposphere. Specifically, we simulated the coupled
   perturbations of increased N2O abundance, leading to stratospheric ozone
   (O-3) depletion, altered solar ultraviolet radiation, altered
   stratosphere-to-troposphere O-3 flux, increased tropospheric hydroxyl
   radical concentration, and finally lower concentrations of CH4. The
   ratio of CH4 per N2O change, -36\% by mole fraction, offsets a fraction
   of the greenhouse effect attributable to N2O emissions. These CH4
   decreases are tied to the 108-year chemical mode of N2O, which is nine
   times longer than the residence time of direct CH4 emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Movement observation and imagery are increasingly propagandized for
   motor rehabilitation. Both observation and imagery are thought to
   improve motor function through repeated activation of mental motor
   representations. However, it is unknown what stimulation parameters or
   imagery conditions are optimal for rehabilitation purposes. A better
   understanding of the mechanisms underlying movement observation and
   imagery is essential for the optimization of functional outcome using
   these training conditions. This study systematically assessed the
   corticospinal excitability during rest, observation, imagery and
   execution of a simple and a complex finger-tapping sequence in healthy
   controls using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Observation was
   conducted passively (without prior instructions) as well as actively (in
   order to imitate). Imagery was performed visually and kinesthetically. A
   larger increase in corticospinal excitability was found during active
   observation in comparison with passive observation and visual or
   kinesthetic imagery. No significant difference between kinesthetic and
   visual imagery was found. Overall, the complex task led to a higher
   corticospinal excitability in comparison with the simple task. In
   conclusion, the corticospinal excitability was modulated during both
   movement observation and imagery. Specifically, active observation of a
   complex motor task resulted in increased corticospinal excitability.
   Active observation may be more effective than imagery for motor
   rehabilitation purposes. In addition, the activation of mental motor
   representations may be optimized by varying task-complexity. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The evolutionarily conserved lethal giant larvae (Lgl) tumor suppressor
   gene has an essential role in establishing apical-basal cell polarity,
   cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue organization. However,
   the precise molecular mechanism by which the Lgl carries out its
   function remains obscure. In the current study, we have identified
   Ran-binding protein M (RanBPM) as a novel binding partner of Mgl-1, a
   mammalian homolog of Drosophila tumor suppressor protein lethal (2)
   giant larvae (L(2)gl) by yeast two-hybrid screening. RanBPM seems to act
   as a scaffolding protein with a modulatory function with respect to
   Mgl-1. The Mgl-1 and RanBPM association was confirmed by
   co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments. Additionally,
   expression of RanBPM resulted in inhibition of Mgl-1 degradation, and
   thereby extended the half-life of Mgl-1. Furthermore, the ability of
   Mgl-1 activity in cell migration and colony formation assay was enhanced
   by RanBPM. Taken together, our findings reveal that RanBPM plays a novel
   role in regulating Mgl-1 stability and contributes to its biological
   function as a tumor suppressor.}},

Title = {{Evaluating housing quality, health and safety using an Internet-based
   data collection and response system: a cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Typically housing and health surveys are not integrated
   together and therefore are not representative of population health or
   national housing stocks. In addition, the existing channels for
   distributing information about housing and health issues to the general
   public are limited. The aim of this study was to develop a data
   collection and response system that would allow us to assess the Finnish
   housing stock from the points of view of quality, health and safety, and
   also to provide a tool to distribute information about important housing
   health and safety issues.
   Methods: The data collection and response system was tested with a
   sample of 3000 adults (one per household), who were randomly selected
   from the Finnish Population Register Centre. Spatial information about
   the exact location of the residences (i.e. coordinates) was included in
   the database inquiry. People could participate either by completing and
   returning a paper questionnaire or by completing the same questionnaire
   via the Internet. The respondents did not receive any compensation for
   their time in completing the questionnaire.
   Results: This article describes the data collection and response system
   and presents the main results of the population-based testing of the
   system. A total of 1312 people (response rate 44\%) answered the
   questionnaire, though only 80 answered via the Internet. A third of the
   respondents had indicated they wanted feedback. Albeit a majority (>
   90\%) of the respondents reported being satisfied or quite satisfied
   with their residence, there were a number of prevalent housing issues
   identified that can be related to health and safety.
   Conclusions: The collected database can be used to evaluate the quality
   of the housing stock in terms of occupant health and safety, and to
   model its association with occupant health and well-being. However, it
   must be noted that all the health outcomes gathered in this study are
   self-reported. A follow-up study is needed to evaluate whether the
   occupants acted on the feedback they received. Relying solely on an
   Internet-based questionnaire for collecting data would not appear to
   provide an adequate response rate for random population-based surveys at
   this point in time.}},

Volume = {{82}},

Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by recent experimental progress to readout quantum bits
   implemented in superconducting circuits via the phenomenon of dynamical
   bifurcation, transitions between steady orbits in a driven anharmonic
   oscillator, the Duffing oscillator, are analyzed. In the regime of weak
   dissipation a consistent diffusion equation in the semiclassical limit
   is derived to capture the intimate relation between finite tunneling and
   reflection and bath induced quantum fluctuations. From the corresponding
   steady-state distribution an analytical expression for the switching
   probability is obtained. It is shown that a reduction of the transition
   rate due to finite reflection at the phase-space barrier is
   overcompensated by an increase due to environmental quantum fluctuations
   that are specific for diffusion processes over dynamical barriers. The
   scaling behavior of the rate is discussed and it is revealed that close
   to the bifurcation threshold the escape dynamics enters an overdamped
   domain such that the quantum-mechanical energy scale associated with
   friction even exceeds the thermal energy scale.}},

Title = {{The FGF-BMP Signaling Axis Regulates Outflow Tract Valve Primordium

Abstract = {{Rationale: Heart valves develop from precursor structures called cardiac
   cushions, an endothelial-lined cardiac jelly that resides in the inner
   side of the heart tube. The cushions are then invaded by cells from
   different sources, undergo a series of complicated and poorly understood
   remodeling processes, and give rise to valves. Disruption of the
   fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling axis impairs morphogenesis of
   the outflow tract (OFT). Yet, whether FGF signaling regulates OFT valve
   formation is unknown.
   Objective: To study how OFT valve formation is regulated and how
   aberrant cell signaling causes valve defects.
   Methods and Results: By using mouse genetic manipulation, cell lineage
   tracing, ex vivo heart culture, and molecular biology approaches, we
   demonstrated that FGF signaling in the OFT myocardium upregulated Bmp4
   expression, which then enhanced smooth muscle differentiation of neural
   crest cells (NCCs) in the cushion. FGF signaling also promoted OFT
   myocardial cell invasion to the cushion. Disrupting FGF signaling
   interrupted cushion remodeling with reduced NCCs differentiation into
   smooth muscle and less cardiomyocyte invasion and resulted in malformed
   OFT valves.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which the
   FGF-BMP signaling axis regulates formation of OFT valve primordia by
   controlling smooth muscle differentiation of cushion NCCs. (Circ Res.

Abstract = {{Previous research on neuronal spacing and columnar organization
   indicates the presence of cell patterning alterations within the
   cerebral cortex of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
   These patterning abnormalities include irregularities at the gray-white
   matter boundary and may implicate early neurodevelopmental events such
   as migration in altering cortical organization in ASD. The present study
   utilized a novel method to quantify the gray-white matter boundary in
   eight ASD and eight typically developing control subjects. Digital
   photomicrographs of the gray-white matter boundary were acquired from
   multiple positions within the superior temporal gyms (BA21),
   dorsolateral frontal lobe (BA9), and dorsal parietal lobe (BA7) of each
   case. A sigmoid curve was fitted to the transition zone between layer VI
   and underlying white matter (subplate), and the slope of the resulting
   curve was used as a measure of the spatial extent of the transition
   zone. For all three cortical regions examined, ASD subjects showed
   ``shallower{''} sigmoid curves compared to neurotypicals, indicating the
   presence of an indistinct boundary between cortical layer VI and the
   underlying white matter. These results may reflect the presence of
   supernumerary neurons beneath the cortical plate that could be the
   result of migration deficits or failed apoptosis in the subplate region.
   Furthermore, these findings raise questions regarding the validity of
   cortical measures that rely on gray-white matter parcellation, since an
   indistinct transition zone could lead to a misplaced cortical boundary
   and errors in both thickness and volume measures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

   reactions of substituted benzoyl chlorides have been analyzed in the

   depending on the reaction mechanism, dissociative or associative,
   respectively. The micellar effects observed can be related to the low
   water content and low polarity of the interface as well as an increase
   of the nucleophilic character of the interfacial water. Moreover, the
   effect of the micellar surface charge on the solvolysis mechanism with
   high associative character was systematically studied. Mixed micelles of
   nonionic-ionic surfactants with a variable ionic content were prepared
   and characterized regarding charge and polarity. A correlation between
   the net charge of the micelles and the rate constants at the micellar
   interface was observed. The results suggest that the transient state for
   this mechanism is highly stabilized in a positively charged environment
   while the negative surface given by anionic micelles strongly inhibit
   the solvolysis reaction.}},

Abstract = {{Background The false positive rate for the newborn screening of
   disorders of amino acid metabolism for premature infants is higher than
   full term infants This may be due to very low birth weight infants
   receiving high concentrations of amino acids from total parenteral
   nutrition (TPN) administration and/or immature metabolism An
   investigation of the possible influence of TPN on screening of premature
   infants resulted in the detection of three unusual peaks in the tandem
   mass spectrometry (MS/MS) acylcarnitine profile. These markers were
   closely correlated with the detection of very high multiple amino acid
   increases in the profiles of newborns administered with TPN and who were
   ultimately found to be normal and free of inherited metabolic disorders
   Methods: TPN solutions contain a concentrated mixture (gamin acids and
   dextrose and other nutrients in saline Due to its high concentration and
   suggestion of a carbohydrate, it was hypothesized that dextrose
   (D-glucose) was the contaminant and source of the markers detected
   Dextrose, stable isotope-labeled (13)C(6)-dextrose and various TPN
   solutions were analyzed directly or after enrichment in whole blood by
   multiple MS/MS acquisition modes including MS-only, product and
   precursor ion and neutral loss scans
   Results. Analysis of dried-blood spots (DBS) prepared from whole blood
   spiked with TPN solutions containing 12.5\% dextrose and amino acid
   formulations designed to deliver 2.5 gm/kg/day of an amino acid mixture
   had moderate increases of all 3 dextrose markers detected at m/z 325.
   399 and 473 as compared to controls MS-only scans, product and precursor
   ion scans of dextrose and (13)C(6)-dextrose in positive ion mode
   confirmed that these 3 peaks are derived from dextrose Mass spectral
   analysis of labeled and unlabeled dextrose suggested that these peaks
   were dimers derived from dextrose
   Conclusion: The identification of dextrose markers in DBS indicates that
   high concentrations of dextrose were present in blood and the likely
   source was contamination by TPN solutions most likely occurring during a
   sample collection process (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Background Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is caused by inherited
   defects in steroid biosynthesis. The Newborn Screening Quality Assurance
   Program (NSQAP) initiated a pilot, dried-blood spot (DBS)-based
   proficiency testing program designed to investigate materials and
   laboratory performance for second tier CAH screening by tandem mass
   spectrometry (MS/MS)
   Methods The ratio of 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP).
   androstenedione (4-AD) and cortisol is used as an indicator of CAH in
   laboratory protocols for second tier analysis of DBS specimens DBS
   prepared by NSQAP contained a range of steroid concentrations resulting
   in different clinical ratios Laboratories received blind-coded DBS
   specimens and reported results to NSQAP for evaluation
   Results Quantitative values reported by participants for 17-OHP, 4-AD,
   and cortisol, reflected small differences in their analytical methods.
   Average quantitative values for 17-OHP increased from 81\% to 107\%
   recovery over the 3 5-year period; cortisol recoveries increased from 61
   9\% to 89 5\%, and 4-AD recoveries decreased from 184\% to 68\%
   Conclusions Laboratory participation in the CAH second tier proficiency
   testing program has resulted in improved analyte recoveries and enhanced
   sample preparation methodologies. NSQAP services for the second tier CAH
   analysis in DBS demonstrate the need for surveillance to ensure
   harmonization and continuous improvements, and to achieve sustained
   high-performance of newborn screening laboratories worldwide. Published

Abstract = {{Sprouting of developing blood vessels is mediated by specialized motile
   endothelial cells localized at the tips of growing capillaries.
   Following behind the tip cells, endothelial stalk cells form the
   capillary lumen and proliferate. Expression of the Notch ligand
   Delta-like-4 (Dll4) in tip cells suppresses tip cell fate in neighboring
   stalk cells via Notch signaling. In DLL4(+/-) mouse mutants, most
   retinal endothelial cells display morphologic features of tip cells. We
   hypothesized that these mouse mutants could be used to isolate tip cells
   and so to determine their genetic repertoire. Using transcriptome
   analysis of retinal endothelial cells isolated from DLL4(+/-) and
   wild-type mice, we identified 3 clusters of tip cell-enriched genes,
   encoding extracellular matrix degrading enzymes, basement membrane
   components, and secreted molecules. Secreted molecules
   endothelial-specific molecule 1, angiopoietin 2, and apelin bind to
   cognate receptors on endothelial stalk cells. Knockout mice and
   zebrafish morpholino knockdown of apelin showed delayed angiogenesis and
   reduced proliferation of stalk cells expressing the apelin receptor APJ.
   Thus, tip cells may regulate angiogenesis via matrix remodeling,
   production of basement membrane, and release of secreted molecules, some
   of which regulate stalk cell behavior. (Blood. 2010;116(19):4025-4033)}},

Title = {{Therapeutic Immunization with HIV-1 Tat Reduces Immune Activation and
   Loss of Regulatory T-Cells and Improves Immune Function in Subjects on
   HAART}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Although HAART suppresses HIV replication, it is often unable to restore
   immune homeostasis. Consequently, non-AIDS-defining diseases are
   increasingly seen in treated individuals. This is attributed to
   persistent virus expression in reservoirs and to cell activation. Of
   note, in CD4(+) T cells and monocyte-macrophages of
   virologically-suppressed individuals, there is continued expression of
   multi-spliced transcripts encoding HIV regulatory proteins. Among them,
   Tat is essential for virus gene expression and replication, either in
   primary infection or for virus reactivation during HAART, when Tat is
   expressed, released extracellularly and exerts, on both the virus and
   the immune system, effects that contribute to disease maintenance. Here
   we report results of an ad hoc exploratory interim analysis (up to 48
   weeks) on 87 virologically-suppressed HAART-treated individuals enrolled
   in a phase II randomized open-label multicentric clinical trial of
   therapeutic immunization with Tat (ISS T-002). Eighty-eight
   virologically-suppressed HAART-treated individuals, enrolled in a
   parallel prospective observational study at the same sites (ISS OBS
   T-002), served for intergroup comparison. Immunization with Tat was
   safe, induced durable immune responses, and modified the pattern of
   CD4(+) and CD8(+) cellular activation (CD38 and HLA-DR) together with
   reduction of biochemical activation markers and persistent increases of
   regulatory T cells. This was accompanied by a progressive increment of
   CD4(+) T cells and B cells with reduction of CD8(+) T cells and NK
   cells, which were independent from the type of antiretroviral regimen.
   Increase in central and effector memory and reduction in
   terminally-differentiated effector memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were
   accompanied by increases of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses against
   Env and recall antigens. Of note, more immune-compromised individuals
   experienced greater therapeutic effects. In contrast, these changes were
   opposite, absent or partial in the OBS population. These findings
   support the use of Tat immunization to intensify HAART efficacy and to
   restore immune homeostasis.}},

Abstract = {{In physically inviscid fluid dynamics, `shock-capturing' methods adopt
   either an artificial viscosity contribution or an appropriate
   Riemann-solver algorithm. These techniques are necessary to solve the
   strictly hyperbolic Euler equations if flow discontinuities (the Riemann
   problem) are to be solved. A necessary dissipation is normally used in
   such cases. An explicit artificial viscosity contribution is normally
   adopted to smooth out spurious heating and to treat transport phenomena.
   Such a treatment of inviscid flows is also widely adopted in the smooth
   particle hydrodynamics (SPH) finite-volume free Lagrangian scheme. In
   other cases, the intrinsic dissipation of Godunov-type methods is
   implicitly useful. Instead, `shock-tracking' methods normally use the
   Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions to solve such problems. A simple,
   effective solution of the Riemann problem in inviscid ideal gases is
   proposed here, based on a reformulation of the equation of state (EoS)
   in the Euler equations in fluid dynamics, the limit of which for a
   motionless gas coincides with the classical EoS of ideal gases. The
   application of such an effective solution to the Riemann problem
   excludes any dependence, in the transport phenomena, on
   particle-smoothing resolution length h in non-viscous SPH flows. Results
   for one-dimensional shock-tube tests, as well as examples of application
   for two-dimensional shear flows, are shown here. As an astrophysical
   application, a much better identification of spiral structures in
   accretion discs in a close binary (CB) as a result of this reformulation
   is also shown here.}},

   approaches on the High Plains Aquifer, USA}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites provide
   observations of water storage variation at regional scales. However,
   when focusing on a region of interest, limited spatial resolution and
   noise contamination can cause estimation bias and spatial leakage,
   problems that are exacerbated as the region of interest approaches the
   GRACE resolution limit of a few hundred km. Reliable estimates of water
   storage variations in small basins require compromises between competing
   needs for noise suppression and spatial resolution. The objective of
   this study was to quantitatively investigate processing methods and
   their impacts on bias, leakage, GRACE noise reduction, and estimated
   total error, allowing solution of the trade-offs. Among the methods
   tested is a recently developed concentration algorithm called
   spatiospectral localization, which optimizes the basin shape
   description, taking into account limited spatial resolution. This method
   is particularly suited to retrieval of basin-scale water storage
   variations and is effective for small basins. To increase confidence in
   derived methods, water storage variations were calculated for both CSR
   (Center for Space Research) and GRGS (Groupe de Recherche de Geodesie
   Spatiale) GRACE products, which employ different processing strategies.
   The processing techniques were tested on the intensively monitored High
   Plains Aquifer (450,000 km(2) area), where application of the
   appropriate optimal processing method allowed retrieval of water storage
   variations over a portion of the aquifer as small as similar to 200,000
   km(2).}},

Abstract = {{Density functional theory calculations predict the surface segregation
   of Cu in the second atomic layer of Pd which has not been unambiguously
   confirmed by experiment so far. We report measurements on Pd surfaces
   covered with three and six monolayers of Cu using element selective
   positron-annihilation-induced Auger electron spectroscopy (PAES) which
   is sensitive to the topmost atomic layer. Moreover, time-resolved PAES,
   which was applied for the first time, enables the investigation of the
   dynamics of surface atoms and hence the observation of the segregation
   process. The time constant for segregation was experimentally determined
   to tau = 1.38(0.21) h, and the final segregated configuration was found
   to be consistent with calculations. Time-dependent PAES is demonstrated
   to be a novel element selective technique applicable for the
   investigation of, e.g., heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion, or surface
   alloying.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of long chain hydrophobic beta-hydroxyalkyl ethers of
   inulin in aqueous surfactant media is described. beta-hydroxyalkyl
   ethers of inulin were obtained in reaction media containing 40\% inulin
   and 1 M KOH at 80 degrees C. Several parameters such as the amount and
   structure of two cationic surfactants (dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide
   (DTAB) and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)) and a non-ionic
   surfactant (beta-hydroxydodecyl ether of inulin (EC12)) as well as the
   amount and epoxide chain length (C6-C18/26) on the reaction efficiency
   (RE) were examined through NMR analysis.
   We can state that the etherification of inulin in aqueous media with
   1,2-dodecylepoxide was dependent on the surfactant used. The non-ionic
   surfactant, EC12, did not have any effect on the etherification
   reaction. On the contrary, adding a cationic surfactant such as CTAB or
   DTAB increased the RE significantly. The effect of DTAB micelles on this
   reaction could be attributed to both electrostatic (inulin/DTAB) and
   hydrophobic (epoxide/DTAB) interactions. A micellar catalysis mechanism
   is proposed to explain these interactions. Efficiencies did not increase
   more than 50\% and were not related to variations in the epoxide alkyl
   chain. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present research deals with the use of pretreatment solutions of
   chitosan (CH), N-{[}(4-dimethyl aminobenzyl)imino] chitosan (DBIC),
   N-{[}(2-hydroxy-3-trimethylammonium)propyl] chitosan chloride (HTACC),
   glycine (Gly), and a mixture of CH and Gly, for padding polyester
   fabrics prior to printing with a set of seven-color pigmented
   water-based ink jet inks. After padding the fabrics with the above
   cationic pretreatments, they were printed with a piezo-electric
   drop-on-demand jet printer. CH, DBIC and HTACC were characterized by IR
   and NMR spectroscopy. The zeta potentials of the pretreatment solutions,
   the inks and the fabrics were measured. The K/S values, color gamut,
   tone reproduction, outline sharpness, and the surface appearance of the
   fabrics were characterized. Statistical evaluation of the significance
   of the results was performed. Among the pretreatments, the HTACC at
   0.1\% (w/v) yielded fabrics with the highest K/S values, widest color
   gamut and gamut volume, more color saturation with good tonal
   reproduction, and the sharpest and smoothest outline of printed
   character, and a smooth fabric surface with less stiffness. The proposed
   ionic interactions between the protonated amino groups of CH and the
   anionic portion of the encapsulated ink pigments, and van der Waals and
   hydrophobic interactions between the polyester and the pigments are
   likely reasons for these enhanced properties of the printed fabrics. (C)

Abstract = {{The ellipsometry is an efficient method to determine the optical
   properties of matter. It has been largely employed with grating
   spectrometers in the visible. UV and near-infrared ranges for the
   characterization of thin films, surfaces and interfaces. In the mid- and
   far-infrared, where most substance-specific absorption lines are
   present, spectroscopic ellipsometry with Fourier-transform spectrometers
   is still not extended as a routine method. In particular, the lack of
   powerful sources in the far-infrared/ terahertz range has prevented
   standoff application of this method. We will show that it is possible to
   measure the complex dielectric constant of a solid in the far-infrared
   and terahertz range by a reflection experiment with polarized light and
   ellipsometric analysis with a suitable calibration procedure. Extraction
   of terahertz synchrotron radiation from storage rings provides a
   suitable source for research-grade experiments. The optical constants
   determined by ellipsometry compare well with those obtained by
   Kramers-Kronig procedures, a method which, however, requires broader
   frequency range and absolute reflectance standard. We will present the
   case of remote spectroscopic identification of explosive materials,
   which is relevant for forthcoming security applications. (C) 2010

Title = {{Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16, 18, 31, 45 DNA loads and HPV-16
   integration in persistent and transient infections in young women}},
Journal = {{BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},

Abstract = {{Background: HPV burden is a predictor for high-grade cervical
   intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer. The natural history of HPV load in
   young women being recently exposed to HPV is described in this paper.
   Methods: A total of 636 female university students were followed for 2
   years. Cervical specimens with HPV-16, -18, -31, or -45 DNA by consensus
   PCR were further evaluated with type-specific and beta-globin real-time
   PCR assays. Proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard
   ratios (HR) of infection clearance. Generalized estimating equations
   assessed whether HPV loads was predictive of HPV infection at the
   subsequent visit.
   Results: HPV loads were consistently higher among women <25 years old,
   and those who had multiple sex partners, multiple HPV type infections
   and smokers. HPV-16 integration was encountered only in one sample.
   Infection clearance was faster among women at lower tertiles of HPV-16
   (HR = 2.8, 95\%CI: 1.0-8.1), HPV-18 (HR = 3.5, 95\%CI: 1.1-11.2) or
   combined (HR = 2.4, 95\%CI: 1.8-6.2) DNA loads. The relationship between
   HPV-16 and HPV-18 DNA loads and infection clearance followed a clear
   dose-response pattern, after adjusting for age and number of sexual
   partners. GEE Odds Ratios for HPV persistence of the middle and upper
   tertiles relative to the lower tertile were 2.7 and 3.0 for HPV-16 and
   3.8 and 39.1 for HPV-18, respectively. There was no association between
   HPV-31 or -45 DNA loads and persistence.
   Conclusions: The association between HPV load and persistence is not
   uniform across high-risk genital genotypes. HPV-16 integration was only
   rarely demonstrated in young women.}},

Abstract = {{Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a progressive disorder
   characterized by corneal endothelial decompensation leading to corneal
   edema, clouding, and vision impairment. Despite improved understanding
   over the last century since its first description, the exact
   mechanism(s) behind the pathogenesis of FECD remain unknown, and
   surgical correction is the only effective treatment available. Previous
   studies have suggested a role for changes in aqueous humor (AH)
   composition in FECD pathogenesis, so to explore this possibility, we
   probed the AH proteome for alterations correlating with end-stage
   corneal disease. Following albumin depletion we performed label-free
   quantitative tandem mass spectrometry on proteins isolated from patients
   with and without FECD who were scheduled to undergo routine cataract
   extraction. We identified 64 proteins, most of which were identified in
   previous AH proteomic studies of patients with cataracts, in the
   albumin-depleted fraction. The levels of five of these were
   significantly lower (afamin, complement C3, histidine-rich glycoprotein,
   immunoglobulin heavy {[}IgH], and protein family with sequence
   similarity 3, member C {[}FAM3C]), while the levels of one (suprabasin)
   was significantly higher in patients with FECD compared to controls (p
   <= 0.01). We also identified 34 proteins in the albumin-bound fraction,
   four of which were significantly elevated in patients with FECD
   including a hemoglobin fragment, immunoglobulin kappa (IgK),
   immunoglobulin lambda (IgL), and uncharacterized protein albumin (ALB),
   (p <= 0.01). Although it has been reported that females have a greater
   extent of disease than males, we were unable to detect any significant
   differences in protein levels due to gender. Because FECD is a
   progressive disorder, regression analyses were performed to determine
   any significant correlations with age, and of interest retinol-binding
   protein 3 was significantly correlated with age in patients with FECD (p
   <= 0.01), whereas no proteins in the control group correlated with age.
   This is the first report indicating alterations in the AH proteome with
   FECD, and taken together this study suggests several novel hypotheses
   regarding AH proteins role in FECD pathogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Background Enzyme immunoassay has been successfully used for the
   diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). but there are
   difficulties in standardising this method because of the difficulty in
   obtaining stable solid phases from a huge variety of heterogeneous
   antigenic sources With this in mind, the aim of this work was to
   demonstrate the usefulness of the standard available
   fluoro-enzyme-immuno-assay (FEIA) to measure specific IgG to uncommon,
   commercially unavailable HP-causing antigens
   Methods. Serum samples from patients suffering from HP caused by canary
   and pigeon protein exposure with positive immunoprecipitation values, as
   well as cystic fibrosis patients, patients with respiratory allergies.
   asymptomatic subjects exposed to canary proteins (canary breeders) and
   healthy unexposed individuals were evaluated by FEIA using biotinylated
   serum proteins coupled to streptavidin-activated solid phases
   Statistical analyses were performed to compare the different groups and
   to evaluate the performance of this technique.
   Results: The group of patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused
   by exposure to canary proteins showed the highest value of specific IgG
   (35 70 mg IgG/mL). ROC analysis demonstrated an optimal cut-off value of
   8.44 mg IgG/mL with a sensitivity of 100\% and a specificity of 91 76\%.
   Comparisons with other groups revealed statistically significant
   differences Comparison between ELISA and FEIA results revealed a strong
   positive relationship between values obtained in both assays
   Conclusion. The results demonstrate that Streptavidin ImmunoCAP (R) is a
   sensitive, specific and efficient laboratory method for routine
   diagnostic testing of HP caused by protein antigens that are not
   commercially available (C) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.}},

   melt inclusions}},

Abstract = {{Chemical analyses of 56 olivine-hosted melt inclusions and their host
   olivines from the explosive eruption of Miyakejima volcano, Japan, on 18
   August 2000 were carried out by electron probe micro analyzer and
   secondary ion mass spectrometry in order to investigate the magma
   plumbing system of the eruption. The bimodal olivine core composition,
   relatively small rims, and diffusion profiles of the Mg-rich olivines
   indicate the mixing of evolved magma and less-evolved magma in 2 months
   before the eruption. The major element composition of the Mg-poor
   olivine-hosted melt inclusions (Mg-poor OLMIs) is similar to that of the
   groundmass. The Mg-rich olivine-hosted melt inclusions (Mg-rich OLMIs)
   have a SiO2- and K2O-poor but Al2O3- and CaO-rich composition, compared
   to the whole-rock composition of the products. Most of the Mg-rich OLMIs
   have slightly higher H2O (1.9-3.5 wt \%) and S (0.06-0.21 wt \%)
   contents and a lower CI (0.04-0.07 wt \%) content than the Mg-poor
   OLMIs, whereas they have similar CO2 (0.003-0.025 wt \%) content. These
   results suggest that CO2-rich gas was added to the evolved magma in a
   shallow magma chamber, followed by decompression degassing in a pressure
   range of 30-80 MPa and the rapid ascent of the less-evolved magma from a
   deep magma chamber up to a depth of about 2 km. The ratios of the H2O
   and S contents of the Mg-rich OLMIs are similar to that of the volcanic
   gas emitted from the summit after the 2000 eruption, which suggests
   shallow degassing of the less-evolved magma in the conduit since the
   eruption.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical bonding and morphology of chemical vapor deposited (CVD)
   diamond films exposed to thermal (similar to 0.04 eV) and hyperthermal
   (5 and 7.5 eV) atomic oxygen (AO) were studied by using high resolution
   electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), atomic force microscopy, and
   theoretical simulations. Although exposure to thermal AO caused subtle
   changes to the surface morphology, hyperthermal AO resulted in selective
   etching of the diamond facets: (100) facets remained essentially
   unaffected, whereas (111)-oriented and other facets were severely
   etched. HREELS reveals that hydrogen is removed from the diamond
   surfaces during both thermal and hyperthermal AO exposures. By using
   isotopic labeling in the CVD growth procedure, it is observed that
   exposure to ambient conditions after the AO exposure leads to adsorption
   of adventitious hydrocarbons on the surface. The high background in the
   HREEL spectrum of samples exposed to hyperthermal AO suggests the
   presence of a graphitic layer. Simulations of the interaction between
   hyperthermal AO and (100) and (111) diamond surfaces were conducted by
   using direct dynamics based on density-functional-based tight binding
   methods, in an attempt to elucidate relevant reaction mechanisms. They
   suggest mechanisms for the partial graphitization of the (111) surface
   and for etching of this surface by way of CO2 desorption. Such damaged
   graphitic layers have been previously shown to erode easily when exposed
   to a hyperthermal AO beam. The simulations also suggest that the (100)
   surface, fully covered with ketones, is inert to carbon removal upon
   exposure to hyperthermal oxygen atoms, which scatter inelastically from
   this surface without reaction. The simulations suggest that a nearly
   full ketone coverage is the steady-state configuration for a (100)
   diamond surface exposed to AO.}},

   excellent mechanical properties and metallurgical workability. The
   effects of main strengthening elements Nb, Ti, Al, minor elements P, S
   and micro-alloying element Mg on mechanical properties and structure
   stability have been studied for this alloy at standard heat treatment
   and long time aging conditions both by means of mechanical tests
   (tensile, stress rupture and creep, cyclic stress rupture and crack
   propagation etc.) and detail structure analyses (SEM, TEM, EDS, SAED,
   phase separation and micro-chemical analyses etc.) and also Auger
   analyses on grain boundary segregation behavior. For quality improvement
   of conventional GH4169, Nb content should be controlled at high level
   (5.4\%-5.5\%) with low content of S (<10 x 10(-6)) and high level of P
   (but less than 150 x 10(-6)) and with micro-alloying element Mg also.
   For 680 degrees C even higher temperature used modified GH4169 the gamma
   `'/gamma' highest stable temperature must be raised and the grain
   boundary precipitates should be controlled. Nb content should be still
   controlled at high level (5.4\%-5.5\%), Al content should be raised to
   1.0\%-1.5\% and Ti content still be kept at 1\%; S must be controlled to
   less than 10x10(-6) and P should be raised to a high level but less than
   150x10(-6) and also with micro-alloying element Mg. The modified GH4169

Title = {{Experimental demonstration of phase-remapping attack in a practical
   quantum key distribution system}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Quantum key distribution (QKD) can, in principle, provide unconditional
   security based on the fundamental laws of physics. Unfortunately, a
   practical QKD system may contain overlooked imperfections and may thus
   violate some of the assumptions in the security proofs of QKD. It is
   important to explore these assumptions. One key assumption is that the
   sender (Alice) can prepare the required quantum states without errors.
   However, such an assumption may be violated in a practical QKD system.
   In this paper, we perform a proof-of-principle experiment to demonstrate
   a technically feasible `intercept-and-resend' attack that exploits such
   a security loophole in a commercial `plug \& play' QKD system. The
   resulting quantum bit error rate is 19.7\%, which is substantially lower
   than the well-known 25\% error rate for an intercept-and-resend attack
   in BB84. The attack we utilize is the phase-remapping attack (Fung et al
   2007 Phys. Rev. A 75 32314) proposed by our group.}},

Title = {{Assessment of the exercise tests used during overground endoscopy in UK
   Thoroughbred racehorses and how these may affect the diagnosis of
   dynamic upper respiratory tract obstructions}},
Journal = {{EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{42}},

Pages = {{587-591}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{P>Reasons for performing study:
   Overground endoscopy is being performed with increasing frequency in the
   UK. A previous study has shown that the type of exercise test may affect
   the diagnosis of upper respiratory tract (URT) obstructions. The
   successful clinical application of overground endoscopy systems requires
   understanding of appropriate field exercise testing protocols.
   Objectives:
   The aim of this study was to report the exercise test parameters used
   during overground endoscopy in UK Thoroughbred racehorses and to
   investigate potential effects of these on the diagnosis of URT
   obstructions.
   Methods:
   The exercise test parameters used and the endoscopic observations of the
   URT during exercise were recorded for 140 Thoroughbred racehorses
   referred for the investigation of abnormal respiratory noise and/or poor
   athletic performance.
   Results:
   The exercise test parameters varied widely between horses. The
   presenting complaint was easiest to reproduce in horses with a history
   of abnormal noise in training and hardest to reproduce in those referred
   for investigation of poor performance with no abnormal noise. No
   associations between the presence or not of an URT obstruction and
   exercise test parameters was identified. For horses referred for
   abnormal noise during racing DDSP was more likely to be observed when
   longer distances were performed.
   Conclusions:
   It is difficult to standardise exercise tests in the field when multiple
   premises are used and when training gallops differ markedly to
   racecourses. It was not possible to establish exercise test protocols
   which should be used for all Thoroughbred racehorses. Therefore, at
   present the best advice for horses which make abnormal noise during a
   race or have poor race performance, can only be to replicate race
   conditions as closely as possible. For horses that race over longer
   distances this will require the use of a circular gallops (e.g.
   racecourse) if only short gallops are available at the trainer's
   premises.}},

Abstract = {{The hypochlorous acid (HOC!) scavenging capacities of 10 garlic
   Compounds containing modifications in the thioallyl group (-S-CH2CH=CH2)
   were determined by a catalase protection assay, and the corresponding
   structure activity relationships using molecular descriptors were
   calculated. This scavenging activity was enhanced by increasing the
   number of S atoms or by the alanyl group (-CH2CH-NH2-COOH) and decreased
   in the absence of the C=C bond or in the presence of a sulfoxide group
   in the thioallyl group. Interestingly, S-allylcysteine and its
   corresponding sulfoxide (alliin) showed the highest and lowest
   HOC-scavenging capacities, respectively. Quantitative modeling by
   multiple regression analysis and partial least-squares projections
   showed that the topological descriptor polar surface area and two
   electronic properties, namely, highest occupied molecular orbital and
   total energy, contributed mainly to variations in the HOCI scavenging
   activity of thioallyl compounds. These observations provide new insights
   on the antioxidant mechanism of garlic derivatives in processes
   involving HOCI production.}},

Abstract = {{Using inspiration derived from studying naturally occurring minerals, a
   series of framework beryllosilicates have been synthesized under
   hydrothermal conditions. These include two new zeolite topologies, a
   unique layered beryllosilicate, and beryllosilicate analogues of
   numerous aluminosilicate zeolites. Materials with the structure of the
   rare zeolite mineral nabesite have been synthesized for the first time,
   including both sodium and potassium derivatives. The structural
   chemistry of these beryllosilicates frameworks is discussed with
   reference to the networks of linked tetrahedra, which include the first
   instance of pentagonal, two-dimensional Cairo-tiling of silicate
   tetrahedra in one of the new zeolite topologies, their porosity, and
   their thermal stability.}},

Title = {{Current practices in treatment of female genital fistula: a cross
   sectional study}},
Journal = {{BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Maternal outcomes in most countries of the developed world
   are good. However, in many developing/resource-poor countries, maternal
   outcomes are bleaker: Every year, more than 500,000 women die in
   childbirth, mostly in resource-poor countries. Those who survive often
   suffer from severe and long-term morbidities. One of the most
   devastating injuries is obstetric fistula, occurring most often in south
   Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Fistula treatment and care are available in
   many countries across Africa and Asia, but there is a lack of reliable
   data around clinical factors associated with the success of fistula
   repair surgery. Most published research has been retrospective. While
   these studies have provided useful information about the care and
   treatment of fistula, they are limited by the design. This study was
   designed to identify practices in care that could lead to the design of
   prospective and randomized controlled trials.
   Methods: Self-administered questionnaires were completed by 40 surgeons
   known to provide fistula treatment services in Africa and Asia at
   private and government hospitals. The questionnaire was divided into
   three parts to address the following issues: prophylactic use of
   antibiotics before, during, and after fistula surgery; urethral catheter
   management; and management practices for patients with urinary
   incontinence following fistula repair.
   Results: The results provide a glimpse into current practices in fistula
   treatment and care across a wide swath of geographic, economic, and
   organizational considerations. There is consensus in treatment in some
   areas (routine use of prophylactic antibiotics, limited bed rest until
   the catheter is removed, nonsurgical treatment for postsurgical
   incontinence), while there are wide variations in practice in other
   areas (duration of catheter use, surgical treatments for postsurgical
   incontinence). These findings are based on a small sample and do not
   allow for recommending changes in clinical care, but they point to
   issues for possible clinical trial research that would contribute to
   more efficient and effective fistula care.
   Conclusions: The findings from the survey allowed us to consider
   clinical practices most influential in the cost, efficacy, and safety of
   fistula treatment. These considerations led us to formulate
   recommendations for eight randomized controlled trials on the following
   subjects: 1) Efficacy/safety of short-term catheterization; 2) efficacy
   of surgical and nonsurgical therapies for urinary incontinence; 3)
   technical measures during fistula repair to reduce the incidence of
   post-surgery incontinence; 4) identification of predictive factors for
   ``incurable fistula{''}; 5) usefulness of urodynamic studies in the
   management of urinary incontinence; 6) incidence and significance of
   multi-drug resistant bacteria in the fistula population; 7) primary
   management of small, new fistulas by catheter drainage; and 8)
   antibiotic prophylaxis in fistula repair.}},

Abstract = {{We have recently presented a new methodology for screening different
   signal analysis methods in combination with signal pre-treatment methods
   with the goal to effectively identify those combinations that are highly
   selective towards a specific process change (Bartels et al., Ind. Chem.
   Eng. Res. 48 (2009) 3158-3166). The main outcome of the methodology is
   visually represented in an overall result matrix with coloured tiles
   illustrating a measure for the suitability of each combination of
   analysis method and signal pre-treatment. Suitable methods can be
   visually identified very quickly.
   For the early detection of agglomeration in fluidized beds we illustrate
   this methodology by four different cases: two cases from a pilot-scale
   bubbling bed, one from an industrial scale bubbling bed and one case
   from a lab-scale circulating bed. With the result matrix for each case
   several suitable methods are identified. The data are also evaluated to
   identify methods that are more generally applicable for a range of
   different cases. The suitability of a positively identified method is
   subsequently analyzed for its temporal response to both agglomeration
   and other effects. The influence of the different data pre-treatment
   methods is also addressed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{38}},
Pages = {{17-22}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{P>Reasons for performing study:
   Standardised exercise tests are used for fitness evaluation of sports
   horses. Standards are described for Thoroughbreds and Standardbreds;
   however, limited information is available for Warmbloods.
   Objectives:
   To establish normative standards of performance parameters and heart
   rate recovery (HRR) in Warmblood riding horses of different levels of
   fitness using a submaximal incremental exercise test (SIET) performed on
   a treadmill.
   Methods:
   A SIET was carried out with 29 healthy and treadmill-accustomed
   Warmbloods: eleven 3-day event horses (TDE) and 18 horses from the
   National Equestrian Centre (NEC) competing in amateur jumping and/or
   dressage events. After a warm-up phase, horses performed 2 stages at
   trot and 3-5 stages at gallop at 6\% incline. The first stage lasted 120
   s, all others 90 s. Velocity (V) and heart rate (HR) were measured
   continuously and blood lactate concentration (LAC) at the end of each
   exercise stage. V at HR 150 and 200 beats/min (V-150, V-200), V and HR
   at 2 and 4 mmol/l LAC (V-2, V-4 and HR2, HR4, respectively) were
   calculated and compared between discipline groups. For reference values,
   horses were divided on the basis of the V-4-results in good (GP) and
   average performers (AP) (performance groups). Five minute passive HRR
   was compared between performance groups. Fifteen NEC horses were
   retested within 1-3 months. Groups were compared with t tests and P <
   0.05 considered significant.
   Results:
   Three-day event horses had higher V-150, V-2 and V-4 values than NEC. GP
   had higher values in all performance parameters compared to AP. No
   differences were found between test and retest. GP mean recovery HR was
   different from that of AP from 120 s of recovery onwards.
   Conclusion:
   Treadmill SIETs are suitable to objectify aerobic capacity in Warmblood
   riding horses. Normative standards were assessed for well and
   averagely-trained horses. The results can be referred to when diagnosing
   patients with exercise intolerance.}},

   remagnetization of a lava flow}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{A new paleomagnetic result from a lava flow with a distinctive, two-part
   remanence reinforces the controversial hypothesis that geomagnetic
   change during a polarity reversal can be much faster than normal. The
   3.9-m-thick lava ({''}Flow 20{''}) is exposed in the Sheep Creek Range
   (north central Nevada) and was erupted during a reverse-to-normal (R-N)
   geomagnetic polarity switch at 15.6 Ma. Flow 20 began to acquire a
   primary thermoremanence while the field was pointing east and down but
   was soon buried, reheated, and partially-remagnetized in a north-down
   direction by the 8.2-m-thick flow that succeeded it. A simple conductive
   cooling calculation shows that the observed remagnetization could not
   have occurred unless Flow 20 was still warm (about 150 degrees C near
   its base) when buried and that the 53 degrees change from east-down to
   north-down field occurred at an average rate of approximately 1
   degrees/week, several orders of magnitude faster than typical of secular
   variation. Citation: Bogue, S. W., and J. M. G. Glen (2010), Very rapid

Abstract = {{The filling of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with water and acetonitrile in
   the presence of adsorbed argon at room temperature and atmospheric
   pressure was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. The
   adsorbed gas was found to be an important factor which influences the
   solvent penetration inside the smallest nanotubes. However, for CNTs
   with a diameter of more than 1.5 nm, including CNT(11, 11), the role of
   gas is negligible although it cannot be spontaneously removed. At 298 K
   acetonitrile fills pristine carbon nanotubes more than 10 times faster
   than water due to its higher mobility and less surface tension in spite
   of a larger polarity of the molecule. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   continuum spectra and are called ``unparticles{''} by Georgi. We
   consider supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model with
   approximate conformal sectors. The conformal symmetry is softly broken
   in the infrared which generates a gap. However, the spectrum can still
   have a continuum above the gap if there is no confinement. Using the
   AdS/CFT correspondence this can be achieved with a soft wall in the
   warped extra dimension. When supersymmetry is broken the superpartners
   of the Standard Model particles may simply be a continuum above gap. The
   collider signals can be quite different from the standard supersymmetric
   scenarios and the experimental searches for the continuum superpartners
   can be very challenging.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of the phonon density of states by inelastic neutron
   time-of-flight scattering and specific-heat measurements along with
   first-principles calculations, provide compelling evidence for the
   existence of an Einstein oscillator (rattler) at omega(E1) approximate
   to 5.0 meV in the filled skutterudite Yb0.2Co4Sb12. Multiple
   dispersionless modes in the measured density of states of Yb0.2Co4Sb12
   at intermediate transfer energies (14 <= omega <= 20 meV) are exhibited
   in both the experimental and theoretical density of states of the
   Yb-filled specimen. A peak at 12.4 meV is shown to coincide with a
   second Einstein mode at omega(F.2) approximate to 12.8 meV obtained from
   heat-capacity data. The local modes at intermediate transfer energies
   are attributed to altered properties of the host CoSb3 cage as a result
   of Yb filling. It is suggested that these modes are owed to a
   complementary mechanism for the scattering of heat-carrying phonons in
   addition to the mode observed at omega(E1) approximate to 5.0 meV. Our
   observations offer a plausible explanation for the significantly higher
   dimensionless figures of merit of filled skutterudites, compared to
   their parent compounds.}},

   in different positions in the cage. The interactions between the cage
   and the doped atom mainly cousist of charge transfer and spin-orbit
   interaction. Binding energies of these three compounds are 6.32, 70.88,
   and -53.05 kJ/mol, respectively. The single occupied molecular orbital
   (SOMO) energy levels of those three doped atoms change and split because
   of the interaction with the cage. When electric field is applied,
   electron density shifts along the direction of the electric field. The
   energies of these molecules decrease as the electric field gets
   stronger. The molecular orbital energies, the gaps between the highest
   occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital,
   the SOMO energy levels, and the split energies vary considerably in the

Abstract = {{ABii diphosphonatocavitands self-assemble in chloroform solution to form
   dimeric molecular capsules. The molecular capsules can incarcerate an
   N-methylpyridinium or N-methylpicolinium guest. We have demonstrated
   that the supramolecular assembly acts as a molecular rotor as a result
   of the restricted motion of the guest inside the molecular cavity. In
   the solid state, X-ray diffraction analysis of the free host showed that
   two cavitands interact through strong hydrogen bonds to give the
   supramolecular self-assembled capsule. The solid-state structure of the
   N-methylpicolinium complex is comparable to that of the free host and
   indicates that the guest is not a prerequisite for the formation of the
   capsule. DOSY NMR studies provided a definitive argument for the
   formation of the free and complexed supramolecular capsule in CDCl3
   solution. In solution, the tumbling of the N-methylpyridinium and
   N-methylpicolinium guests about the equatorial axes of the host can be
   frozen and differs by the respective energy barriers, with the larger
   picolinium substrate having a larger value (Delta G(double dagger) =
   69.7 kJ mol(-1)) than the shorter pyridinium guest (Delta G(double
   dagger) = 44.8 kJ mol(-1)). This behavior corresponds to the restricted
   rotation of a rotator in a supramolecular rotor.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model for the spectra of monocolor light-emitting diodes
   (LEDs) and phosphor-coated white LEDs at different drive currents is
   established. The simulation program of the color rendering of a white
   light LED cluster is developed based on this model. The program can
   predict not only the spectral power distribution and color rendering
   index (CRI), but also the number of LEDs, drive currents, input power,
   and luminous efficacy of a white light LED cluster at a given color
   temperature according to the requirement of the luminous flux. The
   experimental results show that the relative spectral power distributions
   (SPDs) and chromaticity coordinates of the model LED are very close to
   that of the real LED at different drive currents. Moreover, the
   correlated color temperature (CCT), CRI, special color rendering index
   (R9) luminous flux, input power, and luminous efficacy of the white
   light LED cluster predicted by simulation are also very close to the
   measured values. Furthermore, a white/red cluster with high rendering

Abstract = {{We report on experimental investigations into strong, laser-driven,
   radiative shocks in cluster media. Cylindrical shocks launched with
   several joules of deposited energy exhibit strong radiative effects
   including rapid deceleration, radiative preheat, and shell thinning.
   Using time-resolved propagation data from single-shot streaked Schlieren
   measurements, we have observed temporal modulations on the shock
   velocity, which we attribute to the thermal cooling instability, a
   process which is believed to occur in supernova remnants but until now
   has not been observed experimentally.}},

Pages = {{123-128}},

Abstract = {{P>Reasons for performing study:
   The inflammatory and neuroendocrine response to endurance exercise and
   relationship of these parameters to performance is not well documented
   in horses.
   Hypotheses or objectives:
   Evidence of systemic inflammation is associated with poor performance in
   horses competing in endurance events.
   Methods:
   Blood was collected prior to and at the finish or elimination point from
   horses competing in both the 80 and 160 km American Endurance Ride
   National Championship competitions in 2006. Immunoreactive
   alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and tumour necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were quantified utilising radioimmunoassay
   (RIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques,
   respectively. The concentration of total thiobarbituric acid reactive
   substances (TBARS) was measured fluorometrically.
   Results:
   Thirty horses were included in the study. Endurance exercise was
   associated with a significant increase in TBARS in the 80 km group but
   not the 160 km group. TNF-alpha and alpha-MSH did not significantly
   change as a result of exercise in either distance group. Precompetition
   TBARS was significantly higher in horses that failed to finish the 80 km
   race, as well as when distances were combined. In addition,
   precompetition alpha-MSH was significantly lower in nonfinishers in the
   160 km group. Furthermore, competition speed was positively correlated
   with precompetition alpha-MSH in the 80 km and negatively correlated
   with precompetition TNF-alpha when distances were combined.
   Conclusions:
   Our results suggest that basal oxidative stress markers, circulating
   cytokines and anti-inflammatory neuroendocrine hormones appear to
   correlate with endurance performance in horses.
   Potential relevance:
   Basal oxidative stress markers, circulating cytokines and
   anti-inflammatory neuroendocrine hormones may be predictive of athletic
   performance in endurance horses. Future studies evaluating the effect of
   training on these markers in endurance horses are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{PKC-theta (PKC-theta), a member of the novel protein kinase C family
   (nPKC), regulates a wide variety of functions in the periphery. However,
   its presence and role in the CNS has remained largely unknown. Recently,
   we demonstrated the presence of PKC-theta in the arcuate hypothalamic
   nucleus (ARC) and knockdown of PKC-theta from the ARC protected mice
   from developing diet-induced obesity. Another isoform of the nPKC group,
   PKC-delta (PKC-delta), is expressed in several non-hypothalamic brain
   sites including the thalamus and hippocampus. Although PKC-delta has
   been implicated in regulating hypothalamic glucose homeostasis, its
   distribution in the hypothalamus has not previously been described. In
   the current study, we used immunohistochemistry to examine the
   distribution of PKC-theta and delta- immunoreactivity in rat and mouse
   hypothalamus. We found PKC-theta immunoreactive neurons in several
   hypothalamic nuclei including the ARC, lateral hypothalamic area,
   perifornical area and tuberomammillary nucleus. PKC-delta immunoreactive
   neurons were found in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei.
   Double-label immunohistochemisty in mice expressing green fluorescent
   protein either with the long form of leptin receptor (LepR-b) or in
   orexin (ORX) neurons indicated that PKC-theta is highly colocalized in
   lateral hypothalamic ORX neurons but not in lateral hypothalamic LepR-b
   neurons. Double-label immunohistochemistry in oxytocin-enhanced yellow
   fluorescent protein mice or arginine vasopressin-enhanced green
   fluorescent protein (AVP-EGFP) transgenic rats revealed a high degree of
   colocalization of PKC-delta within paraventricular and supraoptic
   oxytocin neurons but not the vasopressinergic neurons. We conclude that
   PKC-theta and -delta are expressed in different hypothalamic neuronal
   populations. (C) 2010 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We develop the algebraic polynomial theory for ``supertropical
   algebra,{''} as initiated earlier over the real numbers by the first
   author. The main innovation there was the introduction of ``ghost
   elements,{''} which also play the key role in our structure theory.
   Here, we work somewhat more generally over an ordered monoid, and
   develop a theory which contains the analogs of several basic theorems of
   classical commutative algebra. This structure enables one to develop a
   Zariski-type algebraic geometric approach to tropical geometry, viewing
   tropical varieties as sets of roots of (supertropical) polynomials,
   leading to an analog of the Hilbert Nullstellensatz.
   Particular attention is paid to factorization of polynomials. In one
   indeterminate, any polynomial can be factored into linear and quadratic
   factors, and although unique factorization may fail, there is a
   ``preferred{''} factorization that is explained both geometrically and
   algebraically. The failure of unique factorization in several
   indeterminates is explained by geometric phenomena described in the
   paper. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The assembly behavior of aryl/alkyl imidazolium ionic liquid salts in

   increase in the solution viscosity in water. Addition of the macrocyclic
   host molecules cucurbit{[}n]urils (CB{[}n]) were found to effectively
   alter the supramolecular assemblies, as evidenced from the dramatic
   increase (by CB{[}7]) and decrease (by CB{[}8]) in solution viscosity
   and aggregation size in water, on account of the different binding
   stoichiometries, 1:1 complexation with CB{[}7] and 2:1 complexation with
   CB{[}8]. Furthermore, the aggregate architectures were controllably
   modified by competitive guests for the CB{[}n] hosts. This complex

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach that may be applied as an accurate and
   rapid tool for classifying coffee beans on the basis of the specific
   kahweol content. Using Fourier-transform Raman spectroscopy with 1064 nm
   excitation it is possible to monitor the characteristic Raman bands of
   kahweol in green coffee beans without chemical and physical processing
   of the beans. The procedure was optimized on the basis of 83 and 125
   measurements of whole and ground beans, respectively, using coffee
   samples of two different species, Coffee arabica L. and Coffee canephora
   L. (var. Robusta), and different origins (Asia, Africa, and South
   America). The relative contribution of the kahweol in individual beans
   can be determined quantitatively by means of a component analysis of the
   spectra, yielding a spectral kahweol index (sigma(ka)) that is
   proportional to the relative content of kahweol in a coffee bean. The
   reproducibility of the spectroscopic measurement and analysis was found
   to be 3.5\%. Individual beans of the same type and origin reveal a
   scattering of the sigma(ka) values. Nevertheless, an unambiguous
   distinction between Arabica and Robusta samples is possible on the basis
   of single-bean measurements as the sigma(ka) values are greater than and
   less than 10 for Arabica and Robusta coffees, respectively. Measurements
   of whole and ground beans afforded very similar results, despite the
   heterogeneous distribution of kahweol within a bean. Unlike conventional
   analytical techniques, the single-bean sensitivity of the present
   approach may also allow for a rapid detection of unwanted admixtures of
   low-value Robusta coffee to high-quality and more expensive Arabica
   coffee.}},

   We did not observe any change of ferroelectric polarization with

   214114) developed a theory explaining the reported large magnetoelectric
   effect in PFWx-PZT(1-x), taking into account relaxor magnetic and
   relaxor ferroelectric properties of the system. Our data revealed
   classical ferroelectric properties below 525 K and 485 K in samples with
   x = 0.2 and 0.3, respectively. Moreover, paramagnetic behavior was
   observed down to 4.5 K instead of previously reported relaxor magnetic
   behavior. It seems that the reported switching-off of ferroelectric
   polarization in PFWx-PZT(1-x) thin films is not an intrinsic property,
   but probably an effect of electrodes,}},

Abstract = {{Steering accuracy is limited by the quantized phase modulation values
   and the number of phase pixels for spatial light modulators (SLMs).
   Conventional methods of beam steering lack optimum precision. In this

   steps is proposed. Compared with the conventional methods, this novel
   method is able to reduce the maximum normalized steering error in SLM
   significantly by a factor proportional to the number of pixels. In
   addition, steering errors of high steering angles can be drastically
   reduced by a factor proportional to the product of the number of pixels
   and the quantized phase levels; the number of high-precision steering
   angles increases with the number of pixels or the quantized phase levels
   increasing.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To describe management practices and routine preventive care
   of aged horses in Queensland, Australia, including effects of owner
   characteristics, affiliation to an equestrian group and retirement of
   the horse.
   Methods Owners of horses were contacted via Equestrian Australia (EA)
   and asked to complete a questionnaire about their aged horses (e.g. age,
   breed, sex and colour); their use and management, including preventive
   health care; and use of equine healthcare providers.
   Results Horses aged 15 years or greater represented one-third of the
   total horses owned in the population sample. The median age of the
   horses was 20.7 years (range 15-44 years). Basic husbandry and
   preventive health care varied depending on demographic region, age of
   the horse and its use. Affiliation with EA was associated with the breed
   and use of the horse, but not with management or preventive health care
   other than frequency of hoof care visits. Retired horses had reduced
   basic husbandry and preventive health care compared with non-retired
   horses. There was reduced preventive health care in rural compared with
   urban areas. The majority (61\%) of horses in the current study had not
   been visited by a veterinarian in the previous 12 months.
   Conclusion Aged horses constitute a large subgroup of the Australian
   horse population. Although basic management is at a high level for most
   aged horses, it appears to be reduced following the horse's retirement
   and in the more rural areas. There was limited veterinary involvement in
   preventive healthcare strategies for aged horses, especially in rural
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{Lactogenic transmission plays an important role in the biology of
   lentiviruses such as HIV and SIV or the small ruminant lentiviruses
   (SRLV). In this work we analyzed the characteristics of viruses that
   goats, naturally infected with two strains of SRLV, transmitted to their
   kids. The spectrum of viral genotypes transmitted was broader and the
   efficiency of transmission greater compared to their human and simian
   counterparts. The newly described A10 subgroup of SRLV was more
   efficiently transmitted than the 01 genotype. The analysis of a
   particular stretch of the envelope glycoprotein encompassing a potential
   neutralizing epitope revealed that, as in Sly, the transmitted viruses
   were positively charged in this region, but, in contrast to Sly, they
   tended to lack a glycosylation site that might protect against antibody
   neutralization. We conclude that the physiology of the ruminant neonatal
   intestine, which permits the adsorption of infected maternal cells,
   shaped the evolution of these particular lentiviruses that represent a
   valid model of lactogenic lentivirus transmission. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: A considerable amount of research has been conducted on
   clinical decision making (CDM) in short-term physical conditions.
   However, there is a lack of knowledge on CDM and its outcome in
   long-term illnesses, especially in care for people with severe mental
   illness.
   Methods/Design: The study entitled ``Clinical decision making and
   outcome in routine care for people with severe mental illness{''}
   (CEDAR) is carried out in six European countries (Denmark, Germany,
   Hungary, Italy, Switzerland and UK). First, CEDAR establishes a
   methodology to assess CDM in people with severe mental illness. Specific
   instruments are developed (and psychometric properties established) to
   measure CDM style, key elements of CDM in routine care, as well as CDM
   involvement and satisfaction from patient and therapist perspectives.
   Second, these instruments are being put to use in a multi-national
   prospective observational study (bimonthly assessments during a one-year
   observation period; N = 560). This study investigates the immediate,
   short- and long-term effect of CDM on crucial dimensions of clinical
   outcome (symptom level, quality of life, needs) by taking into account
   significant variables moderating the relationship between CDM and
   outcome.
   Discussion: The results of this study will make possible to delineate
   quality indicators of CDM, as well as to specify prime areas for further
   improvement. Ingredients of best practice in CDM in the routine care for
   people with severe mental illness will be extracted and recommendations
   formulated. With its explicit focus on the patient role in CDM, CEDAR
   will also contribute to strengthening the service user perspective. This
   project will substantially add to improving the practice of CDM in
   mental health care across Europe.}},

Abstract = {{The intracellular oligomerization of alpha-synuclein is associated with
   Parkinson's disease and appears to be an important target for
   disease-modifying treatment. Yet, to date, there is no specific
   inhibitor for this aggregation process. Using unbiased systematic
   peptide array analysis, we indentified molecular interaction domains
   within the beta-synuclein polypeptide that specifically binds
   alpha-synuclein. Adding such peptide fragments to alpha-synuclein
   significantly reduced both amyloid fibrils and soluble oligomer
   formation in vitro. A retro-inverso analogue of the best peptide
   inhibitor was designed to develop the identified molecular recognition
   module into a drug candidate. While this peptide shows indistinguishable
   activity as compared to the native peptide, it is stable in mouse serum
   and penetrates alpha-synuclein over-expressing cells. The interaction
   interface between the D-amino acid peptide and alpha-synuclein was
   mapped by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Finally,
   administering the retro-inverso peptide to a Drosophila model expressing
   mutant A53T alpha-synuclein in the nervous system, resulted in a
   significant recovery of the behavioral abnormalities of the treated
   flies and in a significant reduction in alpha-synuclein accumulation in
   the brains of the flies. The engineered retro-inverso peptide can serve
   as a lead for developing a novel class of therapeutic agents to treat
   Parkinson's disease.}},

Title = {{OH and OI airglow layer modulation by ducted short-period gravity waves:
   Effects of trapping altitude}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Perturbations to the OH and OI {[}O(S-1) 557.7 nm] airglow layers by
   ducted gravity waves near the Brunt-V is l period are investigated using
   a 2-D numerical model. Airglow signatures of these waves are strongly
   determined by perturbations of O, O-3, and H, which exhibit peak
   densities near and above mesopause. Strong periodic vertical wind
   components of short-period gravity waves induce opposite relative
   density perturbations above and below the layer density peaks. Airglow
   signatures for ducted waves depend on the specific vertical shapes and
   altitudes of the wave packets relative to ambient species density
   profiles; waves perturbing only the bottoms or tops of the layers
   produce signatures differing from those able to perturb the entire layer
   thickness. Line-of-sight cancellation occurs between opposite
   perturbations above and below airglow layer peaks, even for standing
   waves without vertical phase progression. Integrated brightness-weighted
   temperature and intensity can thus appear in-phase or antiphase for
   standing waves, depending on the wave-packet altitude relative to the
   density gradients. Comparisons of OH and OI layer intensities also
   reveal in-phase or antiphase relative intensity responses and do not
   directly indicate the phase of the wave perturbations at layer peak
   altitudes. Despite this ambiguity, simultaneous brightness-weighted
   temperature measurements may provide additional insight into wave
   structure, amplitude, and trapping altitude. For waves of sufficient
   amplitude that perturb steep density gradients, nonlinearity of the
   airglow response may be observable; this effect is most prominent when
   strong cancellation of the linear signature occurs.}},

Title = {{Angular dependence of static and kinetic friction on alkali halide
   surfaces}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{The angular dependence of the lateral forces acting on an atomically
   sharp tip slowly pulled by an elastic spring along a crystal surface
   with square symmetry is investigated in the framework of a separable
   two-dimensional tip-surface interaction potential. In the stick-slip
   regime kinetic friction is proportional to (cos phi + vertical bar sin
   phi vertical bar), phi being the angle between the scan direction and a
   particular symmetry axis. For a high enough normal force, static
   friction is proportional to 1/cos phi, whereas for intermediate loads it
   shows a phi-dependent spread of possible values. Continuous sliding with
   ultralow friction sets in below a load-dependent corrugation amplitude.
   Numerical simulations help interpret those analytic results in terms of
   the zigzag motion of a friction force microscope tip sliding on the
   (001) surface of a rocksalt crystal. The influence of the offset between
   the start of a scan and the center of the corresponding unit cell, in
   particular, for scans along < 100 > directions is also elucidated. The
   predicted ratio of kinetic friction along the < 100 > and < 110 >
   directions agrees best with values measured on alkali halides with
   similar cation and anion radii. This ratio, as well as the angular
   dependence of the static friction may be used to determine fine details
   of the lateral tip-sample interaction.}},

   find that most magnetic loops that reach into the chromosphere or higher

   photosphere. Ninety-one percent of the magnetic energy in the
   mid-chromosphere (at a height of 1 Mm) is in field lines, whose stronger
   footpoint has a strength of more than 300 G, i.e., above the
   equipartition field strength with convection. The loops reaching into
   the chromosphere and corona are also found to be asymmetric in the sense
   that the weaker footpoint has a strength B < 300 G and is located in the
   internetwork (IN). Such loops are expected to be strongly dynamic and
   have short lifetimes, as dictated by the properties of the IN fields.}},

   influence of the properties of MB, Agarose, Agarose B and LRU on the
   separating efficiency of SWCNTs. By characterizing their UV-Vis-NIR
   absorption spectra, we found that different agarose had little influence
   on the separating efficiency of s-SWCNTs, and had a great effect on the
   separating efficiency of m-SWCNTs. Furthermore, by comparing the
   properties of differents agarose gel including gel strength, mesh size
   and so on, we consider that the major factors in separating efficiency
   of m-SWCNTs are the gel strength and gel mesh size. The results indicate
   that the smaller mesh size of the gel is favorable to the enrichment of
   m-SWCNTs, while the higher gel strength is unfavorable.}},

Number = {{32}},
Pages = {{6286-6294}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{The deconvolution of blurred and noisy satellite images is an ill-posed
   inverse problem, which can be regularized under the Bayesian framework
   by introducing an appropriate image prior. In this paper, we derive a
   new image prior based on the state-of-the-art nonlocal means (NLM)
   denoising approach under Markov random field theory. Inheriting from the
   NLM, the prior exploits the intrinsic high redundancy of satellite
   images and is able to encode the image's nonsmooth information. Using
   this prior, we propose an inhomogeneous deconvolution technique for
   satellite images, termed nonlocal means-based deconvolution (NLM-D).
   Moreover, in order to make our NLM-D unsupervised, we apply the L-curve
   approach to estimate the optimal regularization parameter.
   Experimentally, NLM-D demonstrates its capacity to preserve the image's
   nonsmooth structures (such as edges and textures) and outperforms the
   existing total variation-based and wavelet-based deconvolution methods
   in terms of both visual quality and signal-to-noise ratio performance.

Title = {{Manipulating the Stereoselectivity of Limonene Epoxide Hydrolase by
   Directed Evolution Based on Iterative Saturation Mutagenesis}},

Abstract = {{Limonene epoxide hydrolase from Rhodococcus erythropolis DCL 14 (LEH) is
   known to be an exceptional epoxide hydrolase (EH) because it has an
   unusual secondary structure and catalyzes the hydrolysis of epoxides by
   a rare one-step mechanism in contrast to the usual two-step sequence.
   From a synthetic organic viewpoint it is unfortunate that LEH shows
   acceptable stereoselectivity essentially only in the hydrolysis of the
   natural substrate limonene epoxide, which means that this EH cannot be
   exploited as a catalyst in asymmetric transformations of other
   substrates. In the present study, directed evolution using iterative
   saturation mutagenesis (ISM) has been tested as a means to engineer LEH
   mutants showing broad substrate scope with high stereoselectivity. By
   grouping individual residues aligning the binding pocket correctly into
   randomization sites and performing saturation mutagenesis iteratively
   using a reduced amino acid alphabet, mutants were obtained which
   catalyze the desymmetrization of cyclopentene-oxide with stereoselective
   formation of either the (R,R)- or the (S,S)-diol on an optional basis.
   The mutants prove to be excellent catalysts for the desymmetrization of
   other meso-epoxides and for the hydrolytic kinetic resolution of racemic
   substrates, without performing new mutagenesis experiments. Since less
   than 5000 tranformants had to be screened for achieving these results,
   this study contributes to the generalization of ISM as a fast and
   reliable method for protein engineering. In order to explain some of the
   stereoselective consequences of the observed mutations, a simple model
   based on molecular dynamics simulations has been proposed.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed kinetic modeling study of the atom transfer radical
   polymerization (ATRP) of isobornyl acrylate (iBoA) is presented. This
   study combines a detailed reaction scheme with a systematic approach to
   account for diffusional limitations. Calculated values for diffusion
   coefficients and the Williams-Landel-Ferry parameters for poly(iBoA) are
   based on rheological measurements. A good agreement with experimental
   data is obtained for the polymerization rate, average chain length, and
   polydispersity index in conditions ranging from 323 to 348 K for
   targeted chain lengths varying from 50 to 100 and initial
   activator/deactivator concentrations between 10-50/0-2.5 mol m(-3). In
   these conditions, beta C-scission reactions are insignificant and
   backbiting reactions result in a slight decrease of the polymerization
   rate and level of control at high conversions only. Termination is
   subject to diffusional limitations during the whole ATRP, while
   diffusional limitations on deactivation cannot be neglected at higher
   conversion. Diffusional limitations are shown to be codetermined by the
   evolution of the chain length distribution of both the end-chain and
   mid-chain macromolecular species.}},

Abstract = {{A new unsymmetrical AB{*} inimer, p-(2-bromoisobutyloylmethyl)styrene
   (BiBMS), was applied to the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)
   to prepare a family of polymers with the topologies ranging from linear
   to branched. The catalyst system was Cu/CuBr2, coupled with
   2,2'-bipyridine (Bipy) or N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)octylamine (BPMOA) as
   a ligand in toluene or anisole at different temperatures, which ensured
   a very low catalyst (CuBr) concentration throughout the polymerization
   by a slow reduction process. First, BiBMS was polymerized in anisole at
   0 degrees C using Cu/CuBr2/BPMOA as a catalyst system; at this
   temperature, the initiating activity of the formed A{*} was frozen and
   the polymerization was a step-growth polymerization, resulting in the
   formation of a linear polymer (LP1) whose main chain was linked by ester
   bonds. Second, BiBMS was polymerized in toluene at 20 degrees C using
   Cu/CuBr2/Bipy as a catalyst system. Under this condition, initiation
   from the B{*} of BiBMS was slow, followed by a fast radical
   polymerization of the BiBMS vinyl bonds and a slow deactivation, thereby
   affording another linear polymer (LP2), the structure of which was the
   same as that obtained by common free radical polymerization of BiBMS
   except the end groups. The conversion of BiBMS was controlled to be
   moderate to suppress the possible initiation from the pendant B{*} along
   the polymer main chain. Third, BiBMS was polymerized in anisole at
   various temperatures using Cu/CuBr2/Bipy as a catalyst system; three
   branched polymers (BP1, BP2, BP3) with different degree of branching
   (DB) were obtained, the DB of which could be easily adjusted by changing
   temperature (BP1, DB = 0.12 at 20 degrees C; BP2, DB = 0.26 at 40
   degrees C; BP3, DB = 0.37 at 60 degrees C).}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study carried out to develop a scale for assessing
   diabetic patients' perceptions about physical activity and to test its
   psychometric properties (The Physical Activity Questionnaire for
   Diabetic Patients-PAQ-DP).
   Methods: An item pool extracted from the Theory of Planned Behavior
   literature was generated. Then an expert panel evaluated the items by
   assessing content validity index and content validity ratio.
   Consequently exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed to indicate
   the scale constructs. In addition reliability analyses including
   internal consistency and test-retest analysis were carried out.
   Results: In all a sample of 127 women with diabetes participated in the
   study. Twenty-two items were initially extracted from the literature. A
   six-factor solution (containing 19 items) emerged as a result of an
   exploratory factor analysis namely: instrumental attitude, subjective
   norm, perceived behavioral control, affective attitude, self-identity,
   and intention explaining 60.30\% of the variance observed. Additional
   analyses indicated satisfactory results for internal consistency
   (Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.54 to 0.8) and intraclass correlation
   coefficients (ranging from 0.40 to 0.92).
   Conclusions: The Physical Activity Questionnaire for Diabetic Patients
   (PAQ-DP) is the first instrument that applies the Theory of Planned
   Behavior in its constructs. The findings indicated that the PAQ-DP is a
   reliable and valid measure for assessing physical activity perceptions
   and now is available and can be used in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the Drell-Yan lepton pair production at forward rapidity at
   the Large Hadron Collider. Using the dipole framework for the
   computation of the cross section we find a significant suppression in
   comparison to the collinear factorization formula due to saturation
   effects in the dipole cross section. We develop a twist expansion in
   powers of Q(s)(2)/M-2 where Q(s) is the saturation scale and M the
   invariant mass of the produced lepton pair. For the nominal LHC energy
   the leading twist description is sufficient down to masses of 6 GeV.
   Below that value the higher twist terms give a significant contribution.}},

Title = {{Noninvasive Visualization of Coronary Artery Endothelial Function in

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{20}},

Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Objectives The goal was to test 2 hypotheses: first, that coronary
   endothelial function can be measured noninvasively and abnormal function
   detected using clinical 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and
   second, that the extent of local coronary artery disease (CAD), in a
   given patient, is related to the degree of local abnormal coronary
   endothelial function.
   Background Abnormal endothelial function mediates the initiation and
   progression of atherosclerosis and predicts cardiovascular events.
   However, direct measures of coronary endothelial function have required
   invasive assessment.
   Methods The MRI was performed in 20 healthy adults and 17 patients with
   CAD. Cross-sectional coronary area and blood flow were quantified before
   and during isometric handgrip exercise, an endothelial-dependent
   stressor. In 10 severe, single-vessel CAD patients, paired endothelial
   function was measured in the artery with severe stenosis and the
   contralateral artery with minimal disease.
   Results In healthy adults, coronary arteries dilated and flow increased
   with stress. In CAD patients, coronary artery area and blood flow
   decreased with stress (both p <= 0.02). In the paired study, coronary
   artery area and blood flow failed to increase during exercise in the
   mildly diseased vessel, but both area (p = 0.01) and blood flow (p =
   0.02) decreased significantly in the severely diseased, contralateral
   artery.
   Conclusions Endothelial-dependent coronary artery dilation and increased
   blood flow in healthy subjects, and their absence in CAD patients, can
   now be directly visualized and quantified noninvasively. Local coronary
   endothelial function differs between severely and mildly diseased
   arteries in a given CAD patient. This novel, safe method may offer new
   insights regarding the importance of local coronary endothelial function
   and improved risk stratification in patients at risk for and with known
   CAD. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2010;56:1657-65) (C) 2010 by the American

Abstract = {{Since its inception by Kimura in 1955 {[}M. Kimura, Proc. Natl. Acad.
   Sci. U. S. A. 41, 144 (1955)], the diffusion equation has become a
   standard technique of population genetics. The diffusion equation is
   however only an approximation, valid in the limit of large populations
   and small selection. Moreover, useful quantities such as the fixation
   probabilities are not easily extracted from it and need the concomitant
   use of a forward and backward equation. We show here that the partial
   differential equation governing the probability generating function can
   be used as an alternative to the diffusion equation with none of its
   drawbacks: it does not involve any approximation, it has well-defined
   initial and boundary conditions, and its solutions are finite
   polynomials. We apply this technique to derive analytical results for
   the Moran process with selection, which encompasses the Kimura diffusion
   equation.}},

Abstract = {{A simple and flexiable route is presented to fabricate ordered
   micro/nanostructured porous films, based on a monolayer colloidal
   crystal template and solution dipping. In2O3 is chosen as a main model
   material to demonstrate the validity of the given fabrication strategy.
   It has been shown that the porous films with different microstructures,
   can be constructed directly on any desired substrate (with flat, curved,
   or even rough surface). The separately tunable sensitivity and response
   time in a large range and the gas sensing performances with both high
   sensitivity and fast response have been obtained only by controlling
   microstructures of the porous films. High stability, good
   reproducibility, and selectivity of the sensing performance have been
   achieved. Further, micro/nanostructured porous film sensors with desired
   sensing performances are designed and fabricated. This work could be
   important towards practical applications of micro/nanostructured
   porous-film-based sensors in the near future.}},

Title = {{Metastatic canine mammary carcinomas can be identified by a gene
   expression profile that partly overlaps with human breast cancer
   profiles}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Similar to human breast cancer mammary tumors of the female
   dog are commonly associated with a fatal outcome due to the development
   of distant metastases. However, the molecular defects leading to
   metastasis are largely unknown and the value of canine mammary carcinoma
   as a model for human breast cancer is unclear. In this study, we
   analyzed the gene expression signatures associated with mammary tumor
   metastasis and asked for parallels with the human equivalent.
   Methods: Messenger RNA expression profiles of twenty-seven lymph node
   metastasis positive or negative canine mammary carcinomas were
   established by microarray analysis. Differentially expressed genes were
   functionally characterized and associated with molecular pathways. The
   findings were also correlated with published data on human breast
   cancer.
   Results: Metastatic canine mammary carcinomas had 1,011 significantly
   differentially expressed genes when compared to non-metastatic
   carcinomas. Metastatic carcinomas had a significant up-regulation of
   genes associated with cell cycle regulation, matrix modulation, protein
   folding and proteasomal degradation whereas cell differentiation genes,
   growth factor pathway genes and regulators of actin organization were
   significantly downregulated. Interestingly, 265 of the 1,011
   differentially expressed canine genes are also related to human breast
   cancer and, vice versa, parts of a human prognostic gene signature were
   identified in the expression profiles of the metastatic canine tumors.
   Conclusions: Metastatic canine mammary carcinomas can be discriminated
   from non-metastatic carcinomas by their gene expression profiles. More
   than one third of the differentially expressed genes are also described
   of relevance for human breast cancer. Many of the differentially
   expressed genes are linked to functions and pathways which appear to be
   relevant for the induction and maintenance of metastatic progression and
   may represent new therapeutic targets. Furthermore, dogs are in some
   aspects suitable as a translational model for human breast tumors in
   order to identify prognostic molecular signatures and potential
   therapeutic targets.}},

Title = {{Advances in the Use of DNA Barcodes to Build a Community Phylogeny for
   Tropical Trees in a Puerto Rican Forest Dynamics Plot}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Species number, functional traits, and phylogenetic history
   all contribute to characterizing the biological diversity in plant
   communities. The phylogenetic component of diversity has been
   particularly difficult to quantify in species-rich tropical tree
   assemblages. The compilation of previously published (and often
   incomplete) data on evolutionary relationships of species into a
   composite phylogeny of the taxa in a forest, through such programs as
   Phylomatic, has proven useful in building community phylogenies although
   often of limited resolution. Recently, DNA barcodes have been used to
   construct a robust community phylogeny for nearly 300 tree species in a
   forest dynamics plot in Panama using a supermatrix method. In that study
   sequence data from three barcode loci were used to generate a
   well-resolved species-level phylogeny.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we expand upon this earlier
   investigation and present results on the use of a phylogenetic
   constraint tree to generate a community phylogeny for a diverse,
   tropical forest dynamics plot in Puerto Rico. This enhanced method of
   phylogenetic reconstruction insures the congruence of the barcode
   phylogeny with broadly accepted hypotheses on the phylogeny of flowering
   plants (i.e., APG III) regardless of the number and taxonomic breadth of
   the taxa sampled. We also compare maximum parsimony versus maximum
   likelihood estimates of community phylogenetic relationships as well as
   evaluate the effectiveness of one-versus two-versus three-gene barcodes
   in resolving community evolutionary history.
   Conclusions/Significance: As first demonstrated in the Panamanian forest
   dynamics plot, the results for the Puerto Rican plot illustrate that
   highly resolved phylogenies derived from DNA barcode sequence data
   combined with a constraint tree based on APG III are particularly useful
   in comparative analysis of phylogenetic diversity and will enhance
   research on the interface between community ecology and evolution.}},

Title = {{Use of a bovine genome array to identify new biological pathways for
   beef marbling in Hanwoo (Korean Cattle)}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Marbling (intramuscular fat) is a valuable trait that
   impacts on meat quality and an important factor determining price of
   beef in the Korean beef market. Animals that are destined for this high
   marbling market are fed a high concentrate ration for approximately 30
   months in the Korean finishing farms. However, this feeding strategy
   leads to inefficiencies and excessive fat production. This study aimed
   to identify candidate genes and pathways associated with intramuscular
   fat deposition on highly divergent marbling phenotypes in adult Hanwoo
   cattle.
   Results: Bovine genome array analysis was conducted to detect
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in m. longissimus with divergent
   marbling phenotype (marbling score 2 to 7). Three data-processing
   methods (MAS5.0, GCRMA and RMA) were used to test for differential
   expression (DE). Statistical analysis identified 21 significant
   transcripts from at least two data-processing methods (P < 0.01). All 21
   differentially expressed genes were validated by real-time PCR. Results
   showed a high concordance in the gene expression fold change between the
   microarrays and the real time PCR data. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway
   analysis demonstrated that some genes (ADAMTS4, CYP51A and SQLE) over
   expressed in high marbled animals are involved in a protein catabolic
   process and a cholesterol biosynthesis process. In addition, pathway
   analysis also revealed that ADAMTS4 is activated by three regulators
   (IL-17A, TNF alpha and TGF beta 1). QRT-PCR was used to investigate gene
   expression of these regulators in muscle with divergent intramuscular
   fat contents. The results demonstrate that ADAMTS4 and TGF beta 1 are
   associated with increasing marbling fat. An ADAMTS4/TGF beta 1 pathway
   seems to be associated with the phenotypic differences between high and
   low marbled groups.
   Conclusions: Marbling differences are possibly a function of complex
   signaling pathway interactions between muscle and fat. These results
   suggest that ADAMTS4, which is involved in connective tissue
   degradation, could play a role in an important biological pathway for
   building up marbling in cattle. Moreover, ADAMTS4 and TGF beta 1could
   potentially be used as an early biological marker for marbling fat
   content in the early stages of growth.}},

Title = {{Competition for light between individual trees lowers reference canopy
   stomatal conductance: Results from a model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{We have used an ecosystem model, TREES (Terrestrial Regional Ecosystem
   Exchange Simulator), to test the hypothesis that competition for light
   limits reference canopy stomatal conductance (G(Sref); conductance at 1
   kPa vapor pressure deficit) for individual tree crowns. Sap flux (J(S))
   data was collected at an aspen-dominated unmanaged early successional
   site, and at a sugar maple dominated midsuccessional site managed for
   timber production. Using a Monte Carlo approach, J(S) scaled canopy
   transpiration (E-C) estimates were used to parameterize two versions of
   the model for each tree individually; a control model treated trees as
   isolated individuals, and a modified version incorporated the shading
   effects of neighboring individuals on incident radiation. Agreement
   between simulated and observed E-C was better for maple than for aspen
   using the control model. Accounting for canopy heterogeneity using a
   three-dimensional canopy representation had minimal effects on estimates
   of G(Sref) or model performance for individual maples. At the Aspen site
   the modified model resulted in improved E-C estimates, particularly for
   trees with lower G(Sref) and more shading by neighboring individuals.
   Our results imply a link between photosynthetic capacity, as mediated by
   competitive light environment, and G(Sref). We conclude that accounting
   for the effects of canopy heterogeneity on incident radiation improves
   modeled estimates of canopy carbon and water fluxes, especially for
   shade intolerant species. Furthermore our results imply a link between
   ecosystem structure and function that may be exploited to elucidate the
   impacts of forest structural heterogeneity on ecosystem fluxes of carbon
   and water via LiDAR remote sensing.}},

Title = {{Lithological composition of the North American continent and
   implications of lithological map resolution for dissolved silica flux
   modeling}},

Abstract = {{Lithological maps are important tools for applications sensitive to
   physical or chemical attributes of rocks. They aggregate rock types into
   a limited set of classes. Most studies on river elementary fluxes
   derived from chemical weathering use local lithological maps, and some
   upscale their results to global scales, using global lithological maps.
   It remains unclear if those maps sufficiently represent the
   heterogeneous local lithological settings. To analyze this in more
   detail a new lithological map of North America containing 262,111
   polygons is presented and compared to three global lithological maps.
   The impact of the differences is demonstrated using four models of
   dissolved silica mobilization from the terrestrial land system into
   river systems (DSi mobilization), calibrated using each map. According
   to the new map, North America is composed of 62.8\% sediments, 14.8\%
   plutonics, 13.3\% metamorphics, and 7.2\% volcanics. In all four maps,
   the total proportions of rock types are comparable for North America,
   but their spatial distribution differs largely. The calculated DSi
   mobilization differs weakly between the maps (-20\% to +9\%) compared to
   the results of the model calibrated on the new map for North America but
   strongly (-59\% to +38\%) for tributary regions of regional seas around
   North America. The map comparison suggests that lithological classes of
   different data sets may represent different attributes although they may
   share the same name. Applications (e.g., Earth system models)
   considering lateral weathering derived matter fluxes should use data
   derived from different lithological source data sets with care.}},

Abstract = {{Increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is one of the central
   mechanisms that lead to dysregulated metabolic homeostasis in obesity.
   It is thus crucial to understand the underpinnings of the mechanisms
   that lead to the development of ER stress. A high level of ER Ca2+ is
   imperative for maintenance of normal ER function and this high
   Ca(2+)concentration of ER is maintained by sarco(endo) plasmic reticulum
   Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). Here, we show that SERCA2b protein and mRNA levels
   are dramatically reduced in the liver of obese mice and restoration of
   SERCA2b in the liver of obese and diabetic mice alleviates ER stress,
   increases glucose tolerance, and significantly reduces the blood glucose
   levels. Furthermore, overexpression of SERCA2b in the liver of obese
   mice significantly reduces the lipogenic gene expression and the
   triglyceride content in the liver. Our results document the importance
   of SERCA2b in dysregulated glucose and lipid homeostasis in the liver of
   obese mice and suggest development of drugs to increase SERCA2b activity
   for treatment of type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.}},

Abstract = {{The tumor suppressor p53 is a master sensor of stress, and
   post-translational modifications are key in controlling its stability
   and transcriptional activities. p53 can be phosphorylated on at least 23
   Ser/Thr residues, the majority of which are phosphorylated by
   stress-related kinases. An exception is Ser315 in human p53 (Ser312 in
   mouse), which is predominantly phosphorylated by cell cycle-related
   kinases. To understand the biological importance of Ser312
   phosphorylation in vivo, we generated p53Ser312Ala knock-in mice. We
   show here that, although Ser312 is not essential for mouse life span
   under normal physiological conditions, Ser312Ala mutation dampens p53's
   activity during embryonic development. This is evident from its partial
   rescue of embryonic lethality caused by Mdm4 deletion. In agreement with
   the notion that Ser312 mutation weakens p53 function, Ser312Ala mice are
   also more susceptible to tumorigenesis following a sublethal ionizing
   radiation dose. Importantly, in the cohort studied, Ser312 mutation
   predisposes mice to develop thymic lymphomas and liver tumors, partly
   due to p53Ser312Ala's inability to fully induce a set of p53 target
   genes including p21 and cyclin G1. Thus, we demonstrate that
   phosphorylation of Ser312 is required for p53 to function fully as a
   tumor suppressor in vivo.}},

Title = {{Missing links in earthquake clustering models}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{{[}1] Many clustering models imply two kinds of earthquakes: spontaneous
   ones and those triggered by previous earthquakes. The pair-wise links
   from earlier to later earthquakes control the estimates of the
   clustering parameters. However, earthquake catalogs are limited in time,
   space, and magnitude, so that triggers of some cataloged earthquakes may
   be unknown. Thus some links are unrecognized and some triggered events
   appear spontaneous. Here we present a method for identifying such
   earthquakes and reducing the bias from missing links. We treat
   earthquakes probably affected by missing links as potential triggers,
   but we exclude them in evaluating modeled effects. We use an
   Epidemic-type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model to examine specifics. The
   most affected parameter is the proportion of spontaneous earthquakes.
   The most important missing links apparently follow earthquakes below the
   magnitude threshold, before the start, and outside the spatial
   boundaries of the catalog, in that order. Citation: Wang, Q., D. D.

Abstract = {{Properdin is a plasma protein and is also released from neutrophil
   granules following stimulation. At inflammatory sites it can bind
   bacteria and apoptotic bodies to trigger alternative pathway (AP)
   activation. Principles governing properdin homeostasis are unknown. We
   monitored properdin during AP activation and in complement-deficient
   mice. There was a > 90\% reduction of properdin in the Crry
   single-knockout mice (Crry SKO). These membrane complement regulatory
   protein-deficient mice feature accelerated AP turnover, leading to
   reduced C3 and fB. Injecting cobra venom factor into wild-type mice
   activated the AP and led to the consumption of C3, fB, and properdin.
   However, and unexpectedly, properdin was also deficient in C3(-/-),
   fB(-/-), and fD(-/-) mice. It was present in C1q(-/-), C4(-/-), and
   C5(-/-) mice. These findings implicate AP turnover in the maintenance of
   basal levels of properdin in the blood. To explore the mechanism,
   classical pathway-activating immune complexes were infused. Within 10
   min, properdin was partially restored in fB(-/-) but not in C3(-/-)
   mice. Markedly reduced properdin in mice deficient in an AP component
   and its partial restoration by activating C3 suggest a requirement for
   continuous C3 activation via AP tickover to maintain properdin
   homeostasis. The mechanism underlying this C3-dependent process was not
   identified. Engagement of C3a and C5a receptors was ruled out. These
   findings represent an instructive example of how a positive regulator of
   an innate immune recognition and effector pathway is controlled. A
   rationale for such a means to supply properdin for immune reactions is
   proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Decays of b hadrons into final states containing a D-0 meson and a muon
   are used to measure the b (b) over bar; production cross-section in
   proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV at the LHC.
   In the pseudorapidity interval 2 < eta < 6 and integrated over all
   transverse momenta we find that the average cross-section to produce
   b-flavoured or (b) over bar -flavoured hadrons is (75.3 +/- 5.4 +/-
   13.0) mu b. (C) 2010 CERN. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Experimental modal substructuring to couple and uncouple substructures
   with flexible fixtures and multi-point connections}},

Abstract = {{Modal substructuring or component mode synthesis (CMS) has been standard
   practice for many decades in the analytical realm, yet a number of
   significant difficulties have been encountered when attempting to
   combine experimentally derived modal models with analytical ones or when
   predicting the effect of structural modifications using experimental
   measurements. This work presents a new method that removes the effects
   of a flexible fixture from an experimentally obtained modal model. It
   can be viewed as an extension to the approach where rigid masses are
   removed from a structure. The approach presented here improves the modal
   basis of the substructure, so that it can be used to more accurately
   estimate the modal parameters of the built-up system. New types of
   constraints are also presented, which constrain the modal degrees of
   freedom of the substructures, avoiding the need to estimate the
   connection point displacements and rotations. These constraints together
   with the use of a flexible fixture enable a new approach for joining
   structures, especially those with statically indeterminate multi-point
   connections, such as two circular flanges that are joined by many more
   bolts than required to enforce compatibility if the substructures were
   rigid. Fixture design is discussed, one objective of which is to achieve
   a mass-loaded boundary condition that exercises the substructure at the
   connection point as it is in the built up system. The proposed approach
   is demonstrated with two examples using experimental measurements from
   laboratory systems. The first is a simple problem of joining two beams
   of differing lengths, while the second consists of a three-dimensional
   structure comprising a circular plate that is bolted at eight locations
   to a flange on a cylindrical structure. In both cases frequency response
   functions predicted by the substructuring methods agree well with those
   of the actual coupled structures over a significant range of
   frequencies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Klebang Besar waters are one of the main fishing grounds for A.
   japonicus in the Peninsular Malaysia. The overall annual sex ratio was
   found to be 1:1.46 (males:females). The spawning season was March to
   July with peak in May, however there was also some spawning in October
   to November. The female attained sexual maturity at a minimum size of
   17.5 mm total length. The matured and near to spawn stages (II and III)
   occurred more than 50\% in every month except in August. Therefore, it
   may be inferred that A. japonicus breeds continuously throughout the
   year in the coastal waters of Malacca, Peninsular Malaysia.}},

   1,4-dihydro-1,4-dimethyl-2,3,5,6-tetrakis-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-1,4-diar
   sinine (cis-DHDAtBu)(2) which was prepared by the radical reaction of
   pentamethylcyclopentaarsine (cyclo-(MeAs)(5)) and di-tert-butyl
   acetylenedicarboxylate, were obtained individually as only products by
   stoichiometric addition of cis-bis(benzonitrile)dichloroplatinum to
   cis-DHDAtBu. Replacement of chloride with iodide by adding KI into
   acetone solutions of trans-PtCl2(cis-DHDAtBu)(2) and
   trans,trans-Pt2Cl2(cis-DHDAtBu)(2) gave trans-PtI2(cis-DHDAtRu)(2) and
   trans,trans-Pt2I4(cis-DHDAtBu)(2), respectively. The structures of all
   the obtained compounds were confirmed by H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra, X-ray
   crystallography, and elemental analysis. The interior angles around the
   arsenic and the As C=C bond angle were significantly varied in a series
   of the present platinum(II) complexes. These observations suggest that
   the flexibility of the bond angles around the arsenic center is an
   inherent property in the present organoarsenic compounds. The
   intermetallic interaction was induced in the dinuclear platinum(II)
   ``face-to-face{''} complex using cis-DHDAtBu by the replacement of
   chloride with iodide. The distance of the Pt-Pt of
   trans,trans-Pt2I4-(cis-DHDAtBu)(2) was shortened compared with that of
   trans,tran,c-Pt2Cl4(cis-DHDAtBu)(2), and the new broad absorption band
   at around 562 nm was observed in the solution of
   trans,trans-Pt2I4(cis-DHDAtBu)(2). Density functional theory
   calculations indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals in
   trans,trons-Pt2Cl4(cis-DHDAOH)(2) in which H atom surrogates were used
   in place of the tBu group, show no d-d interaction orbitals. On the
   other hand, the HOMO level in trons,troar-Pt2I4-(cis-DHDAOH)(2) has
   mainly d(xz) contributions in the pi{*}-antibonding MO.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical method was developed for the determination of thiols in
   biological samples. Reverse phase chromatography coupled to ICP
   quaduropole MS or Orbitrap MS was employed for the separation and
   detection of thiols. For the determination of total thiols, oxidized
   thiols were reduced using dithiothreitol (DTT). Reduction efficiencies
   for species of interest were found to be close to 100\%. Reduced thiols
   were derivatized by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (PHMB) and then separated
   on a C8 column. Optimization of the extraction, separation and detection
   steps of the HPLC-ICP-MS and HPLC-Orbitrap MS methods was carried out.
   Detection limits for cysteine, homocysteine, selenocysteine,
   glutathione, selenomethionine and cysteinyl-glycine were found to be
   18,34,39,12,128 and 103 fmol, respectively, using HPLC-Orbitrap MS and
   730, 1110, 440, 1110 and 580 fmol for cysteine, homocysteine,
   selenocysteine, glutathione, and cysteinyl-glycine using HPLC-ICP-MS.
   Contrary to expectation, the LODs and RSDs are higher for the
   HPLC-ICP-MS instrument, therefore HPLC-Orbitrap MS was used for the
   determination of thiols in yeast samples. Three different brands of
   baker's yeast and a selenized yeast were analyzed. The GSH and cysteine
   levels found in these samples ranged from 4.45 to 17.87 mu mol g(-1) and
   0.61 to 1.32 mu mol g(-1), respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The performance of a 1040 nm vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting
   laser is studied as function of the size and shape of the pumped area.
   The input-output characteristics of the device are monitored while
   simultaneously tracking the temperature in the active region. It is
   shown that the pump spot shape plays a crucial role in optimizing the
   laser output. Improvements up to a factor of 5 are found for a
   super-Gaussian in comparison to the standard Gaussian shape. For the
   large pump-spot sizes needed for high output powers, it turns out that
   the power-scalability breaks down due to the suppressed lateral heat
   flow. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics. {[}doi:10.1063/1.3515911]}},

Title = {{Neurotrophins and neurotrophin receptors in pulmonary sarcoidosis -
   granulomas as a source of expression}},
Journal = {{RESPIRATORY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pulmonary sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease,
   characterized by an accumulation of CD4(+) lymphocytes and the formation
   of non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas in the lungs. The disease
   either resolves spontaneously or develops into a chronic disease with
   fibrosis. The neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived
   neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) have been suggested
   to be important mediators of inflammation and mediate tissue
   remodelling. In support of this, we have recently reported enhanced NGF
   levels in the airways of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. However,
   less is known about levels of BDNF and NT-3, and moreover, knowledge in
   the cellular sources of neurotrophins and the distribution of the
   corresponding neurotrophin receptors in airway tissue in sarcoidosis is
   lacking.
   Methods: The concentrations of NGF, BDNF and NT-3 in bronchoalveolar
   lavage fluid (BALF) of 41 patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary
   sarcoidosis and 27 healthy controls were determined with ELISA. The
   localization of neurotrophins and neurotrophin receptors were examined
   by immunohistochemistry on transbronchial lung biopsies from sarcoidosis
   patients.
   Results: The sarcoidosis patients showed significantly enhanced NT-3 and
   NGF levels in BALF, whereas BDNF was undetectable in both patients and
   controls. NT-3 levels in BALF were found higher in patients with
   non-Lofgren sarcoidosis as compared to patients with Lofgren's syndrome,
   and in more advanced disease stage. Epithelioid cells and multinucleated
   giant cells within the sarcoid granulomas showed marked immunoreactivity
   for NGF, BDNF and NT-3. Also, immunoreactivity for the neurotrophin
   receptor TrkA, TrkB and TrkC, was found within the granulomas. In
   addition, alveolar macrophages showed positive immunoreactivity for NGF,
   BDNF and NT-3 as well as for TrkA, TrkB and TrkC.
   Conclusions: This study provides evidence of enhanced neurotrophin
   levels locally within the airways of patients with sarcoidosis. Findings
   suggest that sarcoid granuloma cells and alveolar macrophages are
   possible cellular sources of, as well as targets for, neurotrophins in
   the airways of these patients.}},

   positioning and scaling of static light-sheets, Gaussian beams and
   Bessel beams. The comparison of images from identical sample areas
   illuminated by different beams allows a precise assessment of the
   interconnection between beam shape and image quality. The superior

Abstract = {{An on-farm experiment was conducted in Zanyokwe irrigation scheme to
   investigate the effects of row spacing (45 and 90 cm) and atrazine
   dosage (33, 67 and 100\% of the label recommended dosage) on weed
   density and biomass and on maize yield. Overall percent kill of weeds
   increased with increase in atrazine dosage and with reduction in row

   of broad leaf weeds such as Amaranthus hybridus, Nicandra physaloides
   and Bidens pilosa regardless of herbicide dosage while Digitaria
   sanguinalis, Cyperus esculentus, Cynodon dactylon and Oxalis latifolia
   could not be controlled even at the LRD. Weed density at maize
   physiological maturity decreased by 11\% when row spacing was decreased
   from 90 to 45 cm. Atrazine dosage and row spacing did not have
   significant interactive effects and their main effects did not
   significantly affect weight of green cobs, cob length or grain yield.
   The study demonstrated the possibility of incorporation of reduced

Abstract = {{The distribution of pyrethroid insecticides of the Ebro River Delta (NE
   Spain) was assessed by measuring concentrations in surface water and
   sediment samples. Pyrethroid extraction from water was carried out by
   ultrasound-assisted emulsification-extraction (UAEE), while the sediment
   was sonicated and cleaned up using Florisil cartridge. Method detection
   of limits (MLODs) for the 12 pyrethroids analyzed by gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometer in negative chemical ionization
   (GC-NCI-MS) ranged from 0.03 to 35.8 ng L-1 for water and 2.6 to 62.4 pg
   g(-1) for sediment. Recoveries values were in the range of 47-105\% for
   water and 51-105\% for sediments, showing satisfactory robustness of the
   method for analyzing pyrethroids in water and sediment samples.
   Cypermethrin was detected in 22 water samples collected from Ebro River
   Delta, while deltamethrin was present only in three water samples at
   concentrations ranging from 0.73 ng L-1 to 57.2 ng L-1 and 2 ng L-1 to
   58.8 ng L-1 for cypermethrin and deltamethrin, respectively. These
   concentration levels were higher than median lethal concentration (LC50)
   values found for deltamethrin and lower than LC50 values found for
   cypermethrin when short time toxic effects are considered. In sediment
   samples only cypermethrin was detected at concentration levels ranged
   from 8.27 ng g(-1) to 71.9 ng g(-1). These levels were higher than its
   LC50 values.
   Environmental dynamic behaviour and fate were also evaluated for
   cypermethrin measuring the sediment/water partition coefficient (ranging
   from 5.0 to 6.3) and kinetic data (half-life ranging between 13 and 50
   days). Results were in good agreement to those reported in literature

Abstract = {{Quantum chemical calculations using gradient-corrected DFT at the

   {[}Fe(CO)(4)(GaX)] (X = F-I) and for {[}Fe(CO)(5)] and
   {[}Fe(CO)](4)(N-2)]. The nature of the metal-ligand bond has been
   investigated with an energy decomposition analysis. The Fe-GaX bonds in
   {[}Fe(CO)(4)(GaX)] have rather high bond dissociation energies that are
   smaller than the BDE of {[}Fe(CO)(5)] but larger than the BDE of
   {[}Fe(CO)](4)(N-2)]. The axial isomer of {[}Fe(CO)(4)(GaF)] is predicted
   to be slightly more stable than the equatorial form, while the
   equatorial isomers of the heavier halogen systems {[}Fe(CO)(4)(GaX)] (X
   = Cl-I) are a bit lower in energy than the axial form. The energy
   difference between the two isomers is for all gallium complexes
   {[}Fe(CO)(4)(GaX)] smaller than 1.0 kcal/mol. The ratio of covalent
   bonding and electrostatic attraction in the (CO)(4)Fe-GaX bonds is very
   similar to the values that are calculated for the (CO)(4)Fe-CO and
   (CO)(4){[}Fe-N-2 bonds. The analysis of the bonding situation reveals
   that the sigma-donation of the ligands GaX is much stronger than the
   pi-back-donation, while the (CO)(4)Fe-CO and (CO)(4)Fe-N-2 bonds possess
   equally strong contributions from sigma-donation and pi-back-donation.

Abstract = {{Catastrophic flooding in coastal areas is an ongoing problem that may be
   aggravated by projected sea-level rise. We present a method of flood
   protection called SIRGE (solid injection for raising ground elevation),
   where the ground surface is raised by injecting sediment-laden slurry
   into hydraulic fractures at shallow depths. The injection process is
   repeated at adjacent locations to create a network of sub-horizontal,
   overlapping injections of solid material (hydraulic fractures). We argue
   that injecting sediment over large lateral distances would cause a
   lasting surface uplift that scales with the thickness of injected
   sediment at depth. We support this concept by an analysis showing that,
   in contrast to hydraulic fractures in petroleum reservoirs, hydraulic
   fractures in soft, shallow formations would typically grow in the
   toughness-dominated regime. It appears that the SIRGE process could be
   implemented to lift ground elevations in places such as Venice or New
   Orleans. Experimental and geological examples indicate that hydraulic
   fractures of suitable orientation and size can be created in areas with
   appropriate in situ stresses.}},

Abstract = {{A titanium dibenzyl complex featuring a ligand with two phenolates
   linked by a benzene-1.3-diyl group was found to undergo thermal
   decomposition to give toluene and a cyclometalated dimeric complex. The
   thermal decomposition followed first-order kinetics and was studied at a
   number of temperatures to determine the activation parameters (Delta
   H-double dagger = 27.2(5) kcal/mol and Delta S-double dagger = -6.2(14)
   cal/(mol K)). Deuterated isotopologues were synthesized to measure the
   kinetic isotope effects. The complexes with deuterium in the benzyl
   methylene positions decomposed more slowly than the protio analogues.
   Isotopologues of toluene with multiple deuteration positions were
   observed in the product mixtures. These data are consistent with
   competing alpha-abstraction and sigma-bond metathesis.}},

   to maximize the efficiency for one direction or to balance it for both
   directions. Power conversion efficiency close to that of conventional
   opaque OPV cells is demonstrated in semitransparent cells for the ITO
   side illumination by taking advantage of the internal reflection

Title = {{Risk factors for acute kidney injury following orthotopic liver
   transplantation: the impact of changes in renal function while patients
   await transplantation}},
Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs commonly in the setting of
   orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). To date, the correlation between
   AKI post-OLT and pre-operative changes in renal function has not been
   rigorously examined.
   Methods: To determine the impact of pre-OLT changes in renal function on
   AKI post-OLT, as well as to identify risk factors for AKI, we analyzed
   the prospectively maintained NIDDK Liver Transplantation Database, which
   includes patients who received their first OLT between April 15, 1990,
   and June 30, 1994. We used the AKI Network definition of AKI.
   Results: Surprisingly, univariate analysis revealed that worsening renal
   function while awaiting OLT was protective to the development of AKI
   post-OLT. Independent predictors of AKI were increased body mass index,
   increased Childs-Pugh-Turcott score, decreased urine output during
   cross-clamp, improved renal function while awaiting OLT, increased
   post-operative stroke volume, non-Caucasian race, and post-operative use
   of tacrolimus.
   Conclusions: The correlation between improving renal function pre-OLT
   and AKI post-OLT may represent true protection (via ischemic
   pre-conditioning) or, alternatively, a masking of milder forms of AKI
   (via improved renal perfusion through correction of the cirrhotic
   milieu). These results highlight the complex interaction between liver
   and kidney disease, and suggest that not only the etiology but also the
   course of pre-OLT renal dysfunction may be a critical determinant of
   renal function post-OLT.}},

Abstract = {{A series of bis(ureate) zirconium complexes bearing reactive alkyl
   ligands have been prepared and fully characterized. A sterically
   demanding, nontethered ureate ligand was successfully employed in the
   synthesis of a dibenzyl complex; however synthesis can be complicated by
   suspected ligand disproportionation and redistribution. In contrast,
   tethered bis(ureate) ligands, including a chiral, C-2-symmetric ligand,
   are reliable supports for sterically accessible, mononuclear dibenzyl
   and bis(neopentyl) complexes. These coordinatively unsaturated species
   react with pyridine to form seven-coordinate adducts that exhibit
   remarkable thermal and photochemical stability. The reactive nature of
   the dibenzyl derivative can be exploited in the synthesis of imido
   complexes via protonolysis with 2,6-diisopropylaniline. A monometallic
   imido, supported by a sterically open ureate ligand, can be prepared in
   this manner with the use of excess pyridine; however, NMR spectroscopy
   indicates that this species undergoes dimerization in solution. When the
   reaction is performed in the absence of pyridine, only the dimeric
   complex is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{A poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) conjugate of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine
   (AZT, zidovudine) was designed and synthesized as a novel
   sustained-release prodrug. In the synthetic process, a succinate diester
   spacer was used to covalently couple AZT with methoxy poly(ethylene
   glycol) (mPEG; MW = 2000). The conjugate was characterized by Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR) and NMR spectroscopies and matrix-assisted
   laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry
   (MS). The in vitro release was determined in hydrochloride (HCl)
   solution (pH 1.2) and phosphate-buffered solution (PBS; pH 6.8), which
   showed the release rate of AZT from the conjugate was slower than that
   from the free drug, suggesting its possible increased retention in
   gastrointestinal conditions. Pharmacokinetic properties were evaluated
   experimentally by oral administration in mice. Compared to free AZT, the
   absorption half-life (t(1/2ka)) and elimination half life (t(1/2 beta))
   of AZT released from the conjugate were both extended to 0.51 +/- 0.03 h
   (p < 0.01) and 2.94 +/- 0.24 h (p < 0.01), respectively. Evaluation of
   the in vitro anti-HIV activities showed mPEG-AZT exhibited good
   inhibition of HIV-1, with an EC50 value of 0.0634 mu m, but it is lower
   than that of free AZT. These results show that the conjugate is capable
   of releasing the parent drug in a sustained profile, potentially
   providing a feasible alternative to oral administration of AZT in a
   clinical setting.}},

Abstract = {{Excitonic effects of metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes are
   measured with temperature-dependent resonant Raman spectroscopy. By
   changing the temperature in the range of 300-870 K, we observe
   variations in the optical transition energy E(ii) as well as in the
   maximum Raman intensity. We find both dependences to be different for
   semiconducting and metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes. We suggest
   an interpretation in terms of excitons dissociated into free
   electron-hole pairs at temperatures related to the exciton binding
   energy. We furthermore discuss how the oscillator strength is influenced
   by temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Miscible viscous fingering classically occurs when a less viscous fluid
   displaces a miscible more viscous one in a porous medium. We analyze
   here how double diffusive effects between a slow diffusing S and a fast
   diffusing F component, both influencing the viscosity of the fluids at
   hand, affect such fingering, and, most importantly, can destabilize the
   classically stable situation of a more viscous fluid displacing a less
   viscous one. Various instability scenarios are classified in a parameter
   space spanned by the log-mobility ratios R(s) and R(f) of the slow and
   fast component, respectively, and parametrized by the ratio of diffusion
   coefficients delta. Numerical simulations of the full nonlinear problem
   confirm the existence of the predicted instability scenarios and
   highlight the influence of differential diffusion effects on the
   nonlinear fingering dynamics.}},

Title = {{Conduit enlargement in an eogenetic karst aquifer}},

Abstract = {{Most concepts of conduit development have focused on telogenetic karst
   aquifers, where low matrix permeability focuses flow and dissolution
   along joints, fractures, and bedding planes. However, conduits also
   exist in eogenetic karst aquifers, despite high matrix permeability
   which accounts for a significant component of flow. This study
   investigates dissolution within a 6-km long conduit system in the
   eogenetic Upper Floridan aquifer of north-central Florida that begins
   with a continuous source of allogenic recharge at the Santa Fe River
   Sink and discharges from a first-magnitude spring at the Santa Fe River
   Rise. Three sources of water to the conduit include the allogenic
   recharge, diffuse recharge through epikarst, and mineralized water
   upwelling from depth. Results of sampling and inverse modeling using
   PHREEQC suggest that dissolution within the conduit is episodic,
   occurring only during 30\% of 16 sampling times between March 2003 and
   April 2007. During low flow conditions, carbonate saturated water flows
   from the matrix to the conduit, restricting contact between
   undersaturated allogenic water with the conduit wall. When gradients
   reverse during high flow conditions, undersaturated allogenic recharge
   enters the matrix. During these limited periods, estimates of
   dissolution within the conduit suggest wall retreat averages about 4 x
   10(-6) m/day, in agreement with upper estimates of maximum wall retreat
   for telogenetic karst. Because dissolution is episodic, time-averaged
   dissolution rates in the sink-rise system results in a wall retreat rate
   of about 7 x 10(-7) m/day, which is at the lower end of wall retreat for
   telogenetic karst. Because of the high permeability matrix, conduits in
   eogenetic karst thus enlarge not just at the walls of fractures or
   pre-existing conduits such as those in telogenetic karst, but also may
   produce a friable halo surrounding the conduits that may be removed by
   additional mechanical processes. These observations stress the
   importance of matrix permeability in eogenetic karst and suggest new
   concepts may be necessary to describe how conduits develop within these
   porous rocks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nearly 20-30\% of all process control loops oscillate due to stiction
   resulting in productivity losses. Thus, detection and quantification of
   stiction in control valves using routine operating data is an important
   component of any automated controller performance monitoring
   application. Many techniques have been proposed for the detection and
   quantification of stiction. However, most of the approaches assume that
   the underlying process is linear; very little work is available for
   nonlinear processes. In this paper, Volterra model-based technique is
   investigated for the detection of stiction in closed-loop nonlinear
   systems. The advantages of the proposed method are: (i) it can be used
   to detect stiction in nonlinear systems and (ii) requires no prior
   information on whether the loop is linear or nonlinear. Results obtained
   from simulation and industrial case studies demonstrate the utility of
   the proposed methodology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The response of coastal aquifers to sea-level fluctuations, notably
   tides, is known to contain much information about hydraulic parameters.
   We performed sensitivity analyses to assess how much, about what and
   where this information can be best obtained. It is well known that the
   response to harmonic fluctuations (and many harmonics can be
   superimposed to describe sea-level fluctuations) decreases exponentially
   with distance inland. The characteristic length of this decay is L-c =
   root DP/pi, where D is hydraulic diffusivity and P is period. Maximum
   sensitivity is obtained for distances equal to L. which is where maximum
   information would be obtained if the aquifer is treated as homogeneous.
   However, sensitivity depends not only on the problem dynamics, but also
   on parameterization. In fact, if heterogeneity is acknowledged by finely
   discretizing hydraulic conductivity, we find that connection to the sea
   (i.e. K near the coast) is what can be characterized best, while the
   most informative measurements are located at around 0.5 L-c. Thin low
   conductivity zones near the coast lead to a stepwise decrease in the
   amplitude of groundwater head fluctuations. We find that the
   fluctuations are independent of buoyancy effects, so that they can be
   simulated by constant density codes. High information content and ease
   of use suggest that they should be helpful in characterizing the
   aquifer-sea connection, which is important for coastal aquifer
   protection against seawater intrusion. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{The three-body problem is reexamined in the framework of general
   relativity. The Newtonian three-body problem admits Euler's collinear
   solution, where three bodies move around the common center of mass with
   the same orbital period and always line up. The solution is unstable.
   Hence, it is unlikely that such a simple configuration would exist owing
   to general relativistic forces dependent not only on the masses but also
   on the velocity of each body. However, we show that the collinear
   solution remains true with a correction to the spatial separation
   between masses. Relativistic corrections to the Sun-Jupiter Lagrange
   points L-1, L-2, and L-3 are also evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of
   polymorphism in adiponectin gene on meat quality traits, serum total
   cholesterol, serum triglyceride and abdominal fat of 170 individuals
   from Cherry Valley duck (CV), Jinding duck (JD) and Hybrid duck (CV x
   JD) (HB) populations. PCR-SSCP technique was developed to analyze a 230
   bp region of the adiponectin gene exon 1. Three genotypes (CC, CD and
   DD), which were the products of two alleles (C and D) were observed.
   Alignment sequences' results showed that four SNPs (C86T, C104T, C146T
   and C155T) were found and all of those nucleotide variations were
   nonsense mutations. Association analysis indicated that all of these
   traits had significant population effects except meat colour (P < 0.05)
   and then the birds with homozygote (CC) had significant lower than
   homozygotes (DD) for IMF, water holding capacity and abdominal fat (P <
   0.05). The research suggested that genotype DD may be an advantage
   genotype for fat deposition in duck. The adiponectin gene exon 1
   polymorphism could be used in marker assistant selection (MAS) as a
   genetic marker for the birds' fat deposition.}},

   anharmonic OH vibrations at 300 K}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{133}},

Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{The anharmonic OH stretching vibrational frequencies, nu(OH), for the
   first-shell water molecules around the Li+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Al3+ ions in
   dilute aqueous solutions have been calculated based on classical
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum-mechanical (QM)
   calculations. For Li+(aq), Ca2+(aq), Mg2+(aq), and Al3+(aq), our
   calculated IR frequency shifts, Delta nu(OH), with respect to the
   gas-phase water frequency, are about -300, -350, -450, and -750 cm(-1),
   compared to -290, -290, -420, and -830 cm(-1) from experimental infrared
   (IR) studies. The agreement is thus quite good, except for the order
   between Li+ and Ca2+. Given that the polarizing field from the Ca2+ ion
   ought to be larger than that from Li+(aq), our calculated result seems
   reasonable. Also the absolute OH frequencies agree well with experiment.
   The method we used is a sequential four-step procedure: QM(electronic)
   to make a force field+MD simulation +QM(electronic) for
   point-charge-embedded Mn+ (H2O)(x)(first shell) (H2O)(y)(second shell)
   (H2O)(z)(third shell) clusters+QM(vibrational) to yield the OH spectrum.
   The many-body Ca2+-water force-field presented in this paper is new. IR
   intensity-weighting of the density-of-states frequency distributions was
   carried out by means of the squared dipole moment derivatives. (C) 2010

Title = {{Digital gene expression tag profiling of bat digits provides robust
   candidates contributing to wing formation}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: As the only truly flying mammals, bats use their unique wing
   - consisting of four elongated digits (digits II-V) connected by
   membranes - to power their flight. In addition to the elongated digits
   II-V, the forelimb contains one shorter digit (digit I) that is
   morphologically similar to the hindlimb digits. Here, we capitalized on
   the morphological variation among the bat forelimb digits to investigate
   the molecular mechanisms underlying digit elongation and wing formation.
   Using next generation sequencing technology, we performed digital gene
   expression tag profiling (DGE-tag profiling) of developing digits in a
   pooled sample of two Myotis ricketti and validated our sequencing
   results using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) of gene expression in
   the developing digits of two Hipposideros armiger.
   Results: Among hundreds of genes exhibiting significant differences in
   expression between the short and long digits, we highlight 14 genes most
   related to digit elongation. These genes include two Tbx genes (Tbx3 and
   Tbx15), five BMP pathway genes (Bmp3, RGMB, Smad1, Smad4 and Nog), four
   Homeobox genes (Hoxd8, Hoxd9, Hoxa1 and Satb1), and three other genes
   (Twist1, Tmeff2 and Enpp2) related to digit malformations or cell
   proliferation. In addition, our results suggest that Tbx4 and Pitx2
   contribute to the morphological similarity and five genes (Acta1, Tnnc2,
   Atp2a1, Hrc and Myoz1) contribute to the functional similarity between
   the thumb and hindlimb digits.
   Conclusions: Results of this study not only implicate many developmental
   genes as robust candidates underlying digit elongation and wing
   formation in bats, but also provide a better understanding of the genes
   involved in autopodial development in general.}},

Title = {{Quantification of regional calcium burden in chronic total occlusion by

Volume = {{145}},

Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: One of the most important reasons for failure of
   percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in chronic total occlusion
   (CTO) is calcified plaque, which either prevents passage of guide wire
   or ruptures after balloon inflation. We sought to evaluate whether
   quantified calcium contents of CTO on multi-detector computed tomography
   (MDCT) correlate with immediate procedural outcomes.
   Methods: Sixty-four patients with 72 CTO lesions who underwent 64-slice
   MDCT prior to PCI were investigated. The lesions were divided into 2
   groups according to procedural outcomes (55 lesions with PCI-success
   group, 17 lesions with PCI-failure group). Clinical, angiographic and
   MDCT parameters, including regional calcium volume (RCaV), regional
   calcium score (RCaS), regional calcium equivalent mass (RCaEq), and
   relative calcium area at the most calcified cross section of CTO
   (\%CaS/CSA), were compared between the two groups.
   Results: The duration of CTO was shorter in PCI-success group than
   PCI-failure group (7.16 +/- 10.5 vs 15.59 +/- 14.92 months, p = 0.011),
   and the procedural success rate was 76.3\%. Regional calcium-related
   parameters (RCaV 52.86 +/- 58.39 vs 7.26 +/- 15.27 mm(3), p<0.001; RCaS
   72.71 +/- 78.4 vs 9.66 +/- 20.2, p<0.001; RCaEq 12.58 +/- 12.97 vs 1.84
   +/- 3.716 mgCaHA, p<0.001; \%CaS/CSA 53.9 +/- 20.3 vs 30.4 +/- 17.1\%, p
   = 0.009) in the occluded segment were higher and the occlusion length
   was longer (37.44 +/- 27.48 vs 22.00 +/- 18.04 mm, p<0.021) in
   PCI-failure group compared to PCI-success group. Multivariate regression
   analysis showed that only \%CaS/CSA was a significant determinant of
   PCI-failure.
   Conclusions: Precise quantification of regional calcification and
   measurement of the occluded segment by high resolution MDCT can deliver
   important information for predicting procedural outcomes in PCI of CTO.

Abstract = {{In inside-out bovine heart sarcolemmal vesicles,
   p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (PCMBS) and n-ethylmaleimide (NEM) fully
   inhibited MgATP up-regulation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1) and
   abolished the MgATP-dependent PtdIns-4,5P2 increase in the
   NCX1-PtdIns-4,5P2 complex; in addition, these compounds markedly reduced
   the activity of the PtdIns(4)-5kinase. After PCMBS or NEM treatment,
   addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) restored a large fraction of the MgATP
   stimulation of the exchange fluxes and almost fully restored
   PtdIns(4)-5kinase activity; however, in contrast to PCMBS, the effects
   of NEM did not seem related to the alkylation of protein SH groups. By
   itself DTT had no effect on the synthesis of PtdIns-4,5P2 but affected
   MgATP stimulation of NCX1: moderate inhibition at 1 mM MgATP and 1 mu M
   Ca2+ and full inhibition at 0.25 mM MgATP and 0.2 mu M Ca2+. In
   addition, DDT prevented coimmunoprecipitation of NCX1 and
   PtdIns(4)-5kinase. These results indicate that, for a proper MgATP
   up-regulation of NCX1, the enzyme responsible for PtdIns-4,5P2 synthesis
   must be (i) functionally competent and (ii) set in the NCX1
   microenvironment closely associated to the exchanger. This kind of
   supramolecular structure is needed to optimize binding of the newly
   synthesized PtdIns-4,5P2 to its target region in the exchanger protein.

Abstract = {{Mucus-secreting cells of the stomach epithelium provide a protective
   barrier against damage that might result from bacterial colonization or
   other stimuli. Impaired barrier function contributes to chronic
   inflammation and cancer. Knock-out mice for the epithelium-specific
   transcription factor Spdef (also called Pdef) have defects in terminal
   differentiation of intestinal and bronchial secretory cells. We sought
   to determine the physiologic function of Spdef in the stomach, another
   site of significant levels of Spdef expression. We used in situ
   hybridization and immunohistochemistry to localize Spdef-expressing
   cells in the mouse stomach; targeted gene disruption to generate mice
   lacking Spdef; and histologic, immunologic, and transcriptional
   profiling approaches to determine the requirements of Spdef in stomach
   epithelial homeostasis. In wild-type mice, Spdef RNA and protein are
   expressed predominantly in mucous gland cells of the antrum and in
   mucous neck cells of the glandular corpus. Within 1.5 years, nearly half
   of homozygous mutant mice developed profound mucosal hyperplasia of the
   gastric antrum. Submucosal infiltration of inflammatory cells preceded
   antral hyperplasia by several weeks. The absence of Spdef impaired
   terminal maturation of antral mucous gland cells, as reflected in
   reduced expression of Muc6 and Tff2 and reduced numbers of secretory
   granules. Antral gene expression abnormalities overlapped significantly
   with those in Spdef(-/-) colon, including genes implicated in secretory
   granule traffic and functions. Spdef is required for terminal maturation
   of antral mucous gland cells to protect animals from gastric
   inflammation and resulting hyperplasia. These requirements parallel
   Spdef functions in secretory intestinal cells and suggest a common
   molecular mechanism for maturation of gastrointestinal secretory
   lineages.}},

Pages = {{1341-1348}},

Abstract = {{The involvement of microorganisms in the initial stage of maturation of
   natural rubber coagula was assessed with five latex treatments that
   varied in the initial quantity of microorganisms; the treatments ranged
   from latex added with an antimicrobial agent (3.4 x 10(4) CFU/mL) to
   strongly inoculated latex (2.4 x 10(7) CFU/mL). After 0-6 days of
   maturation, the obtained rubber was characterized with respect to its
   physical and structural properties. The Wallace plasticity (P-0) and
   plasticity retention index (PRI) remained constant during maturation
   with the antibiotic-added treatment. PRI decreased with the maturation
   time, and the rate was proportional to the initial microorganism
   concentration. P-0 of all inoculated rubber increased for the first 2
   days of maturation and decreased after 6 days of maturation. With
   respect to structural parameters, a higher initial microorganism content
   corresponded to a higher gel content and a lower weight-average molar
   mass after maturation, drying, and storage. The inoculated rubber showed
   a stable value for the number-average molar mass (M), in contrast to the
   noninoculated samples, for which an increase in M during maturation was
   observed. The quantity of microorganisms significantly affected the
   physical properties and structure of the processed dry rubber. The
   mechanisms occurring during the initial stage of maturation are complex,

Abstract = {{We previously reported the identification of small serine/threonine
   kinase (SSTK) that is expressed in postmeiotic germ cells, associates
   with HSP90, and is indispensable for male fertility. Sperm from
   SSTK-null mice cannot fertilize eggs in vitro and are incapable of
   fusing with eggs that lack zona pellucida. Here, using the yeast
   two-hybrid screen, we have discovered a novel SSTK-interacting protein
   (SIP) that is expressed exclusively in testis. The gene encoding SIP is
   restricted to mammals and encodes a 125-amino acid polypeptide with a
   predicted tetratricopeptide repeat domain. SIP is co-localized with SSTK
   in the cytoplasm of spermatids as they undergo restructuring and
   chromatin condensation, but unlike SSTK, is not retained in the mature
   sperm. SIP binds to SSTK with high affinity (K-d similar to 10 nM), and
   the proteins associate with each other when co-expressed in cells. In
   vitro, SIP inhibited SSTK kinase activity, whereas the presence of SIP
   in cells resulted in enzymatic activation of SSTK without affecting Akt
   or MAPK activity. SIP was found to be associated with cellular HSP70,
   and analyses with purified proteins revealed that SIP directly bound
   HSP70. Importantly, SSTK recruited SIP onto HSP90, and treatment of
   cells with the specific HSP90 inhibitor,
   17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, completely abolished SSTK
   catalytic activity. Hence, these findings demonstrate that HSP90 is
   essential for functional maturation of the kinase and identify SIP as a
   cochaperone that is critical to the HSP90-mediated activation of SSTK.}},

   is challenged by matrix effects associated with the shellfish tissues In
   methods validation assessment of matrix interferences is imperative to
   ensure the validity and accuracy of results being produced Matrix
   Interferences for the analysis of okadaic acid (OA) and azaspiracid 1
   (AZA1) were assessed using acidic methods on electrospray triple stage
   quadrupole (TSQ) and hybrid quadrupole time of flight (QToF) instruments
   by the use of matrix matched standards for different tissue types Using
   an acidic method no matrix interference and suppression was observed on
   the TSQ for OA and AZA1 respectively whilst the opposite was observed on
   the QToF matrix enhancement for OA and no matrix interference for AZA1
   The suppression of AZAs on the TSQ was found to be due to interfering
   compounds being carried over from previous injections The degree of
   suppression is very much dependant on the tissue type ranging from 15 to
   70\% Several strategies were evaluated to eliminate these interferences
   including the partitioning of the extract with hexane optimisation of
   the chromatographic method and the use of on-line SPE Hexane clean up
   did not have any impact on matrix effects The use of an alkaline method
   and a modified acidic method eliminated matrix suppression for AZA1 on

Title = {{Remote sensing and inverse transport modeling of the Kasatochi eruption
   sulfur dioxide cloud}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{An analytical inversion method is used to estimate the vertical profile
   of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from the major 2008 eruption of
   Kasatochi Volcano, located on the Aleutian Arc, Alaska. The method uses
   satellite-observed total SO2 columns from the Global Ozone Monitoring
   Experiment-2 (GOME-2), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and
   Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) during the first 2 days after the
   eruption, and an atmospheric transport model, FLEXPART, to calculate the
   vertical emission profile. The inversion yields an emission profile with
   two large emission maxima near 7 km above sea level (asl) and around 12
   km asl, with smaller emissions up to 20 km. The total mass of SO2
   injected into the atmosphere by the eruption is estimated to 1.7 Tg,
   with similar to 1 Tg reaching the stratosphere (above 10 km asl). The
   estimated vertical emission profile is robust against changes of the
   assumed eruption time, meteorological input data, and satellite data
   used. Using the vertical emission profile, a simulation of the transport
   extending for 1 month after the eruption is performed. The simulated
   cloud agrees very well with SO2 columns observed byGOME-2, OMI, and AIRS
   until 6 days after the eruption, and the altitudes agree with both
   Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation
   measurements and ground-based lidar observations to within 1 km. The
   method is computationally very fast. It is therefore suitable for
   implementation within an operational environment, such as the Volcanic
   Ash Advisory Centers, to predict the threat posed by volcanic emissions
   for air traffic.}},

Title = {{Intense exercise training induces adaptation in expression and

Journal = {{CARDIOVASCULAR DIABETOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Informations about the effects of intense exercise training
   on diabetes-induced myocardial dysfunctions are lacking. We have
   examined the effects of intense exercise training on the cardiac
   function of diabetic rats, especially focusing on the Langendorff
   beta-adrenergic responsiveness and on the beta-adrenoceptors protein
   expression.
   Methods: Control or Streptozotocin induced-diabetic male Wistar rats
   were randomly assigned to sedentary or trained groups. The training
   program consisted of 8 weeks running on a treadmill (10 degrees incline,
   up to 25 m/min, 60 min/day) and was considered to be intense for
   diabetic rats.
   Results: This intense exercise training amplified the in vivo
   diabetes-induced bradycardia. It had no effect on Langendorff basal
   cardiac contraction and relaxation performances in control and diabetic
   rats. In diabetic rats, it accentuated the Langendorff reduced
   responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimulation. It did not blunt the
   diabetes-induced decrease of beta 1-adrenoceptors protein expression,
   displayed a significant decrease in the beta 2-adrenoceptors protein
   expression and normalized the beta 3-adrenoceptors protein expression.
   Conclusions: Intense exercise training accentuated the decrease in the
   myocardial responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimulation induced by
   diabetes. This defect stems principally from the beta 2-adrenoceptors
   protein expression reduction. Thus, these results demonstrate that
   intense exercise training induces specific effects on the
   beta-adrenergic system in diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of post-translational modifications of proteins in
   biological samples often requires access to preanalytical purification
   and concentration methods In the purification step high or low molecular
   weight substances can be removed by size exclusion filters and high
   abundant proteins can be removed or low abundant proteins can be
   enriched by specific capturing tools In this paper is described the
   experience and results obtained with a recently emerged and easy-to-use
   affinity purification kit for enrichment of the low amounts of EPO found
   in urine and plasma specimens The kit can be used as a pre-step in the
   EPO doping control procedure as an alternative to the commonly used
   ultrafiltration for detecting aberrantly glycosylated isoforms The
   commercially available affinity purification kit contains small
   disposable anti-EPO monolith columns (6 mu L volume theta 7 mm length 0
   15 mm) together with all required buffers A 24-channel vacuum manifold
   was used for simultaneous processing of samples The column concentrated
   EPO from 20 mL urine down to 55 mu L eluate with a concentration factor
   of 240 times while roughly 997\% of non-relevant urine proteins were
   removed The recoveries of Neorecormon (epoetin beta) and the EPO
   analogues Aranesp and Mircera applied to buffer were high 76\% 67\% and
   57\% respectively The recovery of endogenous EPO from human urine was
   65\% High recoveries were also obtained when purifying human mouse and
   equine EPO from serum and human EPO from cerebrospinal fluid Evaluation
   with the accredited EPO doping control method based on isoelectric
   focusing (IEF) showed that the affinity purification procedure did not
   change the isoform distribution for rhEPO Aranesp Mircera or endogenous
   EPO The kit should be particularly useful for applications in which it
   is essential to avoid carry-over effects a problem commonly encountered
   with conventional particle-based affinity columns The encouraging
   results with EPO propose that similar affinity monoliths with the
   appropriate antibodies should constitute useful tools for general
   applications in sample preparation not only for doping control of EPO
   and other hormones such as growth hormone and insulin but also for the
   study of post-translational modifications of other low abundance
   proteins in biological and clinical research and for sample preparation

Abstract = {{The packing of submicrometer sized silica beads inside a microchannel
   was enabled by a novel method which avoids the complication and
   limitations of generating a frit using conventional approaches and the
   restriction of flow using a submicrometer sized weir A micrometer sized
   weir and two short columns of 5 mu m and 800 nm silica beads packed in
   succession behind the weir together functioned as a high pressure frit
   to allow the construction of a primary packed bed of 390 nm silica beads
   This packed bed microchannel was tested as an EOF pump wherein it
   exhibited superior performance with regards to pressure tolerance i e
   sustaining good flow rate under extremely high back pressure and maximal
   pressure generation Under a modest applied electric field strength of
   150 V/cm the flow rate against a back pressure of 1200 psi (similar to
   83 MPa) was 40 nL/min and the maximal pressure reached 1470 psi (similar
   to 10 MPa) This work has demonstrated that it is possible to create a
   high performance packed bed microchannel EOF pump using nanometer sized
   silica beads as long as proper care is taken during the packing process
   to minimize the undesirable mixing of two different sized particles at
   the boundaries between particle segments and to maximize the packing
   density throughout the entire packed bed Published by Elsevier B V}},

   temperature on conductivity of the amphiphilic polymer electrolytes
   obeys the Arrhenius equation. The good room temperature conductivity of
   the polymer electrolytes is proposed to relate to the enhancement in the

Title = {{Increasing Incidence of Geomyces destructans Fungus in Bats from the

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: White-nose syndrome is a disease of hibernating
   insectivorous bats associated with the fungus Geomyces destructans. It
   first appeared in North America in 2006, where over a million bats died
   since then. In Europe, G. destructans was first identified in France in
   2009. Its distribution, infection dynamics, and effects on hibernating
   bats in Europe are largely unknown.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We screened hibernacula in the Czech
   Republic and Slovakia for the presence of the fungus during the winter
   seasons of 2008/2009 and 2009/2010. In winter 2009/2010, we found
   infected bats in 76 out of 98 surveyed sites, in which the majority had
   been previously negative. A photographic record of over 6000 hibernating
   bats, taken since 1994, revealed bats with fungal growths since 1995;
   however, the incidence of such bats increased in Myotis myotis from 2\%
   in 2007 to 14\% by 2010. Microscopic, cultivation and molecular genetic
   evaluations confirmed the identity of the recently sampled fungus as G.
   destructans, and demonstrated its continuous distribution in the studied
   area. At the end of the hibernation season we recorded pathologic
   changes in the skin of the affected bats, from which the fungus was
   isolated. We registered no mass mortality caused by the fungus, and the
   recorded population decline in the last two years of the most affected
   species, M. myotis, is within the population trend prediction interval.
   Conclusions/Significance: G. destructans was found to be widespread in
   the Czech Republic and Slovakia, with an epizootic incidence in bats
   during the most recent years. Further development of the situation
   urgently requires a detailed pan-European monitoring scheme.}},

Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{The gabbroic layer comprises the majority of ocean crust. Opportunities
   to sample this expansive crustal environment are rare because of the
   technological demands of deep ocean drilling; thus, gabbroic microbial
   communities have not yet been studied. During the Integrated Ocean
   Drilling Program Expeditions 304 and 305, igneous rock samples were
   collected from 0.45-1391.01 meters below seafloor at Hole 1309D, located
   on the Atlantis Massif (30 degrees N, 42 degrees W). Microbial diversity
   in the rocks was analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and
   sequencing (Expedition 304), and terminal restriction fragment length
   polymorphism, cloning and sequencing, and functional gene microarray
   analysis (Expedition 305). The gabbroic microbial community was
   relatively depauperate, consisting of a low diversity of proteobacterial
   lineages closely related to Bacteria from hydrocarbon-dominated
   environments and to known hydrocarbon degraders, and there was little
   evidence of Archaea. Functional gene diversity in the gabbroic samples
   was analyzed with a microarray for metabolic genes ({''}GeoChip{''}),
   producing further evidence of genomic potential for hydrocarbon
   degradation - genes for aerobic methane and toluene oxidation. Genes
   coding for anaerobic respirations, such as nitrate reduction, sulfate
   reduction, and metal reduction, as well as genes for carbon fixation,
   nitrogen fixation, and ammonium-oxidation, were also present. Our
   results suggest that the gabbroic layer hosts a microbial community that
   can degrade hydrocarbons and fix carbon and nitrogen, and has the
   potential to employ a diversity of non-oxygen electron acceptors. This
   rare glimpse of the gabbroic ecosystem provides further support for the
   recent finding of hydrocarbons in deep ocean gabbro from Hole 1309D. It
   has been hypothesized that these hydrocarbons might originate
   abiotically from serpentinization reactions that are occurring deep in
   the Earth's crust, raising the possibility that the lithic microbial
   community reported here might utilize carbon sources produced
   independently of the surface biosphere.}},

Title = {{Quantification of newly produced B and T lymphocytes in untreated
   chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: The immune defects occurring in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
   are responsible for the frequent occurrence of infections and autoimmune
   phenomena, and may be involved in the initiation and maintenance of the
   malignant clone. Here, we evaluated the quantitative defects of newly
   produced B and T lymphocytes.
   Methods: The output of B and T lymphocytes from the production and
   maturation sites was analyzed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients
   and healthy controls by quantifying kappa-deleting recombination
   excision circles (KRECs) and T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) by
   a Real-Time PCR assay that simultaneously detects both targets.
   T-lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by six-color flow cytometric
   analysis. Data comparison was performed by two-sided Mann-Whitney test.
   Results: KRECs level was reduced in untreated chronic lymphocytic
   leukemia patients studied at the very early stage of the disease,
   whereas the release of TRECs+ cells was preserved. Furthermore, the
   observed increase of CD4(+) lymphocytes could be ascribed to the
   accumulation of CD4(+) cells with effector memory phenotype.
   Conclusions: The decreased number of newly produced B lymphocytes in
   these patients is likely related to a homeostatic mechanism by which the
   immune system balances the abnormal B-cell expansion. This feature may
   precede the profound defect of humoral immunity characterizing the later
   stages of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{One of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen loader complexes,
   Ctf18-replication factor C (RFC), is involved in sister chromatid
   cohesion. To examine its relationship with factors involved in DNA
   replication, we performed a proteomics analysis of Ctf18-interacting
   proteins. We found that Ctf18 interacts with a replicative DNA
   polymerase, DNA polymerase epsilon (pol epsilon). Co-immunoprecipitation
   with recombinant Ctf18-RFC and pol epsilon demonstrated that their
   binding is direct and mediated by two distinct interactions, one weak
   and one stable. Three subunits that are specifically required for
   cohesion in yeast, Ctf18, Dcc1, and Ctf8, formed a trimeric complex
   (18-1-8) and together enabled stable binding with pol epsilon. The
   C-terminal 23-amino acid stretch of Ctf18 was necessary for the trimeric
   association of 18-1-8 and was required for the stable interaction. The
   weak interaction was observed with alternative loader complexes
   including Ctf18-RFC(5), which lacks Dcc1 and Ctf8, suggesting that the
   common loader structures, including the RFC small subunits (RFC2-5), are
   responsible for the weak interaction. The two interaction modes,
   mediated through distinguishable structures of Ctf18-RFC, both occurred
   through the N-terminal half of pol epsilon, which includes the catalytic
   domain. The addition of Ctf18-RFC or Ctf18-RFC(5) to the DNA synthesis
   reaction caused partial inhibition and stimulation, respectively. Thus,
   Ctf18-RFC has multiple interactions with pol epsilon that promote
   polymorphic modulation of DNA synthesis. We propose that their
   interaction alters the DNA synthesis mode to enable the replication fork
   to cooperate with the establishment of cohesion.}},

Abstract = {{Super-orthogonal space-time trellis (SOSTT) codes provide a significant
   coding gain with respect to the conventional space-time trellis (STT)
   codes without increasing the decoding complexity at the receiver.
   Transmit antenna selection (TAS) is an important technique to solve the
   implementation complexity problems of multiple-antenna systems that
   arise from employing a separate RF chain for each antenna. This study
   treats a scheme combining SOSTT coding with TAS in order to exploit
   performance improvements provided by SOSTT codes while realising the
   promises made by the TAS technique. In the proposed scheme, transmit
   antennas that maximise the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver are
   chosen and activated out of all available transmit antennas for
   transmission of the baseline SOSTT code, whereas all other transmit
   antennas are silent. The error performance of the proposed structure is
   investigated by deriving moment generating function (MGF)-based upper
   bound expressions on the pairwise error probability in quasi-static flat
   Rayleigh fading channels for both perfect and imperfect antenna subset
   selection. The performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed
   scheme provides full diversity order as if all transmit antennas were
   used when antennas are perfectly selected. Moreover, it is shown that
   this structure provides better error performance almost at the same
   decoding complexity compared to the previous STT coding structures with
   TAS in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between phenol and cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
   (CTAB) micelles have been investigated by means of nuclear magnetic
   resonance spectroscopy. The combined use of H-1 and NOESY techniques
   revealed that phenol has different preferred locations of interaction
   depending on the pH. At neutral pH (6.70) conditions, phenol molecules
   are preferentially located in the outer micelle region, at the
   micelle-water interface, while at more basic pH (9.94), the deprotonated
   phenol molecules (C6H5O-) are immersed into the palisade layer of the
   micelle. In addition, quantitative estimates of the solubilized fraction
   of phenol were obtained by using PFG-NMR. The results indicate that the
   phenol-CTAB interactions, although already present in neutral pH
   conditions, are largely favored in basic conditions as a consequence of
   the strong electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged
   phenolate ions and the positive charge of the cationic surfactant head

   (ChIP-Seq) we established the whole-genome distribution patterns of
   histone H3 lysine 4 mono-, di-, and tri-methylation (H3K4me1, H3K4me2,
   and H3K4me3, respectively) in Arabidopsis thaliana during watered and
   dehydration stress conditions. In contrast to the relatively even
   distribution of H3 throughout the genome, the H3K4me1, H3K4me2, and
   H3K4me3 marks are predominantly located on genes. About 90\% of
   annotated genes carry one or more of the H3K4 methylation marks. The
   H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 marks are more widely distributed (80\% and 84\%,
   respectively) than the H3K4me3 marks (62\%), but the H3K4me2 and H3K4me1
   levels changed only modestly during dehydration stress. By contrast, the
   H3K4me3 abundance changed robustly when transcripts levels from
   responding genes increased or decreased. In contrast to the prominent
   H3K4me3 peaks present at the 5'-ends of most transcribed genes, genes
   inducible by dehydration and ABA displayed atypically broader H3K4me3
   distribution profiles that were present before and after the stress.
   Conclusions: A higher number (90\%) of annotated Arabidopsis genes carry
   one or more types of H3K4me marks than previously reported. During the
   response to dehydration stress the changes in H3K4me1, H3K4me2, and
   H3K4me3 patterns show different dynamics and specific patterns at
   up-regulated, down-regulated, and unaffected genes. The different
   behavior of each methylation mark during the response process
   illustrates that they have distinct roles in the transcriptional
   response of implicated genes. The broad H3K4me3 distribution profiles on
   nucleosomes of stress-induced genes uncovered a specific chromatin
   pattern associated with many of the genes involved in the dehydration
   stress response.}},

Abstract = {{Protein synthesis requires several guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)
   factors, including elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), which delivers
   aminoacyl-transfer RNAs (tRNAs) to the ribosome. To understand how the
   ribosome triggers GTP hydrolysis in translational GTPases, we have
   determined the crystal structure of EF-Tu and aminoacyl-tRNA bound to
   the ribosome with a GTP analog, to 3.2 angstrom resolution. EF-Tu is in
   its active conformation, the switch I loop is ordered, and the catalytic
   histidine is coordinating the nucleophilic water in position for inline
   attack on the gamma-phosphate of GTP. This activated conformation is due
   to a critical and conserved interaction of the histidine with A2662 of
   the sarcin-ricin loop of the 23S ribosomal RNA. The structure suggests a
   universal mechanism for GTPase activation and hydrolysis in
   translational GTPases on the ribosome.}},

Abstract = {{The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin exhibits diverse
   biological effects, many of which have no clear molecular mechanism.
   Membrane-bound receptors and enzymes are sensitive to their phospholipid
   microenvironment. Amphipathic indomethacin could therefore potentially
   modulate cell signaling by changing membrane properties. Here we
   examined the effect of indomethacin on membrane lateral heterogeneity.
   Fluorescence lifetime imaging of cells expressing lipid-anchored probes
   revealed that treatment of BHK cells with therapeutic levels of
   indomethacin enhances cholesterol-dependent nanoclustering, but not
   cholesterol-independent nanoclustering. Immuno-electron microscopy and
   quantitative spatial mapping of intact plasma membrane sheets similarly
   showed a selective effect of indomethacin on promoting
   cholesterol-dependent, but not cholesterol-independent, nanoclustering.
   To further evaluate the biophysical effects of indomethacin, we measured
   fluorescence polarization of the phase-sensitive probe Laurdan and FRET
   between phase-partitioning probes in model bilayers. Therapeutic levels
   of indomethacin enhanced phase seperation in DPPC/DOPC/Chol (1:1:1) and
   DPPC/Chol membranes in a temperature-dependent manner, but had minimal
   effect on the phase behavior of pure DOPC at any temperature. Taken
   together, the imaging results on intact epithelial cells and the
   biophysical assays of model membranes suggest that indomethacin can
   enhance phase separation and stabilize cholesterol-dependent
   nanoclusters in biological membranes. These effects on membrane lateral
   heterogeneity may have significant consequences for cell signaling
   cascades that are assembled on the plasma membrane.}},

Abstract = {{The use of titanium dioxide as the high refractive index component in
   optical structures is very attractive because of its optical properties.
   In this work, we developed a novel synthesis of colloidal layered
   titanate consisting of nanosheets of titanium oxide. A colloidal
   solution of titanate nanosheets was deposited by spin coating and
   treated by thermal annealing and UV irradiation, obtaining high
   refractive index thin films. Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray
   diffraction, and spectroscopic ellipsometry were used to characterize
   titanate powders and the evolution of titanate films under the employed
   treatments. The developed low temperature UV-assisted titanate
   processing was found to be suitable in the fabrication of multilayer
   dielectric Bragg mirrors, which can be used in a vertical optical
   microcavity incorporating CdSe@ZnS quantum dots (QDs) in the defect
   layer. The developed fabrication procedure did not result in the loss of
   QDs emission properties, allowing for optical characterization of the
   coupling between QDs emission and the cavity. The compatibility between
   the processing of high refractive index materials and QDs functionality
   is very promising for novel strategies in the fabrication of optically
   active photonic structures.}},

Abstract = {{Multilayers of mixed monolayer thiolate-protected Au nanoparticles with
   polycationic ligand shells are strongly and persistently adsorbed on Pt
   electrodes from dilute CH3CN/electrolyte solutions of the nanoparticles.
   The adsorption is so robust that the electrodes can be transferred, with
   rinsing, to nanoparticle-free CH3CN/electrolyte (and other organic
   solvents) and their voltammetry observed without significant desorption.
   The nanoparticles have the average composition
   {[}Au-225(TEA-thiolate(+))(x)(SC6Fc)(gamma)]{[}ClO4-](x), where X = 18,
   22, or 27. The cation sites are a quaternary ammonium-terminated ligand
   (TEA-thiolate(+) = -S(CH2)(11)N(CH2CH3)(3)(+)). The ferrocene content of
   the ligand shell (Y) allows voltammetric detection of the adsorption,
   and also affects it. This work describes how the extent of nanoparticle
   adsorption (surface coverage, Gamma(Np) mol/cm(2)) depends on the manner
   of exposure of the electrode (with potential scanning, at a fixed
   potential, or at open circuit) to the nanoparticle solution, and on the
   nanoparticle concentration, the electrolyte and its concentration, and
   on the mixed monolayer composition. Increase of the cationic
   TEA-thiolate(+) component of the mixed monolayer from X = 18 to 27
   increases, for a given exposure mode, the attained amount of adsorption
   from < one monolayer to > two monolayers, and broadens the voltammetric
   wave. The adsorption phenomenon is interpreted as induced by multiple
   ion-pair bridges between cation sites and electrolyte anions, and as
   such represents an entropic consequence of multiple interactions between
   nanoparticles and between nanoparticles and the electrode.}},

Title = {{Potent and persistent antibody responses against the receptor-binding
   domain of SARS-CoV spike protein in recovered patients}},
Journal = {{VIROLOGY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV not only mediates
   receptor-binding but also induces neutralizing antibodies. We previously
   identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein as a major
   target of neutralizing antibodies in animal models and thus proposed a
   RBD-based vaccine. However, the antigenicity and immunogenicity of RBD
   in humans need to be characterized.
   Results: Two panels of serum samples from recovered SARS patients were
   included and the antibody responses against the RBD were measured by
   ELISA and micro-neutralization assays. We found that the RBD of S
   protein induced potent antibody responses in the recovered SARS patients
   and RBD-specific antibodies could persist at high titers over three year
   follow-up. Furthermore, affinity purified anti-RBD antibodies possessed
   robust neutralizing activity.
   Conclusion: The RBD of SARS-CoV is highly immunogenic in humans and
   mediates protective responses and RBD-based vaccines and diagnostic
   approaches can be further developed.}},

Abstract = {{The origin of the intermolecular interaction, especially the many-body
   interaction, in eight low-lying water hexamer structures (prism, cage,
   book-1, book-2, cyclic-chair, bag, cyclic-boat-1, and cyclic-boat-2) is
   unraveled using the localized molecular orbital energy decomposition
   analysis (LMO-EDA) method at the second-order Moller-Plesset
   perturbation (MP2) level of theory with a large basis set. It is found
   that the relative stabilities of these hexamer structures are determined
   by delicate balances between different types of interaction. According
   to LMO-EDA, electrostatic and exchange interactions are strictly
   pairwise additive. Dispersion interaction in these water hexamer
   structures is almost pairwise additive, with many-body effects varying
   from -0.13 to +0.05 kcal/mol. Repulsion interaction is roughly pairwise
   additive, with many-body effects varying from -0.84 to -0.62 kcal/mol.
   Polarization interaction is not pairwise additive, with many-body
   effects varying from -13.10 to -8.85 kcal/mol.}},

   to show how interfaces cope with the need to terminate ferroelectric
   polarization. In one case, we show evidence for ionic screening, which
   has been predicted by theory but never observed. For a ferroelectric

   Intrinsically Disordered Proteins}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Proteins function by interacting with other molecules, where both native
   and nonnative interactions play important roles. Native interactions
   contribute to the stability and specificity of a complex, whereas
   nonnative interactions mainly perturb the binding kinetics. For
   intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which do not adopt rigid
   structures when being free in solution, the role of nonnative
   interactions may be more prominent in binding processes due to their
   high flexibilities. In this work, we investigated the effect of
   nonnative hydrophobic interactions on the coupled folding and binding
   processes of IDPs and its interplay with chain flexibility by conducting
   molecular dynamics simulations. Our results showed that the free-energy
   profiles became rugged, and intermediate states occurred when nonnative
   hydrophobic interactions were introduced. The binding rate was initially
   accelerated and subsequently dramatically decreased as the strength of
   the nonnative hydrophobic interactions increased. Both thermodynamic and
   kinetic analysis showed that disordered systems were more readily
   affected by nonnative interactions than ordered systems. Furthermore, it
   was demonstrated that the kinetic advantage of IDPs ({''}fly-casting''
   mechanism) was enhanced by nonnative hydrophobic interactions. The
   relationship between chain flexibility and protein aggregation is also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{An important factor to consider is the resistance of load bearing

   addition to in-plane forces, earthquake accelerations produce
   out-of-plane forces which may cause the wall to fail under flexure, very
   similar to a reinforced concrete slab, loaded perpendicular to its
   plane. Four wall specimens were tested under out-of-plane hysteretic
   loads to assess its behaviour. The paper also describes different
   measures taken to improve both the strength and the ductility of the
   original specimen. It appears from the tests that the proposed measures
   improve substantially the strength, but ductility was only slightly
   improved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of traces of water on the relative strengths of acids (Delta
   pK(a) values) in acetonitrile was quantitatively evaluated
   experimentally and computationally (COSMO-RS). Water affects first of
   all the anions by selective solvation. Expectedly, the more localized is
   the charge in acid anions the higher is the effect of water. The
   energetic effect of increasing water content from 0 to ca. 10 000 ppm on
   solvation enthalpies of anions ranged from 0.2-0.4 kcal mol(-1) (anions
   with delocalized charges) to 15 kcal mol(-1) in the case of the highly
   charge-localized acetate ion. In the case of Delta pK(a) values the
   change ranges from 0.01 to ca. 1.7 pK(a) units (acid pair involving
   acetic acid). The COSMO-RS method was found to satisfactorily describe
   the trends in Delta pK(a) values. To quantify the extent of charge
   localization/delocalization in anions a parameter, weighted average
   positive sigma (WAPS), was introduced, which can be conveniently
   computed using the COSMO approach. WAPS characterizes the distribution
   of charge density across the molecular surface and was found to
   correlate well with the extent of water influence on the dissociation of
   the respective acid.}},

Abstract = {{The natural response to itch sensation is to scratch, which relieves the
   itch through an unknown mechanism. Interaction between pain and itch has
   been frequently demonstrated, and the selectivity hypothesis of itch,
   based on data from electrophysiological and behavioral experiments,
   postulates the existence of primary pain afferents capable of repressing
   itch. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of vesicular glutamate
   transporter (VGLUT) 2 in a subpopulation of neurons partly overlapping
   with the vanilloid receptor (TRPV1) primary afferents resulted in a
   dramatic increase in itch behavior accompanied by a reduced
   responsiveness to thermal pain. The increased itch behavior was reduced
   by administration of antihistaminergic drugs and by genetic deletion of
   the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, demonstrating a dependence on
   VGLUT2 to maintain normal levels of both histaminergic and
   nonhistaminergic itch. This study establishes that VGLUT2 is a major
   player in TRPV1 thermal nociception and also serves to regulate a normal
   itch response.}},

Abstract = {{TiO2 nanoparticle photocatalysts modified with uniform gold
   nanoparticles are prepared by anchoring bifunctional glutathione-coated
   monolayer-protected gold clusters (MPCs) onto TiO2. In this method, the
   MPC loading on TiO2 can be precisely controlled in the range of 1-5 wt
   \% without incurring size change upon anchoring. The photocatalytic
   degradation of Uniblue A (UBA) is carried out with thus prepared
   MPC-TiO2 composites, which shows, however, no enhancement upon MPC
   anchoring. The MPC-TiO2 composites are thermally treated to activate the
   catalytic activity. When the MPC-TiO2 composites are calcined at 250
   degrees C, the glutathione ligand on gold surface is partially removed
   and the photocatalytic activity of the composites significantly
   increases, highlighting the role of gold in the photocatalytic
   reactions. However, when the calcination temperature is raised to 400
   degrees C, the photocatalytic activity of the composites drastically
   decreased. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the calcined
   composites reveals that significant amount of oxidized sulfur remains
   after calcination that appears to act as a recombination center for the
   photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting in a drastic decrease in
   the photocatalytic activity. These results emphasize the important role
   of ligands in the use of MPCs in photocatalysis.}},

Title = {{Regulatory network modelling of iron acquisition by a fungal pathogen in
   contact with epithelial cells}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks can be used
   to predict regulatory interactions of an organism faced with
   environmental changes, but can prove problematic, especially when
   focusing on complicated multi-factorial processes. Candida albicans is a
   major human fungal pathogen. During the infection process, this fungus
   is able to adapt to conditions of very low iron availability. Such
   adaptation is an important virulence attribute of virtually all
   pathogenic microbes. Understanding the regulation of iron acquisition
   genes will extend our knowledge of the complex regulatory changes during
   the infection process and might identify new potential drug targets.
   Thus, there is a need for efficient modelling approaches predicting key
   regulatory events of iron acquisition genes during the infection
   process.
   Results: This study deals with the regulation of C. albicans iron uptake
   genes during adhesion to and invasion into human oral epithelial cells.
   A reverse engineering strategy is presented, which is able to infer
   regulatory networks on the basis of gene expression data, making use of
   relevant selection criteria such as sparseness and robustness. An
   exhaustive use of available knowledge from different data sources
   improved the network prediction. The predicted regulatory network
   proposes a number of new target genes for the transcriptional regulators
   Rim101, Hap3, Sef1 and Tup1. Furthermore, the molecular mode of action
   for Tup1 is clarified. Finally, regulatory interactions between the
   transcription factors themselves are proposed. This study presents a
   model describing how C. albicans may regulate iron acquisition during
   contact with and invasion of human oral epithelial cells. There is
   evidence that some of the proposed regulatory interactions might also
   occur during oral infection.
   Conclusions: This study focuses on a typical problem in Systems Biology
   where an interesting biological phenomenon is studied using a small
   number of available experimental data points. To overcome this
   limitation, a special modelling strategy was used which identifies
   sparse and robust networks. The data is augmented by an exhaustive
   search for additional data sources, helping to make proposals on
   regulatory interactions and to guide the modelling approach. The
   proposed modelling strategy is capable of finding known regulatory
   interactions and predicts a number of yet unknown biologically relevant
   regulatory interactions.}},

   57 bar where it is equal to 10.5 +/- 1.2 K. At the same pressure, the
   vacancy formation volume exhibits a maximum and reaches the volume of

Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Artemisinin is the current drug of choice for treatment of
   malaria and a number of other diseases. It is obtained from the annual
   herb, Artemisia annua and some microbial sources by genetic engineering.
   There is a great concern that the artemisinin production at current rate
   will not meet the increasing demand by the pharmaceutical industry, so
   looking for additional sources is imperative.
   Methods: In current study, artemisinin concentration was analysed and
   compared in the flowers, leaves, roots and stems of Artemisia annua and
   14 other Artemisia species including two varieties each for Artemisia
   roxburghiana and Artemisia dracunculus using high performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC).
   Results: The highest artemisinin concentration was detected in the
   leaves (0.44 +/- 0.03\%) and flowers (0.42 +/- 0.03\%) of A. annua,
   followed by the flowers (0.34 +/- .02\%) of A. bushriences and leaves
   (0.27 +/- 0\%) of A. dracunculus var dracunculus. The average
   concentration of artemisinin varied in the order of flowers > leaves >
   stems > roots.
   Conclusion: This study identifies twelve novel plant sources of
   artemisinin, which may be helpful for pharmaceutical production of
   artemisinin. This is the first report of quantitative comparison of
   artemisinin among a large number of Artemisia species.}},

Abstract = {{The self-assembly of neutral chiral porphyrins in aqueous solution was
   studied by absorption, fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD)
   spectroscopy, and optical and electron microscopy. Different
   supramolecular structures of the porphyrins were obtained by changing
   the diffusion rate of water into the porphyrin organic solution. When
   water was mixed and homogenized with the porphyrin solution immediately,
   the absorbance at the both sides of absorption Soret band increased
   along with hypochromism, indicating that J- and H-type self-assembly
   occurred simultaneously, and AFM measurements showed that porphyrin
   nanoparticles approximately 250 nm formed. On the other hand, the
   significant red-shift of the absorption Soret band and very long
   porphyrin microtubes observed by optical microscopy clearly demonstrated
   that J-type intermolecular packing increased significantly when
   porphyrin solution was slowly diffused into water. These observations
   indicate that the J- and H-type self-assembly pathways are kinetic and
   thermodynamic, respectively, and different self-assembly structures
   could be obtained by controlling the kinetic and thermodynamic pathways,
   which was also supported by theoretical calculations. In particular,
   porphyrin macroscopic nanowell-array films, which morphology is ideal
   for organic photovoltaic devices and biosensors, were obtained by
   diffusing water vapor into porphyrin organic solution. The methodology
   and results reported here may provide a novel, simple, and efficient
   approach to obtain well-defined self-assembly nanostructures.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the current fast development of materials science, preserving
   activity and native structure of biomolecules upon their adsorption on a
   solid substrate is still a challenge in the elaboration of hybrid
   functional materials. We describe a novel functionalization method of
   the Zinc Selenide (ZnSe) semiconductor with a peptide presenting surface
   recognition properties for this material. The peptide was further used
   as a linker and interface layer when horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was
   adsorbed onto the ZnSe surface. Our ELISA assays evidenced that HRP
   activity was enhanced 2-fold when adsorbed on ZnSe via use of the
   specific peptide compared to when it was directly adsorbed onto the bare
   surface or the one modified by a polyelectrolyte film. We demonstrate
   that the secondary structure of the enzyme in its adsorbed form is much
   closer to its native secondary structure found in solution when peptide
   functionalization of ZnSe crystal was performed prior to HRP adsorption.
   The affinity of the peptide for the ZnSe was quantified via force
   spectroscopy measurements performed with atomic force microscopy and the
   binding forces between this peptide and the ZnSe were measured to be 125
   +/- 30 pN. Our results demonstrate the outstanding utility of the
   specific peptide in surface modification of ZnSe thus avoiding protein
   denaturation while adsorption. This may be of great interest in
   triggering biological applications of ZnSe based devices (diodes,
   attenuated total reflection crystals, prisms, and quantum dots) where
   interaction with biomolecules is expected.}},

Abstract = {{Alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha(1)-PI) is the most relevant protease
   inhibitor in the lung. Patients with hereditary deficiency of
   alpha(1)-PI suffer from an impaired hepatic synthesis of alpha 1-PI in
   the liver and in consequence an insufficient concentration of the
   protease inhibitor in the lung followed by development of lung emphysema
   due to an impaired protease antiprotease balance and a local relative
   excess of neutrophil elastase (NE). In contrast, patients with cystic
   fibrosis (CF) are characterised by a normal synthesis of alpha(1)-PI and
   a severe pulmonary inflammation with a strong excess of NE in the lung
   followed by progressive loss of lung function. In principle, both
   patient groups may benefit from an augmentation of alpha(1)-PI.
   Intravenous augmentation, which is established in patients with
   alpha(1)-PI deficiency only, is very expensive, subject to controversial
   discussions and only about 2\% of the administered protein reaches lung
   interstitium. Inhalation of alpha(1)-PI may serve as an alternative to
   administer high alpha(1)-PI doses into the lungs of both patient groups
   to restore the impaired protease antiprotease balance and to diminish
   the detrimental effects of NE. However, prerequisites of this therapy
   are the reproducible administration of sufficient doses of active (xi-PI
   into the lung without adverse effects. In our review we describe the
   results of studies investigating the inhalation of alpha(1)-PI in
   patients with alpha(1)-PI deficiency and CF. The data demonstrate the
   feasibility of alpha(1)-PI inhalation for restoration of the impaired
   protease antiprotease balance, attenuation of the inflammation and
   neutralisation of the excess activity of NE. Likely, inhalation of
   alpha(1)-PI serves as cheaper and more convenient therapy than
   intravenous augmentation. However, inhalation will be further optimised
   by use of novel nebulisers and optimised breathing techniques.}},

   Transfer}},

Abstract = {{Photoinduced electron transfer processes in two
   bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEA)-based triads were investigated to
   identify the dominating factors that lead to long-lived charge-separated
   (CS) states in BPEA-based donor-acceptor systems. In both systems
   studied, phenothiazine moieties acted as final donors. Nitrotoluene or
   pyromellitic diimide units acted as final acceptors. Two possible
   electron transfer pathways could be identified in these systems.
   Fluorescence of the BPEA chromophore was highly quenched in both systems
   due to the photoinduced electron transfer process. Picosecond transient
   absorption studies suggested that excitation of BMA leads to electron
   transfer from (1)BPEA{*} to the acceptor followed by a second electron
   transfer from phenothiazine to the BPEA radical cation. In both systems
   formation of long-lived CS states was confirmed by nanosecond flash
   photolysis. A comparison showed that the BPEA-based triads exhibited
   lower CS state lifetimes compared to the BPEA-phenothiazine dyad.
   Analysis of the Delta G degrees and lambda values showed that for both
   triads -Delta G degrees <= lambda, and hence, the inverted region effect
   cannot operate. Hence, the long lifetime of the final CS state is
   attributed to the long distance separating the donor and acceptor
   components in the CS state. This study supports the contention that if
   the CS state in a dyad is long-lived due to the inverted region effects,
   the CS state lifetime will decrease if the dyad is converted to a triad.}},

   provided ECG, respiratory and sleep parameters for a comparative
   analysis. Various types and severity of NCA were detected already in
   moderate SAHS (apnea/hypopnea index = 26 +/- 15.6/h), reflecting the
   respiratory and atherosclerotic changes. Moderately severe arrhythmias,
   represented with benign and 2 complex types were caused by hypoxemia
   characterized by AHI, minimal SaO(2), and lower values after
   desaturation. Three-time higher prevalence of complex arrhythmias in
   SAHS patients was not significantly different by usual statistical
   comparison, likely due to a low number of controls and a joint
   occurrence of various types and complex severity of arrhythmias in some
   patients. Therefore, a complex assessment of different types and varying
   severity of arrhythmias would require a scale specifically constructed
   for their evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{The steady-state absorption and emission spectra and the time-resolved
   Soret- and Q-band excited fluorescence profiles of the model

   emission resulting from Soret-band excitation behaves in a manner
   completely consistent with that of molecular solvents of the same
   polarizability. The ionic nature of the solvent and its slow solvation
   relaxation times have no significant effect on the nature of the
   radiationless decay of the S-2 state, which decays quantitatively to S-1
   at a population decay rate that is consistent with the weak coupling
   case of radiationless transition theory (energy gap law). The ratio of
   the intensities of the Q alpha:Q beta (0-0:1-0) bands is consistent with
   the solvatochromic shift correlation data obtained for molecular
   solvents. The temporal S-1 fluorescence decay profiles measured at a
   single emission wavelength are biexponential; the longer-lived major
   component is similar to that observed for ZnTPP in molecular solvents,
   and the minor shorter-lived component is attributed to solvent
   relaxation processes on a nanosecond time scale.}},

   energies with a series of oxygen-containing Lewis base anions (including

   results show that the interaction energy can be tuned across a range
   from reactive to nonreactive (or physical) interactions. We evaluated
   different levels of theory as well as possible corrections to the
   interaction energy, and we explained our calculated trends on the basis
   of properties of the individual anions. We found that the interaction
   energy between CO2 and the Lewis bases examined here correlates most
   strongly with the atomic charge on the oxygen atom. This insight
   provides a useful handle to tune the anion-CO2 interaction energy for
   future experimental and computational studies of novel CO2 capture

   Proliferation of Endometrial Carcinoma Cells via the PKC delta/ERK
   Pathway}},

Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Recently, a variant of ER-alpha, ER-alpha 36 was identified
   and cloned. ER-alpha 36 lacks intrinsic transcription activity and
   mainly mediates non-genomic estrogen signaling. The purpose of this
   study was to investigate the function and the underlying mechanisms of
   ER-alpha 36 in growth regulation of endometrial Ishikawa cancer cells.
   Methods: The cellular localization of ER-alpha 36 and ER-alpha 66 were
   determined by immunofluorescence in the Ishikawa cells. Ishikawa
   endometrial cancer control cells transfected with an empty expression
   vector, Ishikawa cells with shRNA knockdown of ER-alpha 36
   (Ishikawa/RNAiER36) and Ishikawa cells with shRNA knockdown of ER-alpha
   66 (Ishikawa/RNAiER66) were treated with E2 and E2-conjugated to bovine
   serum albumin (E2-BSA, membrane impermeable) in the absence and presence
   of different kinase inhibitors HBDDE, bisindolylmaleimide, rottlerin,
   H89 and U0126. The phosphorylation levels of signaling molecules and
   cyclin D1/cdk4 expression were examined with Western blot analysis and
   cell growth was monitored with the MTT assay.
   Results: Immunofluorescence staining of Ishikawa cells demonstrated that
   ER-alpha 36 was expressed mainly on the plasma membrane and in the
   cytoplasm, while ER-alpha 66 was predominantly localized in the cell
   nucleus. Both E2 and E2-BSA rapidly activated PKC delta not PKC alpha in
   Ishikawa cells, which could be abrogated by ER-alpha 36 shRNA
   expression. E2-and E2-BSA-induced ERK phosphorylation required ER-alpha
   36 and PKCd. However, only E2 was able to induce Camp-dependent protein
   kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation. Furthermore, E2 enhances cyclin D1/cdk4
   expression via ER-alpha 36.
   Conclusion: E2 activates the PKC delta/ERK pathway and enhances cyclin
   D1/cdk4 expression via the membrane-initiated signaling pathways
   mediated by ER-alpha 36, suggesting a possible involvement of ER-alpha
   36 in E2-dependent growth-promoting effects in endometrial cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{Using the electrocrystallization process, silver iodide particles were
   embedded into bulk Vycor7930 porous glass (VPG) to obtain ionic
   conductor composite. X-ray microdiffraction (mu XRD) was carried out on
   the composite. AgI was found to be in its beta-form with nanometric
   crystallite size. Microstructure has also been investigated by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM). The ionic conductor was found to be embedded
   in the center of the VPG disk, into the 4 nm diameter pore network.
   Electron probe for micro analysis (EPMA) has shown the homogeneity of
   the silver iodide precipitate inside the VPG. Electrical conductivity
   was measured by complex impedance spectroscopy (CIS). A large hysteresis
   phenomenon in the conductivity versus temperature curve at a temperature
   close to the transition beta <-> alpha-AgI was observed. At low
   temperature, the conductivity of the composite was found to be higher
   than that of pure beta-AgI by 1 order of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{The reentrant condensation of 21-bp oligonucleotide in the presence of
   spermidine was investigated by laser light scattering and capillary
   electrophoresis. 21-bp oligonucleotide showed a bimodal distribution in
   1 x TE buffer, with the slow mode being the characteristic diffusion of
   polyelectrolyte in solution without enough salt. At the fixed spermidine
   concentration, the reentry of oligonucleotide underwent aggregation,
   phase separation, and disassociation in sequence with time, and the
   kinetics was extremely slow. For example, it took more than 1200 h (50
   days) for the reentry to complete at 21 mM spermidine. Higher spermidine
   concentration led to faster kinetics. After reentry, the slow mode
   disappeared, and the charges of oligonucleotide were at least partially
   neutralized. No prominent charge inversion was observed. The kinetics of
   oligonucleotide reentry in the presence of spermidine gained insight in
   the interactions of polyelectrolyte in aqueous solution.}},

Abstract = {{Late Pleistocene outburst flooding of ice-dammed glacial Lake Missoula,
   and possible discharge from the Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS),
   catastrophically altered the northwestern United States landscape, yet
   little is known about potential infiltration of flood waters into the

   late Pleistocene CIS-related recharge waters in the Columbia River
   Basalt Aquifers (CRBAs) in central Washington. CRBA groundwaters with
   corrected (14)C ages from 15.7 and 33.3 k yrs BP (during periods of
   flood events) have anomalously low delta(18)O values (-18.9 to -17.6

   -13.4 parts per thousand) and modern precipitation in the region
   (average -15.9 parts per thousand), consistent with CIS-related

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{We present a formula that relates the variations of the area of extreme
   throat initial data with the variation of an appropriate defined mass
   functional. From this expression we deduce that the first variation,
   with fixed angular momentum, of the area is zero and the second
   variation is positive definite evaluated at the extreme Kerr throat
   initial data. This indicates that the area of the extreme Kerr throat
   initial data is a minimum among this class of data. And hence the area
   of generic throat initial data is bounded from below by the angular
   momentum. Also, this result strongly suggests that the inequality
   between area and angular momentum holds for generic asymptotically flat
   axially symmetric black holes. As an application, we prove this
   inequality in the nontrivial family of spinning Bowen-York initial data.}},

Abstract = {{PicoGreen is a fluorescent probe that binds dsDNA and forms a highly
   luminescent complex when compared to the free dye in solution. This
   unique probe is widely used in DNA quantitation assays but has limited
   application in biophysical analysis of DNA and DNA-protein systems due
   to limited knowledge pertaining to its physical properties and
   characteristics of DNA binding. Here we have investigated PicoGreen
   binding to DNA to reveal the origin and mode of PicoGreen/DNA
   interactions, in particular the role of electrostatic and
   nonelectrostatic interactions in formation of the complex, as well as
   demonstrating minor groove binding specificity. Analysis of the
   fluorescence properties of free PicoGreen, the diffusion properties of
   PG/DNA complexes, and the excited-state lifetime changes upon DNA
   binding and change in solvent polarity, as well as the viscosity, reveal
   that quenching of PicoGreen in the free state results from its
   intramolecular dynamic fluctuations. On binding to DNA, intercalation
   and electrostatic interactions immobilize the dye molecule, resulting in
   a >1000-fold enhancement in its fluorescence. Based on the results of
   this study, a model of PicoGreen/DNA complex formation is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{This contribution focuses on the model-based system design and the
   systemwide evaluation of novel reactor concepts for power plants which
   combine gasification of wood and conversion of its gaseous product in

   Each system was subject to several feasibility checks, and optimization
   of the most important control parameters was performed. Simulation
   results show that high temperature gas purification units and high
   temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells have strong advantages
   over their classical counterparts with respect to heat integration and
   electrical system efficiency. Systems with high and low temperature fuel
   cells were studied separately, but they show that a combination of both
   types of fuel cells in a single plant offers the highest efficiency and

   special Cu crystallographic site which is next to each of the four Ce

Abstract = {{Many fundamental cellular and extracellular processes in the body are
   mediated by enzymes. At the single molecule level, enzyme activity is
   influenced by mechanical forces. However, the effects of mechanical
   forces on the kinetics of enzymatic reactions in complex tissues with
   intact extracellular matrix (ECM) have not been identified. Here we
   report that physiologically relevant macroscopic mechanical forces
   modify enzyme activity at the molecular level in the ECM of the lung
   parenchyma. Porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), which binds to and
   digests elastin, was fluorescently conjugated (f-PPE) and fluorescent
   recovery after photobleach was used to evaluate the binding kinetics of
   f-PPE in the alveolar walls of normal mouse lungs. Fluorescent recovery
   after photobleach indicated that the dissociation rate constant (k(off))
   for f-PPE was significantly larger in stretched than in relaxed alveolar
   walls with a linear relation between k(off) and macroscopic strain.
   Using a network model of the parenchyma, a linear relation was also
   found between k(off) and microscopic strain on elastin fibers. Further,
   the binding pattern of f-PPE suggested that binding sites on elastin
   unfold with strain. The increased overall reaction rate also resulted in
   stronger structural breakdown at the level of alveolar walls, as well as
   accelerated decay of stiffness and decreased failure stress of the ECM
   at the macroscopic scale. These results suggest an important role for
   the coupling between mechanical forces and enzyme activity in ECM
   breakdown and remodeling in development, and during diseases such as
   pulmonary emphysema or vascular aneurysm. Our findings may also have
   broader implications because in vivo, enzyme activity in nearly all
   cellular and extracellular processes takes place in the presence of
   mechanical forces.}},

Abstract = {{Neuropeptides are found in both mammals and invertebrates and can
   modulate neural function through activation of G-protein-coupled
   receptors (GPCRS). The precise mechanisms by which many of these GPCRs
   modulate specific signaling cascades to regulate neural function are not
   well defined. We used Drosophila melanogaster as a model to examine both
   the cellular and behavioral effects of DPKQDFMRFamide, the most abundant
   peptide encoded by the dFMRF gene. We show that DPKQDFMRFamide enhanced
   synaptic transmission through activation of two G-protein-coupled
   receptors, Fmrf Receptor (FR) and Dromyosupress in Receptor-2 (DmsR-2).
   The peptide increased both the presynaptic Ca(2+) response and the
   quantal content of released transmitter. Peptide-induced modulation of
   synaptic function could be abrogated by depleting intracellular Ca(2+)
   stores or by interfering with Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic
   reticulum through disruption of either the ryanodine receptor or the
   inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. The peptide also altered
   behavior. Exogenous DPKQDFMRFamide enhanced fictive locomotion; this
   required both the FR and DmsR-2. Likewise, both receptors were required
   for an escape response to intense light exposure. Thus, coincident
   detection of a peptide by two GPCRs modulates synaptic function through
   effects of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release, and we hypothesize that these
   mechanisms are involved in behavioral responses to environmental stress.}},

Title = {{Localization and Androgen Regulation of Metastasis-Associated Protein 1
   in Mouse Epididymis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1), the founding member
   of the MTA family of genes, can modulate transcription by influencing
   the status of chromatin remodeling. Despite its strong correlation with
   the metastatic potential of cancer cells, MTA1 can also regulate crucial
   cellular pathways by modifying the acetylation status. We have
   previously reported the presence of MTA1/MTA1 in human and mouse testes,
   providing the evidence for its involvement in the regulation of
   testicular function during murine spermatogenesis. The objective of
   present study was to further assess the localization of MTA1 in mouse
   epididymis on both transcriptional and translational level, and then to
   explore whether MTA1 expression is regulated by androgens and postnatal
   epididymal development.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Mice were deprived of circulating
   androgen by bilaterally castration and were then supplemented with
   exogenous testosterone propionate for one week. MTA1 was immunolocalized
   in the epithelium of the entire epididymis with the maximal expression
   in the nuclei of principal cells and of clear cells in proximal region.
   Its expression decreased gradually after castration, whereas
   testosterone treatment could restore the expression, indicating that the
   expression of this gene is dependent on androgen. During postnatal
   development, the protein expression in the epididymis began to appear
   from day 7 to day 14, increased dramatically from postnatal day 28, and
   peaked at adulthood onwards, coinciding with both the well
   differentiated status of epididymis and the mature levels of circulating
   androgens. This region-and cell-specific pattern was also conservative
   in normal human epididymis.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that the expression of MTA1 protein could
   be regulated by androgen pathway and its expression level is closely
   associated with the postnatal development of the epididymis, giving rise
   to the possibility that this gene plays a potential role in sperm
   maturation and fertility.}},

Number = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{We present a tree-tensor-network-based method to study strongly
   correlated systems with nonlocal interactions in higher dimensions.
   Although the momentum-space and quantum-chemistry versions of the
   density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method have long been
   applied to such systems, the spatial topology of DMRG-based methods
   allows efficient optimizations to be carried out with respect to one
   spatial dimension only. Extending the matrix-product-state picture, we
   formulate a more general approach by allowing the local sites to be
   coupled to more than two neighboring auxiliary subspaces. Following
   {[}Y. Shi, L. Duan, and G. Vidal, Phys. Rev. A 74, 022320 (2006)], we
   treat a treelike network ansatz with arbitrary coordination number z,
   where the z=2 case corresponds to the one-dimensional (1D) scheme. For
   this ansatz, the long-range correlation deviates from the mean-field
   value polynomially with distance, in contrast to the matrix-product
   ansatz, which deviates exponentially. The computational cost of the
   tree-tensor-network method is significantly smaller than that of
   previous DMRG-based attempts, which renormalize several blocks into a
   single block. In addition, we investigate the effect of unitary
   transformations on the local basis states and present a method for
   optimizing such transformations. For the 1D interacting spinless fermion
   model, the optimized transformation interpolates smoothly between real
   space and momentum space. Calculations carried out on small quantum
   chemical systems support our approach.}},

Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate the first use of marine mammal dive-depth data to improve
   maps of bathymetry in poorly sampled regions of the continental shelf. A
   group of 57 instrumented elephant seals made on the order of 2 x 10(5)
   dives over and near the continental shelf on the western side of the
   Antarctic Peninsula during five seasons, 2005-2009. Maximum dive depth
   exceeded 2000 m. For dives made near existing ship tracks with measured
   water depths H<700 m, similar to 30\% of dive depths were to the seabed,
   consistent with expected benthic foraging behavior. By identifying the
   deepest of multiple dives within small areas as a dive to the seabed, we
   have developed a map of seal-derived bathymetry. Our map fills in
   several regions for which trackline data are sparse, significantly
   improving delineation of troughs crossing the continental shelf of the
   southern Bellingshausen Sea. Citation: Padman, L., D. P. Costa, S. T.

Title = {{Effects of feeding a ruminally protected lysine product, with or without
   isoleucine, valine and histidine, to lactating dairy cows on their
   productive performance and plasma amino acid profiles}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{161}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{75-84}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{The literature on post-ruminal lysine supplementation to diets of
   lactating dairy cows shows generally small negative responses to
   supplemental intestinally absorbable lysine, and our recent metabolic
   modeling of California dairy rations predicted other amino acid (AA)
   that could become co-limiting if supplies of intestinally absorbable
   lysine were met. The objectives of this study were to estimate the rumen
   escape potential of a ruminally protected (RP) lysine (RPL) product, and
   an RPL product also containing isoleucine, valine and histidine (RPM),
   to determine effects of feeding these products on performance and plasma
   AA profiles of high producing dairy cows. Three pens of about 310
   multiparous early lactation cows were used in a 3 x 3 Latin square
   design with 28 day experimental periods in which the basal total mixed
   ration (TMR) was the same for all groups except for the RP products
   which were added to the treatment pens at a level designed to deliver an
   equal amount of intestinally absorbable L-lysine to both RP groups.
   However rumen stability was slightly higher for the RPL versus the RPAA,
   and the RPL was calculated to deliver similar to 13.2 g/d of
   intestinally absorbable lysine and the RPM calculated to deliver similar
   to 10.6, 5.4, 2.2 and 1.6 g/d of intestinally absorbable lysine,
   isoleucine, histidine and valine respectively. Only milk protein
   proportion was increased when RPL was fed. However, replacement of the
   RPL with the RPM increased milk and milk lactose yields, while milk
   protein and energy outputs tended to increase. Plasma levels of both
   non-essential and essential AA, including lysine, were not impacted by
   feeding the RPL or RPAA. Overall, feeding the RPL alone was judged to
   cause a generally reduced productive performance, which could be
   interpreted to suggest that lysine was not supplied in sufficient
   quantity or that it was not required. Feeding the RPM versus the RPL
   increased productive performance of the cows overall, which could
   support an overall hypothesis that lysine alone resulted in an imbalance
   and/or deficiency of isoleucine, histidine and/or valine which was
   alleviated by their supplementation. Overall treatment differences,
   regardless of their statistical significance, were small and of very
   limited practical application. Nevertheless, feeding a complex of RPM
   was beneficial beyond supplementation of RP lysine alone, but more
   research on AA imbalances will be required in order to determine effects
   of supplementation of RP amino acids. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We study the disorder effect on the transport properties of graphene
   quantum well structures using a phenomenological statistical model. By
   adopting the transfer matrix method combined with a Monte Carlo
   averaging procedure, we observe transitions from ballistic transport to
   the diffusive limit. It is found that the transmission probability of
   incident electrons is sensitive to the disorder effect. The significance
   of the disorder effect depends on the incident angle of the electrons.
   For normal incidence, the perfect transmission due to the Klein
   tunneling remains robust against the disorder effect. For tilted
   incidence, the transmission possibility can be suppressed. In
   particular, we found that the transmission probability for electrons
   with a very small angle, i.e. the wavevector along the transport
   direction is zero in the barrier, can be greatly suppressed. As a
   result, abrupt dips at these wavevectors emerge in the transmission
   spectrum.}},

   gases, H-2:CO:CO2 = 2:1:0 and H-2:CO:CO2 = 3:0(:)1, were mixed in
   various proportions thus varying the ratio of CO, CO2, and H-2
   stoichiometrically. The results show that CO and CO2 mixtures can be
   used as feed to a cobalt catalyst. Comparison of the FTS using different
   syngas mixtures (CO2/H-2, CO2/CO/H-2, and CO/H-2) shows that: (1) CO2
   can be hydrogenated along with CO in the FT reactor over cobalt
   catalyst, especially in the case of high content of CO2. (2)
   Hydrogenation of CO2 or CO/CO2 mixture leads to a typical
   Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) distribution. These could support the
   hypothesis that CO2 hydrogenation processes might occur with the
   formation of CO as intermediate. (3) CO feed exhibit the typical
   two-alpha distribution while CO2 and CO2 rich feeds only exhibit a
   single-alpha distribution. This may also help us to understand the
   mechanisms that lead to product distributions in FT with single- and
   dual-alpha distributions. In spite of the fact that cobalt catalysts are
   not water-gas shift active, it is shown the rate of hydrocarbon
   production is maximized at an intermediate composition of the CO/CO2/H-2
   mixture. The results could have implications for the design of XTL
   (anything-to-liquids is a process that converts carbon and energy
   containing feedstock to high quality fuels and products, such as
   coal-to-liquids, biomass-to-liquids and gas-to-liquids) using cobalt
   catalysts in that it might be advantageous to keep some carbon dioxide
   in the syngas feed to the FTS process.}},

Abstract = {{Humans are creatures of routine and habit. When faced with situations in
   which a default option is available, people show a consistent tendency
   to stick with the default. Why this occurs is unclear. To elucidate its
   neural basis, we used a novel gambling task in conjunction with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. Behavioral results revealed that
   participants were more likely to choose the default card and felt
   enhanced emotional responses to outcomes after making the decision to
   switch. We show that increased tendency to switch away from the default
   during the decision phase was associated with decreased activity in the
   anterior insula; activation in this same area in reaction to ``switching
   away from the default and losing{''} was positively related with
   experienced frustration. In contrast, decisions to choose the default
   engaged the ventral striatum, the same reward area as seen in winning.
   Our findings highlight aversive processes in the insula as underlying
   the default bias and suggest that choosing the default may be rewarding
   in itself.}},

   Ultimatum Game}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{In experimental economics, the preference for reciprocal fairness has
   been observed in the controlled and incentivized laboratory setting of
   the ultimatum game, in which two individuals decide on how to divide a
   sum of money, with one proposing the share while the second deciding
   whether to accept. Should the proposal be accepted, the amount is
   divided accordingly. Otherwise, both would receive no money. A recent
   twin study has shown that fairness preference inferred from responder
   behavior is heritable, yet its neurogenetic basis remains unknown. The
   D4 receptor (DRD4) exon3 is a well-characterized functional
   polymorphism, which is known to be associated with attention deficit
   hyperactivity disorder and personality traits including novelty seeking
   and self-report altruism. Applying a neurogenetic approach, we find that
   DRD4 is significantly associated with fairness preference. Additionally,
   the interaction among this gene, season of birth, and gender is highly
   significant. This is the first result to link preference for reciprocal
   fairness to a specific gene and suggests that gene x environment
   interactions contribute to economic decision making.}},

Title = {{Factors associated with psychological and behavioral functioning in

Journal = {{HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: To identify demographic and clinical factors associated with
   psychological and behavioral functioning (PBF) in people with type 2
   diabetes living in France.
   Methods: In March 2002, approximately 10,000 adults, who had been
   reimbursed for at least one hypoglycemic treatment or insulin dose
   during the last quarter of 2001, received a questionnaire about their
   health status and PBF (3,646 responders). For this analysis, the 3,090
   persons with type 2 diabetes, aged 18-85 years old were selected. PBF
   was measured with the adapted version of the Diabetes Health Profile for
   people with type 2 diabetes. This permitted the calculation of three
   functional scores -psychological distress (PD), barriers to activity
   (BA), and disinhibited eating (DE) - from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).
   Results: Major negative associations were observed with PBF for
   microvascular complications (a difference of 6.7 in the BA score between
   persons with and without microvascular complications) and severe
   hypoglycemia (difference of 7.9 in the BA score), insulin treatment
   (-8.5 \& -9.5 in the PD \& BA scores respectively, as compared to
   treatment with oral hypoglycemic agents), non-adherence to treatment
   (-12.3 in the DE score for persons forgetting their weekly treatment),
   increasing weight (-8.5 \& -9.7 in the PD \& DE scores respectively, as
   compared to stable weight), at least one psychiatrist visit in 2001
   (-8.9 in the DE score), and universal medical insurance coverage (-7.9
   in the PD score) (due to low income).
   Conclusion: Prevention and management of microvascular complications or
   adherence to treatment (modifiable factors) could be essential to
   preserving or improving PBF among people with type 2 diabetes. A
   specific approach to type 2 diabetes management may be required in
   groups with a low socioeconomic profile (particularly people with
   universal medical insurance coverage), or other non modifiable factors.}},

Title = {{In vivo development of dendritic orientation in wild-type and
   mislocalized retinal ganglion cells}},
Journal = {{NEURAL DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many neurons in the central nervous system, including
   retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), possess asymmetric dendritic arbors
   oriented toward their presynaptic partners. How such dendritic arbors
   become biased during development in vivo is not well understood.
   Dendritic arbors may become oriented by directed outgrowth or by
   reorganization of an initially unbiased arbor. To distinguish between
   these possibilities, we imaged the dynamic behavior of zebrafish RGC
   dendrites during development in vivo. We then addressed how cell
   positioning within the retina, altered in heart-and-soul (has) mutants,
   affects RGC dendritic orientation.
   Results: In vivo multiphoton time-lapse analysis revealed that RGC
   dendrites initially exhibit exploratory behavior in multiple directions
   but progressively become apically oriented. The lifetimes of basal and
   apical dendrites were generally comparable before and during the period
   when arbors became biased. However, with maturation, the addition and
   extension rates of basal dendrites were slower than those of the apical
   dendrites. Oriented dendritic arbors were also found in misplaced RGCs
   of the has retina but there was no preferred orientation amongst the
   population. However, has RGCs always projected dendrites toward nearby
   neuropil where amacrine and bipolar cell neurites also terminated.
   Chimera analysis showed that the abnormal dendritic organization of RGCs
   in the mutant was non-cell autonomous.
   Conclusions: Our observations show that RGC dendritic arbors acquire an
   apical orientation by selective and gradual restriction of dendrite
   addition to the apical side of the cell body, rather than by
   preferential dendrite stabilization or elimination. A biased arbor
   emerges at a stage when many of the dendritic processes still appear
   exploratory. The generation of an oriented RGC dendritic arbor is likely
   to be determined by cell-extrinsic cues. Such cues are unlikely to be
   localized to the basal lamina of the inner retina, but rather may be
   provided by cells presynaptic to the RGCs.}},

Title = {{Inference of field-scale fracture transmissivities in crystalline rock
   using flow log measurements}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Characterization of transmissivity for crystalline rock is conducted
   through simulation by conditioning against borehole flow rates obtained
   from high-resolution, in situ field measurements during extraction
   pumping. Full three-dimensional discrete fracture network simulations
   are carried out according to specifications obtained from site
   characterization data in a stochastic Monte Carlo setting. A novel
   method of conditioning is thereby introduced and applied using
   nonparametric comparison tests, which provide quantifiable measures of
   accuracy enabling evaluation of simulated results against field
   measurements. The assumption of a constitutive relationship ( perfect
   correlation) between fracture size and transmissivity is adopted. The
   method is evaluated against both single and multiple realizations,
   various domain size, and fracture length configurations and shown to be
   robust for the cases considered. When the introduced method of
   conditioning is applied, transmissivity parameterization can be inferred
   to a narrow range with a quantifiable accuracy in terms of a probability
   value. Results indicate that elementary interpretation of transmissivity
   based on homogenization of a porous medium will generally underestimate
   transmissivity. Further implications on advective transport for natural
   flow conditions are briefly evaluated, indicating advective breakthrough
   times can be overestimated up to a factor of about 10 in the median.}},

   l trichloroacetimidate (14) was conveniently prepared in six steps by
   regioselective introduction of an N-benzyl carbamate at O-3 of
   6-deoxy-D-glucal 6, followed by mesylation at O-4. Intramolecular
   displacement of the leaving group afforded oxazolidinone 11.
   Azidonitration of the bicyclic glycal 11 gave the glycosyl nitrate
   anomers 12 in good yield and stereoselectivity. Hydrolysis of the
   anomeric nitrates under aqueous conditions gave the pyranose 13, which
   was easily converted into the imidate 14. Glycosylation of cyclohexanol

Abstract = {{An important development in behavioral neuroscience in the past 20 years
   has been the demonstration that it is possible to stimulate functional

Title = {{Linkage to HIV Care and Antiretroviral Therapy in Cape Town, South
   Africa}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been scaled-up rapidly in
   Africa. Programme reports typically focus on loss to follow-up and
   mortality among patients receiving ART. However, little is known about
   linkage and retention in care of individuals prior to starting ART.
   Methodology: Data on adult residents from a periurban community in Cape
   Town were collected at a primary care clinic and hospital. HIV testing
   registers, CD4 count results provided by the National Health Laboratory
   System and ART registers were linked. A random sample (n = 885) was
   drawn from adults testing HIV positive through antenatal care, sexual
   transmitted disease and voluntary testing and counseling services
   between January 2004 and March 2009. All adults (n = 103) testing HIV
   positive through TB services during the same time period were also
   included in the study. Linkage to HIV care was defined as attending for
   a CD4 count measurement within 6 months of HIV diagnosis. Linkage to ART
   care was defined as initiating ART within 6 months of HIV diagnosis in
   individuals with a CD4 count <= 200 cells/mu l taken within 6 months of
   HIV diagnosis.
   Findings: Only 62.6\% of individuals attended for a CD4 count
   measurement within 6 months of testing HIV positive. Individuals testing
   through sexually transmitted infection services had the best (84.1\%)
   and individuals testing on their own initiative (53.5\%) the worst
   linkage to HIV care. One third of individuals with timely CD4 counts
   were eligible for ART and 66.7\% of those were successfully linked to
   ART care. Linkage to ART care was highest among antenatal care clients.
   Among individuals not yet eligible for ART only 46.3\% had a repeat CD4
   count. Linkage to HIV care improved in patients tested in more recent
   calendar period.
   Conclusion: Linkage to HIV and ART care was low in this poor peri-urban
   community despite free services available within close proximity. More
   efforts are needed to link VCT scale-up to subsequent care.}},

Abstract = {{Cediranib
   (4-{[}(4-fluoro-2-methyl-1H-indol-5-yl)oxy]-6-methoxy-7-{[}3-(1-pyrrolid
   inyl)propoxy]quinazoline, RECENTIN (TM)), a vascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of all three VEGF
   receptors, is currently in Phase III clinical trials for the first-line
   treatment of colorectal cancer and the treatment of recurrent
   glioblastoma
   During its clinical development a unique human metabolite. an
   N(+)-glucuronide, was identified as a major circulating metabolite and
   one of the major metabolites excreted Into faeces Given the possibility
   of four sites for the conjugation of the glucuronic acid moiety,
   determination of the location of the conjugation site on cediranib was
   warranted A small quantity of the N(+)-glucuronide metabolite of
   cediranib was initially generated using recombinant human undine
   glucuronosyltransferase 1A4 (UGT1A4) enzymes The metabolite generated
   was characterised by HPLC-UV and mass spectrometric (HPLC-MS(n))
   detection and confirmed by (1)H NMR spectroscopy However, the exact site
   of conjugation could not be determined without generating more of the
   metabolite Hence a subsequent biosynthetic scale-up experiment was
   devised to generate a sufficiently large quantity for full structural
   characterisation by (1)H NMR spectroscopy
   The identity of the N(+)-glucuronide metabolite generated in the UGT1A4
   scale-up experiment was confirmed by HPLC-MS(n) and displayed the same
   retention time, molecular mass and mass fragmentation data as the
   metabolite generated in previous human liver microsomal and hepatocyte
   incubations.
   (1)H NMR spectroscopy clearly showed the characteristic anomeric doublet
   at approximately 47 ppm, which, following irradiation during selective
   Rotating frame Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (ROESY) experiments,
   enabled the site of glucuronidation to be confirmed on the pyrrolidine
   nitrogen.
   With the exception of the N(+)-glucuronide metabolite, all other human
   metabolites of cediranib were observed following incubation with
   hepatocytes from rat and cynomolgus monkey, the species used for
   toxicology testing of the drug {[}6] As the N(+)-glucuronide was not
   detected in the preclinical species, it is suggested that its formation
   is more likely in human and higher primates (great apes), a finding
   widely supported in the literature (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{The Stabilisation Potential of Individual and Mixed Assemblages of
   Natural Bacteria and Microalgae}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{It is recognized that microorganisms inhabiting natural sediments
   significantly mediate the erosive response of the bed ({''}ecosystem
   engineers{''}) through the secretion of naturally adhesive organic
   material (EPS: extracellular polymeric substances). However, little is
   known about the individual engineering capability of the main biofilm
   components (heterotrophic bacteria and autotrophic microalgae) in terms
   of their individual contribution to the EPS pool and their relative
   functional contribution to substratum stabilisation. This paper
   investigates the engineering effects on a non-cohesive test bed as the
   surface was colonised by natural benthic assemblages (prokaryotic,
   eukaryotic and mixed cultures) of bacteria and microalgae. MagPI
   (Magnetic Particle Induction) and CSM (Cohesive Strength Meter)
   respectively determined the adhesive capacity and the cohesive strength
   of the culture surface. Stabilisation was significantly higher for the
   bacterial assemblages (up to a factor of 2) than for axenic microalgal
   assemblages. The EPS concentration and the EPS composition
   (carbohydrates and proteins) were both important in determining
   stabilisation. The peak of engineering effect was significantly greater
   in the mixed assemblage as compared to the bacterial (x 1.2) and axenic
   diatom (x 1.7) cultures. The possibility of synergistic effects between
   the bacterial and algal cultures in terms of stability was examined and
   rejected although the concentration of EPS did show a synergistic
   elevation in mixed culture. The rapid development and overall
   stabilisation potential of the various assemblages was impressive (x 7.5
   and x9.5, for MagPI and CSM, respectively, as compared to controls). We
   confirmed the important role of heterotrophic bacteria in
   ``biostabilisation{''} and highlighted the interactions between
   autotrophic and heterotrophic biofilm consortia. This information
   contributes to the conceptual understanding of the microbial sediment
   engineering that represents an important ecosystem function and service

Abstract = {{G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of
   integral membrane proteins present in all eukaryotic cells, yet
   relatively little information about their structure, folding, and
   stability has been published. In this work, we describe several
   approaches to characterizing the conformational stability of the human
   adenosine A(2)a receptor (hA(2)aR). Thermal denaturation and chemical
   denaturation were not reversible, yet clear differences in the unfolding
   behavior were observed upon ligand binding via circular dichroism and
   fluorescence spectrometry. We found that the stability of hA(2)aR was
   increased upon incubation with the agonist N-6-cyclohexyladenosine or
   the antagonist theophylline. When extracellular disulfide bonds were
   reduced with a chemical reducing agent, the ligand binding activity
   decreased by similar to 40\%, but reduction of these bonds did not
   compromise the unfolding transition observed via urea denaturation.
   Overall, these approaches offer a general strategy for characterizing
   the effect of surfactant and ligand effects on the stability of GPCRs.}},

Title = {{Transcriptome analysis of germinating maize kernels exposed to
   smoke-water and the active compound KAR}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Smoke released from burning vegetation functions as an
   important environmental signal promoting the germination of many plant
   species following a fire. It not only promotes the germination of
   species from fire-prone habitats, but several species from
   non-fire-prone areas also respond, including some crops. The germination
   stimulatory activity can largely be attributed to the presence of a
   highly active butenolide compound, 3-methyl-2H-furo{[}2,3-c]pyran-2-one
   (referred to as karrikin 1 or KAR(1)), that has previously been isolated
   from plant-derived smoke. Several hypotheses have arisen regarding the
   molecular background of smoke and KAR(1) action.
   Results: In this paper we demonstrate that although smoke-water and
   KAR(1) treatment of maize kernels result in a similar physiological
   response, the gene expression and the protein ubiquitination patterns
   are quite different. Treatment with smoke-water enhanced the
   ubiquitination of proteins and activated protein-degradation-related
   genes. This effect was completely absent from KAR(1)-treated kernels, in
   which a specific aquaporin gene was distinctly upregulated.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the array of bioactive compounds
   present in smoke-water form an environmental signal that may act
   together in germination stimulation. It is highly possible that the
   smoke/KAR(1) `signal' is perceived by a receptor that is shared with the
   signal transduction system implied in perceiving environmental cues
   (especially stresses and light), or some kind of specialized receptor
   exists in fire-prone plant species which diverged from a more general
   one present in a common ancestor, and also found in non fire-prone
   plants allowing for a somewhat weaker but still significant response.
   Besides their obvious use in agricultural practices, smoke and KAR(1)
   can be used in studies to gain further insight into the transcriptional
   changes during germination.}},

   model of kidney yin deficiency induced with thyroxine and reserpine as
   well as the therapeutic effect of Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (LW) and its
   separated prescriptions, a classic traditional Chinese medicine formula
   for treating kidney yin deficiency in China The study utilized
   ultra-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization synapt
   high definition mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-SYNAPT-HDMS) in both
   negative and positive electrospray ionization (ESI) At the same time,
   blood biochemistry was examined to identify specific changes in the
   kidney yin deficiency Distinct changes in the pattern of metabolites, as
   a result of daily administration of thyroxine and reserpine, were
   observed by UPLC-HDMS combined with a principal component analysis
   (PCA). The changes in metabolic profiling were restored to their
   baseline values after treatment with LW according to the PCA score plots
   Altogether, the current metabonomic approach based on UPLC-HDMS and
   orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminate analysis

Abstract = {{Recent reports have demonstrated that topical and systemic application
   of naltrexone markedly improves the characteristic signs of diabetic
   keratopathy; most notably, impaired corneal sensation and delayed wound
   repair. The aim of this study was to prepare and characterise non-ionic
   surfactant vesicles (niosomes) for the ocular drug delivery of
   naltrexone hydrochloride. The niosomes were prepared using the thin film
   hydration method and characterised using polarized light microscopy,
   cryo-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM), percent drug entrapment
   efficiency (EE\%), laser light diffraction and differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC). Two classes of non-ionic surfactants (sorbitan esters
   and polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers) were investigated. The results
   revealed that tuning of cholesterol concentrations can significantly
   alter the niosome's physical properties including sizes, EE\% and
   membrane fluidity (thermo-responsiveness). The prepared vesicles were in
   the range of 7.0 +/- 1.0 to 14.6 +/- 0.8 mu m in size. The prepared
   niosomes showed different abilities to accommodate cholesterol. This was
   highly dependent on the structure and continuity of the hydrophobic
   chains of the used surfactants. Span 60-based vesicles containing 30\%
   mol/mol of cholesterol showed the highest EE\%. The microstructure and
   lamellarity of the niosomes were studied using Cryo-SEM. Typical
   concentric multilayered structures (onion or rose-like) were seen
   suggesting the formation of multilamellar vesicles. DSC-studies
   conducted on Span 60-based niosomes containing 30\% mol/mol cholesterol
   revealed liquid-gel transition (T-m and entropy of 43.5 degrees C and
   0.82 kcal/mol, respectively). Such transition reflects potential
   thermo-responsive properties, which is desirable for ocular delivery.}},

Title = {{Fermi Large Area Telescope observations of Local Group galaxies:
   detection of M31 and search for M33}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{Context. Cosmic rays (CRs) can be studied through the galaxy-wide
   gamma-ray emission that they generate when propagating in the
   interstellar medium. The comparison of the diffuse signals from
   different systems may inform us about the key parameters in CR
   acceleration and transport.
   Aims. We aim to determine and compare the properties of the
   cosmic-ray-induced gamma-ray emission of several Local Group galaxies.
   Methods. We use 2 years of nearly continuous sky-survey observations
   obtained with the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space
   Telescope to search for gamma-ray emission from M31 and M33. We compare
   the results with those for the Large Magellanic Cloud, the Small
   Magellanic Cloud, the Milky Way, and the starburst galaxies M82 and NGC
   253.
   Results. We detect a gamma-ray signal at 5 sigma significance in the
   energy range 200 MeV-20 GeV that is consistent with originating from
   M31. The integral photon flux above 100 MeV amounts to (9.1 +/-
   1.9(stat) +/- 1.0(sys)) x 10(-9) ph cm(-2) s(-1). We find no evidence
   for emission from M33 and derive an upper limit on the photon flux > 100
   MeV of 5.1 x 10(-9) ph cm(-2) s(-1) (2 sigma). Comparing these results
   to the properties of other Local Group galaxies, we find indications of
   a correlation between star formation rate and gamma-ray luminosity that
   also holds for the starburst galaxies.
   Conclusions. The gamma-ray luminosity of M31 is about half that of the
   Milky Way, which implies that the ratio between the average CR densities
   in M31 and the Milky Way amounts to xi = 0.35 +/- 0.25. The observed
   correlation between gamma-ray luminosity and star formation rate
   suggests that the flux of M33 is not far below the current upper limit
   from the LAT observations.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of abnormal cervical
   cytology in women with infertility problems with that of fertile women
   by using ThinPrep (R) liquid-based Pap Tests (TM). A retrospective
   case-control study for over 2 years was conducted. The cases included
   all women with infertility problems who had Pap tests during their
   infertility treatment period. The cases were further subdivided into
   primary and secondary infertility groups. The control group included all
   women without infertility problems who had routine Pap tests in the same
   period. The age and demographic features were adjusted and matched for
   both groups. Statistical analysis included chi-square test and Fischer
   exact test. The infertility group (n = 490) showed significantly (P <
   0.05) more abnormal cervical squamous epithelial abnormalities (48
   positive cases, 9.8\%) than the controls (n = 7,150, 216 positive cases,
   3\%). Women with secondary infertility had more epithelial abnormalities
   and more high-grade lesions than women with primary infertility. Women
   with infertility had statistically significant higher frequency of
   squamous intraepithelial lesions than women without infertility problems
   of similar age and demographic background. The data suggest that women
   with infertility might benefit from more frequent cervical cytology

Abstract = {{Objective To explore the association of maxillary first molar agenesis
   with other dental anomalies in Japanese orthodontic patients
   Materials and Methods A total of 32 subjects with one or two
   congenitally missing maxillary first molars (group M) were selected and
   divided into group 1M (12 subjects with one maxillary first molar
   missing) and group 2M (20 subjects with two maxillary first molars
   missing) As controls, 32 sex-matched subjects without agenesis of
   maxillary first molars were collected (group C) Panoramic and periapical
   radiographs, cephalograms, study models, intraoral photographs, and
   anamnestic data were used to identify anomalies of permanent teeth
   Chi-square, Fisher's exact, Kruskal-Wallis, and Steel-Dwass tests were
   used to make statistical comparisons
   Results The prevalence rates of tooth agenesis other than the maxillary
   first molars and advanced tooth agenesis, with third molars excluded,
   were significantly higher in group 2M than in group C The absence of
   second premolars was most common The prevalence rate of third molar
   agenesis was significantly higher in groups 1M and 2M than in group C
   The occurrence of symmetrical agenesis of the mandibular third molars
   was particularly notable in group 2M as compared to group 1M, in which
   maxillary third molar agenesis was predominant There was no significant
   association between maxillary first molar agenesis and other dental
   anomalies, except for agenesis of teeth other than maxillary first
   molars
   Conclusion Agenesis of maxillary first molars is associated with a
   higher prevalence of other permanent tooth agenesis and advanced tooth
   agenesis (Angle Orthod 2010,80 1002-1009)}},

Abstract = {{A transboundary aquifer is a body of groundwater intersected by two or
   more countries with the potential threat of dispute over a shared
   groundwater resource A large portion of the population in East Africa
   relies on surface water resources for day to-day activities in turn this
   is dependent on episodic rainfall Surface water in the region is
   vulnerable to pollution and potential climate change Consequently
   frequent conflict over the water use is a regular event in the region
   This paper examines the transboundary aquifers and their significance
   for water supply in the six adjacent Intergovernmental Authority on
   Development (IGAD) countries (Ethiopia Eritrea Sudan Kenya Somalia and
   Djibouti) Analysis of available literature and short field visits to
   accessible areas were undertaken in order to examine the geology
   hydrogeological dynamics and water use The geology of the transboundary
   aquifers is mainly represented by Precambrian basement Mesozoic
   sedimentary rocks Cenozoic volcanics and recent alluvial deposits Taking
   into consideration the topographic setting and water circulation the
   Ethiopian highlands are the major sources of recharge to the
   transboundary aquifers of the adjacent countries The surface runoff
   drains through 11 major rivers into the neighbouring countries The
   groundwater contained in the transboundary aquifers is yet to receive
   attention by the various countries but the future trend is towards
   exploiting the resources to alleviate water shortages in the region It
   is hoped that the systematic development of these groundwater resources
   would strengthen cooperation in this conflict-dominated region (C) 2010

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{The possibility that allogeneic T cells may be targeted to leukemia has
   important therapeutic implications. As most tumor antigens represent
   self-proteins, high-avidity tumorspecific T cells are largely deleted
   from the repertoire of the patient. In contrast, T cells from major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched donors provide naive
   repertoires wherein such cells have not been systematically eliminated.
   Yet, evidence for peptide degeneracy or poly-specificity warrants
   caution in the use of foreign human leukocyte antigen (HLA) or peptide
   complexes as therapeutic targets. Here, we cocultured
   HLA-A{*}0201-negative T cells with autologous dendritic cells engineered
   to present HLA-A{*}0201 complexed with a peptide from the B cell antigen
   CD20 (CD20p). HLA-A{*}0201/CD20p pentamer-reactive CD8(+) T cells were
   readily obtained from all donors. The polyclonal cells showed exquisite
   peptide and MHC specificity, and efficiently killed
   HLA-A{*}0201-positive B cells, including primary chronic lymphocytic
   leukemia cells. The T cell receptor (TCR) sequences displayed a novel
   type of conservation, with extensive homology in the TCR beta chain
   complementarity-determining region 3 and in J, but not V, region. This
   is surprising, as the donors were HLA disparate and their TCR
   repertoires are expected to show little overlap. The results demonstrate
   the first public recognition motif for an allogeneic HLA/peptide
   complex. The allo-restricted T cells or TCRs could provide
   graft-versus-leukemia in the absence of graft-versus-host disease.

Abstract = {{Copper carboxylates were identified as degradation residues on the
   surface of a metallic pigment used in the illumination and in the text
   of a 9th century Italian manuscript containing the Homilies on the
   Gospels of Gregory the Great, belonging to the Archive and Chapter
   Library of Vercelli (Italy). These compounds are responsible of the
   greenish aspect that several text lines and decorated initials have
   developed over time from their original golden texture, starting from
   more than a century as could be guessed from the early 20th century
   descriptions of the manuscript by art historians. Further, Raman
   investigations carried out on a particle recovered from the gutters
   between folios allowed (1) the identification with good accuracy of the
   nature of these compounds, confirmed by scanning electron
   microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis, (2) proposing a
   hypothesis on their origin as due to the interaction of copper with
   carboxylic acids and (3) making suggestions on the proper restoration
   intervention; moreover, evidence was found for similar compounds in
   three 9th-10th century Italian manuscripts coming from Bobbio abbey.

Volume = {{663}},
Pages = {{120-147}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Multiple-scale asymptotics is used to analyse the Euler equations for
   the dynamical situation of a gravity wave (GW) near breaking level. A
   simple saturation argument in combination with linear theory is used to
   obtain the relevant dynamical scales. As a small expansion parameter,
   the ratio of the inverse of the vertical wavenumber and potential
   temperature and pressure scale heights is used, which we allow to be of
   the same order of magnitude here. It is shown that the resulting
   equation hierarchy is consistent with that obtained from the
   pseudo-incompressible equations, both for non-hydrostatic and
   hydrostatic GWs, while this is not the case for the anelastic equations
   unless the additional assumption of sufficiently weak stratification is
   adopted. To describe vertical propagation of wavepackets over several
   atmospheric-scale heights, Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) theory is
   used to show that the pseudo-incompressible flow divergence generates
   the same amplitude equation that also obtains from the full Euler
   equations. This gives a mathematical justification for the use of the
   pseudo-incompressible equations in the study of GW breaking in the
   atmosphere for arbitrary background stratification. The WKB theory
   interestingly even holds at wave amplitudes close to static instability.
   In the mean-flow equations, we obtain in addition to the classic
   wave-induced momentum-flux divergences a wave-induced correction of
   hydrostatic balance in the vertical momentum equation, which cannot be
   obtained from Boussinesq or anelastic dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive micropapillary carcinomas (IMPC) of the breast are aggressive
   tumors frequently associated with lymphatic invasion and nodal
   metastasis even when micropapillary (MP) differentiation is very focal
   within the tumors. We have noticed that some breast carcinomas showing
   lymphatic spread but lacking histologic features of IMPC have occasional
   tumor cell clusters reminiscent of those of IMPC without the
   characteristic prominent retraction artifact. To study the
   clinicopathologic significance of such features, we prospectively
   selected 1323 invasive ductal carcinomas and determined the presence and
   extent of MP differentiation and retraction artifact in the tumors. One
   representative tumor block per case was used for immunostaining for
   epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Partial reverse cell polarity (PRCP)
   was defined as prominent linear EMA reactivity on at least part of the
   periphery of tumor cell clusters usually associated with decreased
   cytoplasmic staining. The clinicopathologic features of carcinomas with
   PRCP were compared with IMPC and invasive ductal (no special type)
   carcinomas without this feature. Of the 1323 cases, 96 (7.3\%) and 92
   (7.0\%) showed MP features and the presence of PRCP, respectively. We
   found that the presence of both PRCP and MP features were strongly
   associated with decreased cytoplasmic EMA immunoreactivity and the
   presence of lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis, even if such
   features were present only very focally. Our results suggest that breast
   carcinomas with PRCP may have the same implication as MP differentiation
   and these tumors may represent part of a spectrum of IMPC. Complete or
   partial reversal of cell polarity may play a significant role in
   lymphatic tumor spread.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of feedforward linewidth reduction scheme for semiconductor
   lasers followed by measurements are presented in this paper. The design
   challenges for such a system, followed by improvements to the original
   scheme are explained and demonstrated using top-bench electrooptical
   setups. The experiments are carried out on a commercially available
   1.55-mu m distributed feedback (DFB) laser. The measurement results show
   more than 40 times reduction in frequency noise power spectrum. Also the
   laser original full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) linewidth of 2.6 MHz is
   reduced to less than 140 KHz. The feedforward scheme does not have the
   limited noise cancellation bandwidth, instability, and speed issues that
   are common in feedback linewidth reduction systems. In this scheme, the
   ultimate achievable phase noise will be limited by the noise of
   electronic circuitry and laser intensity noise. Using the proposed
   feedforward approach, the frequency noise of semiconductor lasers can be
   reduced by 3-4 orders of magnitude in a monolithic approach using
   today's low-noise scaled transistors with THz gain-bandwidth product.}},

   The aim of this study was to compare the oral mucosal pH in healthy
   individuals to patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),
   Bulimia nervosa (BN) and burning mouth syndrome (BMS).
   Subjects and methods:
   Using a flat pH meter sensor, pH levels were established in eight
   mucosal sites in 26 healthy individuals, 26 GERD patients, 22 BN
   patients and 29 BMS patients.
   Results:
   A significantly lower pH was found in the BN and GERD groups (6.38 +/-
   00.45, 6.51 +/- 0.32 respectively, P < 0.05) and a higher, but
   non-significant, pH level in the BMS group (7.01 +/- 0.34, P > 0.05)
   compared with the control (C) group (6.82 +/- 0.33).
   Conclusions:
   BMS patients showed no pH differences from C group. The mucosa of BN and
   GERD patients was significantly acidic relative with controls; thus this
   simple technique may serve as a diagnostic tool for identifying
   gastro-esophageal conditions.}},

   Histopathology is diagnostic: most of the lesions are benign. Rarely,
   malignancy develops in any of the somatic components. Aims: To study the
   demographic, clinico-morphological and follow-up data of central nervous
   system (CNS) teratomas. Materials and Methods: Cases diagnosed as mature
   or immature teratomas in the CNS over a 20-year period were included in
   the study. Clinico-radiological, demographic and follow-up data of these
   cases were analyzed. Results: A total of I 4 tumors were diagnosed as
   teratomas. Of these, I I were mature cystic teratomas: and I case each,
   of teratoma with malignant transformation, terato-carcinoma and mixed
   germ cell tumor (immature teratoma with germinoma). Six of the I 4 cases
   were intracranial and 8 were spinal. Presenting features varied
   according to the location. Radiologically, contrast enhancement with
   predominantly solid component was suggestive of malignancy or an
   aggressive tumor. Morphologically, a variety of tissue derivatives were
   seen in the cases. Excision was curative or provided symptomatic relief
   in most cases: terato-carcinoma and mixed germ cell tumor patients
   needed adjuvant radiotherapy. Conclusion: CNS teratomas are rare.

Abstract = {{Studies of urban ethnicity have portrayed ethnic groups as initially
   concentrating in locations where they live in relatively exclusive
   residential areas containing few members of other groups. This
   concentration into ethnic enclaves is commonly regarded as a result of
   disadvantage and discrimination in the labour and housing markets,
   coupled with a desire for residential concentration to promote and
   guarantee group cultural, socioeconomic and physical security. To what
   extent do the neighbourhoods of Accra Metropolitan Area reflect these
   urban ethnicity patterns, and what are the factors shaping the
   concentration of ethnic groups in the city? Using the Location Quotient
   Index based on census data, the paper examines the degree of ethnic
   diversity and concentration in the neighbourhoods of Accra. The findings
   of the study reveal that Accra is not following a Western model of
   segregation, neither is there a single model of African segregation, but
   rather many African trajectories. Economic segregation is the organising
   force underlying residential segregation in Accra, and this operates
   through several social markers, one of which remains the ethnic history
   of migration to Accra. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the effects of organic binders on the crystal
   microstructure of unsupported, Pd2+-impregnated TiO2 membranes. The
   organic binders used in this study were polyvinyl alcohol and
   hydroxypropyl cellulose. The use of the binders is important in the
   production of crack-free membranes. However, the use of the binders
   influenced the microstructure of the unsupported TiO2 membranes. X-ray
   diffraction analysis utilized showed that the addition of binders has
   caused aggregation of palladium oxide (PdO) during its formation in the
   TiO2 network. This phenomenon directly affects the effectiveness of PdO
   presence in the suppression of anatase-rutile phase transition. N-2
   adsorb/desorption analysis was conducted to investigate the Pd2+-TiO2
   membrane morphology at different Pd2+ loading. Based on the observation,
   the presence of 2 wt\% Pd2+ in the TiO2 microstructure has significant
   impacts on the increment of surface area, pore volume, and average pore
   width from the original TiO2. However, the surface area shows decrement
   after the Pd2+ loading was further increased from 2 to 6 and 10 wt\%.}},

Abstract = {{In this Letter, we create an optical nanoantenna array composed of
   parasitic plasmonic loops that can enhance radiation characteristics and
   direct the optical energy successfully. Three metallic loops inspired by
   the concept of the Yagi-Uda antenna are optimized around the region
   where they feature high scattering performance to control the radiation
   beam. The loop geometry, when compared to the dipole configuration, has
   the benefit of using the available aperture in an effective way to
   provide higher directivity. The angular emission of the nanoloop array
   antenna is highly directive, and a directivity of 8.2 dB for upward
   radiation is established. (C) 2010 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The effect of planting window (PW) acting as changing temperature
   scenarios and water availability at critical stages of wheat (Zadok's
   scale) on photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (g(s)) and
   transpiration rate (E) as well as their relationship with yield of
   spring wheat genotypes viz: Chakwal-50, Wafaq-2001 and GA-2002 was
   studied. The research was conducted at three locations of varying
   climatic conditions (National Agricultural Research Centre Islamabad
   (NARC), Barani Agriculture Research Institute Chakwal (BARI) and
   farmer's field at Talagang, District Chakwal) in year 2008-09 and
   2009-10. The results showed that photosynthesis, stomatal conductance
   and transpiration rate were significantly affected under three locations
   due to change in temperature and water availability. Photosynthesis
   (27.03, 24.64 and 22.66 mu mole/m(2)/second), stomatal conductance
   (0.78, 0.31 and 0.09 mole/m(2)/second) were recorded and transpiration
   rate (8.66, 8.17 and 2.07 mole/m(2)/s) were recorded at NARC, Chakwal
   and Talagang, respectively. The values of these attributes were highest
   in growing year 2008-09 due to optimum temperature and water
   availability. The results clearly indicated that CO(2) reduction rate,
   transmission of stomata and water loss rate were dependent on optimum
   temperature and moisture availability. Reduction in moisture
   availability and increase in temperature lead to reduction in
   photosynthesis which ultimately reduces the biomass produced and
   accordingly, limit the yield. Grain yield was observed to be 3540, 2352
   and 1938 kg ha(-1) for NARC, Chakwal and Talagang, respectively, which
   showed a regular reduction under three different observed environments.
   These physiological results of wheat genotypes can be used to find
   adaptive and potential genotypes for changing environment.}},

Abstract = {{(3-(1H-indol-2-yl) phenyl)(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl) methanone (I-387) is
   a novel synthetic compound that inhibits tubulin action and exhibits
   potent antitumor activity in various preclinical models. I-387 inhibited
   the in vitro growth of several human cancer cell lines with IC50 values
   in the range of 15 to 39 nmol/L. Nanomolar concentrations of the
   compound induced apoptosis and caused phosphorylation of the
   antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. I-387 induced a strong and
   concentration-dependent G(2)-M arrest in PC-3 cells by constitutive
   activation of Cdc2/cyclin B1 complex and destabilized polymerization of
   purified tubulin in vitro by binding to the colchicine-binding site. In
   vivo, I-387 treatment effectively inhibited tumor growth in mice bearing
   PC-3 tumor xenografts. In vitro studies of nerve growth factor-dependent
   neurite outgrowth in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells and in vivo studies of
   mouse behavior showed that I-387 was less neurotoxic than vinblastine
   and vincristine, tubulin destabilizers with known neurotoxicity.
   Interestingly, multidrug-resistant cell lines that overexpressed
   P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated proteins, and
   breast cancer resistance protein were rendered resistant to docetaxel,
   vinblastine, SN-38, and doxorubicin, but not to I-387. I-387 dosed at 10
   mg/kg was equally effective with 76\% tumor growth inhibition in
   xenograft models using MES-SA uterine sarcoma cells and MES-SA/DX5 cells
   overexpressing P-gp. In contrast, docetaxel and vinblastine were not
   effective in MES-SA/ DX5 xenograft models. The potent in vitro and in
   vivo antitumor activity of I-387 suggests that it may represent a new
   antimitotic agent for management of various malignancies, particularly
   for patients with drug-resistant cancer. Mol Cancer Ther; 9(11);

Abstract = {{The process of multiwavelengh detection by a single system is possible
   when considering multi-level structures. Indeed, in a quantum structure
   with specific profile, levels can be confined in a single band leading
   to Infrared intersubband transitions which may be responsible of strong
   enough absorption. In this work we present the theoretical determination
   of the absorption spectra in a specific GaAs/AlGaAs super-lattice
   containing four confined minibands. For this, we have calculated the
   electronic states, the dipole matrix elements and the Fermi level's
   position versus temperature and doping. We analyze the importance of the
   different transitions absorption peaks and their behavior when varying
   either the temperature or the free electrons density, both in the
   parabolic and the non parabolic cases.}},

   separate or overlapping populations of primary afferent and second-order

   trigeminal ganglion (TG) cells showed that 15.4\% responded to
   histamine, 5.8\% to the protease-activated receptor (PAR)-2 agonist,
   13.4\% to allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), and 36.7\% to capsaicin. AITC
   and/or capsaicin activated the vast majority of histamine-and PAR-2
   agonist-sensitive TG cells. A chemical search strategy identified
   second-order neurons in trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc) responsive
   to histamine, the PAR-2 agonist, or AITC. A minority of histamine or
   PAR-2 agonist-responsive Vc neurons responded to the other pruritogen,
   whereas a large majority of puritogen-responsive Vc neurons responded to
   capsaicin and/or AITC. A minority of AITC-responsive Vc neurons
   responded to pruritogens, whereas most responded to capsaicin. These
   data indicate that most primary and higher-order trigeminal sensory
   neurons are activated by both pruritic and algesic stimuli, although a
   minority exhibit selectivity. The results are discussed in terms of
   population codes for itch and pain that result in distinct behavioral
   responses of hindlimb scratching and forelimb wiping that are mediated
   at lumbar and cervical segmental levels, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   BK virus nephropathy (BKVN) was reported in up to 7.5\% of patients
   after simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPK). Its management
   by reduction in immunosuppression might pre-dispose to pancreatic graft
   loss.
   Methods:
   A retrospective analysis of 178 SPK recipients was performed. All
   patients received thymoglobulin, daclizumab and a maintenance of
   low-dose steroids, tacrolimus, and either sirolimus or mycophenolate.
   Results:
   Two (1.1\%) patients were identified with BKVN. Time of diagnosis was 22
   and 45 months after transplant. Both patients had superimposed
   calcineurin toxicity in their graft biopsies. Immunosuppression was
   reduced in both patients, and leflunomide (LEF) was used in one patient.
   Concurrent kidney rejection episodes were treated with steroid pulses in
   both patients. One kidney graft improved with a last estimated
   glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 43 mL/min, and another kidney graft
   showed limited improvement with a last GFR of 30 mL/min. Pancreatic
   graft function remained excellent in both patients as assessed by serum
   c-peptide, glycosylated hemoglobin, amylase-lipase, and urine amylase
   levels.
   Conclusion:
   Low incidence of BKVN was observed in our SPK series. Reduction in
   immunosuppression and sometimes LEF can be effective. The underlying
   mechanism of stable pancreatic allograft function despite ongoing kidney
   rejection warrants further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of classical and irregular streaming motion on convective
   heat transfer in air-filled shallow enclosures carrying a standing sound
   wave are investigated. The fluid motion is driven by the periodic
   vibration of the enclosure left wall. The vertical walls of the
   enclosure are adiabatic while the horizontal walls are heated
   differentially. The fully compressible form of the Navier-Stokes
   equations are considered to compute the oscillatory and mean flow
   fields. A control-volume method based, explicit time-marching
   Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) Algorithm is used to simulate the
   transport phenomena in the enclosure. The simulation results of a test
   case for an unheated enclosure are compared with the existing literature
   for code validation. Transverse temperature gradient strongly affects
   the acoustic streaming structures and velocities. The streaming motion
   significantly enhances overall heat transfer from the bottom wall
   compared to pure conduction. Enhancement is more pronounced in the
   presence of irregular streaming. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{From several years the study of binary compounds has been intensified in
   order to find new materials for solar photocells. The development of
   thin film solar cells is an active area of research at this time. Much
   attention has been paid to the development of low cost, high efficiency
   thin film solar cells. CdTe is one of the suitable candidates for the
   production of thin film solar cells due to its ideal band gap, high
   absorption coefficient. The present work deals with thickness dependent
   study of CdTe thin films. Nanocrystalline CdTe bulk powder was
   synthesized by wet chemical route at pH approximate to 11.2 using
   cadmium chloride and potassium telluride as starting materials. The
   product sample was characterized by transmission electron microscope,
   X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope. The structural
   characteristics studied by X-ray diffraction showed that the films are
   polycrystalline in nature. CdTe thin films with thickness 40, 60, 80 and
   100 nm were prepared on glass substrates by using thermal evaporation
   onto glass substrate under a vacuum of 10(-6) Torr. The optical
   constants (absorption coefficient, optical band gap, refractive index,
   extinction coefficient, real and imaginary part of dielectric constant)
   of CdTe thin films was studied as a function of photon energy in the
   wavelength region 4002000 nm. Analysis of the optical absorption data
   shows that the rule of direct transitions predominates. It has been
   found that the absorption coefficient, refractive index (n) and
   extinction coefficient (k) decreases while the values of optical band
   gap increase with an increase in thickness from 40 to 100 urn, which can
   be explained qualitatively by a thickness dependence of the grain size
   through decrease in grain boundary barrier height with grain size. (C)

Abstract = {{This study describes a novel cytoskeletal array in fiber cells of the
   ocular lens of the rat and shows its relationship to the classical
   terminal web of other epithelial tissues. Naive adult Sprague-Dawley
   rats (n = 28) were utilized. F-actin, fodrin, myosin IIA, and CP49
   distribution was assessed in anterior and posterior polar sections. For
   functional analysis, lenses were cultured with or without cytochalasin-D
   for 3 hr, then processed for confocal microscopy or assessed by laser
   scan analysis along sutures. Phalloidin labeling demonstrated a dense
   mesh of F-actin adjacent to posterior sutural domains to a subcapsular
   depth of 400 mu m. Anterior polar sections revealed a comparable actin
   structure adjacent to anterior suture branches however, it was not
   developed in superficial fibers. Fodrin and myosin were localized within
   the web-like actin apparatus. The data was used to construct a model
   showing that the cytoskeletal array is located within the blunt,
   variable-width fiber ends that abut at sutures such that the ``terminal
   web{''} flanks the suture on either side. Treatment with cytochalasin-D
   resulted in partial disassembly of the ``terminal web{''} and perturbed
   cellular organization. Laser scan analysis revealed that cytochalasin-D
   treated lenses had significantly greater focal variability than control
   lenses (P = 0.020). We conclude that cortical fibers of rat lenses
   contain a bipolar structure that is structurally and compositionally
   analogous to classical terminal webs. The results indicate that the lens
   ``terminal web{''} functions to stabilize lens fiber ends at sutures
   thus minimizing structural disorder, which in turn, promotes the
   establishment and maintenance of lens transparency. Anat Rec,

Abstract = {{Prior to this study, phosphogypsum (PG) stockpiles at the Eshidiya mine
   in Jordan were thought to be potentially enriched with potentially toxic
   metals and radionuclides, resulting in possible environmental
   degradation of the surrounding ecosystem. In order to investigate this
   phenomenon, enrichment levels and distribution patterns of metals (e.g.
   Zn, Cd, V) and radionuclides in the underlying soils, alluvium, and
   yellow marl bedrock were determined and compared against those in the PG
   stockpiles. The Ra-226, Pb-210, and U-238 in soil reached peak
   concentrations of 1.5 pCi/g, 2.0 pCi/g, and 1.1 pCi/g, respectively.
   These elemental concentrations are similar to their concetrations in the
   uncontaminated soils, whereas the concentrations of these elements
   exhibit higher concentrations in PG and are as follows: Ra-226= 18
   pCi/g, Pb-210= 19 pCi/g, and U-238= 4 pCi/g. The elements Cd, Zn, and V
   have maximum concentrations of 3 mg kg(-1), 69 mg kg(-1) and 62 mg
   kg(-1), respectively, in the soil's layer. These elemental
   concentrations are relatively lower than in uncontaminated soil and the
   PG. The degrees of mobility of the determined elements in soils were
   classified into three categories: elements with high mobility are Se,
   Mn, Pb, and Cr; those with moderate mobility are Co, Ni, As, Hg, Cu, V,
   and Zn; and those with low mobility are U, Cd, Pb-210, Ra-226, and
   U-238. Following correlation analysis, R-mode factor analysis was
   applied in conjunction with mineralogy to understand the geochemical
   variability of the soil. Four main meaningful factors were extracted: a
   detrital quartz factor, a clay minerals factor, a carbonate factor, and
   a terrigenous minerals factor. To investigate the spatial distribution
   patterns of the elements, a contour mapping technique was applied,
   allowing the following conclusions: (1) The elements Pb-210, Ra-226, and
   U exhibit similar distribution patterns; (2) Cd and Cu show similar
   distribution patterns; (3) As and V exhibit similar distribution
   patterns; and (4) no observed trend was observed for Cr. Generally, the
   results revealed that potentially toxic metals and radionuclides are not
   contaminated in soils related to the phosphogypsum stockpiles, and the
   soils of the Eshidiya area do not contain potentially toxic metals and
   radionuclide concentrations that threaten the surrounding ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To compare the effects on enamel demineralization and
   fluoride (F) retention of two different brushing-rinsing regimens.
   Material and methods. An in-situ caries model with orthodontic bands was
   used for 8-9 weeks. A total of 20 orthodontic patients participated.
   They were randomized into two groups: (1) a test group using 5000 ppm F
   (n = 10) with no post-brushing water rinsing; and (2) a control group
   using 1450 ppm F (n = 10) with three sessions of post-brushing water
   rinsing. Orthodontic stainless-steel bands were applied to the two upper
   first premolars, leaving 2-3 mm of space away from the exposed buccal
   surface in order to accumulate plaque and provoke initial caries
   development. The teeth were extracted after 8 and 9 weeks, then analysed
   using quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF). Additionally, oral
   F retention was compared for the two groups. Results. In comparison to
   the control group, the test regimen resulted in a nonsignificant smaller
   QLF lesion area and a significantly lower average QLF loss of
   fluorescence (P < 0.05). The highest F retention concentration under the
   band was found in the test group (P < 0.001). Conclusions. The
   combination of using a 5000 ppm F toothpaste and no post-brushing water
   rinsing had a greater anti-caries potential and resulted in elevated
   oral F retention compared to a 1450 ppm F toothpaste with three sessions
   of post-brushing water rinsing.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Fixed pulmonary hypertension (FPH) is considered a
   contraindication to cardiac transplantation. Ventricular assist device
   (VAD) therapy through prolonged left ventricular unloading may reverse
   FPH. Our aim was to assess post-transplant outcomes and survival in
   patients with and without FPH undergoing VAD implantation as bridge to
   transplant.
   METHODS: Fifty-four patients received an intracorporeal left VAD (LVAD)
   as a bridge to transplant from 2000 to 2008 at two institutions
   (Rigshospitalet, Denmark, and the Toronto General Hospital, Canada).
   Twenty-two (41\%) patients had fixed FPH (defined as pulmonary vascular
   resistance {[}PVR] >3 Wood units and resistant to pulmonary
   vasodilators) prior to VAD implant (FPH group) and were compared with 32
   patients without FPH (NoFPH group). Baseline characteristics, pre- and
   post-transplant pulmonary pressures, incidence of complications and
   post-transplant survival were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar except that patients in
   the FPH group were older (46 +/- 11 years vs 39 +/- 13 years in the
   NoFPH group, p < 0.05). The mean pre-VAD PVR was 4.3 +/- 1.7 Wood units
   in the FPH group and 1.7 +/- 0.5 Wood units in the NoFPH group (p <
   0.001). Pulmonary pressures were higher in the FPH group immediately
   prior to VAD implant, but they were comparable immediately
   pre-transplant and during the first year post-transplant. The incidence
   of post-transplant RV failure was not significantly different between
   groups. Post-transplant survival was similar between groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: VAD therapy successfully decreases pulmonary hypertension,
   even in patients with ``fixed{''} FPH, allowing candidacy for heart
   transplantation. Among bridge-to-transplant candidates, the presence of
   FPH does not reduce post-transplant survival. J Heart Lung Transplant

Abstract = {{Taurine is one of the most abundant free amino acids in the central
   nervous system, where it displays several functions. However, its
   molecular targets remain unknown. It is well known that taurine c:an
   activate GABA-A and strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors, which
   increases a chloride conductance. In this study, we describe that acute
   application of taurine induces a dose-dependent inhibition of
   voltage-dependent calcium channels in chromaffin cells from bovine
   adrenal medullae. This taurine effect was not explained by the
   activation of either GABA-A, GABA-B or strychnine-sensitive glycine
   receptors. Interestingly, glycine mimicked the modulatory action exerted
   by taurine on calcium channels, although the acute application of
   glycine did not elicit any ionic current in these cells. Additionally,
   the modulation of calcium channels exerted by both taurine and glycine
   was prevented by the intracellular dialysis of GDP-beta-S. Thus, the
   modulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels by taurine seems to be
   mediated by a metabotropic-like glycinergic receptor coupled to
   G-protein activation in a membrane delimited pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Background We previously reported that over the last 10 years our
   practice has evolved in the treatment of neurogenic tumors of the pelvis
   to include a multispecialty team of surgeons, a factor that might
   decrease morbidity and improve recurrence, survival, and function.
   Questions/purposes Therefore, we (1) assessed the morbidity associated
   with surgical excision in patients with neurogenic tumors of the pelvis;
   (2) determined the function of these patients; and (3) determined the
   rates of local recurrence, metastasis, and overall survival with this
   new approach.
   Methods We reviewed the records of all 38 patients who had surgery for a
   pelvic plexus tumor between 1994 and 2005. Twenty one were male. The
   mean age of all patients was 38 years and median follow up was 2.1
   years. Twelve patients had a malignant tumor. We recorded demographic
   data, postoperative complications, tumor-specific recurrence, and
   determined survival.
   Results Postoperative complications occurred in nine of the 38 patients
   (23\%): hematoma (n = 3), wound infection or deep abscess (n = 3), and
   deep venous thrombosis (n = 3). Surgical complications occurred more
   frequently in patients with malignant disease. Patients with benign
   tumors had a mean MSTS score of 94\%, while survivors of malignant
   disease had a mean of 57\%. For malignant tumors, the 5-year rate of
   local recurrence was 40\%, the estimated 5-year rate of metastasis was
   67\% and 5-year survival rate was 50\%.
   Conclusion Using a team approach, surgical excision provided high
   functional scores for patients with benign disease with a low rate of
   complications. In patients with malignant tumors, intentional wide
   resection is associated with higher morbidity but yields acceptable
   functional scores.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Despite the recognized importance of patient involvement in
   primary care interactions, little information describing women's needs
   and expectations for these interactions is available. This participatory
   action study was based in Critical Action Theory and designed to
   describe any emancipatory interests that surfaced when eight ethnically
   diverse women examined their interactions with primary care nurse
   practitioners (PCNPs) over the course of five successive focus group
   meetings.
   Data Sources: Focus group meeting transcripts, field notes, interaction
   notations, seating maps, and first impression summaries.
   Conclusions: Participants wanted to learn how to ``stand up{''} for
   themselves in primary care interactions. They believed this could be
   accomplished by developing a positive sense of self-esteem. Ultimately,
   they identified the right way to ``talk back{''} to clinicians and
   created a method for regaining control of their own health care and
   maintaining equality in interactions with primary care clinicians.
   Implications for Practice: Nurse practitioners working in the primary
   setting are especially well situated to support self-management and
   foster patient participation by women as they live with chronic disease,
   engage in health promotion activities, and deal with common symptomatic
   problems for themselves and their families.}},

Abstract = {{Externally prestressed segmental (EPS) concrete beams are widely used in
   the construction of bridge structures today. The EPS concept has become
   an attractive tool for rehabilitation and strengthening of existing
   bridges which have insufficient strength and/or excessive deflection and
   cracking. EPS bridges are affected by combined stresses (bending, shear,
   normal, and torsion) at the joint interface between the segments. This
   paper presents an experimental investigation of the structural behaviour
   of EPS bridge beams under combined stresses, i.e. bending, shear and
   torsional stresses. An experimental study of two different external
   tendon layouts, two types of joint between segments and different levels
   of torsional force applied at different load eccentricities was
   conducted. It was concluded that torsion reduced the vertical load and
   vertical deflection at the onset point of nonlinearity as well as at a
   failure load. Furthermore, the opening between segments was the reason
   behind the nonlinear behaviour of EPS beams. Torsion did not only alter
   the value of the failure load, tendon strain and deflection of the beams
   but it also altered the failure mechanism. Furthermore, due to the shear
   key, there was a difference between the onset points of nonlinearity
   load for the different tendon layouts and joint types. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Context: Black women have lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D {[}25(OH)D] and
   higher PTH than white women. Recent evidence implicates PTH in adverse
   cardiovascular outcomes.
   Objective: The objective of the study was to determine whether PTH
   increases at lower 25(OH)D levels (the threshold) in black compared with
   white women.
   Design: Healthy black and white women, aged 20-80 yr were recruited to
   participate in a cross-sectional study of body-composition in black and
   white women. Measurement of serum 25(OH)D and PTH were carried out.
   Setting: The study was a convenience sample recruited from a community
   setting.
   Patients: Healthy black and white women were recruited by advertising
   and a direct mail campaign in a comparative study of body composition.
   Age ranged from 20-to 80 yr. There were 148 black and 129 white
   premenopausal participants and 87 black and 139 white postmenopausal
   participants.
   Main Outcome: The main outcome was to determine whether the threshold
   for 25(OH)D/PTH differs in black and white women.
   Results: A threshold of 37 nmol/liter (95\% confidence interval 35-40)
   was found for black and 59 nmol/liter (95\% confidence interval 56-63)
   for white women. These two values were significantly different (P <
   0.001).
   Conclusions: Black women have an increase in serum PTH at a lower
   25(OH)D level than white women. Negative health outcomes of higher PTH
   should be investigated in black women. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 95:

Abstract = {{P>We investigated the incidence of trailing growth with fluconazole in
   101 clinical Candida isolates (49 C. albicans and 52 C. tropicalis) and
   tried to establish the convenient susceptibility testing method and
   medium for fluconazole minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
   determination. MICs were determined by CLSI M27-A2 broth microdilution
   (BMD) and Etest methods on RPMI-1640 agar supplemented with 2\% glucose
   (RPG) and on Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 2\% glucose and 0.5
   mu g ml-1 methylene blue (GMB). BMD and Etest MICs were read at 24 and
   48 h, and susceptibility categories were compared. All isolates were
   determined as susceptible with BMD, Etest-RPG and Etest-GMB at 24 h.
   While all isolates were interpreted as susceptible at 48 h on Etest-RPG
   and Etest-GMB, one C. albicans isolate was interpreted as
   susceptible-dose dependent (S-DD) and two C. tropicalis isolates were
   interpreted as resistant with BMD. On Etest-RPG, trailing growth caused
   widespread microcolonies within the inhibition zone and resulted in
   confusion in MIC determination. On Etest-GMB, because of the nearly
   absence of microcolonies within the zone of inhibition, MICs were
   evaluated more easily. We conclude that, for the determination of
   fluconazole MICs of trailing Candida isolates, the Etest method has an
   advantage over BMD and can be used along with this reference method.
   Moreover, GMB appears more beneficial than RPG for the fluconazole
   Etest.}},

Abstract = {{AD (Alzheimer's disease) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of
   unknown origin. Despite questions as to the underlying cause(s) of this
   disease, shared risk factors for both AD and atherosclerotic
   cardiovascular disease indicate that vascular mechanisms may critically
   contribute to the development and progression of both AD and
   atherosclerosis. An increased risk of developing AD is linked to the
   presence of the apoE4 (apolipoprotein E4) allele, which is also strongly
   associated with increased risk of developing atherosclerotic
   cardiovascular disease. Recent studies also indicate that cardiovascular
   risk factors, including elevated blood cholesterol and triacylglycerol
   (triglyceride), increase the likelihood of AD and vascular dementia.
   Lipids and lipoproteins in the circulation interact intimately with the
   cerebrovasculature, and may have important effects on its constituent
   brain microvascular endothelial cells and the adjoining astrocytes,
   which are components of the neurovascular unit. The present review will
   examine the potential mechanisms for understanding the contributions of
   vascular factors, including lipids, lipoproteins and cerebrovascular A
   beta (amyloid beta), to AD, and suggest therapeutic strategies for the
   attenuation of this devastating disease process. Specifically, we will
   focus on the actions of apoE, TGRLs (triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins)
   and TGRL lipolysis products on injury of the neurovascular unit and
   increases in blood-brain barrier permeability.}},

Journal = {{POSTGRADUATE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{87-97}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) and osteoarthritis (OA) of any
   joint are highly prevalent, occurring in > 50\% of US adults aged >= 60
   years. Opioids are prescribed more frequently for CLBP and OA than for
   any other noncancer pain, and the judicious use of opioids is
   recommended by treatment guidelines for the management of CLBP and OA
   pain. Objective: To review the appropriate role of opioid analgesics in
   the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe pain due to CLBP or OA
   and provide recommendations for best practices when prescribing opioids.
   Methods: Articles were identified through a search of PubMed. Additional
   references were identified for inclusion from the reference lists of
   articles identified via the literature search, treatment guidelines, and
   Cochrane Reviews. Results: The available data suggest that opioid
   therapy represents a valuable treatment option in patients who do not
   respond to other analgesics and in whom the potential benefits of
   treatment outweigh the potential risks. Prescribing physicians need to
   perform vigilant patient screening and monitoring for signs of abuse,
   intervene promptly to manage or prevent adverse events and drug
   interactions, tailor opioid therapy to individual patients'
   comorbidities, and know how to switch or rotate opioids to find the best
   treatment option. Conclusions: Prescribers need to understand the place
   of opioid therapy in a multimodal treatment program that includes
   patient rehabilitation to reduce pain and improve function. The
   analgesic benefits of opioids must be balanced against concerns about
   addiction and abuse, adverse events, and their potential impact on other
   aspects of treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The phenolic compounds in extracts from pressed olive cake were
   investigated. Free phenolic compounds were extracted from olive cake
   using methanol. To liberate bound phenolic compounds, the olive cake was
   subjected to basic and acidic hydrolysis followed by methanol
   extraction. The individual phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity
   of the extracts were determined. The highest total phenolic content and
   antioxidant activity were obtained using methanol extraction for 12 h at
   70 degrees C. The RP-HPLC profiles for full-fat and defatted olive cake
   showed that protocatechuic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, sinapic acid,
   p-coumaric acid, twin and hesperidin were the predominant free phenolic
   compounds. Meanwhile, syringic acid, sinapic acid, caffeic acid and
   protocatechuic acid were the predominant bound phenolic acids. A
   positive correlation was observed between total phenolic content and
   antioxidant activity. The results indicated that most of the phenolic
   compounds in olive products were present in their free forms (75-90\% of
   total phenolic content), while bound phenolic compounds were only a
   small proportion (10-25\%) of total phenolic content. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: Fujinon intelligent chromoendoscopy (FICE) is a
   post-processing imaging technique for increasing contrast of mucosa and
   mucosal lesions that might lead to improvement in colonic adenoma
   detection during colonoscopy. Previous studies on similar
   contrast-enhancing techniques as well as on dye staining have yielded
   variable and conflicting results. This large randomized trial was
   undertaken to determine whether FICE technology enhances adenoma
   detection rate (ADR).
   METHODS: In a prospective study performed in a multicenter private
   practice and hospital setting, involving 8 examiners with substantial
   lifetime experience (>10,000 colonoscopies each), 1,318 patients (men
   46.7\%, women 53.3\%; mean age 59.05 years) were randomly assigned to
   colonoscopy with either FICE or white light imaging on instrument
   withdrawal. Of the colonoscopies, 68\% were screening and 32\% were
   diagnostic examinations. The primary outcome measure was the ADR (i.e.,
   number of adenomas/total number of patients).
   RESULTS: There was no difference between the two groups in terms of
   general ADR (0.28 in both groups), the total number of adenomas (184 vs.
   183), or detection of subgroups of adenomas. The rate of identification
   of hyperplastic polyps was also the same in both groups (127 vs. 121;
   P=0.67). The results were the same for both the screening and the
   diagnostic colonoscopy subgroups. Withdrawal time was the same in both
   groups (8.4 vs. 8.3 min, P=0.55).
   CONCLUSIONS: This large randomized trial could not show any objective
   advantage of the FICE technique over conventional high-resolution
   endoscopy in terms of improved ADR.}},

Abstract = {{Self-regulation is believed to involve changes in motivation and
   perception that function to promote goal-driven behavior. However,
   little is known about the way these processes interact during the
   on-line engagement of self-regulation. The present study examined the
   coordination of motivation, perception, and action control in White
   American participants as they regulated responses on a racial
   stereotyping task. Electroencephalographic indices of approach
   motivation (left frontal cortical asymmetry) and perceptual attention to
   Black versus White faces (the P2 event-related potential) were assessed
   during task performance. Action control was modeled from task behavior
   using the process-dissociation procedure. A pattern of moderated
   mediation emerged, such that stronger left frontal activity predicted
   larger P2 responses to race, which in turn predicted better action
   control, especially for participants holding positive racial attitudes.
   Results supported the hypothesis that motivation tunes perception to
   facilitate goal-directed action. Implications for theoretical models of
   intergroup response regulation, the P2 component, and the relation
   between motivation and perception are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The weak gravity conjecture and the shear viscosity to entropy density
   bound place constraints on low energy effective field theories that may
   help to distinguish which theories can be UV completed. Recently, there
   have been suggestions of a possible correlation between the two
   constraints. In some interesting cases, the behavior was precisely such
   that the conjectures were mutually exclusive. Motivated by these works,
   we study the mass to charge and shear viscosity to entropy density
   ratios for charged AdS(5) black branes, which are holographically dual
   to four-dimensional CFTs at finite temperature. We study a family of
   four-derivative and six-derivative perturbative corrections to these
   backgrounds. We identify the region in parameter space where the two
   constraints are satisfied and in particular find that the inclusion of
   the next-to-leading perturbative correction introduces wider
   possibilities for the satisfaction of both constraints.}},

Title = {{Elimination of Active Trachoma after Two Topical Mass Treatments with

Abstract = {{Background: Following an epidemiological study carried out in 2006
   showing a high prevalence of blinding trachoma in the Far North Region
   of Cameroon, a trachoma elimination programme using the SAFE strategy
   was initiated: three yearly trachoma mass treatments were to be
   performed.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The entire district population (120,000
   persons) was treated with azithromycin 1.5\% eye drops in February 2008
   and January 2009. To assess the effect of treatment on the prevalence of
   active trachoma, three epidemiological studies were conducted on a
   representative sample of children aged between 1 and 10 years. The first
   study was performed just prior to the first treatment, the second just
   prior to the 2nd treatment and the third one, one year later. The
   prevalence of active forms of trachoma (TF + TI) dropped from 31.5\%
   (95\% CI 26.4-37.5) before treatment to 6.3\% (95\% CI 4.1-9.6) one year
   after first treatment; a reduction of nearly 80\%. One year after the
   second treatment, the prevalence decreased to 3.1\% (95\% CI 2.0-4.9), a
   total reduction of 90\%. Furthermore, there were no more TI cases (only
   TF). There was no report of serious or systemic side effects. Tolerance
   was excellent.
   Conclusions/Significance: Active trachoma mass treatment with
   azithromycin 1.5\% eye drops is feasible, well tolerated, and effective.}},

Abstract = {{Peptide-functionalized materials show promise in controlling stem cell
   behavior by mimicking cell matrix interactions. Supported lipid bilayers
   are an excellent platform for displaying peptides due to their ease of
   fabrication and low non-specific interactions with cells. In this paper,
   we report on the behavior of adult hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs)
   on phospholipid bilayers functionalized with different RGD-containing
   peptides: either GGGNGEPRGDTYRAY ('bsp-RGD(15)') or GRGDSP. Fluid
   supported bilayers were prepared on glass surfaces by adsorption and
   fusion of small lipid vesicles incorporating synthetic peptide
   amphiphiles. NSCs adhered to bilayers with either GRGDSP or bsp-RGD(15)
   peptide. After 5 days in culture, NSCs formed neurosphere-like
   aggregates on GRGDSP bilayers, whereas on bsp-RGD(15) bilayers a large
   fraction of single adhered cells were observed, comparable to monolayer
   growth seen on laminin controls. NSCs retained their ability to
   differentiate into neurons and astrocytes on both peptide surfaces. This
   work illustrates the utility of supported bilayers in displaying peptide
   ligands and demonstrates that RGD peptides may be useful in synthetic
   culture systems for stem cells. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{At long tempering times in steels when both cementite (Fe3C) and ferrite
   (body-centered cubic (bcc) Fe-rich solid solution) phases are present,
   alloying elements tend to segregate to either of the two phases. The
   elements V. Cr, Mn, Mo and W are found to partition to the cementite
   phase, while Al, Si, P, Co, Ni and Cu partition to ferrite. We show that
   partitioning of alloying elements and cementite (de)stabilization by
   alloying in mixtures of bcc Fe and cementite are intimately related
   through the introduction of a partitioning enthalpy. The formation
   enthalpy of alloying-element-substituted cementite is shown not to be a
   proper gauge for addressing these questions. (C) 2010 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{Patients who have undergone the Fontan procedure are at risk for
   thrombosis, ventricular dysfunction, and valve regurgitation, but data
   to guide the medical treatment and prevention of these adverse outcomes
   in this population are lacking. This analysis examined medication usage
   among Fontan patients by putative indication and by study center. The
   medical history and current medications of 546 Fontan subjects, ages
   6-18 years, were assessed in a Pediatric Heart Network multicenter
   cross-sectional study. Cardiac imaging was performed within 3 months of
   enrollment. The majority of the subjects (64\%) were taking two or more
   medications. Antithrombotics were taken by 86\% of those with a history
   of stroke, thrombosis, or both and 67\% of those without such a history
   (P = 0.01). Conversely, 14\% of those with a history of stroke,
   thrombosis, or both were taking no antithrombotic.
   Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) therapy was independently
   associated with moderate or severe atrioventricular valve regurgitation
   (P = 0.004), right ventricular morphology (P < 0.001), and shorter time
   since Fontan (P = 0.004) but not with ventricular systolic dysfunction.
   Glycoside therapy and diuretic therapy each was associated with older
   age at Fontan (P = 0.001 and P = 0.023, respectively) and a history of
   post-Fontan arrhythmia (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively) but not
   with ventricular systolic dysfunction. Medication use rates varied
   widely among the centers, even with controls for center differences in
   patient characteristics. Prospective therapeutic trials are needed to
   guide the medical treatment of Fontan patients.}},

Abstract = {{Many patients in pre-hospital and emergency care are under the influence
   of alcohol. In addition, some of the more common pathological conditions
   can introduce a behaviour that can be mistaken to be related to alcohol
   inebriation. Fast quantitative determination of the breath alcohol
   concentration (BrAC) in emergency patients facilitates triage and
   medical assessment, but shallow expirations performed by non-cooperative
   patients reduce the measurement reliability. The aim of this study was
   to evaluate if breath alcohol analysis in non-cooperative patients can
   be improved with use of simultaneous measurement of the expired carbon
   dioxide (CO2). With prototypes of a handheld breath alcohol analyser
   based on infrared transmission spectroscopy the alcohol and CO2
   concentration in expired breath from 37 cooperative and non-cooperative
   patients were measured. The results show that enhanced breath sampling
   with use of a pump and estimation of the end expiratory BrAC with use of
   the ratio between the measured partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2) and a
   reference value of the alveolar PCO2, provided adequate correlation with
   the blood alcohol concentration (BAC). This pre-clinical study has shown
   that breath alcohol analysis in shallow expirations from non-cooperative
   patients can be improved with use of CO2 as a tracer gas.}},

Abstract = {{A right ventricular (RV) myocardial infarction (MI) may yield precordial
   ST-segment elevation (STE). Accordingly, combined inferior and
   precordial STE may be produced during an inferior-RV MI. Such an
   electrocardiographic picture may be mistakenly regarded as showing
   wrapped left anterior descending artery (LADA) occlusion or double
   vessel occlusion. We present a patient with inferior-RV MI and STE in
   the inferior, all precordial and right chest leads, in whom the diffuse
   precordial STE was probably mistakenly regarded as showing anterior MI.
   However, the STE resolution in V1-V2 and late R' wave in V1, which were
   combined with a recanalized RV branch, favored the RV origin of this
   STE. Furthermore, the LADA was patent when V3-V6 showed severe ischemia,
   while its lesion was angiographically stable. Thus its simultaneous
   occlusion was unlikely. The late R' wave in V1 indicates RV transmural
   conduction delay;as highlighted herein, it is diagnostic of a RV

Abstract = {{The performance of wireless networks depends critically on their spatial
   configuration, because received signal power and interference depend
   critically on the distances between numerous transmitters and receivers.
   This is particularly true in emerging network paradigms that may include
   femtocells, hotspots, relays, white space harvesters, and meshing
   approaches, which are often overlaid with traditional cellular networks.
   These heterogeneous approaches to providing high-capacity network access
   are characterized by randomly located nodes, irregularly deployed
   infrastructure, and uncertain spatial configurations due to factors like
   mobility and unplanned user-installed access points. This major shift is
   just beginning, and it requires new design approaches that are robust to
   spatial randomness, just as wireless links have long been designed to be
   robust to fading. The objective of this article is to illustrate the
   power of spatial models and analytical techniques in the design of
   wireless networks, and to provide an entry-level tutorial.}},

Abstract = {{The use of a Rhys-Davies (R-D) mechanical exsanguinator prior to the
   application of tourniquet is routine clinical practice in knee
   arthroscopy. However, this technique has been reported to cause injuries
   and is contraindicated in conditions like malignancy and latex allergy.
   Lower limb elevation alone has also been described as a technique of
   exsanguination. We conducted a prospective audit of two groups of
   patients (25 each) undergoing routine knee arthroscopy comparing the
   practice of mechanical exsanguination (R-D) with lower limb elevation
   technique. Average total operative times of the two groups were similar
   (R-D exsanguinator-23 min, limb elevation-21 min, n.s). Time interval
   between tourniquet inflation and skin incision was significantly lower
   in limb elevation technique (R-D exsanguinator-5 min, limb elevation-0.2
   min, P < 0.001). Limb elevation technique of exsanguination helps avoid
   the risks associated with mechanical exsanguination and may potentially
   reduce the non-operative tourniquet application time.}},

   To provide an overview of conceptualizations of female sexual problems,
   and `Female Sexual Dysfunction' in particular, throughout the 20th
   century, especially in relation to psychiatry and mental illness.
   Recent findings
   In the past 15 years, there has been an increase in both medical and
   public discourse about `Female Sexual Dysfunction'. I discuss a variety
   of literature sources dealing with female sexual problems, where these
   are understood variously as problems of developmental psychopathology,
   as technical phenomena to be resolved through education, or as medical
   problems to be addressed pharmaceutically.
   Summary
   The stigma of mental illness shapes much recent discussion of female
   sexual problems, as does the legacy of the postwar critique of
   psychodynamic psychiatry.}},

Title = {{Tension-Free Vaginal Tape Versus Transobturator Suburethral Tape:
   Five-Year Follow-up Results of a Prospective, Randomised Trial}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{58}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many studies have assessed the equivalent effectiveness of
   tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) and transobturator suburethral tape
   (TVT-O) at short-to medium-term follow-up, but no long-term randomised
   trials appear in the literature.
   Objective: We compared the use of TVT to TVT-O, providing a longer
   follow-up than currently appears in the literature.
   Design, setting, and participants: Seventy-two consecutive patients
   affected by stress urinary incontinence (SUI) were included in this
   randomised, controlled trial. Patients were randomly allocated to the
   TVT or TVT-O procedure using a predetermined, computer-generated
   randomisation code.
   Intervention: After preoperative assessment, patients were randomly
   allocated to the TVT or TVT-O procedure.
   Measurements: This 5-yr study represents the extension of our original
   randomised trial, which was designed to assess the incidence of
   long-term complications (primary end point) and successes (secondary end
   point) for both techniques.
   Results and limitations: At 60-mo follow-up, 52 patients (72\%) were
   objectively cured of SUI (72.9\% after TVT-O and 71.4\% after TVT), but
   only 44 patients (61\%) were satisfied. The late complication rate was
   16.6\% (10 women): five women (16.1\%) in the TVT-O group and five women
   (17.2\%) in the TVT group (p = 1). In this follow-up, 62\% of the
   patients from the TVT-O group and 60\% from the TVT group (p = 1)
   expressed that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the results.
   The mean cause of dissatisfaction was the development of sexual
   dysfunction resulting from dyspareunia or incontinence during
   intercourse, which was found in 6 of 16 dissatisfied patients (37.5\%).
   The limitations of our study included the adequate but small sample size
   and the lack of questionnaires.
   Conclusions: Both surgical techniques are safe, with similar results
   (72.9\% and 71\% of patients objectively cured after TVT-O and TVT,
   respectively) and low complication rates (16.6\%: 16.1\% and 17.2\%,
   respectively, for TVT-O and TVT), even after 5-yr follow-up. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The need for ICZM arises often due to inadequate or inappropriate
   landuse planning practices and policies, especially in urban coastal
   zones which are more complex due to the larger number of components,
   their critical dimensions, attributes and interactions. A survey of
   literature shows that there is no holistic metric for assessing the
   impacts of landuse planning on the health of a coastal zone. Thus there
   is a need to define such a metric. The proposed metric, CHI (Coastal
   zone Health Indicator), developed on the basis of coastal system
   sustainability, attempts to gauge the health status of any coastal zone.
   It is formulated and modeled through an expert survey and pertains to
   the characteristic components of coastal zones, their critical
   dimensions, and relevant attributes. The proposed metric is applied to
   two urban coastal zones and validated. It can be used for more coast
   friendly and sustainable landuse planning/masterplan preparation and
   thereby for the better management of landuse impacts on coastal zones.

Abstract = {{A promising therapeutic approach for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
   is exon skipping using antisense oligonucleotides (AOs). In-frame
   deletions of the hinge 3 region of the dystrophin protein, which is
   encoded by exons 50 and 51, are predicted to cause a variety of
   phenotypes. Here, we performed functional analyses of muscle in the exon
   52-deleted mdx (mdx52) mouse, to predict the function of in-frame
   dystrophin following exon 51-skipping, which leads to a protein lacking
   most of hinge 3. A series of AOs based on phosphorodiamidate morpholino
   oligomers was screened by intramuscular injection into mdx52 mice. The
   highest splicing efficiency was generated by a two-oligonucleotide
   cocktail targeting both the 5' and 3' splice sites of exon 51. After a
   dose-escalation study, we systemically delivered this cocktail into
   mdx52 mice seven times at weekly intervals. This induced 20-30\% of
   wild-type (WT) dystrophin expression levels in all muscles, and was
   accompanied by amelioration of the dystrophic pathology and improvement
   of skeletal muscle function. Because the structure of the restored
   in-frame dystrophin resembles human dystrophin following exon
   51-skipping, our results are encouraging for the ongoing clinical trials
   for DMD. Moreover, the therapeutic dose required can provide a
   suggestion of the theoretical equivalent dose for humans.}},

Abstract = {{The Benchmarking Project ``National Register for Quality Control in
   Intensive Care Medicine{''} has so far been attended by 59 Intensive
   care units from the majority of those specialties practicing intensive
   care, with 127,872 patients and a total of 589.635 treatment days. The
   underlying idea was the revision of the ``1999 core data set{''}. The
   high daily documentation requirement, new stratification instruments
   (e.g. SAPS) and new developments in quality assurance (e.g. quality
   indicators) necessitated an updating of the core data. In addition to
   the newly introduced recording of SAPS3 (once on patient admission) and
   quality indicators (once a year or once per patient) the daily
   documentation requirement was reduced by abandoning the recording of a
   whole range of parameters, and limiting recording to those patients only
   who remained in the ICU for at least 24 hours. For paediatric patients,
   specific modifications were implemented. The ``2010 ICM core data
   set{''} was officially agreed by both DIVI and DGAI and, to enable
   external quality comparison, its application by all ICUs recommended.}},

Abstract = {{The red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, is a paradigmatic invader
   of freshwater systems. Several attempts have been made to mitigate its
   multiple impacts but none was successful. Among the different methods
   proposed, the use of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) as an
   indigenous predator is promising but the available information about its
   predatory ability on crayfish is to date scanty. To fill this gap in
   knowledge, we ran three experiments in wetlands and irrigation ditches
   in Italy. The first experiment, in the laboratory, was aimed at
   quantifying the extent of predation by eels on crayfish, the second, in
   enclosures, the size classes of crayfish mainly preyed and the possible
   effect of the eels on P. clarkii behaviour, and the third, in the field,
   its ability to effectively reduce crayfish populations. Results showed
   that eels prey on small-sized or soft crayfish, attacking them from the
   back; an indirect effect was to reduce crayfish trophic activity, which
   in turn might increases crayfish mortality due to starvation and
   decreases impact on the community. However, as shown in the field, the
   use of eels should be appropriately calibrated to the context of
   application. Taken together, our results show that eels might be used as
   a complement to the traditional trapping method. However, additional
   studies are necessary to understand the adequate number of eels to be
   introduced and to develop appropriate methods for quantifying such
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Sand fly saliva contains molecules that modify the host's
   hemostasis and immune responses. Nevertheless, the role played by this
   saliva in the induction of key elements of inflammatory responses, such
   as lipid bodies (LB, also known as lipid droplets) and eicosanoids, has
   been poorly investigated. LBs are cytoplasmic organelles involved in
   arachidonic acid metabolism that form eicosanoids in response to
   inflammatory stimuli. In this study, we assessed the role of salivary
   gland sonicate (SGS) from Lutzomyia (L.) longipalpis, a Leishmania
   infantum chagasi vector, in the induction of LBs and eicosanoid
   production by macrophages in vitro and ex vivo.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Different doses of L. longipalpis SGS
   were injected into peritoneal cavities of C57BL/6 mice. SGS induced
   increased macrophage and neutrophil recruitment into the peritoneal
   cavity at different time points. Sand fly saliva enhanced PGE(2) and
   LTB4 production by harvested peritoneal leukocytes after ex vivo
   stimulation with a calcium ionophore. At three and six hours
   post-injection, L. longipalpis SGS induced more intense LB staining in
   macrophages, but not in neutrophils, compared with mice injected with
   saline. Moreover, macrophages harvested by peritoneal lavage and
   stimulated with SGS in vitro presented a dose- and time-dependent
   increase in LB numbers, which was correlated with increased PGE(2)
   production. Furthermore, COX-2 and PGE-synthase co-localized within the
   LBs induced by L. longipalpis saliva. PGE(2) production by macrophages
   induced by SGS was abrogated by treatment with NS-398, a COX-2
   inhibitor. Strikingly, SGS triggered ERK-1/2 and PKC-alpha
   phosphorylation, and blockage of the ERK-1/2 and PKC-alpha pathways
   inhibited the SGS effect on PGE(2) production by macrophages.
   Conclusion: In sum, our results show that L. longipalpis saliva induces
   lipid body formation and PGE(2) production by macrophages ex vivo and in
   vitro via the ERK-1/2 and PKC-alpha signaling pathways. This study
   provides new insights regarding the pharmacological mechanisms whereby
   L. longipalpis saliva influences the early steps of the host's
   inflammatory response.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of temporal fine-structure (TFS) cues to consonant
   identification was compared for seven young adults with normal hearing
   and five young adults with mild-to-moderate hearing loss and flat, high-
   or low-frequency gently sloping audiograms. Nonsense syllables were
   degraded using two schemes (PM: phase modulation; FM: frequency
   modulation) designed to remove temporal envelope (E) cues while
   preserving TFS cues in 16 0.35-octave-wide frequency bands spanning the
   range of 80 to 8020 Hz. For both schemes, hearing-impaired listeners
   performed significantly above chance level (PM: 36\%; FM: 31\%; chance
   level: 6.25\%), but more poorly than normal-hearing listeners (PM: 80\%;
   FM: 65\%). Three hearing-impaired listeners showed normal or near-normal
   reception of nasality information. These results indicate that for mild
   to moderate levels of hearing loss, cochlear damage reduces but does not
   abolish the ability to use the TFS cues of speech. The deficits observed
   for both schemes in hearing-impaired listeners suggest involvement of
   factors other than only poor reconstruction of temporal envelope from
   temporal fine structure.}},

   carry out the numerical simulations, the developed governing equations
   are determined in terms of the stream function-vorticity formulation.
   The weighting function in the weak formulation of the governing
   equations is taken as unity, and the field variables are approximated
   using the MLS interpolation. Capability as well as adaptability of the
   proposed meshless technique is ascertained by close comparisons of the
   illustrated results obtained through the mesh-free method with those
   obtained through a traditional method already existing in the
   literature. Effective viscosity and thermal conductivity of the
   solid-liquid mixture are determined using the Brinkman and Maxwell
   models, respectively. A parametric study conducted through the present
   method to gain insight into the nanofluid convective heat transfer
   performance shows rational and deducible results. The study reveals
   that, distributions of the local Nusselt number along the wavy hot wall
   closely follow the pattern of the wall's geometry for different
   Richardson numbers and the nanoparticles volume fractions considered.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Adenosarcomas are rare tumors composed of a benign epithelium
   in combination with a malignant mesenchymal component. We examined the
   natural history of uterine adenosarcomas and compared the outcome of
   uterine adenosarcoma and carcinosarcoma.
   Methods. Patients with uterine adenosarcomas and carcinosarcomas
   registered in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database
   between 1988 and 2006 were examined. Survival was analyzed using Cox
   proportional hazards model and the Kaplan-Meier method.
   Results. A total of 5496 patients including 544 (10\%) with
   adenosarcomas were identified. Patients with adenosarcomas tended to be
   younger and were more likely to have early-stage tumors (p<0.0001) In a
   multivariate model patients with adenosarcomas were 65\% (HR= 0.35; 95\%
   CI, 0.28-0.45) less likely to die from their tumors than women with
   carcinosarcomas. Five-year survival was 79\% (95\% CI, 75-84\%) for
   stage I adenosarcomas and 51\% (95\% CI, 49-54\%) for carcinosarcomas.
   For stage III disease, 5-year survival for adenosarcomas was 48\% (95\%
   CI, 29-65\%) vs. 24\% (95\% CI, 20-27\%) for carcinosarcomas.
   Conclusion. The majority of women with uterine adenosarcoma present with
   early-stage tumors and have a favorable outcome. Despite the overall
   favorable prognosis for most patients, survival is only 63-69\% for
   women whose tumors invade into the wall of the uterus and lower than
   50\% for disease spread beyond the uterus. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hash and a canonicalization algorithm for Notation
   3 (N3) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) graphs. The hash
   algorithm produces, given a graph, a hash value such that the same value
   would be obtained from any other equivalent graph. Contrary to previous
   related work, it is well-suited for graphs with blank nodes, variables
   and subgraphs. The canonicalization algorithm outputs a canonical
   serialization of a given graph (i.e. a canonical representative of the
   set of all the graphs that are equivalent to it). Potential applications
   of these algorithms include, among others, checking graphs for identity,
   computing differences between graphs and graph synchronization. The
   former could be especially useful for crawlers that gather RDF/N3 data
   from the Web, to avoid processing several times graphs that are
   equivalent. Both algorithms have been evaluated on a big dataset, with
   more than 29 million triples and several millions of subgraphs and
   variables. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Purpose: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of
   tadalafil (TDF) on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rat ovaries.
   Methods: Thirty-five female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided
   into 5 groups (n = 7): sham (S), I/R1, I/R2, TDF1, and TDF2. In the I/R1
   and TDF1 groups, 3-hour ischemia was followed by 12-hour reperfusion;
   and in the I/R2 and TDF2 groups, 3-hour ischemia was followed by 24-hour
   reperfusion. In the TDF groups, 30 minutes before reperfusion, a single
   dose of 5 mg/kg TDF was administered intraperitoneally. The ovarian
   tissue levels of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide (NO), and the
   activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase were measured
   biochemically. Tissue damage to ovarian tissue was scored by
   histopathologic examination.
   Results: The tissue malondialdehyde levels were significantly higher and
   the catalase and superoxide dismutase activities were significantly
   lower in the I/R groups compared with the S and TDF groups (P < .05).
   The NO levels were significantly higher in the TDF1 group than the S and
   I/R1 groups (P < 05). Although the NO levels were increased in the TDF2
   group compared with the I/R2 group, the difference was not significant.
   Ovarian tissue damage scores of the I/R groups were significantly higher
   than those of the S group (P < 05). Treatment with TDF significantly
   decreased the ovarian tissue damage scores in the TDF groups compared
   with the I/R groups (P < 05).
   Conclusions: Tadalafil is effective in preventing tissue damage induced
   by I/R in rat ovaries. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The pilot phase of the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute
   Cerebral Haemorrhage Trial (INTERACT) showed that rapid blood pressure
   (BP) lowering can attenuate hematoma growth in acute intracerebral
   hemorrhage. We sought to define the systolic BP level associated with
   greatest attenuation of hematoma growth. INTERACT included 404 patients
   with computed tomographic-confirmed intracerebral hemorrhage, elevated
   systolic BP (150 to 220 mm Hg), and capacity to commence BP lowering
   treatment within 6 hours of onset. Computed tomography was done at
   baseline and at 24 hours using standardized techniques, with digital
   images analyzed centrally, blinded to clinical data. Associations of
   baseline and achieved on-treatment (mean during the first 24 hours)
   systolic BP levels with the primary outcome of increase in hematoma
   volume were explored. There were 346 patients with duplicate computed
   tomographic scans. There was no significant association between baseline
   systolic BP levels and either the absolute or proportional growth in
   hematoma volume (P trend=0.26 and 0.12, respectively). By contrast,
   achieved on-treatment systolic BP levels in the first 24 hours were
   clearly associated with both absolute and proportional hematoma growth
   (both P trend=0.03). Maximum reduction in hematoma growth occurred in
   the one third of participants with the lowest on-treatment systolic BP
   levels (median: 135 mm Hg). Intensive BP reduction to systolic levels
   between 130 and 140 mm Hg is likely to provide the maximum protection
   against hematoma growth after intracerebral hemorrhage. (Hypertension.

   passive and paracellular, there is an additional component of Cl-
   transport that is transcellular. A search for possible mechanisms that
   might mediate Cl- uptake into proximal tubule cells led to the
   identification of an apical membrane Cl(-)oxalate exchange activity.
   Subsequent studies identified anion transporter SLC26A6 as responsible
   for proximal tubule Cl--oxalate exchange activity. The most striking
   phenotype in Slc26a6 null mice was calcium oxalate urolithiasis due to
   hyperoxaluria. Hyperoxalemia and hyperoxaluria in Slc26a6 null mice were
   found to be caused by defective intestinal back-secretion of ingested
   oxalate. These findings suggested that inherited or acquired defects in
   SLC26A6 might lead to hyperoxaluria and increased stone risk, and have
   motivated studies to characterize the role of SLC26A6 in oxalate
   homeostasis in patients and in animal models.}},

Abstract = {{The usefulness of urine cytology combined with NMP22 was evaluated for
   the primary diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma. Of 53 clinically
   suspected patients, histopathological diagnoses were low-grade
   urothelial carcinoma (25), high-grade urothelial carcinoma (13), and
   inflammatory lesions (15). Cytology was positive in 25 and negative in
   14 patients. Fourteen of 25 low-grade urothelial carcinoma and 11/13
   high-grade urothelial carcinoma were diagnosed correctly on urine
   cytology. Atypical cells seen in 14 patients were categorized as
   inconclusive for malignancy. The overall sensitivity of urine cytology
   was 65.8\%, whereas specificity was 100\%. NMP22 was positive in 33
   patients. Of these 30, 18 low-grade and 12 high-grade lesions were true
   positive. Of the 20 NMP22, eight negative cases were false-negative. Ten
   of 15 with negative histopathology were also negative for NMP22, three
   were false-positive, and two showed erratic results. Nine of 14 cases
   with atypical urine cytology were positive for NMP22. Eight of these
   showed low-grade carcinoma on histopathology. The sensitivity of
   BladderChek NMP22 test was 79\%, whereas specificity was 80\%. NMP22
   BladderChek test is a useful adjunct to urine cytology in atypical and

   hsSerRS differs from that of its eubacterial and archaebacterial
   analogues. As a consequence of an N-terminal insertion and a C-terminal
   extra-sequence, the binding mode of tRNASer to hsSerRS is expected to
   differ from that in prokaryotes. Recombinant hsSerRS protein was

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{655}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{171-188}},

Abstract = {{Stream flow affects many aspects of freshwater fish biology, but the
   extent to which variation in stream flow influences productivity of
   anadromous salmonid populations across their entire life cycle is not
   well known. We compared relationships of stream flow and productivity
   for Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from two systems in the
   Salmon River basin in Idaho: the Lemhi River, a watershed subjected to
   intensive water use for irrigation, and Marsh Creek, a drainage with a
   natural hydrograph. We estimated rates of productivity based on
   monitoring at four life stages: the number of eggs initiating each
   cohort, juveniles migrating from the natal tributary past an outmigrant
   trap, smolts surviving to the Snake River, and adults returning to
   spawn. Using model selection techniques, we examined whether river flow
   experienced during these life stages explained variation above and
   beyond predictors of climate associated with each stage. In the Lemhi
   River, tributary stream flow during early residence exhibited strong
   correlations with egg-trap, egg-smolt, and egg-adult return rates, and
   was consistently a better predictor of productivity than stream flow
   occurring during late summer. Model selection indicated that early
   rearing flow was the single best predictor of both egg-trap and
   trap-smolt transition rates in the Lemhi River, and path analysis
   revealed a strong set of pathways linking rearing flow to adult return
   rate primarily through egg-trap productivity. These patterns were much
   less strongly exhibited or nonexistent in Marsh Creek. However, for both
   populations, migration flow in the Columbia River was the best predictor
   of smolt-adult return rates. Potentially confounding climatic variables
   exhibited relatively weak effects upon both early life histories and
   tributary flow, but were included in the best models of migration flows
   and smolt-adult return rate. These results suggest that effects of
   stream flow on juvenile salmonids in flow-altered systems can have
   substantial impacts on returning adults.}},

Abstract = {{Species-specific genes play an important role in defining the phenotype
   of an organism. However, current gene prediction methods can only
   efficiently find genes that share features such as sequence similarity
   or general sequence characteristics with previously known genes. Novel
   sequencing methods and tiling arrays can be used to find genes without
   prior information and they have demonstrated that novel genes can still
   be found from extensively studied model organisms. Unfortunately, these
   methods are expensive and thus are not easily applicable, e.g., to
   finding genes that are expressed only in very specific conditions.
   We demonstrate a method for finding novel genes with sparse arrays,
   applying it on the 33.9 Mb genome of the filamentous fungus Trichoderma
   reesei. Our computational method does not require normalisations between
   arrays and it takes into account the multiple-testing problem typical
   for analysis of microarray data. In contrast to tiling arrays, that use
   overlapping probes, only one 25mer microarray oligonucleotide probe was
   used for every 100 b. Thus, only relatively little space on a microarray
   slide was required to cover the intergenic regions of a genome. The
   analysis was done as a by-product of a conventional microarray
   experiment with no additional costs. We found at least 23 good
   candidates for novel transcripts that could code for proteins and all of
   which were expressed at high levels. Candidate genes were found to
   neighbour ire1 and cre1 and many other regulatory genes. Our simple,
   low-cost method can easily be applied to finding novel species-specific
   genes without prior knowledge of their sequence properties. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Purpose: To conduct an evidence-based systematic review and provide an
   estimate of the effects of oral motor interventions (OMIs) on
   feeding/swallowing outcomes (both physiological and functional) and

   Method: A systematic search of the literature published from 1960 to
   2007 was conducted. Articles meeting the selection criteria were
   appraised by 2 reviewers and vetted by a 3rd for methodological quality.
   Results: Twelve studies were included and focused on 3 OMIs-nonnutritive
   sucking (NNS), oral/perioral stimulation, and NNS plus oral/perioral
   stimulation. Six studies addressed the effects of OMI on the
   feeding/swallowing physiology outcomes of feeding efficiency or sucking
   pressures. Ten studies addressed the functional feeding/swallowing
   outcomes of oral feeding or weight gain/growth. No studies reported data
   on pulmonary health. Methodological quality varied greatly. NNS alone
   and with oral/perioral stimulation showed strong positive findings for
   improvement in some feeding/swallowing physiology variables and for
   reducing transition time to oral feeding. Prefeeding stimulation showed
   equivocal results across the targeted outcomes. None of the OMIs
   provided consistent positive results on weight gain/growth.
   Conclusions: Although some OMIs show promise for enhancing
   feeding/swallowing in preterm infants, methodological limitations and
   variations in results across studies warrant careful consideration of
   their clinical use.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Between January and March of 2006, over 35 000 diarrhea
   cases and 532 deaths were reported among children aged <5 years in
   Botswana. We conducted an investigation to characterize the outbreak,
   identify risk factors for diarrhea, and recommend control strategies.
   Methods: We enrolled children <5 years of age presenting to the
   emergency department between March 2 and March 20, 2006. Cases had >= 3
   loose stools per day and no antecedent diarrhea among household members.
   Controls had had no diarrhea since January 1, 2006. We conducted a
   multivariate logistic regression analysis controlling for socioeconomic
   status, age, and maternal HIV status.
   Results: Forty-nine cases with median age of 12 months (range 0-45
   months) and 61 controls with median age of 24 months (range 0-59 months)
   were enrolled; 33 (30\%) were born to HIV-positive mothers. Case-parents
   were more likely to report storing household drinking water (adjusted
   odds ratios (AOR) 3.9, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-15.7). Lack of
   hand washing after using the toilet or latrine (AOR 4.2, 95\% CI
   1.1-20.4) was more likely to be reported by case-parents. Case-children
   were less likely to be currently breastfeeding (AOR 30.3, 95\% CI
   2.0-1000.0). Five (10\%) case-patients and no control-patients died.
   Multiple causal pathogens were identified.
   Conclusions: During this diarrhea outbreak in a country with a national
   program to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV, ill children
   were less likely to be breastfed and more likely to have been exposed to
   environmental factors associated with fecal contamination. These
   findings underscore the importance of adequate access to safe water,
   sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition education among populations using
   breast milk substitutes. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Journal = {{ALGORITHMICA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{679-710}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We consider a variant of the path cover problem, namely, the
   k-fixed-endpoint path cover problem, or kPC for short, on interval
   graphs. Given a graph G and a subset T of k vertices of V (G), a
   k-fixed-endpoint path cover of G with respect to T is a set of
   vertex-disjoint paths P that covers the vertices of G such that the k
   vertices of T are all endpoints of the paths in P. The kPC problem is to
   find a k-fixed-endpoint path cover of G of minimum cardinality; note
   that, if T is empty the stated problem coincides with the classical path
   cover problem. In this paper, we study the 1-fixed-endpoint path cover
   problem on interval graphs, or 1PC for short, generalizing the 1HP
   problem which has been proved to be NP-complete even for small classes
   of graphs. Motivated by a work of Damaschke (Discrete Math. 112: 4964,
   1993), where he left both 1HP and 2HP problems open for the class of
   interval graphs, we show that the 1PC problem can be solved in
   polynomial time on the class of interval graphs. We propose a
   polynomial-time algorithm for the problem, which also enables us to
   solve the 1HP problem on interval graphs within the same time and space
   complexity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel, inexpensive and one-step approach for
   synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) using arc discharge between

   of 18 nm diameter were formed during reduction of AgNO3 in plasma
   discharge zone. Optical absorption spectroscopy of as prepared samples
   at 15 A arc current in AgNO3 solution shows a surface plasmon resonance
   around 410 nm. It was found that sodium citrate acts as a stabilizer and
   surface capping agent of the colloidal nanoparticles. SEM images exhibit
   the increase of reduced nanoparticles in 6 min arc duration compared
   with 1 min arc duration. TEM image of the sample prepared at 6 min arc
   duration shows narrow size distribution with 18 nm mean particle size.

Title = {{Niche complementarity due to plasticity in resource use: plant

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3252-3260}},

Abstract = {{Niche complementarity, in which coexisting species use different forms
   of a resource, has been widely invoked to explain some of the most
   debated patterns in ecology, including maintenance of diversity and
   relationships between diversity and ecosystem function. However,
   classical models assume resource specialization in the form of distinct
   niches, which does not obviously apply to the broadly overlapping
   resource use in plant communities. Here we utilize an experimental
   framework based on competition theory to test whether plants partition
   resources via classical niche differentiation or via plasticity in
   resource use. We explore two alternatives: niche preemption, in which
   individuals respond to a superior competitor by switching to an
   alternative, less-used resource, and dominant plasticity, in which
   superior competitors exhibit high resource use plasticity and shift
   resource use depending on the competitive environment. We determined
   competitive ability by measuring growth responses with and without
   neighbors over a growing season and then used N-15 tracer techniques to
   measure uptake of different nitrogen (N) forms in a field setting. We
   show that four alpine plant species of differing competitive abilities
   have statistically indistinguishable uptake patterns (nitrate > ammonium
   > glycine) in their fundamental niche (without competitors) but differ
   in whether they shift these uptake patterns in their realized niche
   (with competitors). Competitively superior species increased their
   uptake of the most available N form, ammonium, when in competition with
   the rarer, competitively inferior species. In contrast, the
   competitively inferior species did not alter its N uptake pattern in
   competition. The existence of plasticity in resource use among the
   dominant species provides a mechanism that helps to explain the manner
   by which plant species with broadly overlapping resource use might
   coexist.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate a smoking reduction and cessation intervention
   tailored for people with significant disability associated with mental
   illness.
   Method: The intervention was a 10 week group programme, which tailored
   smoking cessation interventions to the needs of people living with
   mental illness. It was facilitated by mental health workers and peer
   workers and was promoted through mental health services, general
   practitioners and the Quitline phone service. Participants were people
   living with mental illness who had asked for help to quit or reduce
   their tobacco use. Participants were interviewed before starting the
   course, twice during the course and at 3, 6 and 12 months post course
   completion.
   Results: Overall, 226 people expressed interest, 183 attended at least
   one session of the course and 105 attended at least 10 sessions. Of the
   183 participants, 79.8\% reported they did not smoke for at least 24
   hours, with 30.6\% stopping for at least 30 days. At the 12 month follow
   up 16.6\% of participants reported they were not smoking. Of the 105
   participants who attended at least 10 sessions of the course, 85.7\%
   reported they did not smoke for at least 24 hours and 37.1\% stopping
   for at least 30 days. At 12 month follow up 21.3\% reported they were
   not smoking. Cigarettes smoked per day declined among those who did not
   quit, and was still significantly lower after 12 months. Motivation to
   try to quit was high among those still smoking at 12 months, with 83.9\%
   wanting to try again to quit.
   Conclusions: This programme has shown many people with significant
   disability associated with mental illness are motivated to attend a
   smoking reduction and cessation group programme. A programme tailored to
   meet the specific needs of this group can be effective in helping many
   to quit or reduce their tobacco use.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, adaptive beamforming methods have been successfully applied to
   medical ultrasound imaging, resulting in significant improvement in
   image quality compared with non-adaptive delay-and-sum (DAS)
   beamformers. Most of the adaptive beamformers presented in the
   ultrasound imaging literature are based on the minimum variance (MV)
   beamformer which can significantly improve the imaging resolution,
   although their success in enhancing the contrast has not yet been
   satisfactory. It is desirable for the beamformer to improve the
   resolution and contrast at the same time. To this end, in this paper, we
   have applied the eigenspace-based MV (EIBMV) beamformer to medical
   ultrasound imaging and have shown a simultaneous improvement in imaging
   resolution and contrast. EIBMV beamformer utilizes the eigenstructure of
   the covariance matrix to enhance the performance of the MV beamformer.
   The weight vector of the EIBMV is found by projecting the MV weight
   vector onto a vector subspace constructed from the eigenstructure of the
   covariance matrix. Using EIBMV weights instead of the MV ones leads to
   reduced sidelobes and improved contrast, without compromising the high
   resolution of the MV beamformer. In addition, the proposed EIBMV
   beamformer presents a satisfactory robustness against data misalignment
   resulting from steering vector errors, outperforming the regularized MV
   beamformer.}},

Abstract = {{India, which produced nearly 67 Mt steel in 2010, aims to produce, in
   the near future, more than 100 Mt/year and to become, after China, the
   second largest steelmaker worldwide. To do this, India benefits from
   large iron ore reserves, especially of high-grade hematites, which
   presently constitute the largest amount of the local consumption as well
   of the exports. For the future, however, it will be necessary to
   beneficiate the large reserves of lower-grade iron ores, especially the
   magnetites. Furthermore, the question of the amount of the Indian iron
   ores available for export will have to be considered. India also has
   very large coal resources but, unhappily, mainly in non-coking coal, and
   often with high ash content: this is the main problem of the Indian iron
   and steel industry, to select the best routes and processes to make
   steel. The Indian iron and steel industry has to choose between: the
   conventional route based on the Blast Furnace and Oxygen Converter,
   which implies increasing the imports of high-grade coking coal, mainly
   from Australia; various routes based on local Indian coals, such as: (a)
   COREX or FINEX processes to produce liquid hot metal, or (b) direct
   reduction processes, either based on natural gas where it is available,
   or on local coals, presently mainly in rotary kilns (but with serious
   problems of energy efficiency and environmental pollution, in spite of
   the large present development), or based on coal gasification processes
   (such as MXCOL or ITmk3 processes). Finally, another special feature of
   the Indian iron and steel companies, specially of the largest private
   ones such as Tata, Essar and JSW (Jindal), is their development outside
   of India, which means the control of some 18 Mt steel/year, aiming to
   reach about 25 Mt/year in the near future!}},

Abstract = {{Using a periodic slab model for the (0001) surface of americium-I (Am-I)
   and the full-potential linear augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) plus local
   basis implementation of hybrid density functional theory (HYB-DFT), we
   show that with a fraction of 0.40 Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange, the
   non-magnetic nature of the Am-I surface is well described and the
   electronic properties are in good agreement with recent photoemission
   spectroscopy data. The work function and surface energy of the
   non-magnetic semi-infinite surface are predicted to 3.46 eV and 1.03
   J/m(2), respectively. As a function of slab thickness, the surface
   properties, namely the surface energy, work function, and slab
   incremental energy converge after five layers. A five layer slab is thus
   deemed to be sufficient to very accurately model the adsorption of
   impurities on the surface and adsorbate-induced changes in the work
   function. A layer-by-layer examination of the nine-layer non-magnetic
   slab clearly indicates that the 5f electrons are uniformly localized,
   that is, the 5f electron localization is independent of the position of
   the layer.}},

   measure time inconsistencies and simplify their qualitative tests. TTO
   sequences can be administered and analyzed very easily, using only
   pencil and paper. For theoretical purposes, we use TTO sequences to
   axiomatize (quasi-) hyperbolic discount functions. We demonstrate the
   feasibility of measuring TTO sequences in an experiment, in which we
   tested the axiomatizations. Our findings suggest rejections of several
   currently popular discount functions and call for the development of new
   ones. It is especially desirable that such discount functions can

Abstract = {{Objective: Hyponatremia and the associated life-threatening
   complications have emerged as an important issue among marathon runners.
   This study was conducted to estimate the serum sodium level among local
   marathon runners and to identify the associated risk factors of
   dysnatremia.
   Design: Prospective observational cohort study.
   Setting: Hong Kong Marathon 2008.
   Participants: Subjects were approached at their convenience to
   participate in the study. Only full-marathon runners were recruited.
   They were to have had an unremarkable medical and drug history.
   Interventions: Demographic data, training information, previous marathon
   experience, anticipated drinking strategy, details of fluid consumption
   throughout the race, weight change, finishing time, and physical
   complaint.
   Main Outcome Measures: Post-race serum sodium level.
   Results: Of the 6488 entries to the race, 370 runners (5.7\%) were
   recruited. Among them, 272 (73.5\%) completed the race and attended for
   blood sampling and data collection. One runner (0.4\%) had hyponatremia
   (133 mmol/L) and 35 runners (12.9\%) had hypernatremia (> 145 mmol/L),
   whereas 236 runners (86.7\%) had normal serum sodium (135-145 mmol/L)
   after the race. No symptomatic dysnatremia was found. A mean weight
   reduction of 0.70 kg was found after the race. An average of 1.9 L of
   fluid was consumed during the race and 2.5 L if the fluid consumed
   immediately before and after the race was also included. Hypernatremia
   was seen in runners who were better trained before the race, those who
   performed better, and those who drank less water after the race.
   Conclusions: This is the largest prospective observational cohort study
   of dysnatremia conducted on athletes completing a standard marathon in
   Asia. No case of symptomatic dysnatremia was found.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to characterize the features of fractures that
   occur in female patients with osteoporosis in the setting of a typical
   trauma hospital.
   Observational study was conducted on 233 women aged 50 years and above
   reporting to a trauma center with a fracture. Fracture location,
   fracture classification and cause of fracture were obtained and compared
   with bone mineral status assessed by DXA at the spine.
   Our findings indicate that with increasing patient age, the majority of
   fractures occur after a minor traumatic event. In more than one-third of
   all fractures after minor trauma, the patients were diagnosed with
   osteoporosis. The overall prevalence of osteoporosis in patients older
   than 50 years with fractures was more than 30\% and was increasing with
   age. Most strikingly, one-third of the patients have had a previous
   fracture at a location that should have triggered the assessment of bone
   health status, but only 25\% of them had received any form of
   osteoporosis treatment.
   For patients older than 50 years reporting to a trauma unit with a
   fracture, osteoporosis has a considerable prevalence. The large number
   of patients who have had a previous fracture emphasizes the necessity
   for an effective implementation of treatment algorithms for elderly
   patients with osteoporosis in the setting of a trauma hospital.}},

Abstract = {{An HPLC method was developed for the simultaneous determination of nine
   compounds of Nigella sativa L. The separation was achieved within 23 min
   by using C18 column material, a water acetonitrile mobile phase, both
   containing 0.1\% acetic acid gradient system and a temperature of 35
   degrees C. The method was validated for linearity, repeatability, LOD,
   and LOQ. The LOD and LOQ of nine compounds were in the range of 0.09-10
   and 0.3-25 mu g/mL, respectively. The wavelength used for quantification
   with the diode array detector was 205 and 260 nm. LC/MS coupled with
   electrospray ionization interface method is described for the
   identification of compounds in N. sativa L. samples. This method
   involved the use of {[}M+H](+) and {[}M+Na](+) ions in the positive ion
   mode with extracted ion chromatogram.}},

Abstract = {{1'-(S)-1'-Acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA) isolated from the Malaysian
   ethnomedicinal plant Alpinia conchigera Griff. was investigated for its
   potential as an anticancer drug. In this communication, we describe the
   cytotoxic and apoptotic properties of ACA on five human tumour cell
   lines. Data from MTT cell viability assays indicated that ACA induced
   both time-and dose-dependent cytotoxicity on all tumour cell lines
   tested and had no adverse cytotoxic effects on normal cells. Total
   mortality of the entire tumour cell population was achieved within 30
   hrs when treated with ACA at 40.0 mu M concentration. Flow cytometric
   analysis for annexin-V and PI dual staining demonstrated that cell death
   occurred via apoptosis, followed by secondary necrosis. The apoptotic
   effects of ACA were confirmed via the DNA fragmentation assay, in which
   consistent laddering of genomic DNA was observed for all tumour cell
   lines after a 24 hrs post-treatment period at the IC50 concentration of
   ACA. A cell cycle analysis using PI staining also demonstrated that ACA
   induced cell cycle arrest at the G(0)/G(1) phase, corresponding to oral
   tumour cell lines. In conclusion, ACA exhibits enormous potential for
   future development as a chemotherapeutic drug against various
   malignancies.}},

   close-loop control of the rotor motion, instability regions as well as
   the amplitude level contours of vertical and horizontal vibrations of
   the rotor are obtained in the form suitable for engineering

   framework that asserts that, in spite of adverse circumstances, positive
   affect and subjective well-being and its correlates allow for daily
   functioning in most cases. Results did not support any significant
   differences between the first (2003) and second study (2007) data. As
   expected, optimism, self-esteem, and negative affect predicted SWB.
   Additional findings show that demographic variables such as
   socioeconomic status were associated with higher SWB. Gender differences
   were found, whereby males scored higher on positive affect than females.}},

Abstract = {{Nasal septal deformity is a central feature of the crooked nose,
   contributing to functional and aesthetic problems. Straightening of the
   septum often requires resection, scoring, or incision of the
   septum-maneuvers that inevitably weaken the cartilaginous dorsal and
   caudal L-shaped struts, which together are known as the L-strut.
   Compromise of this L-strut predisposes to septal buckling, recurrent
   deviation, and saddle nose deformity. We describe our experience with
   the oblique septal crossbar, a structural graft that allows
   biomechanically sound anterior septal angle reconstruction during
   septorhinoplasty. The technique improves dorsal septal support and
   facilitates correction of the crooked nose. The open septorhinoplasty
   approach and swinging door maneuver are followed by placement of a
   diagonally oriented crossbar graft, obtained from cartilage or the
   perpendicular plate. The approach allows consistent midline correction
   and buttressing of the nasal dorsum, with no complications to date. Arch

Abstract = {{A simple mathematical model (Granich et al., Lancet 373:48-57, 2009)
   suggested recently that annual HIV testing of the population, with all
   detected HIV+ individuals immediately treated with antiretrovirals,
   could lead to the long-term decline of HIV in South Africa and could
   save millions of lives in the next few years. However, the model
   suggested that the long-term decline of HIV could not be achieved with
   less frequent HIV testing. Many observers argued that an annual testing
   rate was very difficult in practice. Small scale trials are nevertheless
   in preparation. In this paper, we use a more realistic age-structured
   model, which suggests that the recent high levels of reported condom use
   could already lead to a long-term decline of HIV in South Africa. The
   model therefore suggests that trials with for example 20\% of the
   population tested each year would also be interesting. They would have
   similar (though smaller) advantages in terms of reduction of mortality
   and incidence, would be much easier to generalize to larger populations,
   and would not lead to long term persistence of HIV. Our model
   simulations also suggest that the age distribution of incidence has
   changed considerably over the past 20 years in South Africa. This raises
   some concern about an assumption presently used in EPP/Spectrum, the
   software used by UNAIDS for its estimates.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on an evaluation of a domestic violence intervention
   in the maternity and sexual health services of a UK hospital. The
   intervention encompassed guidelines, staff training, inclusion of
   routine enquiry for domestic violence with all patients, and referral of
   women disclosing violence to an on-site advocacy service. An
   ``assumption querying{''} approach was applied to evaluate the
   intervention. Programmatic assumptions were identified and tested using
   interviews with service providers and patients, review of patient
   records, and pre- and post-training questionnaires. Domestic violence
   training resulted in changes in health professionals' knowledge and
   practice in the short-term, but universal routine enquiry was not
   achieved even in a context of organisational support, guidelines,
   training and advocacy. Potential and actual harm occurred, including
   breaches of confidentiality and failure to document evidence, limiting
   women's ability to access civil and legal remedies. Advocacy support led
   to positive outcomes for many women, as long as support to maintain
   positive changes, whether women stayed with or left the violent partner,
   continued to be given. Maternity and sexual health services were found
   to be opportune points of intervention for domestic violence services
   that combine routine enquiry by clinicians, support after disclosure and
   attention to harm reduction. (C)2010 Reproductive Health Matters. All

Abstract = {{In this article the arrangements for the participatory planning of the
   five largest Finnish cities are examined from the perspectives of both
   democracy and planning theories. Four paradigms that form the continuum
   of general planning theoretical debate are identified as being relevant
   in the Finnish context: comprehensive-rationalistic, incrementalist,
   consensus-oriented communicative and conflict-oriented agonistic
   planning theory. These are discussed in relation to the parallel
   development of democracy theory: from the aggregative to the
   deliberative and further to the agonistic model of democracy. The
   empirical study reveals that while each paradigm shift in theory
   purports to replace the former theory with a new one, in practice the
   new theory emerges as a new addition to the palette of coexisting
   theoretical sources, to be drawn upon as a source of guidance and
   inspiration in organizing participatory planning. The five Finnish
   cities combine traits of different theories in their arrangements of
   planning participation, often in a fashion that generates institutional
   ambiguity. The argument concludes with discussing the necessity of
   further empirical and developmental research, where the contexts of both
   planning theory and democracy theory are related to the institutional
   challenges of planning conduct. If this does not happen the emerging
   agonistic planning theory, too, may become a paradigm shift at the level
   of theory only, thereby contributing to the widening gap between theory
   and practice.}},

Abstract = {{The acaricidal activity of 12 monoterpenes against the two-spotted
   spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, was examined using fumigation and
   direct contact application methods. Cuminaldehyde and (-)-linalool
   showed the highest fumigant toxicity with LC50 = 0.31 and 0.56 mg/l,
   respectively. The other monoterpenes exhibited a strong fumigant
   toxicity, the LC50 values ranging from 1.28 to 8.09 mg/l, except
   camphene, which was the least effective (LC50 = 61.45 mg/l). Based on
   contact activity, the results were rather different: menthol displayed
   the highest acaricidal activity (LC50 = 128.53 mg/l) followed by thymol
   (172.0 mg/l), geraniol (219.69 mg/l) and (-)-limonene (255.44 mg/l);
   1-8-cineole, cuminaldehyde and (-)-linalool showed moderate toxicity. At
   125 mg/l, (-)-Limonene and (-)-carvone caused the highest egg mortality
   among the tested compounds (70.6 and 66.9\% mortality, respectively). In
   addition, the effect of molecular descriptors was also analyzed using
   the quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) procedure. The
   QSAR model showed excellent agreement between the estimated and
   experimentally measured toxicity parameter (LC50) for the tested
   monoterpenes and the fumigant activity increased significantly with the
   vapor pressure. Comparing the results of the fumigant and contact
   toxicity assays of monoterpenes against T. urticae with the results of
   acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory effect revealed that some of the
   tested compounds showed a strong acaricidal activity and a potent AChE
   inhibitory activity, such as cuminaldehyde, (-)-linalool, (-)-limonene
   and menthol. However, other compounds such as (-)-carvone revealed a
   strong fumigant activity but a weak AChE inhibitory activity.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative fluorescent PCR (QF PCR) has been used by many laboratories

   conventional karyotype and QF PCR had been performed, including 1243

   evolution as that described by the parameters of thermal stability
   temperatures and apparent activation energies. The decomposition
   reactions can be described by two competitive different mechanisms:
   Nucleation model (A2) and Reaction Contracting Volume model (R3). The

Abstract = {{In this work, non-associative finite strain anisotropic elastoplasticity
   fully coupled with ductile damage is considered using a
   thermodynamically consistent framework. First, the kinematics of large
   strain based on multiplicative decomposition of the total transformation
   gradient using the rotating frame formulation, is recalled and different
   objective derivatives defined. By using different anisotropic equivalent
   stresses (quadratic and non-quadratic) in yield function and in plastic
   potential, the evolution equations for all the dissipative phenomena are
   deduced from the generalized normality rule applied to the plastic
   potential while the consistency condition is still applied to the yield
   function. The effect of the objective derivatives and the equivalent
   stresses (quadratic or non-quadratic) on the plastic flow anisotropy and
   the hardening evolution with damage is considered. Numerical aspects
   mainly related to the time integration of the fully coupled constitutive
   equations are discussed. Applications are made to the AISI 304 sheet
   metal by considering different loading paths as tensile, shear, plane
   tensile and bulge tests. For each loading path the effect of the
   rotating frame, the equivalent stress (quadratic or non-quadratic) and
   the normality rule (with respect to yield function or to the plastic
   potential) are discussed on the light of some available experimental
   results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Subarachnoid aneurysmal hemorrhage (SAH) due to cerebral aneurysm
   rupture is a very serious disease resulting in high mortality rate. It
   has been known that genetic factors are involved in the risk of SAH. A
   recent breakthrough in genomic variation called copy number variation
   (CNV) has been revealed to be involved in risks of human diseases. In
   this study, we hypothesized that CNVs can predict the risk of SAH. We
   used the Illumina HumanHap300 BeadChip (317 503 markers) to genotype 497
   individuals in a Japanese population. Furthermore, individual CNVs were
   identified using signal and allelic intensities. The genetic effect of
   CNV on the risk of SAH was evaluated using multivariate logistic
   regression controlling for age and gender in 187 common CNV regions
   (frequency > 1\%). From a total of 4574 individual CNVs identified in
   this study (9.7 CNVs per individual), we were able to discover 1644
   unique CNV regions containing 1232 genes. The identified variations were
   validated using visual examination of the genoplot image, overlapping
   analysis with the Database of Genomic Variants (73.2\%), CNVpartition
   (72.4\%) and quantitative PCR. Interestingly, two CNV regions,
   chr4:153210505-153212191 (deletion, 4q31.3, P=0.0005, P-corr (corrected
   P-value)=0.04) and chr10:6265006-6267388 (duplication, 10p15.1,
   P=0.0006, P-corr=0.05),were significantly associated with the risk of
   SAH after multiple testing corrections. Our results suggest that the
   newly identified CNV regions may contribute to SAH disease
   susceptibility. Journal of Human Genetics (2010) 55, 726-730;

Abstract = {{Soft-polymer based microparticles are currently being applied in many
   biomedical applications, ranging from bioimaging and bioassays to drug
   delivery carriers. As one class of soft polymers, hydrogels are
   materials that can be used for delivering drug cargoes and can be
   fabricated in controlled sizes. Among the various hydrogel-forming
   polymers, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) based hydrogel systems are widely
   used due to their negligible toxicity and limited immunogenic
   recognition. Physical and chemical properties of particles (i.e.,
   particle size, shape, surface charge, and hydrophobicity) are known to
   play an important role in cell-particle recognition and response. To
   understand the role of physicochemical properties of PEG-based hydrogel
   structures on cells, it is important to have geometrically precise and
   uniform hydrogel structures. To fabricate geometrically uniform
   structures, the authors have employed electron beam lithography and
   ultraviolet optical lithography using PEG or PEG diacrylate polymers.
   These hydrogel structures have been characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy, atomic force microscopy, optical microscopy, and attenuated
   total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, confirming
   control of chemistry, size, and shape. (C) 2010 American Vacuum Society.

   The coherent x-ray diffraction microscope is a recent development where
   highly coherent x-ray sources are used without focusing optics. Instead,

Abstract = {{Belief merging is concerned with the integration of several belief bases
   such that a coherent belief base is developed. Various belief merging
   models that use a belief negotiation game have been developed. These
   models often consist of two key functions, namely, negotiation and
   weakening. A negotiation function finds and selects the weakest belief
   bases among the available belief bases, while the weakening function
   removes the least valuable set of information from the selected belief
   base. This process is iteratively repeated until a consistent belief
   base is developed. In this paper, we extend the current game-based
   belief merging models by introducing the Subjective belief game model.
   The Subjective belief game model operates over a Subjective belief
   profile, which consists of belief bases with Subjectively annotated
   formulas. The Subjective information attached to each formula enables
   the proposed model to prioritize the formulas in the merging process.
   One of the advantages of the proposed game is that it provides room for
   enhancing the content of the weak belief bases, instead of enforcing
   their further weakening. Trustworthiness of the information sources is
   also considered. We provide several instantiations of the model. The
   Subjective belief game model can be useful for formalizing a negotiation
   process between the human participants of a design process in cases
   where discrepancies and conflicts arise. We apply this belief game model
   to an example case study of collaboratively designing some parts of
   unified modeling language (UML) class diagram for vehicle design.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, many current real financial applications have nonlinear and
   uncertain behaviors which change across the time. Therefore, the need to
   solve highly nonlinear, time variant problems has been growing rapidly.
   These problems along with other problems of traditional models caused
   growing interest in artificial intelligent techniques. In this paper,
   comparative research review of three famous artificial intelligence
   techniques, i.e., artificial neural networks, expert systems and hybrid
   intelligence systems, in financial market has been done. A financial
   market also has been categorized on three domains: credit evaluation,
   portfolio management and financial prediction and planning. For each
   technique, most famous and especially recent researches have been
   discussed in comparative aspect. Results show that accuracy of these
   artificial intelligent methods is superior to that of traditional
   statistical methods in dealing with financial problems, especially
   regarding nonlinear patterns. However, this outperformance is not
   absolute.}},

Abstract = {{Mid-troposphere CO2 data retrieved by the AIRS (atmospheric infrared
   sounder) were validated with five ground-based stations and aircraft
   measurements in the Northern Hemisphere. AIRS CO2 products show good
   agreement with ground and aircraft observations. The data had a monthly
   average accuracy better than 3 ppmv. In this study, the spatial and
   temporal distribution of mid-troposphere CO2 from January 2003 to
   December 2008 was analyzed based on this satellite product. The average
   concentration of atmospheric CO2 was higher in the Northern Hemisphere
   than in the Southern Hemisphere. The yearly average results show a
   gradual increase from 2003 to 2008. In China, the annual growth rate was
   about 2 ppmv/a, similar to the United States, Europe, Australia and
   India, but was slightly lower than Canada and Russia. Mid-troposphere
   CO2 concentrations were higher over northern China than over southern
   areas, due to differences in natural conditions and industrial layout.
   There were four centers of high CO2 concentration between 35A degrees
   and 45A degrees N over China, with low concentrations over Yunnan
   Province. There was a significant seasonal CO2 variation with peak
   concentration in spring and the lowest concentration in autumn.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Research shows a significant association between eating
   disorders (ED) and substance use disorders (SUD). The objective of this
   study is to examine the prevalence, chronology, and possibility of
   shared familial risk between SUD and ED symptomatology.
   Method: Subjects included 1,206 monozygotic and 877 dizygotic adult
   female twins. ED symptomatology included anorexia (AN) and bulimia
   nervosa (BN) diagnosis, symptoms associated with diagnostic criteria,
   and BN symptom count. SOD included alcohol, illicit drug, and caffeine
   abuse/dependence. Generalized estimated equation modeling was used to
   examine phenotypic associations, and Choleksy decompositions were used
   to delineate the contribution of genes and environment to comorbidity.
   Results: There were no significant differences between SOD prevalence in
   women with AN and BN. Women with BN reported BN preceded SOD development
   while the reverse was true for AN. Twin analyses showed possible
   familial overlap between BN symptomatology and all SOD examined.
   Discussion: Results suggest an important difference in the chronology of
   EDs and SUDs. Women with BN may be turning to substances to dampen
   bulimic urges. Women with AN may be engaging in substance use initially
   in an effort to lose weight. Results also suggest familial factors
   contribute to the comorbidity between BN and SOD. (C) 2010 by Wiley

Abstract = {{Tegillarca granosa, bloody clam are valuable resource and extensive
   culture bivalve in China. In contrast to other cultured mollusca, very
   few genomic resources are available in this species. In an effort to
   identify clam genes involved in immunity, growth and hemoglobins, a
   normalized full-length cDNA library were constructed from hemocytes of
   the bloody clam. 2278 ESTs from 5' ends of the cDNA clones representing
   1501 unigenes with an average length of 459 bp were obtained from
   library. Cluster analysis of these ESTs identified 1501 unique sequences
   containing 173 contigs and 1328 singletons. Among the sequences that
   matched known genes, based on comparisons with the NCBI non-redundant
   database, the unigene were clustered into six categories, 142 (29.0\%)
   were related to metabolism, 128 (26.3\%) were related to cell
   structure/motility, 94 (19.2\%) were related to gene/protein expression,
   61 (12.5\%) were related to cell signaling/communication, 50 (10.2\%)
   were related to cell/organism immune, and 14 (2.8\%) were related to
   cell division. All contigs and singlets were compared to the public
   protein database using BLASTx, and annotations and descriptions of
   interested genes related to immunity, growth or hemoglobin. These genome
   resources provide a significant number of ESTs for gene discovery and
   development of microarrays for gene expression. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this study, potassium hydroxide catalyst supported on palm shell
   activated carbon was developed for transesterification of palm oil. The
   Central Composite Design (CCD) of the Response Surface Methodology (RSM)
   was employed to investigate the effects of reaction temperature,
   catalyst loading and methanol to oil molar ratio on the production of
   biodiesel using activated carbon supported catalyst. The highest yield
   was obtained at 64.1 degrees C reaction temperature, 30.3 wt.\% catalyst
   loading and 24:1 methanol to oil molar ratio. The physical and chemical
   properties of the produced biodiesel met the standard specifications.
   This study proves that activated carbon supported potassium hydroxide is
   an effective catalyst for transesterification of palm oil. (c) 2010

Abstract = {{Coal mine rejects and sulfide bearing coals are prone to acid mine
   drainage (AMD) formation due to aqueous weathering. These acidic
   effluents contain dissolved trace and potentially harmful elements
   (PHEs) that have considerable impact on the environment. The behavior of
   these elements in AMD is mainly controlled by pH. The focus of the
   present study is to investigate aqueous leaching of mine rejects for
   prediction of acid producing potential, rates of weathering, and release
   of PHEs in mine drainage. Mine reject (MR) and coal samples from the
   active mine sites of Meghalaya, India typically have high S contents
   (1.8-5.7\% in MR and 1.7-4.7\% in coals) with 75-90\% of the S in
   organic form and enrichment of most of the PHEs in rejects. Aqueous
   kinetic leaching experiments on mine rejects showed high acid producing
   potential and release of trace and potentially harmful elements. The
   elements (Sb, As, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni, V and Zn) in mine sample
   leachates are compared with those in mine waters. The concentrations of
   Al, Si, P. K, Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb are found to increase
   with leaching time and are negatively correlated with pH of the
   solution. The processes controlling the release of these elements are
   acid leaching, precipitation and adsorption. The critical loads of PHEs
   in water affected by AMD are calculated by comparing their
   concentrations with those of regulatory levels. The Enrichment Factors
   (EFs) and soil pollution indices (SPIs) for the elements have shown that
   PHEs from coal and mine reject samples are mobilized into the nearby
   environment and are enriched in the associated soil and sediment. (C)

Title = {{Mast cell activation by fibrinogen-related homologous c-terminal

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Haptides are a family of short peptides homologous to
   C-termini sequences of fibrinogen chains beta and gamma (haptides C beta
   and preC gamma, respectively) which were previously shown to penetrate
   and bind cells.
   Objectives: This work investigates the systemic effect of the haptides
   with possible clinical implications.
   Methods: Intra-arterial monitoring in rats recorded the haptides'
   effects on systemic blood pressure. In parallel, their effect was also
   tested in vitro on isolated rat peritoneal mast cells and on human mast
   cells.
   Results: Intra-arterial monitoring in rats showed that intravenous
   administration of low haptides concentrations (35-560 mu g/kg rat)
   caused a shocklike behavior with transient decrease in the systolic and
   diastolic blood pressure by up to 55\% (P < .05) in a dose-dependent
   manner and a minor increase in their heart rate. Randomly scrambled
   sequences of the haptides had no such effect, suggesting a specific
   interaction with receptors. Intravenous administration of blockers to
   histamine receptors H1 and H2 before haptides administration attenuated
   this effect. Furthermore, in vitro incubation of human LAD2 mast cell
   line or isolated rat peritoneal mast cells with the haptides caused
   degranulation of the mast cells. We found that the haptides C beta and
   preC gamma activated mast cells causing histamine release, resulting in
   a steep decrease in blood pressure, comparable to anaphylactic shock.
   Conclusion: In treating vascular occlusive diseases, massive
   fibrinolysis is induced, and haptide-containing sequences are released.
   We suggest that treatment with histamine receptor blockers or with mast
   cell stabilizing agents in such pathological conditions may overcome
   this effect. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2010;126:1041-8.)}},

Abstract = {{Ca2+-independent phospholipase A(2)beta (iPLA(2)beta) selectively
   hydrolyzes docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) in vitro from

   patients with idiopathic neurodegeneration plus brain iron accumulation
   and dystoniaparkinsonism without iron accumulation, whereas mice lacking
   PLA2G6 show neurological dysfunction and neuropathology after 13 months.
   We hypothesized that brain DHA metabolism and signaling would be reduced
   in 4-month-old iPLA(2)beta-deficient mice without overt neuropathology.
   Saline or the cholinergic muscarinic M 1,3,5 receptor agonist arecoline
   (30 mg/kg) was administered to unanesthetized iPLA(2)beta(-/-),
   iPLA(2)beta(+/-), and iPLA(2)beta(+/+) mice, and {[}1-C-14]DHA was
   infused intravenously. DHA incorporation coefficients k{*} and rates
   J(in), representing DHA metabolism, were determined using quantitative
   autoradiography in 81 brain regions. iPLA(2)beta(-/-) or
   iPLA(2)beta(+/-) compared with iPLA(2)beta(+/+) mice showed widespread
   and significant baseline reductions in k{*} and J(in) for DHA. Arecoline
   increased both parameters in brain regions of iPLA(2)beta(+/+) mice but
   quantitatively less so in iPLA(2)beta(-/-) and iPLA(2)beta(+/-) mice.
   Consistent with iPLA(2)beta's reported ability to selectively hydrolyze
   DHA from phospholipid in vitro, iPLA(2)beta deficiency reduces brain DHA

Abstract = {{Diatoms recovered from archaeological features on a Viking Age farmstead
   excavation in the Mosfell Valley in southwestern Iceland are utilized as
   microscopic indicators of turf-based structures. Eroded turf can be
   difficult to distinguish macroscopically from naturally occurring
   sediments because turf foundations erode and melt into the landscape
   over time, leaving minimal evidence of site use. Turf was a principle
   building component in Iceland until the early 20th century. Turf strips
   and blocks were harvested from lowlands where organically rich peat and
   abundant water contributed to the development of bog plants with thick
   root mats that produced premium turf. Diatoms embedded in turf reflect
   the ecological conditions of the peat-bog at the time of deposition.
   Turf was cut from the bog and transported to higher elevations where
   drainage was more conducive to house construction. Siliceous diatom
   frustules are resistant to decay and preserve well archaeologically. The
   presence of diatoms in archaeological sediments is considered a marker
   of sediment provenience and an indication of human site use and
   anthropogenic modification of natural substrates. This paper
   demonstrates how diatom analysis can determine the presence and
   delimitation of archaeological features otherwise difficult to
   distinguish with the naked eye. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{16}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The signature of scaling in human systems is the well-known power law
   whose key characteristic is that the size distributions of their objects
   display self-similarity in space and time. In many systems such as
   cities, firms, and high buildings used here as examples, power laws
   represent an approximation to the fat or heavy tails of their rank-size
   distributions, appearing stable in time with little change in their
   scaling over tens or even hundreds of years. However, when the detailed
   dynamics of how their ranks shift in time is examined, there is
   considerable volatility in such distributions. To explore this
   microvolatility, we introduce measures of rank shift over space and time
   and visualize size distributions using the idea of the ``rank clock.{''}
   We illustrate this for populations of Italian towns between 1300 and
   1861 and then compare this analysis with city-size distributions for the
   world from 430 B.C.E., the United States from 1790, Great Britain
   (England, Scotland, Wales) from 1901, and Israel from 1950. When we
   extend this analysis to the distribution of US firms from 1955 and high
   buildings in New York City and the world from 1909, we generate a rich
   portfolio of space-time dynamics that adds to our understanding of how
   different systems can display stability and regularity at the macro
   level in the face of considerable volatility at the micro. (C) 2010

Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The present paper describes the results of an experimental study
   performed burning alternative fuels, different per quality and
   feedstock, in a modern diesel engine compliance the Euro 5 emission
   standards. Three alternative fuels were tested on the engine and
   compared with a reference fossil fuel in terms of combustion
   characteristics, fuel consumption, noise and emissions. The alternative
   fuels were two biodiesels (RME and SME) and a Fischer-Tropsh (GTL),
   while the reference fuel was an EU certification diesel fuel. The engine
   employed in the study was a light-duty diesel engine developed for
   passenger car and light truck application, and equipped with the new
   generation ECU able to drive the engine under ``torque-controlled{''}
   mode by means of instrumented glow-plugs with pressure sensor. The
   experiments were carried out in a fully instrumented test bench fuelling
   the engine with the various fuels. The tests were done in a wide range
   of engine operation points for the complete characterization of the
   biodiesels performance in the NEDC cycle. Moreover, the trade-off
   NO(x)-PM by EGR sweep in the three most critical test points for the
   engine emission performance was carried out for all fuels. The test
   methodology was selected carefully in order to evaluate the interaction
   between the fuel quality and the engine management strategy. The results
   put in evidence a strong interaction between the alternative fuel
   quality and the engine control mode highlighting the great benefits
   reachable by exploiting simultaneously the alternative fuel quality and
   the flexibility of the new engine management strategies. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Statement of problem Despite good clinical success rates of ceramic
   restorations, fractures of substructures made from high-strength dental
   ceramics remain an issue Transillumination of ceramic restorations has
   been proposed as a means of quality assurance
   Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare the sensitivity of
   transillumination and the fluorescent penetrant method (FPM) in
   detecting microcracks in zirconia and feldspathic ceramic materials
   Material and methods Two groups (n=20) of standardized plates were
   fabricated from zirconia ceramic (Cercon) and feldspathic ceramic
   (VITABLOCS Mark II for CEREC) materials, and central holes were created
   to induce microcracks The plates were microscopically analyzed at x20
   magnification by means of transillumination and FPM Based on whether the
   criterion crack was recognized or not recognized, contingency tables
   were developed Fisher's exact test for count data was used to compare
   frequency distributions (alpha = 05)
   Results Minimum crack length as detected by FPM was 18 mu m in zirconia
   ceramic and 17 mu m in feldspathic ceramic For transillumination,
   minimum detectable crack length was 54 mu m in zirconia ceramic and 33
   mu m in feldspathic ceramic Thirty-seven percent of cracks in
   feldspathic ceramic plates and 64\% of cracks in zirconia ceramic plates
   could not be detected by means of transillumination The conditional
   probabilities for a crack being detected by transillumination, although
   it was detected by FPM, were significantly lower than 1 for both
   materials (P<001) Although transillumination was less sensitive than FPM
   on a relative scale, it was not possible to demonstrate a general
   difference between the 2 analyzing techniques by using statistical
   methods
   Conclusions Using FPM as a relative reference system, transillumination
   appears to be less sensitive in detecting microcracks in ceramic
   components (J Prosthet Dent 2010,104 301-305)}},

Title = {{Hemispheric asymmetries depend on the phonetic feature: A dichotic study

Journal = {{BRAIN AND LANGUAGE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Dichotic listening experiments show a right-ear advantage (REA),
   reflecting a left-hemisphere (LH) dominance. However, we found a
   decrease in REA when the initial stop consonants of two simultaneous
   French CVC words differed in voicing rather than place of articulation
   (Experiment 1). This result suggests that the right hemisphere (RH) is
   more involved in voicing than in place processing. The voiceless-voiced
   contrast is realised as short positive vs. long negative VOT in French
   stop consonants, but as long vs. short positive VOT in English. We
   tested whether the relative involvement of the LH and RH is governed by
   their respective putative specialisation for short and long events. As
   expected, in French, the REA decreased when a voiced stop was presented
   to the left ear and a voiceless stop to the right ear (+V -V), whereas
   the REA had been shown to decrease for (-V +V) pairs in English.
   Additionally, voiced stops were more frequently reported among blend
   responses when a voiced consonant was presented to the left ear. In
   Experiment 2, VCV pairs were used to reduce the stimulus dominance
   effect for voiced consonants, which probably contributed to the low REA
   for (+V -V) pairs in Experiment 1. The reduction of the REA due to a
   voicing difference was maintained, which provides evidence for the
   relative independence of the mechanisms responsible for stimulus
   dominance and perceptual asymmetries in dichotic listening. The results
   are discussed in the light of the Asymmetric Sampling in Time (AST)
   model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The transition of the wake of a circular cylinder is investigated
   numerically via a stabilized finite element method for 150 Re 350 Both
   the flow and aerodynamic coefficients are studied The onset of the
   three-dimensionality of the flow takes place via the mode-A instability
   at Re=200 At this Re, the flow exhibits pure mode-A type flow structures
   for t<1800 At larger times, the vortex dislocations appear spontaneously
   and destroy the spanwise periodicity in the flow This confirms the
   hypothesis that the fully developed mode-A flow structures cannot exist
   without vortex dislocations The appearance of dislocations leads to time
   variation in the vortex shedding frequency They also lead to a reduction
   in the global aerodynamic parameters such as drag coefficient, rms value
   of lift coefficient, and dominant vortex shedding frequency The vortex
   dislocations repetitively appear and disappear from the flow The
   aerodynamic coefficients achieve a relatively lower value at the time
   instant when vortex dislocations appear in the flow This leads to a low
   frequency modulation in the time variation of aerodynamic coefficients
   The onset of mode-A is hysteretic This is demonstrated in the present
   work via computations perhaps for the first time for increasing and
   decreasing Re The transition from mode-A to mode-B vortex structures is
   gradual and not hysteretic Mode-B is devoid of vortex dislocations and,
   therefore, the aerodynamic coefficients achieve a relatively larger
   value The discontinuity in the variation of aerodynamic coefficients
   with Re is captured very well by the present computations Unlike mode-A,
   the flow structures of the mode-B instability are restricted to the near

Abstract = {{Bullying occurs at approximately the same rate in kindergarten as in
   elementary school, but few studies inquired into preschool years
   {[}Alsaker and Nagele, 2008; Stassen Berger, 2007]. This study aimed at:
   (1) verifying the presence in preschoolers of two additional participant
   roles (Consoler and Mediator), besides the six traditional roles
   detected by Salmivalli et al. {[}1996], grouped in four latent
   macroroles, by means of teacher report version of the Eight Participant
   Roles Questionnaire (PRQ){[}Belacchi, 2008]; (2) linking prosocial and
   hostile behaviors to age and gender; and (3) investigating the
   relationship between roles and emotion understanding. Two hundred and
   nineteen children (54\% boys; aged 3-6 years: mean age 4;10) were
   administered the Italian version of the Test of Emotion Comprehension
   {[}Albanese and Molina, 2008]; 20 teachers (2 for each class) filled in
   the questionnaire, attributing frequency scores on 24 items (3 for each
   role) to each pupil. A confirmatory analysis supported the fit of the
   hetero-report version of the Eight PRQ, revealing four macroroles:
   Hostile Roles (Bully, Reinforcer and Assistant), Prosocial Roles
   (Defender, Consoler, and Mediator), Victim, and Outsider. Satisfactory
   interteachers agreement not only confirms the macroroles hypothized, but
   also their expected distribution for gender and age. Moreover, the
   Prosocial roles presented a significant positive correlation with all
   subdimensions of emotion comprehension (External, Mental, and
   Reflective). The Victim and Outsider roles negatively correlated only
   with the External subdimension. The implications of these results for
   prevention and intervention purposes are discussed. Aggr. Behav.

Abstract = {{GATA6 is a zinc finger transcription factor expressed in the colorectal
   epithelium. We have examined the expression of GATA6 in colon cancers
   and investigated the mechanisms by which GATA6 regulates colon cancer
   cell invasion. GATA6 was overexpressed in colorectal polyps and primary
   and metastatic tumors. GATA6 was strongly expressed in both the nuclear
   and cytoplasmic compartments of the colon cancer cells. GATA6 expression
   was upregulated in invasive HT29 and KM12L4 cells compared with the
   parental HT29 and KM12 cells and positively correlated with
   urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene expression. Small
   interfering RNA ( siRNA) knockdown of GATA6 resulted in reduced uPA gene
   expression and cell invasion. GATA6 bound to the uPA gene regulatory
   sequences in vivo and activated uPA promoter activity in vitro. uPA
   promoter deletion analysis indicated that the promoter proximal Sp1
   sites were required for GATA6 activation of the uPA promoter.
   Accordingly, GATA6 physically associated with Sp1 and siRNA knockdown of
   Sp1 decreased GATA6 activation of the uPA promoter activity suggesting
   that Sp1 recruits GATA6 to the uPA promoter and mediates GATA6 induced
   activation of the uPA promoter activity. On the basis of our results, we
   conclude that GATA6 is an important regulator of uPA gene expression,
   and the dysregulated expression of GATA6 contributes to colorectal
   tumorigenesis and tumor invasion.}},

   doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00202.2010.-Glomerular tubular balance maintains a
   stable fractional solute and fluid reabsorption in the proximal tubule
   over a range of glomerular filtration rates. The mediators of this
   process are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that adenosine, produced
   in proximal tubule cells acting on adenosine type 1 receptors (A(1)-AR)
   promotes Na+ and fluid uptake and mediates glomerular tubular balance.
   Absolute proximal fluid reabsorption (J(v)) was measured by in vivo
   microperfusion in A1-AR knockout and wild-type mice during perfusion of
   the closed proximal tubule at 2-10 nl/min. Jv increased with perfusate
   flow from 2-4 nl/min in both strains, but the fractional increase was
   lower in A(1)-AR(-/-) mice (A(1)-AR(+/+): 114\% vs. A(1)-AR(-/-) : 38\%;
   P < 0.001), suggesting reduced glomerular tubular balance (GTB). At
   higher perfusion rates, Jv increased modestly in both strains,
   indicating less GTB at higher flow. The physiological effects of reduced
   GTB in A(1)-AR(-/-) mice were assessed from the response to an acute
   volume load (1 ml/2 min). Na+ excretion and urine flow increased 76 and
   73\% more in A(1)-AR(+/+) mice than A(1)-AR(+/+) over the following 30
   min, accompanied by a higher proximal tubule flow (A(1)-AR(-/-) : 6.9
   +/- 0.9 vs. A(1)-AR(+/+) : 5.2 +/- 0.6 nl/min; P < 0.05). The expression
   of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 and sodium phosphate cotransporter-2
   were similar between strains. In conclusion, GTB is dependent on
   adenosine acting on type 1 receptors in the proximal tubule. This may
   contribute to acute changes in Na+ and fluid reabsorption.}},

Abstract = {{Given a graph G with two distinguished nodes s and t, a cost on each
   edge of G and two fixed integers k >= 2, L >= 2, the k edge-disjoint
   L-hop-constrained paths problem is to find a minimum cost subgraph of G
   such that between s and t there are at least k edge-disjoint paths of
   length at most L. In this paper we consider this problem from a
   polyhedral point of view. We give an integer programming formulation for
   the problem and discuss the associated polytope. In particular, we show
   that when L = 3 and k >= 2, the linear relaxation of the associated
   polytope, given by the trivial, the st-cut and the so-called L-path-cut
   inequalities, is integral. As a consequence, we obtain a polynomial time
   cutting plane algorithm for the problem when L = 2, 3 and k >= 1. This
   generalizes the results of Huygens et al. (2004) {[}1] for k = 2 and L =
   2,3 and those of Dahl et al. (2006) {[}2] for L = 2 and k >= 2. This
   also proves a conjecture in {[}1]. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The family of decision tree learning algorithms is among the most
   widespread and studied. Motivated by the desire to develop learning
   algorithms that can generalize when learning highly varying functions
   such as those presumably needed to achieve artificial intelligence, we
   study some theoretical limitations of decision trees. We demonstrate
   formally that they can be seriously hurt by the curse of dimensionality
   in a sense that is a bit different from other nonparametric statistical
   methods, but most importantly, that they cannot generalize to variations
   not seen in the training set. This is because a decision tree creates a
   partition of the input space and needs at least one example in each of
   the regions associated with a leaf to make a sensible prediction in that
   region. A better understanding of the fundamental reasons for this
   limitation suggests that one should use forests or even deeper
   architectures instead of trees, which provide a form of distributed
   representation and can generalize to variations not encountered in the
   training data.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of pH and two post-emulsification treatments (pH
   modification and thermal cycles) over linear dynamic viscoelasticity and
   droplet size distribution, DSD, of O/W emulsions (75\% oil) stabilized
   either by soy protein isolate, SPI, or wheat gluten, WG were studied in
   the present work. Rheological properties and droplet size of fresh
   emulsions showed an important dependence on pH as a consequence of the
   role of electrostatic interactions, not being possible to obtain a
   stable emulsion for pH values close to the protein isoelectric point,
   pI, (4-5 for SPI and 6 for WG). In order to overcome this inconvenient,
   an alternative emulsification procedure, basically consisting in a
   modification of pH after emulsification (indirect emulsification), was
   successfully developed. Emulsions obtained after this
   post-emulsification treatment, showed higher elastic (G') and loss (G
   `') moduli and also larger oil droplets than fresh emulsions prepared at
   the same pH. Moreover, the application of upward/downward temperature
   cycles from 20 to 70 degrees C to emulsions directly prepared at a pH
   yielded to significantly higher values of the rheological functions when
   compared to those found for fresh emulsions. Accordingly, both
   post-emulsification treatments lead to apparent enhancements in emulsion
   rheology and microstructure, which is indicative of a good potential to
   improve long-term emulsion stability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The `within-season' module of the Weed Manager decision support system
   (DSS) predicts the effect of twelve UK arable weeds on winter wheat
   yields and profitability. The model and decision algorithm that underpin
   the DSS are described and their performance discussed. The model
   comprises: (i) seedling germination and emergence, (ii) early growth,
   (iii) phenological development, (iv) herbicide and cultivation effects
   and (v) crop yield loss. Crop and weed emergence are predicted from the
   timing and method of cultivation, species biology, and the weather.
   Wheat and weeds compete for resources, and yield losses are predicted
   from their relative leaf area at canopy closure. Herbicides and cultural
   control methods reduce weed green area index, improving crop yield. A
   decision algorithm identifies economically successful weed management
   strategies based on model output. The output of the Weed Manager model
   and decision algorithm was extensively validated by experts, who
   confirmed the predicted responses to herbicide application were
   sufficiently accurate for practical use. Limited independent data were
   also used in the validation. The development of the module required
   integrating novel and existing approaches for simulating weed seedling
   establishment, plant development and decision algorithm design.
   Combining these within Weed Manager created a framework suitable for
   commercial use. Crown Copyright (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Chromium: NLTE abundances in metal-poor stars and nucleosynthesis in the
   Galaxy}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{522}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Aims. We investigate statistical equilibrium of Cr in the atmospheres of
   late-type stars to ascertain whether the systematic abundance
   discrepancy between Cr I and Cr II lines, as often found in previous
   work, is due to deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).
   Furthermore, we attempt to interpret the Non-LTE (NLTE) trend of
   {[}Cr/Fe] with {[}Fe/H] using chemical evolution models for the solar
   neighborhood.
   Methods. NLTE calculations are performed for the model of the Cr atom,
   comprising 340 levels and 6806 transitions in total. We use the
   quantum-mechanical photoionization cross-sections of Nahar (2009) and
   investigate the sensitivity of the model to uncertain cross-sections for
   H I collisions. NLTE line formation is performed for the MAFAGS-ODF
   model atmospheres of the Sun and 10 metal-poor stars with -3.2 <
   {[}Fe/H] < -0.5, and Cr abundances are derived by comparing the
   synthetic and observed flux spectra.
   Results. We achieve good ionization equilibrium of Cr for models with
   different stellar parameters, if inelastic collisions with H I atoms are
   neglected. The solar NLTE abundance based on Cr I lines is 5.74 dex with
   sigma = 0.05 dex, which is similar to 0.1 dex higher than the LTE
   abundance. For the metal-poor stars, the NLTE abundance corrections to
   Cr I lines range from +0.3 to +0.5 dex. The resulting {[}Cr/Fe] ratio is
   roughly solar for the range of metallicities analyzed here, which is
   consistent with current views on the production of these iron peak
   elements in supernovae.
   Conclusions. The tendency of Cr to become deficient with respect to Fe
   in metal-poor stars is an artifact caused by the neglect of NLTE effects
   in the line formation of Cr I, and has no relation to any peculiar
   physical conditions in the Galactic ISM or deficiencies of
   nucleosynthesis theory.}},

Abstract = {{A large number of azodicarboxylates and their derivatives are produced
   and used in the chemical industries. The versatile applications of these
   azodicarboxylates in research institutes and in the chemical industries
   for chemical synthesis arouse additional hazards. The intent of this
   paper is to obtain first knowledge about the structure-response
   relationship regarding the explosive properties and the thermal hazards
   of different versatile used azodicarboxylates. The substances are
   examined with the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Furthermore,
   different laboratory test methods, based on the UN Recommendations on
   the Transport of Dangerous Goods, are applied to determine the explosive
   properties of the mentioned substances. On the basis of the obtained
   results, the known influence of the nitrogen content within the molecule
   regarding their thermal behaviour could be confirmed. The measured heat
   of decomposition appeared to be proportional to the nitrogen content
   within the group of the aliphatic and the aromatic azodicarboxylates. To
   emphasize this dependency, further investigations should be done. The
   long term objective of this research is to develop structure response
   relationships of the explosive properties and the thermal hazards
   originating from azodicarboxylates. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Increasing evidence indicates that thrombin plays a role not only in
   thrombosis but also in the progression of atherosclerosis. Aim: The
   relationship between thrombin generation and intima-media thickness
   (IMT) as an index of subclinical atherosclerosis was investigated.
   Participants, material, methods: We examined 163 asymptomatic
   middle-aged persons free of overt clinical atherosclerotic disease. They
   underwent ultrasonography of the common carotid arteries. In addition,
   thrombin generation was measured by means of CAT (calibrated automated
   thrombography). For our study we divided the healthy study participants
   into three age groups (< 45, 45-60 and > 60 years). Results: A
   significant positive correlation was seen between endogenous thrombin
   potential (ETP) (p = 0.012), time to peak (TTP) (p = 0.033) start tail
   (p = 0.007) and carotid IMT in the group of healthy volunteers younger
   than 45 years. Conclusion: We demonstrated that in adults younger than
   45 years without clinically overt atherosclerotic disease ETP was
   significantly associated with carotid IMT. It is tempting to speculate
   that ETP may serve as an index for subclinical atherosclerosis in
   persons below 45 years.}},

   Grapevine fleck virus (GFkV), Grapevine leafroll associated virus-1
   (GLRaV-1) and Grapevine leafroll associated virus-3 (GLRaV-3). Ninety
   five sampling points were selected and the position of grapevine plants
   georeferenced. Samples were collected in two different vegetative
   periods and analyses were performed by ELISA and real-time RT-PCR.
   Purified RNA and immobilized viral targets from plant extracts on nylon
   membranes were used in parallel assays as templates for PCR assays. In
   order to analyse these five viral species by real-time RT-PCR, new
   specific primers and TaqMan probes were designed for detection of ArMV
   and GFkV. Real time RT-PCR from purified RNA was more sensitive than
   spot version and ELISA tests. The most prevalent virus was GFLV (95.8\%)
   followed by GLRaV-3 (94.7\%), GLRaV-1 (66.3\%) and GFkV (65.3\%). ArMV
   was not detected in any sample. The high level of viral infections and
   the presence of mixed infections suggest that initial infected plant
   material and uncontrolled traffic of propagation material have played an
   important role in the spread of viruses.}},

Abstract = {{In mammalian cells, DNA-bound Fe(II) reacts with H(2)O(2) producing the
   highly reactive hydroxyl radical ((center dot)OH) in situ. Since (center
   dot)OH attacks nearby DNA residue generating oxidative DNA damage, many
   questions have arisen regarding iron-DNA complex formations and their
   implication in pre-malignant mutations and aging. In this work, a solid
   sample of Fe(II)-DNA complex containing one Fe(II) per 10 nucleotides
   was analyzed from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
   spectra collected in a synchrotron radiation light source. Best fitting
   parameters of the EXAFS signal for the first two shells provide evidence
   of five oxygen atoms at 1.99 +/- 0.02 angstrom and one nitrogen atom at
   2.20 +/- 0.02 angstrom in the inner coordination sphere of the
   Fe(II)-DNA complex. Considering that both purine base moieties bearing
   nitrogen atoms are prone to chelate iron, these results are consistent
   with the previously observed lower levels of DNA damage in cytosine
   nucleotides relative to adenine and guanine sites in cells under more
   physiological conditions of Fe(II) Fenton reaction. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to establish the influences of high hafnium

   beta-NiAl coatings. Binary NiAl and ternary NiAl-1.0 at.\% Hf coatings
   were deposited onto CMSX-4 (R) superalloy substrates via unbalanced DC
   magnetron sputtering. Investigations were conducted using scanning
   electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, transmission electron
   microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and three-dimensional atom probe
   tomography in an effort to determine the influences of annealing on the
   coating microstructures and coating/substrate interdiffusion. All
   as-deposited coatings were found to consist of a B2 structured solid
   solution consistent with the Ni-rich beta-NiAl. Post-deposition
   annealing at 1000 degrees C resulted in significant coating-substrate
   interdiffusion and in the formation of an interdiffusion zone, the
   extent/thickness of which decreased with the addition of Hf Annealing
   additionally produced gamma'-Ni3Al precipitates in the binary coatings
   and nanometer-sized Hf-rich precipitates in Hf-containing coatings. The
   majority of these precipitates were identified as the equilibrium
   Heusler (i e, Ni2AlHf) phase; however, when Hf-containing specimens were
   annealed in a high carbon environment, significant concentrations of
   carbon were incorporated Into the coatings. This sometimes resulted in
   the formation of HfC precipitates The results have been analyzed and
   discussed relative to previous research on sputter deposited NiAl-Hf

Abstract = {{Introduction This retrospective analysis compared sensitivity to change
   on the 17-item and 6-item Hamilton rating scales for depression
   (HAM-D-17 and HAM-D-6, respectively) in relation to antidepressant dose
   and baseline depression severity
   Methods Data were derived from 6 randomized double-blind,
   placebo-controlled, 8-week trials of fixed-dose desvenlafaxine (50, 100
   200 or 400 mg/d) for major depressive disorder HAM-D-17 and HAM-D-6
   effect sizes were assessed
   Results HAM-D-17 effect sizes were negative (favoured placebo) for
   higher desvenlafaxine doses (200-400 mg/d) at week 1 but were positive
   for all doses after week 2, with no clear dose-response pattern However,
   HAM-D-6 effect sizes were positive for all doses at all weeks Effect
   sizes were consistently greater for HAM-D-6 vs HAM-D-17, regardless of
   time spent under therapy Effect sizes were greater for HAM-D-6 vs
   HAM-D-17 for all desvenlafaxine doses among patients with baseline
   HAM-D-17 <25 but not among patients with baseline HAM-D-17 >= 25
   Discussion The HAM-D-6 demonstrated greater sensitivity to change and
   robustness than the HAM-D-17, supporting the greater homogeneity of the
   HAM-D-6}},

Abstract = {{The classical functional delta method (FDM) provides a convenient tool
   for deriving the asymptotic distribution of statistical functionals from
   the weak convergence of the respective empirical processes. However, for
   many interesting functionals depending on the tails of the underlying
   distribution this FDM cannot be applied since the method typically
   relies on Hadamard differentiability w.r.t. the uniform sup-norm. In
   this article, we present a version of the FDM which is suitable also for
   nonuniform sup-norms, with the outcome that the range of application of
   the FDM enlarges essentially. On one hand, our FDM, which we shall call
   the modified FDM, works for functionals that are ``differentiable{''} in
   a weaker sense than Hadamard differentiability. On the other hand, it
   requires weak convergence of the empirical process w.r.t. a nonuniform
   sup-norm. The latter is not problematic since there exist strong
   respective results on weighted empirical processes obtained by Shorack
   and Wellner (1986) {[}25], Shao and Yu (1996) {[}23], Wu (2008) {[}32],
   and others. We illustrate the gain of the modified FDM by deriving the
   asymptotic distribution of plug-in estimates of popular risk measures
   that cannot be treated with the classical FDM. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the quality of life and susceptibility for chronic
   disease development of the oldest generation of young adults conceived
   by IVF in the U.S.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Setting: Single tertiary clinic.
   Patient(s): Young adults conceived by standard IVF between 1981 and
   1990.
   Intervention(s): Self-administered questionnaire.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Indicators of physical, psychologic, and
   behavioral health.
   Result(s): A total of 173 (31\%) of 560 eligible young adults completed
   the questionnaire. Mean age was 21.2 years (range 18-26 years) and
   male-to-female ratio was 3:4. A limited number were conceived through
   gamete donation but none through oocyte/embryo micromanipulation.
   Prevalence rates of overweight and obesity were 35\% and 10\%,
   respectively. More than 65\% were ever diagnosed with a chronic
   condition; most diagnoses were psychiatric, ocular, respiratory, and
   cardiometabolic in nature. Almost 40\% of respondents were lifetime
   smokers, 62\% reported binge drinking in the previous year, and >90\%
   were physically active in the preceding month. Survey participants were
   mostly similar to a subsample of the 1999-2004 National Health and
   Nutrition Examination Survey on selected health indicators.
   Conclusion(s): Young adults conceived by IVF appear to be healthy and
   well adjusted, although the preponderance of psychologic health problems
   requires further investigation. (Fertil Steril (R) 2010;94:2043-9. (C)

   many applications in modern optics or nanomechanics. The authors present
   four fabrication paths to create gold patterns that are supported by 1

   monolayers. Two fabrication schemes apply resist based lithographic
   processes to define gold structures on nanosheets. The gold/nanomembrane
   hybrids are then released from their substrates to form a freestanding
   structure. In two further fabrication schemes, the direct metal
   deposition of metal onto a freestanding graphenoid is performed. All
   four schemes are capable of producing gold patterns on two-dimensional
   nanomaterials, thus resembling new paths for the routine fabrication of
   free-floating metallic structures. (c) 2010 American Vacuum Society.

Abstract = {{This research tests whether comprehenders use their knowledge of typical
   events in real time to process verbal arguments. In self-paced reading
   and event-related brain potential (ERP) experiments, we used materials
   in which the likelihood of a specific patient noun (brakes or spelling)
   depended on the combination of an agent and verb (mechanic checked vs.
   journalist checked). Reading times were shorter at the word directly
   following the patient for the congruent than the incongruent items.
   Differential N400s were found earlier, immediately at the patient.
   Norming studies ruled out any account of these results based on direct
   relations between the agent and patient. Thus, comprehenders dynamically
   combine information about real-world events based on intrasentential
   agents and verbs, and this combination then rapidly influences online

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Chromatin is broadly compartmentalized in two defined states:
   euchromatin and heterochromatin. Generally, euchromatin is trimethylated
   on histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4(me3)) while heterochromatin contains the
   H3K9(me3) mark. The H3K9(me3) modification is added by lysine
   methyltransferases (KMTs) such as SETDB1. Herein, we show that SETDB1
   interacts with its substrate H3, but only in the absence of the
   euchromatic mark H3K4(me3). In addition, we show that SETDB1 fails to
   methylate substrates containing the H3K4(me3) mark. Likewise, the
   functionally related H3K9 KMTs G9A, GLP and SUV39H1 also fail to bind
   and to methylate H3K4(me3) substrates. Accordingly, we provide in vivo
   evidence that H3K9(me2)-enriched histones are devoid of H3K4(me2/3) and
   that histones depleted of H3K4(me2/3) have elevated H3K9(me2/3). The
   correlation between the loss of interaction of these KMTs with H3K4(me3)
   and concomitant methylation impairment leads to the postulate that at
   least these four KMTs require stable interaction with their respective
   substrates for optimal activity. Thus, novel substrates could be
   discovered via the identification of KMT interacting proteins. Indeed,
   we find that SETDB1 binds to and methylates a novel substrate, the
   inhibitor of growth protein ING2, while SUV39H1 binds to and methylates
   the heterochromatin protein HP1 alpha. Thus, our observations suggest a
   mechanism of post-translational regulation of lysine methylation and
   propose a potential mechanism for the segregation of the biologically
   opposing marks, H3K4(me3) and H3K9(me3). Furthermore, the correlation
   between H3-KMTs interaction and substrate methylation highlights that
   the identification of novel KMT substrates may be facilitated by the
   identification of interaction partners.}},

   abundant transcripts were expressed constitutively. 71 transcripts were
   upregulated specifically during excystation and 42 during encystation.
   Nonetheless, the transcriptomes of cysts and trophozoites showed major
   differences. SAGE detected co-expressed clusters of 284 transcripts
   differentially expressed in cysts and excyzoites and 287 transcripts in
   vegetative trophozoites and encysting cells. All clusters included known
   genes and pathways as well as proteins unique to Giardia or diplomonads.
   SAGE analysis of the Giardia life cycle identified a number of kinases,
   phosphatases, and DNA replication proteins involved in excystation and
   encystation, which could be important for examining the roles of cell
   signaling in giardial differentiation. Overall, these data pave the way

Title = {{Orbital evolution of eccentric planets in radiative discs}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{523}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Context. With an average eccentricity of about 0.29, the eccentricity
   distribution of extrasolar planets is markedly different from the solar
   system. Among other scenarios considered, it has been proposed that
   eccentricity may grow through planet-disc interaction. Recently, it has
   been noticed that the thermodynamical state of the disc can
   significantly influence the migration properties of growing
   protoplanets. However, the evolution of planetary eccentricity in
   radiative discs has not been considered yet.
   Aims. In this paper we study the evolution of planets on eccentric
   orbits that are embedded in a three-dimensional viscous disc and analyse
   the disc's effect on the orbital evolution of the planet.
   Methods. We use the three-dimensional hydrodynamical code NIRVANA that
   includes full tensor viscosity and implicit radiation transport in the
   flux-limited diffusion approximation. The code uses the FARGO-algorithm
   to speed up the simulations. First we measure the torque and power
   exerted on the planet by the disc for fixed orbits, and then we let the
   planet start with initial eccentricity and evolve it in the disc.
   Results. For locally isothermal discs we confirm previous results and
   find eccentricity damping and inward migration for planetary cores. For
   low eccentricity (e less than or similar to 2H/r) the damping is
   exponential, while for higher e it follows. e proportional to e(-2). In
   the case of radiative discs, the planets experience an inward migration
   as long as its eccentricity lies above a certain threshold. After the
   damping of eccentricity cores with masses below 33 M-Earth begin to
   migrate outward in radiative discs, while higher mass cores always
   migrate inward. For all planetary masses studied (up to 200 M-Earth) we
   find eccentricity damping.
   Conclusions. In viscous discs the orbital eccentricity of embedded
   planets is damped during the evolution independent of the mass. Hence,
   planet-disc interaction does not seem to be a viable mechanism to
   explain the observed high eccentricity of exoplanets.}},

Abstract = {{Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) and dwarf nova oscillations (DNOs)
   occur in dwarf novae and nova-like variables during outburst and
   occasionally during quiescence, and have analogs in high-mass X-ray
   binaries and black-hole candidates. The frequent low coherence of
   quasi-period oscillations and DNOs can make detection with standard
   time-series tools such as periodograms problematic. This paper develops
   tools to analyze quasi-periodic brightness oscillations. We review the
   use of time-frequency representations (TFRs) in the astronomical
   literature, and show that representations such as the Choi-Williams
   distribution and Zhao-Atlas-Marks representation, which are best suited
   to high signal-to-noise data, cannot be assumed a priori to be the best
   techniques for our data, which have a much higher noise level and lower
   coherence. This leads us to a detailed analysis of the time-frequency
   resolution and statistical properties of six TFRs. We conclude that the
   wavelet scalogram, with the addition of wavelet ridges and maxima
   points, is the most effective TFR for analyzing quasi-periodicities in
   low signal-to-noise data, as it has high time-frequency resolution, and
   is a minimum variance estimator. We use the wavelet ridges method to
   re-analyze archival data from VW Hyi, and find 62 new QPOs and 7 new
   long-period DNOs. Relative to previous analyses, our method
   substantially improves the detection rate for QPOs.}},

Title = {{Vancomycin MIC Susceptibility Testing of Methicillin-Susceptible and
   Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Isolates: A Comparison
   Between Etest (R) and an Automated Testing Method}},
Journal = {{SOUTHERN MEDICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1124-1128}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Vancomycin treatment failures and increased mortality have
   been reported in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
   isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) >1 mu g/mL. Most
   of this data utilized manual testing to determine the MIC. Recent
   vancomycin treatment guidelines do not specify the optimal testing
   method to define the MIC.
   Methods: Over a twelve-month study period, we compared manual
   susceptibility testing by Etest (R) (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) with
   automated testing by MicroScan Walk-Away (R) (Dade Behring, Inc., East
   Mississauga, Ontario) to determine the difference in the MICs among 383
   sequential clinical S aureus isolates.
   Results: Manual testing demonstrated MICs of 1.5 mu g/mL or 2.0 mu g/mL
   in 90\% and 86\% of MRSA and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus
   (MSSA) isolates, respectively. Automated testing revealed MICs of 2.0 mu
   g/mL for 56\% and 54\% of MRSA and MSSA isolates, respectively. The
   manual MIC test by Etest (R) was >1 mu g/mL in 87\% of MRSA isolates and
   86\% of methicillin-susceptible S aureus isolates in which the automated
   MIC result was 1 mu g/mL. This same finding occurred in 94\% (17/18) of
   S aureus isolates causing non-skin/skin structure infections. Among all
   subgroups of isolates, manual testing demonstrated statistically
   significant higher MICs compared to automated testing.
   Conclusions: MIC results generated by the Etest (R) consistently
   revealed a one dilution higher vancomycin MIC compared to MicroScan (R).
   Automated MIC results of invasive MRSA isolates should be confirmed by
   manual Etest (R) to ensure identification of those isolates with
   vancomycin MICs >1 mu g/mL that are at risk for vancomycin treatment
   failure or increased mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Online support resources have become viable alternatives to face-to-face
   support groups for cancer patients. It is important to understand how
   individuals make use of such online support resources and what, if any,
   differences exist between groups. A content analysis was conducted on
   3203 posted messages to prostate and breast cancer support sites on
   Google Groups and WebMD. Overall, post-treatment survivors were the most
   common posters followed by spouses; however, the proportion of posters
   varied by site. For both groups, messages of support were most frequent.
   However the type of support varied by cancer type. Support messages on
   the breast cancer sites were mostly offers of emotional support.
   Conversely, messages of support on the prostate cancer sites focused on
   informational support. Messages of emotional well-being and
   medical-related comments were next most common on the breast cancer
   sites, whereas medical issues and sexual intimacy were on the prostate
   cancer sites. Overall, these findings identify several key differences
   in the use and benefits of online support sites for breast and prostate

   goal was to understand the pedagogical use of ICTs in schools in 22
   education systems. We aim to contextualize South Africa's participation
   in SITES 2006 on four levels: (i) the nature and structure of the South
   African education system, (ii) a review of South Africa's participation
   in SITES 2006, (iii) ICT infrastructure, facilities and equipment, and
   (iv) teachers' use of ICTs for teaching and learning. SITES 2006
   administered three questionnaires to school principals, technology
   coordinators, and mathematics and science teachers. The final sample
   consisted of 666 mathematics and 622 science teachers. Although most
   education systems collected data via the internet, South Africa was the
   only country that used only a paper-and-pencil data collection strategy
   with an average return rate of 90\%. South Africa scored low on most
   variables, e.g. ICT infrastructure, facilities, and equipment. A large
   percentage of South African teachers reported their ICT incompetence.

Title = {{Effect of Ambrotose AO (R) on resting and exercise-induced antioxidant
   capacity and oxidative stress in healthy adults}},
Journal = {{NUTRITION JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: The purpose of this investigation was to determine the
   effects of a dietary supplement (Ambrotose AO (R)) on resting and
   exercise-induced blood antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress in
   exercise-trained and untrained men and women.
   Methods: 25 individuals (7 trained and 5 untrained men; 7 trained and 6
   untrained women) received Ambrotose AO (R) (4 capsules per day = 2 grams
   per day) or a placebo for 3 weeks in a random order, double blind
   cross-over design (with a 3 week washout period). Blood samples were
   collected at rest, and at 0 and 30 minutes following a graded exercise
   treadmill test (GXT) performed to exhaustion, both before and after each
   3 week supplementation period. Samples were analyzed for Trolox
   Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC), Oxygen Radical Absorbance
   Capacity (ORAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and
   nitrate/nitrite (NOx). Quality of life was assessed using the SF 12 form
   and exercise time to exhaustion was recorded. Resting blood samples were
   analyzed for complete blood count (CBC), metabolic panel, and lipid
   panel before and after each 3 week supplementation period. Dietary
   intake during the week before each exercise test was recorded.
   Results: No condition effects were noted for SF-12 data, for GXT time to
   exhaustion, or for any variable within the CBC, metabolic panel, or
   lipid panel (p > 0.05). Treatment with Ambrotose AO (R) resulted in an
   increase in resting levels of TEAC (p = 0.02) and ORAC (p < 0.0001). No
   significant change was noted in resting levels of MDA, H2O2, or NOx (p >
   0.05). Exercise resulted in an acute increase in TEAC, MDA, and H2O2 (p
   < 0.05), all which were higher at 0 minutes post exercise compared to
   pre exercise (p < 0.05). No condition effects were noted for exercise
   related data (p > 0.05), with the exception of ORAC (p = 0.0005) which
   was greater at 30 minutes post exercise for Ambrotose AO (R) compared to
   placebo.
   Conclusion: Ambrotose AO (R) at a daily dosage of 4 capsules per day
   increases resting blood antioxidant capacity and may enhance post
   exercise antioxidant capacity. However, no statistically detected
   difference is observed in resting or exercise-induced oxidative stress
   biomarkers, in quality of life, or in GXT time to exhaustion.}},

Abstract = {{Background: It is well established that in both food- and drug-addicted
   individuals there is ``dopamine resistance{''} associated with the DRD2
   gene A1 allele. Based on earlier studies, evidence is emerging wherein
   the potential of utilizing a natural, nonaddicting, safe, putative D 2
   agonist may play a significant role in the recovery of individuals with
   reward deficiency syndrome, including those addicted to psychoactive
   chemicals. Findings: Positive outcomes demonstrated by quantitative
   electroencephalographic (qEEG) imaging in a randomized, tripleblind,
   placebo-controlled, crossover study involving oral Synaptose Complex
   KB220Z (TM) showed an increase of alpha waves and low beta wave activity
   in the parietal brain region. Using t statistics, significant
   differences observed between placebo and Synaptose Complex KB220Z (TM)
   consistently occurred in the frontal regions after week 1 and then again
   after week 2 of analyses (P = 0.03). This is the first report to
   demonstrate involvement of the prefrontal cortex in the qEEG response to
   a natural putative D-2 agonist (Synaptose Complex KB220Z (TM)),
   especially evident in dopamine D-2 A1 allele subjects. Independently, we
   have further supported this finding with an additional study of 3
   serious polydrug abusers undergoing protracted abstinence who carried
   the DRD2 A1 allele. Significant qEEG differences were found between
   those who received 1 dose of placebo compared with those who were
   administered Synaptose Complex KB220Z (TM). Synaptose Complex KB220Z
   (TM) induced positive regulation of the dysregulated electrical activity
   of the brain in these addicts. The results are indicative of a phase
   change from low amplitude or low power in the brain to a more regulated
   state by increasing an average of 6.169 mV(2) across the prefrontal
   cortical region. In the first experiment we found that while 50\% of the
   subjects carried the DRD2 A1 allele, 100\% carried > 1 risk allele.
   Specifically, based on the proposed addiction risk score for these 14
   subjects, 72\% had moderate-to-severe addiction risk. Similar findings
   were obtained by repeating the experiment in 3 additional currently
   abstinent polydrug abusers carrying the DRD2 A1 allele. Conclusion: This
   seminal work will provide important information that may ultimately lead
   to significant improvement in the recovery of individuals with
   psychostimulant and polydrug abuse problems, specifically those with
   genetically induced dopamine deficiency. Based on this small sample
   size, we are proposing that with necessary large populations supporting
   these initial results, and possibly even additional candidate genes and
   single nucleotide polymorphisms, we may eventually have the clinical
   ability to classify severity according to genotype and possession of
   risk alleles, along with offering a safe, nonaddicting, natural
   dopaminergic receptor agonist that potentially upregulates instead of
   downregulates dopaminergic receptors, preferably the D-2 subtype.}},

Abstract = {{Ten high boiling solvents were evaluated as the extraction solvent of
   furfural. o-Nitrotoluene with a high furfural distribution coefficient,
   high thermal stability, and having no azeotrope with furfural was chosen
   as a furfural extraction solvent for further study. The mutual
   solubilities for the water-o-nitrotoluene system were experimentally
   determined from (383.15 to 483.15) K at 25.0 bar using a static method.
   According to the results, it can be seen that the solubilities are
   temperature-dependent and can be correlated with a quadratic equation
   well. The distribution, coefficients for furfural and acetic acid in the
   water-o-nitrotoluene system were determined from (303.15 to 483.15) K at
   25.0 bar using a static method, respectively. The results show that the
   distribution coefficients are temperature-dependent and can be
   correlated with van't Hoff equation well. Considering the high
   selectivity for furfural, the low selectivity for acetic acid and
   negligible mutual solubilities with water, o-nitrotoluene was considered
   as a suitable solvent for furfural production in the solvent extraction
   process.}},

   a decrease of the glass transition temperature. For membranes doped with
   85 wt.\% phosphoric acid solution proton conductivity increased up to
   2.10(-3) S cm(-1) at 120 degrees C and at 5\% relative humidity. The

Abstract = {{The chip-scale integration of optical components is crucial for
   technologies as diverse as optical communications, optoelectronics
   displays and photovoltaics. However the realization of integrated
   optical devices from discrete components is often hampered by the lack
   of a universal substrate for achieving monolithic integration and by
   incompatibilities between materials. Emergent technologies such as
   chip-scale photonics organic optoelectronics and optofluidics present a
   host of new challenges for optical device integration which cannot be
   solved with existing bonding techniques. Here, we report a new method
   for substrate independent integration of dissimilar optical components
   by way of biological recognition directed assembly. Bonding in this
   scheme is achieved by locally modifying the substrate with a protein
   receptor and the optical component with a biomolecular ligand or vice
   versa. The key features of this new technology include substrate
   independent assembly, cross-platform vertical scale integration and
   selective registration of components based on complementary biomolecular
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To investigate the analgesic properties of different dose combinations
   of midazolam and dexmedetomidine administered intraperitoneally (IP) in
   the rat.
   Study design
   Prospective experimental trial.
   Animals
   Seventy adult male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g.
   Methods
   Dexmedetomidine (D) 0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, 0.15, 0.18, 0.21 mg kg-1 and
   midazolam (M) 5, 10, 25, 50 mg kg-1 were administered IP, alone then in
   combinations ranging from 0.03 D:5 M to 0.18 D:30 M mg kg-1. Analgesia
   was evaluated using the tail-flick test at time 0 (before injection),
   15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 minutes.
   Results
   Midazolam at all doses administered (5-50 mg kg-1) did not significantly
   change tail-flick latencies from baseline values whereas D showed clear
   dose-dependent increases in tail-flick latency for doses administered in
   the range of 0.03-0.18 mg kg-1. Tail-flick latencies in rats
   administered D + M combinations were significantly greater than D alone
   (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions
   A dose-related analgesic effect was demonstrated for D in the rat, which
   was enhanced by co-administration of M.
   Clinical relevance
   The combination of D + M administered IP to rats at doses of 0.12:20 and
   0.09:15 mg kg-1 was shown to be a good combination to provide
   sedation/analgesia with a duration of action greater than 60 minutes.
   The onset of sedation was rapid (1-3 minutes), and onset of profound
   analgesia was reached within 5-10 minutes.}},

Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{16-17}},
Pages = {{1351-1355}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Presence of residual blood is a common problem in
   cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diagnostics of ventriculitis. We hypothesised
   that neutrophil granulocytes in infected, blood-containing CSF lose
   CD62L expression. Therefore CD62L expression on neutrophils may present
   a complementary marker to distinguish between patients with residual
   blood and infection.
   Designs and methods: Evaluation was performed in 64 ventricular CSF
   samples sent to the laboratory for diagnostic investigation. Cell count,
   microbiological culture, total protein and flow cytometric analysis of
   CSF were performed.
   Results: Cell counts and CD62L expression were significantly different
   between the culture positive and negative group. ROC-analysis revealed a
   significant predictive value for cell count and CD62L expression.
   Optimal cut-offs were calculated and a decision tree was established to
   predict a positive culture.
   Conclusions: Cell count and CD62L expression were predictive for a
   positive culture and the combination helped to increase specificity and
   sensitivity for the detection of ventriculitis in blood-containing CSF.

Abstract = {{Soil water content (SWC) plays a key role in partitioning water and
   energy fluxes at the land surface and in controlling hydrologic fluxes
   such as groundwater recharge. Despite the importance of SWC, it is not
   yet measured in an operational way at larger scales. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the potential of wireless sensor network
   technology for the near-real-time monitoring of SWC at the field and
   headwater catchment scales using the recently developed wireless sensor
   network SoilNet. The forest catchment Wustebach (similar to 27 ha) was
   instrumented with 150 end devices and 600 EC-5 SWC sensors from the
   ECH2O series by Decagon Devices. In the period between August and
   November 2009, more than six million SWC measurements were obtained. The
   observed spatial variability corresponded well with results from
   previous studies. The very low scattering in the plots of mean SWC
   against SWC variance indicates that the sensor network data provide a
   more accurate estimate of SWC variance than discontinuous data from
   measurement campaigns, due, e. g., to fixed sampling locations and
   permanently installed sensors. The spatial variability in SWC at the
   50-cm depth was significantly lower than at 5 cm, indicating that the
   longer travel time to this depth reduced the spatial variability of SWC.
   Topographic features showed the strongest correlation with SWC during
   dry periods, indicating that the control of topography on the SWC
   pattern depended on the soil water status. Interpolation results
   indicated that the high sampling density allowed capture of the key
   patterns of SWC variation.}},

Abstract = {{Androgens and the androgen receptor are important for both normal
   prostate development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). However,
   the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The Polycombprotein
   enhancer of zeste homolog 2(EZH2) functions as an epigenetic gene
   silencer and plays a role in oncogenesis by promoting cell proliferation
   and invasion. EZH2 has been implicated in human PCa progression, because
   its expression is often elevated in hormone-refractory PCa. Here, we
   demonstrated that expression of EZH2 is lower in androgen-sensitive
   LNCaP PCa cells compared with Rf and C4-2 cells, two androgen-refractory
   sublines that are derived from LNCaP cells. Androgen ablation by
   castration increased the level of EZH2 proteins in LNCaP xenografts in
   mice. In contrast, treatment of LNCaP cells in culture with the
   synthetic androgen methyltrieolone (R1881) at doses of 1 nM or higher
   suppressed EZH2 expression. Moreover, our data suggest that androgen
   repression of EZH2 requires a functional androgen receptor and this
   effect is mediated through the retinoblastoma protein and its related
   protein p130. We further showed that androgen treatment not only
   increases expression of EZH2 target genes DAB2IP and E-cadherin but also
   affects LNCaP cell migration. Our results reveal that androgens function
   as an epigenetic regulator in prostatic cells by repression of EZH2
   expression through the retinoblastoma protein and p130-dependent
   pathways. Our findings also suggest that blockade of EZH2 derepression
   during androgen deprivation therapy may represent an effective tactic
   for the treatment of androgen-refractory PCa. (Endocrinology 151:

Volume = {{19}},

Pages = {{605-634}},

Abstract = {{Recorded remittances to Africa have grown dramatically over the past
   decade. Yet data limitations still mean relatively little is known about
   which migrants remit, how much they remit and how their remitting
   behaviour varies with gender, education, income levels and duration
   abroad. This paper constructs the most comprehensive remittance database
   currently available on immigrants in the OECD, containing microdata on
   more than 12,000 African immigrants. Using this microdata the authors
   establish several basic facts about the remitting patterns of Africans,
   and then explore how key characteristics of policy interest relate to
   remittance behaviour. Africans are found to remit twice as much on
   average as migrants from other developing countries, and those from
   poorer African countries are more likely to remit than those from richer
   African countries. Male migrants remit more than female migrants,
   particularly among those with a spouse remaining in the home country;
   more-educated migrants remit more than less educated migrants; and
   although the amount remitted increases with income earned, the gradient
   is quite flat over a large range of income. Finally, there is little
   evidence that the amount remitted decays with time spent abroad, with
   reductions in the likelihood of remitting offset by increases in the
   amount remitted conditional on remitting.}},

Abstract = {{Parvovirus retentive filters that assure removal of viruses and
   virus-like particles during the production of therapeutic proteins
   significantly contribute to total manufacturing costs. Operational
   approaches that can increase throughput and reduce filtration area would
   result in a significant cost savings. A combination of methods was used
   to achieve high throughputs of an antibody or therapeutic protein
   solution through three parvovirus retentive filters. These methods
   included evaluation of diatomaceous earth or size-based prefilters, the
   addition of additives, and the optimization of protein concentration,
   temperature, buffer composition, and solution pH. An optimum temperature
   of 35 degrees C was found for maximizing throughput through the Virosart
   CPV and Viresolve Pro filters. Mass-throughput values of 7.3, 26.4, and
   76.2 kg/m(2) were achieved through the Asahi Planova 20N, Virosart CPV,
   and Viresolve Pro filters, respectively, in 4 h of processing.
   Mass-throughput values of 73, 137, and 192 kg/m(2) were achieved through
   a Millipore Viresolve Pro filter in 4.0, 8.8, and 22.1 h of processing,
   respectively, during a single experiment. However, large-scale
   parvovirus filtration operations are typically controlled to limit
   volumetric throughput to below the level achieved during small-scale
   virus spiking experiments. The virus spike may cause significant filter
   plugging, limiting throughput. Therefore newer parvovirus filter spiking
   strategies should be adopted that may lead to more representative viral
   clearance data and higher utilization of large-scale filter capacity.

Abstract = {{Despite 10 years of clinical use, linezolid resistance in Staphylococcus
   aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) is still a rare
   phenomenon. This study reports the mechanisms of resistance and strain
   types seen in clusters of linezolid-resistant CoNS from two different
   hospitals in Italy during the period 2008-09.
   Genes associated with linezolid resistance were subjected to molecular
   analysis and isolates were characterized by PFGE macrorestriction
   analysis using SmaI.
   Thirty-three linezolid-resistant isolates of methicillin-resistant CoNS
   comprising Staphylococcus epidermidis (24), Staphylococcus hominis (5)
   and Staphylococcus simulans (4) were studied. The isolates showed
   varying levels of linezolid resistance. Almost all isolates for which
   linezolid MICs were 64 mg/L possessed point mutations in domain V of 23S
   rRNA, while isolates for which the MICs were 256 mg/L expressed
   methylase activity at position A2503 mediated by the cfr gene. Overall,
   the isolates showed reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (MICs 1-2 mg/L)
   and 11 of the 33 isolates showed no susceptibility to teicoplanin. These
   strains were also resistant to chloramphenicol (28 of 33), lincomycin
   (24 of 33), erythromycin (17 of 33) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (13 of
   33). S. epidermidis isolates, showing mutations or methylase
   modifications, belonged to different PFGE profiles and to two different
   sequence types (ST2 and ST23), in which the cfr gene was carried on a
   plasmid of similar to 50 kb.
   Clinical CoNS strains with resistance to linezolid and other second-line
   antibiotics, as well as reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides, have
   emerged in Italy.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of single droplets dispersed in a second, immiscible liquid

   components and varying viscosity ratio on the deformation and

   relative amount of extension in the flow. Overall, a fair agreement was
   found between the model predictions and the experimental results for all

Abstract = {{In Autumn 2009, a faecal egg count reduction test (FERCT) was carried
   out on three sheep farms. Groups of 8-II lambs were treated with
   ivermectin or moxidectin, with a 14-day interval between treatment and
   sampling. Ivermectin resistance was present on all three farms.
   Treatment with ivermectin resulted in a reduction in faecal egg numbers
   of 94.6\%, 63\%, and 59\%. On two farms, 14 days after treatment pooled
   faecal samples yielded predominantly larvae of Hamonchus contortus
   (100\% and 98\%, respectively). On the third farm, H. contortus and
   (probably) Teladorsagia circumcincta were resistant to ivermectin (64\%
   and 36\% of the larvae, respectively). Treatment with moxidectin
   resulted in a 100\% reduction in egg output in sheep on all three farms.
   More sensitive culture techniques failed to detect any larvae in samples
   taken from two farms, but a few Ostertagia-type larvae, probably of T.
   circumcincta, were detected in samples from the third farm. It can be
   concluded that gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep from these three
   farms were resistant to ivermectin, whereas resistance to moxidectin was
   not detected.}},

Abstract = {{Psychiatry can be seen as a natural and cultural science. According to
   this the postulate of freedom is its strong value judgment. Since the
   times of enlightenment it has been described metaphorically by the myth
   of the expulsion from Paradise. Following Max Weber and Wilhelm Dilthey,
   Karl Jaspers has introduced this perspective into psychiatry. His strict
   dichotomy between explaining and understanding has later been critically
   revised by Werner Janzarik and Hans Heimann. Their concepts of structure
   dynamic, of pathography and of anthropology are closer to Max Weber who
   connected natural and cultural sciences in a much stronger way.
   Especially the pathographic example of Nietzsche allows to demonstrate
   the differences between Jaspers and the later psychopathologists of the

Title = {{Mapping Burned Areas in a Mediterranean Environment Using Soft
   Integration of Spectral Indices from High-Resolution Satellite Images}},
Journal = {{EARTH INTERACTIONS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This article presents a new method for burned area mapping using
   high-resolution satellite images in the Mediterranean ecosystem. In such
   a complex environment, high-resolution satellite images represent an
   appropriate data source for identifying fire-affected areas, and single
   postfire data are often the only available source of information. The
   method proposed here integrates several spectral indices into a fuzzy
   synthetic indicator of likelihood of burn. The indices are interpreted
   through fuzzy membership functions that have been derived with a
   partially data-driven approach exploiting training data and expert
   knowledge. The final map of fire-affected areas is produced by applying
   a region growing algorithm on the basis of seed pixels selected on a
   conservative threshold of the synthetic fuzzy score. The algorithm has
   been developed and tested on a set of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal
   Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) scenes acquired over Southern
   Italy. Validation showed that the accuracy of the burned area maps is
   comparable or even better {[}overall accuracy (OA) > 90\%, K > 0.76]
   than that obtained with approaches based on single index thresholds
   adapted to each image. The method described here provides an automatic
   approach for mapping fire-affected areas with very few false alarms (low
   commission error), whereas omission errors are mainly related to
   undetected small burned areas and are located in heterogeneous sparse
   vegetation cover.}},

Title = {{Electron leakage and its suppression via deep-well structures in 4.5-to

Journal = {{OPTICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{The equations for threshold-current density J(th) and external
   differential quantum efficiency eta(d) of quantum cascade lasers (QCLs)
   are modified to include electron leakage and the electron-backfilling
   term corrected to take into account hot electrons in the injector. We
   show that by introducing both deep quantum wells and tall barriers in
   the active regions of 4.8-mu m-emitting QCLs, and by tapering the
   conduction-band edge of both injector and extractor regions, one can
   significantly reduce electron leakage. The characteristic temperatures
   for J(th) and eta(d), denoted by T-0 and T-1, respectively, are found to
   reach values as high as 278 and 285 K over the 20 to 90 degrees C
   temperature range, which means that J(th) and eta(d) display approximate
   to 2.3 slower variation than conventional 4.5- to 5.0-mu m-emitting,
   high-performance QCLs over the same temperature range. A model for the
   thermal excitation of hot injected electrons from the upper laser level
   to the upper active-region energy states, wherefrom some relax to the
   lower active-region states and some are scattered to the upper miniband,
   is used to estimate the leakage current. Estimated T-0 values are in
   good agreement with experiment for both conventional QCLs and deep-well
   QCLs. The T-1 values are justified by increases in both electron leakage
   and waveguide loss with temperature. (C) 2010 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{This investigation studied how the incorporation of a natural
   crosslinking agent, genipin (Gp), into the AlloDerm (R) (AD) rehydration
   protocol affects the biomechanical properties and the stability of the
   collagenous matrix. AD is a minimally processed, noncrosslinked,
   freeze-dried collagen-based graft. Samples were immersed in a saline
   solution for 5 min and then randomly assigned for further rehydration
   (30 min) into three groups, according to the crosslinking agent: control
   (saline), G2-1 wt\% genipin, and G3-1 wt\% glutaraldehyde. Gp
   crosslinking for a prolonged time of 6 h (G4) was also investigated.
   After washing (5 min), samples were mechanically tested wet in tension.
   G2 demonstrated a significantly higher ultimate tensile strength (UTS)
   and E relative to G1. However, G3 did not show a noteworthy increase in
   these properties. A significant enhancement in UTS was found when Gp
   exposure time was increased from 30 min to 6 h. FT-IR revealed a protein
   backbone with no significant peak shifting for all samples due to
   crosslinking. However, a considerable decrease in -NH2 peak intensity
   occurred due to crosslinking reactions. Additionally, DSC analyses
   indicated an important shift in the denaturation temperature for
   crosslinked samples. SEM micrographs revealed no alterations in the
   native fibrous morphology after crosslinking. Simultaneous genipin
   incorporation during the rehydration protocol of AlloDerm significantly
   enhances its biomechanical properties. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract = {{Structures and magnetic properties of (FePt)(n) clusters (with n <= 5)
   have been studied within density functional theory (DFT). Specific
   attention has been paid to the influence of the spinorbit interaction on
   the geometry, binding energy and magnetic moments. It is found that for
   (FePt)(n) clusters, the ground states usually display collinear magnetic
   behavior, although small deviations from the collinear direction are
   noticeable when the spinorbit interaction (SOI) is included. The spin
   magnetic moment and the binding energy increase with the size of the
   cluster, although the spin magnetic moment per (FePt) unit remains
   unaltered. The spin magnetic moment of the Pt atoms slightly increases
   with the cluster size. The orbital and spin magnetic moments of Fe atoms
   increases when Fe is alloyed to Pt atoms, larger than that is obtained
   in pure iron clusters and shrinks with cluster size. For the dimers
   studied, a large magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) is observed for Pt-2,
   Co-2 and CoPt with a large orbital magnetic moment in the ground
   state(easy axis). In other way, we note the dependence of MAE on the
   orbital magnetic anisotropy. In contrast for Fe-2 and FePt, the MAE is
   relatively small. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. The aim of this survey was to study the prevalence of
   tooth decay, to assess oral hygiene control, to analyze the different.
   risk factors for caries in orthodontics, and to determine
   recommendations.
   Patients and methods. We studied 155 patients managed in the unit, for
   three months and 19 days. The main indicators used were: the DMF index;
   Loe and Silness's gingival index, and Silness and Loe's plate index.
   Results. The plate index ranged between 0.08 and 2.4, with a mean of
   1.12 +/- 0.48; the gingival index ranged between 0 and 2, with a mean of
   0.67 +/- 0.43; the DMF index ranged between 0 and 21., with a mean of
   5.77 +/- 4.52.
   Discussion. The orthodontist has a major role to play in the prevention
   of caries before and after treatment. Recommendations and patient
   information should be adapted to risk for dental caries. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The optimization of gearbox geometric design parameters to reduce rattle
   noise in an automotive transmission based on a torsional vibration model
   approach is studied. Rattle noise is calculated and simulated based on
   the design parameters of a 5-speed gearbox, and all pinion gears and
   wheel gears are helical. The effect of the design parameters on rattle
   noise is analyzed. The observed rattle noise profiles are obtained
   depending on the design parameters. During the optimization, a
   four-degree-of-freedom torsional vibration model of the pinion
   gear-wheel gear system is obtained and the minimum singular value of the
   transfer matrix is considered as the objective functions and design
   parameters are optimized under several constraints that include bending
   stress, contact stress and a constant distance between gear centers.
   Therefore, by optimizing the geometric parameters of the gearbox such
   as, the module, number of teeth, axial clearance, and backlash, it is
   possible to obtain a light-weight-gearbox structure and minimize the
   rattling noise. It is concluded that the optimized geometric design
   parameters lower the rattle noise by 10\% compared to the calculated
   rattle noise for sample gearbox. All optimized geometric design
   parameters also satisfy all constraints. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Signaling through the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is a crucial determinant
   of hepatic zonal gene expression, liver development, regeneration, and
   tumorigenesis. Transgenic mice with hepatocyte-specific knockout of
   Ctnnb1 (encoding beta-catenin) have proven their usefulness in
   elucidating these processes. We now found that a small number of
   hepatocytes escape the Cre-mediated gene knockout in that mouse model.
   The remaining beta-catenin-positive hepatocytes showed approximately
   25\% higher cell volumes compared to the beta-catenin-negative cells and
   exhibited a marker protein expression profile similar to that of normal
   perivenous hepatocytes or hepatoma cells with mutationally activated
   beta-catenin. Surprisingly, the expression pattern was observed
   independent of the cell's position within the liver lobule, suggesting a
   malfunction of physiological periportal repression of perivenously
   expressed genes in beta-catenin-deficient liver. Clusters of
   beta-catenin-expressing hepatocytes lacked expression of the gap
   junction proteins Connexin 26 and 32. Nonetheless, beta-catenin-positive
   hepatocytes had no striking proliferative advantage, but started to grow
   out on treatment with phenobarbital, a tumor-promoting agent known to
   facilitate the formation of mouse liver adenoma with activating
   mutations of Ctnnb1. Progressive re-population of Ctnnb1 knockout livers
   with wild-type hepatocytes was seen in aged mice with a pre-cirrhotic
   phenotype. In these large clusters of beta-catenin-expressing
   hepatocytes, perivenous-specific gene expression was re-established. In
   summary, our data demonstrate that the zone-specificity of a
   hepatocyte's gene expression profile is dependent on the presence of
   beta-catenin, and that beta-catenin provides a proliferative advantage
   to hepatocytes when promoted with phenobarbital, or in a pre-cirrhotic
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Bioluminescence and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) are
   two naturally occurring light emission phenomena that have been adapted
   to a wide variety of important research applications including in vivo
   imaging and enzyme assays. The luciferase enzyme from the North American
   firefly, which produces yellow-green light, is a key component of many
   of these applications. Recognizing the heightened interest in the
   potential of near-infrared (nIR) light to improve these technologies, we
   have demonstrated that spectral emissions with maxima of 705 and 783 nm
   can be efficiently produced by a firefly luciferase variant covalently
   labeled with nIR fluorescent dyes. In one case, an outstanding BRET
   ratio of 34.0 was achieved emphasizing the importance of selective
   labeling with fluorescent dyes and the efficiency provided by the
   intramolecular BRET process. Additionally, we constructed a biotinylated
   fusion protein that similarly produced nIR light. This novel material
   was immobilized on solid supports containing streptavidin,
   demonstrating, in principle, that it may be used for receptor-based
   imaging. Also, the matrix-bound labeled fusion protein was used to
   measure factor Xa activity at physiological concentrations in blood. We
   believe this to be the first report of bright nIR light sources produced
   by chemical modification of a beetle luciferase.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of
   chlorhexidine application after dentin phosphoric acid etching at
   immediate and long-term bond strength of a fiber post cemented to root
   dentin.
   Study design. Seventy-two single-rooted, human upper teeth were
   selected. After phosphoric acid etching, each group received a different
   dentin treatment: no pretreatment or chlorhexidine 0.2\% or 2.0\%.
   Three-step etch-and-rinse adhesive and dual-cured resin cement was used
   to cementation procedure. Half of the teeth were submitted to push-out
   bond strength test after 24 hours and the other half after 6 months.
   Data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA and Tukey.
   Results. Chlorhexidine application had no influence on bond strength
   when teeth were stored at the same aging time (P > .05). The storage
   time significantly decreased the bond strength values of 24 hours to 6
   months in all groups (P < .05).
   Conclusion. After 6 months, chlorhexidine application did not
   effectively arrest bond strength degradation of fiber posts cemented in
   human roots. (Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod

Abstract = {{Pathological vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) behavior after vascular
   interventions such as angioplasty or bypass is initiated within the 3D
   environment of the vessel media. Here VSMCs proliferate, invade the
   surrounding matrix, migrate adluminally, and deposit substantial amounts
   of matrix, leading to myointimal hyperplasia and decreased blood flow to
   critical organs and tissue. Since focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mediates
   many of the VSMC responses to these pathologic events, it provides a
   reasonable pharmacologic target to limit this invasive VSMC behavior and
   to better understand the cellular pathophysiology of this disease. Here
   we quantified the effectiveness of disabling FAK in VSMCs with its
   dominant-negative inhibitor, FAK-related nonkinase (FRNK), in a
   clinically relevant 3D assay. We found that FRNK overexpression
   decreased VSMC invasion (both the length and frequency) in this matrix.
   These effects were demonstrated in the presence and absence of chemical
   mitotic inhibition, suggesting that FAK's effect on cellular matrix
   invasion, migration, and proliferation utilize separate and/or redundant
   signaling cascades. Mechanistically, FAK inhibition decreased its
   localization to focal adhesions which led to a significant decrease in
   FAK autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation of the serine/threonine
   kinase, AKT. Together these findings suggest that disruption of FAK
   signaling may provide a pharmaceutical tool that limits pathological
   VSMC cell behavior. J. Cell. Physiol. 225: 562-568, 2010. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Study Objective: To investigate the feasibility of safely implementing a
   total laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) in established gynecologists'
   practices with on-site coaching and monitoring of the learning curve by
   an experienced visiting surgeon.
   Design: Multicenter prospective feasibility and implementation study
   (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).
   Setting: Eleven general gynecologists in 8 hospitals (1 university
   hospital and 7 regional hospitals) participated.
   Patients: Laparoscopic hysterectomy was performed in 83 patients during
   the learning curve, and in 83 patients after the learning curve.
   Interventions: During the learning curve, an experienced visiting
   laparoscopist was available for coaching during each LH. A competence
   score was marked on an Objective Structured Assessment of Technical
   Skills (OSATS) form. Complications were recorded intraoperatively and
   postoperatively for 6 weeks after surgery in all patients.
   Measurements and Main Results: Nine of 11 gynecologists reached the
   competence score of at least 28 points during the study, from January
   2005 to January 2007. A major complication occurred in 3 of 83 LH
   procedures (4\%) performed during the learning curve, and in 5 of 83 LH
   procedures (6\%) performed after the learning curve (p = .72).
   Conclusion: The concept of a visiting surgeon for on-site coaching and
   monitoring of established gynecologists during the learning curve of an
   advanced laparoscopic procedure using Objectively Structured Assessment
   of Technical Skills is feasible. According to the observed complication
   rate during and after the learning curve, on-site coaching is a useful
   tool when implementing a new laparoscopic technique in established
   gynecologists' practices. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology

Abstract = {{We present a new code for solving the molecular and atomic excitation
   and radiation transfer problem in a molecular gas and predicting
   emergent spectra. This code works in arbitrary three dimensional
   geometry using unstructured Delaunay latices for the transport of
   photons. Various physical models can be used as input, ranging from
   analytical descriptions over tabulated models to SPH simulations. To
   generate the Delaunay grid we sample the input model randomly, but weigh
   the sample probability with the molecular density and other parameters,
   and thereby we obtain an average grid point separation that scales with
   the local opacity. Our code does photon very efficiently so that the
   slow convergence of opaque models becomes traceable. When convergence
   between the level populations, the radiation field, and the point
   separation has been obtained, the grid is ray-traced to produced images
   that can readily be compared to observations. Because of the high
   dynamic range in scales that can be resolved using this type of grid,
   our code is particularly well suited for modeling of ALMA data. Our code
   can furthermore deal with overlapping lines of multiple molecular and
   atomic species.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic detectors are powerful tools for the study of bat ecology.
   Many options are available for deploying acoustic detectors including
   various weatherproofing designs and microphone orientations, but the
   impacts of these options on the quantity and quality of the bat calls

   microphone orientations (horizontal, 45 degrees, and vertical) and two
   weatherproofing designs (polyvinyl chloride tubes and the BatHat) on the
   number of calls detected, call quality, and species detected by the
   Anabat II bat detector system at 17 sites in central Kentucky in May and
   June 2008. Detectors with BatHat weatherproofing recorded significantly
   fewer call sequences, pulses per file, species per site, and lower
   quality calls. Detectors in the horizontal position also tended to
   record fewer files, fewer species, and lower quality calls. These
   results illustrate potential impacts of deployment method on quality and
   quantity of data obtained. Because weatherproofing and orientation
   impacted the quality and quantity of data recorded, comparison of
   results using different methodologies should be made with caution.}},

Abstract = {{Fast and reliable epidemiological typing methods for identifying
   outbreaks and epidemic strains of extended spectrum p-lactamase (ESBL)
   producing Enterobacteriaceae are urgently needed. The DiversiLab system
   (DL) has been proposed for these purposes. We compared DL to
   pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) on a national collection of
   ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (n = 258; of which 226 isolates were
   typeable with PFGE) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 48) isolated in 2007.
   For E. coli the Wallace coefficients showed that the probability of two
   isolates of the same DL type having the same PFGE type was only 19.8\%
   and the probability of two isolates of the same PFGE type having the
   same DL type was 90.4\%. For K. pneumoniae the Wallace coefficients
   showed that the probability of two isolates of the same DL type having
   the same PFGE type was 100\% and the probability of two isolates of the
   same PFGE type having the same DL type was 79\%, indicating that for
   this K. pneumoniae strain collection DL was slightly more
   discriminatory. Only four of 48 isolates had discordant results with the
   two methods. In E. coli 42\% of the isolates were sequence type 131 and
   these isolates were related at >95\% similarity with DL and at >= 60\%
   similarity with PFGE. In summary, for E. coli DL performed well in
   identifying isolates related by PFGE, but overestimated the genetic
   relatedness in the studied collection. This indicates that DL could be a
   primary screening method for excluding unrelated isolates. Isolates
   shown to be related must be confirmed with a more discriminatory method.
   For K. pneumoniae, DL discriminated well but overestimated the diversity
   of the isolates compared to PFGE, assuming a risk of missing possible
   genetic relatedness. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The adenocarcinoma of the lung has recently shown peculiar molecular
   characteristics, which relate with both carcinogenesis and response to
   targeted drugs. Several molecular alterations have been defined as
   ``driver mutations{''}. These are responsible for both the initiation
   and maintenance of the malignancy. The epidermal growth factor receptor
   (EGFR) pathway is the main regulator of cell function and cancer
   development. It has a widely defined role in the occurrence of driver
   mutations. Up till now EGFR gene mutations, KRAS gene mutations and
   EML4-ALK fusion genes are the most widely recognized alterations
   involved in both the biology and the clinical management of lung
   adenocarcinoma. In this review we report the molecular bases that have
   led to the clinical application of the detection for such genetic
   impairments. Subsequently we discuss the clinical studies regarding the
   prognostic role and the predictive value for response to anti-EGFR
   tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) of the same mutations. We also provide
   a potential algorithm as a guide in the choice of the best treatment for
   patients with adenocarcinoma. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Can an `Extreme Female Brain' be characterised in terms of psychosis?}},

Abstract = {{The empathising-systemising (E-S) theory proposes that many sex
   differences can be explained by females typically demonstrating greater
   empathising abilities (understanding of the social world) and males
   typically demonstrating greater systemising abilities (understanding of
   the non-social world). Autism is argued to represent an `Extreme Male
   Brain', with impaired empathising alongside preserved or enhanced
   systemising producing a hypo-empathising profile. A recent account
   hypothesised that a hyper-empathising `Extreme Female Brain' would be
   characterised in terms of psychosis. The present study tests this
   hypothesis by investigating the relationship between levels of
   empathising and systemising, as well as self-report measures of
   psychosis, depression and anxiety, in 70 healthy female undergraduates.
   Results showed a hyper-empathising profile was related to psychosis, and
   specifically Paranoia and mania (positive symptoms). No relationship was
   found between hyper-empathising and either depression or anxiety,
   consistent with the idea that an `Extreme Female Brain' is specifically
   associated with psychosis. In addition, empathising and systemising were
   found to negatively correlate with each other, suggesting they are
   separate but related components. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We have investigated two thick film copper compositions used in
   thermoelectric device fabrication. Dynamic mechanical analysis, thermal
   mechanical analysis, tensile testing, Vickers microhardness, optical
   microscopy and scratch testing were performed. The small grain samples
   have much smaller microindentation areas and much higher hardness than
   large grain samples, a consequence of intergranular spaces and thus low
   cohesion in large grain materials. The small grain material without
   intergranular spaces has higher linear thermal expansivity alpha(L) up
   to 150 degrees C; above that temperature negative alpha(L) is seen, a
   consequence of orientation relaxation. The large grain material also
   exhibits alpha(L) < 0 but only above 275 degrees C or so, a consequence
   of sintering. The small grain material has a storage modulus 49\% higher
   than the large grain material over a wide temperature range, again an
   effect of high cohesion in the former. The brittleness value for the
   large grain material is 3.5 times larger than for the small grains
   material. Both kinds of materials exhibit recovery in scratch testing in
   the overall range of 23-36\%-a manifestation of viscoelasticity. (C)

Abstract = {{The role of soy in reducing breast cancer risk has been suggested to be
   associated with early exposure to isoflavones, which alter mammary gland
   morphology. The objective of the study was to determine the effect of
   dietary exposure to the enantiomers of a key soy isoflavone metabolite,
   equol, on mammary gland development and later chemoprotection using the
   DMBA-induced animal model of breast cancer. Animals were exposed to
   S-(-)equol or R-(+)equol (250 mg/kg diet) during the neonatal (0-21
   days) or prepubertal (21-35 days) periods only. Histological evaluation
   of the mammary glands showed that both enantiomers fed neonatally via
   the dam led to significant precocial mammary gland differentiation. By
   day 50, early S-(-)equol or R-(+)equol exposure resulted in a decrease
   in immature terminal end structures and an increase in mature lobules,
   suggesting an early `imprinting' effect. Despite these morphological
   changes to the mammary gland, neonatal and prepubertal exposure to equol
   had no long-term chemoprevention against mammary tumors induced by DMBA.
   although for R-(+)equol there was a trend to delaying tumor formation.
   In summary, early exposure to equol was not chemopreventive, but neither
   did it increase tumor formation in response to DMBA, suggesting exposure
   in early life does not influence breast cancer risk. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Tetrachlorinated butadienes (TetraCBDs), pentachlorinated butadienes
   (PentaCBDs) and hexachlorobutadiene (HexaCBD) were detected in
   groundwater wells of drinking water supplier near Basel up to maximally
   157 ng/L (sum value), 15 ng/L (sum value), and <50 ng/L, in 2006.
   HexaCBD is toxicologically well characterized and the WHO has derived a
   TDI of 0.2 mu g/kg body weight (bw)/day and a drinking-water guideline
   value of 600 ng/L. However, due to insufficient toxicity data, neither
   health-based guideline values nor maximum contaminant levels have been
   established for the TetraCBDs and PentaCBDs yet. Since TetraCBDs and
   PentaCBDs show structural alerts for potential genotoxicity, the
   genotoxicity of TetraCBDs and PentaCBDs was examined in vitro. All the
   TetraCBDs and PentaCBDs as well as HexaCBD were clastogenic in the
   chromosome aberration test. In addition, 1,1,3,4-TetraCBD and
   1,2,3,4-TetraCBD were positive in the Ames test while the other
   polychlorinated butadienes including HexaCBD were negative. Using the
   threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) concept, the target value for
   TetraCBDs and PentaCBDs in drinking water was set at 75 ng/L (sum value
   of both substance groups). For the main component 1,1,4,4-TetraCBD,
   which is negative in the Ames, it is recommended to perform a third in
   vitro genotoxicity test, the HPRT test, before it can be decided whether
   to refer to the guideline value of HexaCBD at 600 ng/L or still to use
   the conservative TTC-based target value of 75 ng/L. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Title = {{Evaluating oxygen fluxes using microprofiles from both sides of the
   sediment-water interface}},
Journal = {{LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{610-627}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Sediment-water fluxes are influenced by both hydrodynamics and sediment
   biogeochemical processes. However, fluxes at the sediment-water
   interface (SWI) are almost always analyzed from either a water-or
   sediment-side perspective. This study expands on previous work by
   comparing water-side (hydrodynamics and resulting diffusive boundary
   layer thickness, delta(DBL)) and sediment-side (oxygen consumption and
   resulting sediment oxic zone) approaches for evaluating diffusive
   sediment oxygen uptake rate (J(O2)) and delta DBL from microprofiles.
   Dissolved oxygen microprofile and current velocity data were analyzed
   using five common methods to estimate J(O2) and delta(DBL) and to assess
   the robustness of the approaches. Comparable values for J(O2) and
   delta(DBL) were obtained (agreement within 20\%), and turbulence-induced
   variations in these parameters were uniformly characterized with the
   five methods. J(O2) estimates based on water-side data were consistently
   higher (+1.8 mmol m(-2) d(-1) or 25\% on average) and delta(DBL)
   estimates correspondingly lower (-0.4 mm or 35\% on average) than those
   obtained using sediment-side data. This deviation may be attributed to
   definition of the sediment-water interface location, artifacts of the
   methods themselves, assumptions made on sediment properties, and/or
   variability in sediment oxygen-uptake processes. Our work emphasizes
   that sediment-side microprofile data may more accurately describe oxygen
   uptake at a particular location, whereas water-side data are
   representative of oxygen uptake over a broader sediment area.
   Regardless, our overall results show clearly that estimates of J(O2) and
   delta(DBL) are not strongly dependent on the method chosen for analysis.}},

Title = {{Control of Tungiasis through Intermittent Application of a Plant-Based
   Repellent: An Intervention Study in a Resource-Poor Community in Brazil}},
Journal = {{PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Background: Tungiasis, an ectoparasitosis caused by the female sand flea
   Tunga penetrans, is an important health problem in many impoverished
   communities in the tropics. Sand flea disease is associated with a broad
   spectrum of clinical pathology and severe sequels are frequent.
   Treatment options are limited.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We assessed the effectiveness of the
   intermittent application of the plant-based repellent Zanzarin to reduce
   infestation intensity and tungiasis-associated morbidity in a
   resource-poor community in Brazil, characterized by a very high attack
   rate. The study population was randomized into three cohorts. Initially,
   during a period of four weeks, the repellent was applied twice daily to
   the feet of all cohort members. This reduced the number of embedded
   sandfleas to 0 in 98\% of the participants. Thereafter members of cohort
   A applied the repellent every second week twice daily for one week,
   members of cohort B every fourth week for one week, and members of
   cohort C served as controls. Infestation intensity and
   tungiasis-associated morbidity were monitored during five months. The
   intermittent application of Zanzarin for one week every second week
   significantly reduced infestation intensity from a median 4 lesions (IQR
   1-9) during the whole transmission season. In contrast, in cohort B
   (application of the repellent every fourth week) the infestation
   intensity remained twice as high (median 8 lesions, IQR 9-16; p=0.0035),
   and in the control cohort C 3.5 times as high (median 14 lesions; IQR
   7-26; p=0.004 during the transmission season). Tungiasis-related acute
   pathology remained very low in cohort A (median severity score 2; IQR
   1-4) as compared to cohort B (median severity score 5; IQR 3-7;
   p<0.001), and control cohort C (median severity score 6.5; IQR 4-8;
   p<0.001).
   Conclusions/Significance: Our study shows that in a setting with intense
   transmission, tungiasis-associated morbidity can be minimized through
   the intermittent application of a plant-based repellent.}},

Title = {{Measurement of Thoracic Bone Mineral Density with Quantitative CT}},
Journal = {{RADIOLOGY}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To create standard thoracic bone mineral density (BMD) values
   for patients undergoing cardiac computed tomography (CT) by using
   thoracic quantitative CT and to compare these BMDs (in a subpopulation)
   with those obtained by using lumbar spine quantitative CT.
   Materials and Methods: The institutional review board approved this
   HIPAA-compliant study. A total of 9585 asymptomatic subjects (mean age,
   56 years; age range, 30-90 years) who underwent coronary artery calcium
   scanning, including 4131 women, were examined. Patients with vertebral
   deformities or fractures were excluded. Six hundred forty-four subjects
   (322 of whom were female) also underwent lumbar quantitative CT. The
   mean thoracic vertebral BMDs for both sexes were reported separately in
   a subgroup of subjects aged 30 years and in 29 age-based subgroups in
   2-year intervals from ages 30 to 90 years. The formulas used to
   calculate the female T score (T-f) and the male T score (T-m) on the
   basis of thoracic quantitative CT measurements were as follows: T-f =
   (BMDim 2 222)/36, and T-m = (BMDim 2 215)/33, where BMDim is the
   individual mean BMD. Comparisons between thoracic quantitative CT and
   lumbar quantitative CT measurements, as well as analyses of
   intraobserver, interobserver, and interscan variability, were performed.
   Results: The young-subgroup mean BMD was 221.9 mg/mL +/- 36.2 (standard
   deviation) for the female subjects and 215.2 mg/mL +/- 33.2 for the male
   subjects. The mean thoracic BMDs for the female and male subjects were
   found to be 20.7\% higher and 17.0\% higher, respectively, than the
   values measured with lumbar quantitative CT (P < .001 for both
   comparisons). A significant positive association between the thoracic
   and lumbar quantitative CT measurements (r. > 0.85, P < .001) was found.
   Intraobserver, interobserver, and interscan variabilities in thoracic
   quantitative CT measurements were 2.5\%, 2.6\%, and 2.8\%, respectively.
   Conclusion: There was a significant association between the mean
   thoracic and lumbar BMDs. Therefore, standard derived measurements
   (young-subgroup BMD 6 standard deviation) based on these data can be
   used with thoracic CT images to estimate the bone mineral status. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper examines the probability of currency crises using a signal

   indices, and gross domestic product (GDP), in that order. Excess money
   balances and the ratio of domestic credit to GDP are significant and
   have positive correlation with the probability of a crisis. The growth
   rate of exports and the stock indices are significant and have a
   negative relationship with a crisis probability. Overall, the results
   indicate that government policies, the macroeconomic environment, and

Abstract = {{A three-wave longitudinal study conducted with preadolescent boys and
   girls (N=231 at Time 1 {[}T1]) was used to assess the hypotheses that
   aspects of social withdrawal would be predictors of a ``snowball{''}
   cascade of depressed affect, and that friendship experiences would
   moderate these effects. Consistent with these hypotheses, multilevel
   modeling showed that measures of avoidance and exclusion at T1 were
   associated with concurrent levels of depressed affect and were
   antecedent to escalating trajectories of depressed affect over time.
   These accelerating growth curves fit a snowball cascade model. The
   analyses also showed the protective effects of friendship. Specifically,
   the snowball effect was limited to avoidant and excluded children who
   were friendless. Depressed affect did not increase among avoidant and
   excluded children who were friended.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a Markov chain \{Xn\}(n=0)(infinity) on R(d) defined by the
   stochastic recursion X(n) = M(n)X(n-1) + Q(n) , where (Q(n) , M(n) ) are
   i.i.d. random variables taking values in the affine group A(R(d)) = R(d)
   x GL(R(d)). Assume that M(n) takes values in the group of similarities
   of R(d), and the Markov chain has a unique stationary measure nu, which
   has unbounded support. We denote by vertical bar M(n)vertical bar the
   expansion coefficient of M(n) and we assume E{[}vertical bar M vertical
   bar(alpha)] = 1 for some positive alpha. We show that the partial sums
   Sn = Sigma(n)(k=0) X(k), properly normalized, converge to a normal law
   (alpha >= 2) or to an infinitely divisible law, which is stable in a
   natural sense (alpha < 2). These laws are fully nondegenerate, if nu is
   not supported on an affine hyperplane. Under an aperiodicity hypothesis,
   we prove also a local limit theorem for the sums S (n) . If alpha <=
   sign 2, proofs are based on the homogeneity at infinity of nu and on a
   detailed spectral analysis of a family of Fourier operators P (v)
   considered as perturbations of the transition operator P of the chain
   \{X (n) \}. The characteristic function of the limit law has a simple
   expression in terms of moments of nu (alpha > 2) or of the tails of nu
   and of stationary measure for an associated Markov operator (alpha <=
   sign 2). We extend the results to the situation where M (n) is a random
   generalized similarity.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of total reduced sulphur (TRS) compounds, emitted from
   faeces, may be an indicator of hygiene in slaughterhouses. The aim of
   this study was to measure the concentrations of TRS compounds in the air
   at various locations and times in pig and cattle slaughterhouses. The
   data was then reviewed to see if there was any pattern associated with
   location in the slaughterhouses or any changes associated with
   activities or events. TRS concentration was lowest in chillers that are
   away from the slaughter area. Gut bursts generally led to increases in
   TRS but the level of increase was variable. In one slaughterhouse,
   ventilation fans were used during part of the day and this corresponded
   with falls in the TRS concentration. These variations in TRS
   concentration negate its use as a reliable indicator of slaughterhouse
   hygiene. (C) 2010 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Professional antigen-presenting cells secrete major histocompatibility
   complex class II (MHC II) carrying exosomes with unclear physiological
   function(s). Exosomes are first generated as the intraluminal vesicles
   (ILVs) of a specific type of multivesicular body, and are then secreted
   by fusion of this compartment with the plasma membrane. We have
   previously shown that in contrast to the sorting of MHC II at
   lysosomally targeted multivesicular bodies, sorting of MHC II into
   exosomes does not rely on MHC II ubiquitination. In search for proteins
   that drive the incorporation of MHC II into exosomes or functionally
   discriminate exosomal from plasma membrane MHC II, we first analyzed the
   total proteome of highly purified B cell-derived exosomes using
   sensitive and accurate mass spectrometry (MS), and identified 539
   proteins, including known and not previously identified constituents.
   Using quantitative MS, we then identified a small subset of proteins
   that were specifically co-immunoprecipitated with MHC II from
   detergent-solubilized exosomes. These include HSC71, HSP90, 14-3-3
   epsilon, CD20 and pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2), and we speculate on
   the functionality of their interaction with exosomal MHC II. Immunology

Abstract = {{Context: The typically indolent behavior of pituitary tumors is
   juxtaposed with high rates of tumor cell invasion into adjacent dural
   structures, and occasional aggressive behavior. Although clinically
   significant invasion and malignant transformation remain uncommon, there
   are limited treatment options available for the management of these
   aggressive tumors. Recently, case reports have described efficacy of
   temozolomide for the treatment of aggressive pituitary tumors.
   Design: Seven patients with aggressive pituitary tumors have been
   treated with temozolomide. We compared O-6-methylguanine
   methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation and MGMT expression in 14
   surgical specimens from these seven patients and correlated these
   molecular features with the clinical response to temozolomide.
   Results: Significant tumor regression was seen in two patients (29\%), a
   20\% reduction in tumor volume with subsequent stable tumor size was
   noted in one patient, arrest of tumor growth occurred in three patients,
   and progressive metastatic disease developed during treatment in one
   patient. The DNA promoter site for MGMT was unmethylated in all 14
   adequate specimens, and variable MGMT expression was seen in all 14
   cases. There was no correlation between MGMT expression and clinical
   outcomes.
   Conclusions: We conclude that medical therapy with temozolomide can be
   helpful in the management of life-threatening pituitary tumors that have
   failed to respond to conventional treatments. The optimal duration of
   treatment in patients with stabilization or reduction of tumor size has
   not been established, and long-term follow up studies are needed. (J

Abstract = {{Dopamine (DA), the most abundant catecholamine in the basal ganglia,
   participates in the regulation of motor functions and of cognitive
   processes such as learning and memory. Abnormalities in dopaminergic
   systems are thought to be the bases for some neuropsychiatric disorders
   including addiction, Parkinson's disease, and Schizophrenia. DA exerts
   its arrays of functions via stimulation of D1-like (D1 and D5) and
   D2-like (D2, D3, and D4) DA receptors which are located in various
   regions of the brain. The DA D1 and D2 receptors are very abundant in
   the basal ganglia where they exert their functions within separate
   neuronal cell types. The present paper focuses on a review of the
   effects of stimulation of DA D1 receptors on diverse signal transduction
   pathways and gene expression patterns in the brain. We also discuss the
   possible involvement of the DA D1 receptors in DA-mediated toxic effects
   observed both in vitro and in vivo. Future studies using more selective
   agonist and antagonist agents and the use of genetically modified
   animals should help to further clarify the role of these receptors in
   the normal physiology and in pathological events that involve DA.}},

Abstract = {{Fifteen zircons separated from a mafic dyke in the Chinese Altai give a
   concordant age population with a weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 age of 375.5
   +/- 4.8 Ma, suggesting a Devonian emplacement. On the basis of their
   mineralogical compositions and textures, the coeval dykes can be divided
   into gabbroic and doleritic types. They are both sub-alkaline,
   tholeiitic, characterized by similarly low SiO2 contents (45.2-52.7
   wt.\%) and total alkaline (K2O + Na2O = 0.99-4.93 wt.\%). Rare earth
   element patterns of the gabbroic dykes are similar to N-MORB (La/Yb-N =
   0.86-1.1), together with their high epsilon(Nd)(t) values (+7.6 to
   +8.1), indicating that their precursor magma was mainly derived from a
   N-MORB-type depleted asthenospheric mantle. While the REE patterns of
   the doleritic dykes resemble that of E-MORB (La/Yb-N = 1.12-2.28),
   enriched in LILEs and strongly depleted in HFSEs, with relative low
   epsilon(Nd)(t) values (+3.4 to +5.4) and high initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios
   (0.7057-0.7060). The zircon Hf isotopic analysis of the doleritic dykes
   give epsilon(Hf)(t) values from +10.7 to +13.8. These signatures suggest
   that a depleted mantle wedge metasomatized by slab-derived fluids and/or
   melts was possibly involved in the generation of the doleritic magma.
   The refractory peridotite may have been melted with variable degrees
   caused by upwelling of the hot asthenosphere. The petrogenesis of the
   mafic dykes suggest a high heat flux as a result of upwelling of the hot
   asthenosphere and the contrast geochemical signatures can be interpreted
   by a ridge subduction, which could be an important tectonic control in
   the accretionary process of the Chinese Altai. (C) 2010 International

Abstract = {{We investigate the dynamics of a pair of coincident D5 branes in the
   background of k NS5 branes. It has been proposed by Kutasov that the
   system with a single probing D-brane moving radially in this background
   is dual to the tachyonic DBI action for a non-BPS Dp brane. We extend
   this proposal to the non-abelian case and find that the duality still
   holds provided one promotes the radial direction to a matrix valued
   field associated with a non-abelian geometric tachyon and a particular
   parametrization for the transverse scalar fields is chosen. The
   equations of motion of a pair of coincident D5 branes moving in the NS5
   background are determined. Analytic and numerical solutions for the pair
   are found in certain simplified cases in which the U(2) symmetry is
   broken to U(1) x U(1) corresponding to a small transverse separation of
   the pair. For certain range of parameters these solutions describe
   periodic motion of the centre of mass of the pair `bouncing off' a
   finite sized throat whose minimum size is limited by the D5 branes
   separation.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to compare and contrast the
   effects of developmental hypoxia vs undernutrition on fetal growth,
   cardiovascular morphology, and function.
   STUDY DESIGN: On day 15 of gestation, Wistar dams were divided into
   control, hypoxic (10\% O-2), or undernourished (35\% reduction in food
   intake) pregnancy. On day 20, fetal thoraces were fixed, and the fetal
   heart and aorta underwent quantitative histological analysis. In a
   separate group, fetal aortic vascular reactivity was determined via wire
   myography.
   RESULTS: Both hypoxic and undernourished pregnancy was associated with
   asymmetric fetal growth restriction. Pregnancy complicated by hypoxia
   promoted fetal aortic thickening without changes in cardiac volumes when
   expressed as a percentage of total heart volume. In contrast, maternal
   undernutrition affected fetal cardiac morphology without changes in
   aortic structure. Fetal aortic vascular reactivity was also
   differentially affected by hypoxia or undernutrition.
   CONCLUSION: Developmental hypoxia or undernutrition in late gestation
   has differential effects on fetal cardiovascular morphology and
   function.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic techniques are increasingly employed in the field of
   conservation biology; our understanding of sea turtle biology, and
   particularly of sea turtle migrations and population structures, has
   increased through genetic analyses that `match' turtles found in various
   and often widely distributed habitats (e.g. nesting beaches, foraging
   grounds, migratory corridors). This relatively recent technological
   development has implications for how sea turtles are conceived, both as
   resources and as objects of conservation. Traditionally, sea turtle
   populations have been identified with nesting beaches, and most
   conservation efforts have been focused on these discrete geographic
   locations and undertaken by the state. The more complete understanding
   of relationships among turtles found in geographically disparate areas,
   achieved via genetic analysis, can take conservation beyond the beaches
   and territorial waters of individual states; foraging populations can
   now be linked to nesting populations sometimes hundreds of kilometers
   distant. In this paper, we explore the implications of genetic analysis
   for sea turtle conservation, the scale at which it is undertaken, and
   the variety of actors with competing interests in it. We focus on the
   case of hawksbill sea turtles in the Caribbean, where genetic data are
   invoked in conservation conflicts. We are particularly interested in the
   way genetic data can support the scaling-up of sea turtle conservation,
   creating new `conservation territories,' and we draw on political
   ecology and common pool resource theory to explore the implications
   thereof. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: This study describes the epidemiological aspects of TB
   among Brazilian Native Indians aged less than 15 years-old in Mato
   Grosso do Sul, Brazil, between 2000 and 2006. Methods: A retrospective
   observational study based on secondary data collected from the health
   system of Brazilian indigenous peoples, Special Indigenous Sanitary
   District (DSEI), and National System of Notifiable Diseases (SINAN)
   databases. The variables analyzed were: frequency of TB according to
   sex, age, clinical presentation and outcome. The Fisher test and the
   incidence tendency curve were calculated (p<0.01). Results: TB
   prevalence was 20.4\% (224/1,096). The incidence rate decreased 14\% per
   year during the study period. TB was more prevalent among Brazilian
   indigenous individuals aged less than 5 years-old and among those aged
   less than one year-old. More than half of TB cases were male and the
   most common clinical presentation was pulmonary TB (92.9\%). Cure was
   the most common outcome (91.1\%), followed by abandoned treatment
   (3.6\%) and death (2.2\%). Conclusions: The high cure rate, reduced
   mortality and the progressive decrease in TB incidence rate during the
   study period indicate the effectiveness of supervised treatment of the
   new TB control model implemented among Brazilian indigenous peoples on
   2000.}},

Abstract = {{A target-oriented algorithm is developed for the prediction of multiples
   recorded on ocean-bottom cables by utilizing apparent slowness relations
   in common-source and common-receiver gathers. It is based on combining
   offsets and times of direct waves and primary reflections to predict
   multiples by matching apparent slownesses at all source and receiver
   locations; all higher-order multiples can be predicted by matching
   apparent slownesses alternately in common-source and common-receiver
   gathers. No knowledge of the subsurface velocity is required.
   Traveltimes of the direct waves and primary reflections need to be
   picked from common-source gathers. The subtraction of multiples involves
   flattening the predicted times of the multiple events, subtracting a
   local spatial average trace from each trace, within a fixed time window
   containing the wavelet of the multiple, and then shifting the data back
   to its original times. Tests of synthetic and field data indicate that
   the proposed method predicts multiples very well and removes them from
   seismic data efficiently with negligible affect on the primary
   reflections, as long as the primary and multiple reflections do not
   overlap in time and slowness over substantial windows in the domain in
   which the removal is done.}},

Abstract = {{Glass fiber polymer composites embedded with tetra-needle-like zinc
   oxide (ZnO) nanowhiskers were prepared. The prepared composites
   exhibited excellent mechanical properties after the effective dispersion
   of ZnO nanowhiskers in the resin. The static and dynamic compressive
   properties of the composites were tested in the thickness and in-plane
   directions. The macro- and microfracture morphologies of the damaged
   specimens were obtained by using a scanning electron microscope. The
   results show that the compressive properties of the composites could be
   significantly affected by strain rates. As the strain rate increases,
   the composites have a higher strength. The compressive properties of the
   composites are affected by the content of ZnO nanowhiskers in the resin.
   The high strength of the composites can be attributed to the
   three-dimensional structures of ZnO nanowhiskers and the corresponding
   stress transfer. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Age-constrained and high-resolution pollen records from 12,000 cal. BP
   to the late Holocene from Wangjiadian, a site close to the Yinxu and
   Huanbei archaeological sites, are presented and compared with
   archaeological data to reconstruct climate change and human impact
   during the Holocene in the Anyang region, central China. The pollen data
   demonstrate that the Younger Dryas event occurred between 11,500 and
   10,000 cal. BP, and that the time between 8200 and 3400 cal. BP was a
   period of warm temperature and high precipitation (the Megathermal
   period). The pollen records also reflect human impact in this region
   since 3400 cal. BP. A sharp decrease in Pinus pollen percentages, as
   well as sharp increases in pollen abundance of Ulmus, ruderal species
   (including planted Poaceae) and Selaginella sinensis, suggest forest
   clearance and selective felling associated with agriculture. Human
   impacts are also associated with changes in sedimentation, as the
   palaeo-soil ground surface was covered by yellow-brown sandy silt at
   this time. This might reflect anthropogenic soil erosion in Anyang. (C)

Abstract = {{Bacterial sRNAs are an emerging class of small regulatory RNAs, 40-500

   database-sRNATarBase. The database holds 138 sRNA-target interactions
   and 252 noninteraction entries, which were manually collected from
   peer-reviewed papers. The detailed information for each entry, such as
   supporting experimental protocols, BLAST-based phylogenetic analysis of
   sRNA-mRNA target interaction in closely related bacteria, predicted
   secondary structures for both sRNAs and their targets, and available
   binding regions, is provided as accurately as possible. This database
   also provides hyperlinks to other databases including GenBank,

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel strategy for predicting the performance of
   open vertical refrigerated display cabinets which is based on a modified
   two-fluid (MTF) model and an adaptive support vector machine (ASVM)
   algorithm. A MTF model (physical model) was built for open vertical
   refrigerated display cabinets, and then an ASVM algorithm (machine
   learning algorithm) was built. To verify the quantity of air leakage
   from the cabinet during operation, an important performance factor of
   display cabinets, an MTF model was built. After the training and
   validation data sets were constructed from the output of the MTF model,
   the problem was solved using an ASVM algorithm. The defrosting water
   quantity and total energy consumption / total display area (TEC/TDA),
   achieved from the experiments by using the predicted combination of the
   controlled parameters, were found to be reduced by 39.2\% and 19.3\%,
   respectively, from the experimental results of the original display
   cabinet. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Enrollment in Computing Science university programs is at a dangerously
   low level. A major reason for this is the general lack of interest in
   Computing Science by females. In this paper, we discuss our experience
   with using a computer game construction environment as a vehicle to
   encourage female participation in Computing Science. Experiments with
   game construction in grade 10 English classes showed that females
   enjoyed this activity as much as males and were just as successful. In
   this paper, we argue that: a) computer game construction is a viable
   activity for teaching higher-order thinking skills that are essential
   for Science; b) computer game construction that involves scripting
   teaches valuable Computing Science abstraction skills: c) this activity
   is an enjoyable introduction to Computing Science; and d) outcome
   measures for this activity are not male-dominated in any of the three
   aspects (higher-order thinking, Computing Science abstraction skills,
   activity enjoyment). Therefore, we claim that this approach is a viable
   gender-neutral approach to teaching Computing Science in particular and
   Science in general that may increase female participation in the

Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN GASTROENTEROLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{583-590}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   The intestinal epithelium serves as a highly dynamic immunologic
   frontier - exhibiting both innate and adaptive immune features. This
   review focuses on recent advances and novel insights into key intrinsic
   processes of the intestinal epithelium to closely monitor its
   intracellular and extracellular environment, communicate messages to
   neighbouring cells and rapidly initiate active defensive and repair
   measures, if necessary.
   Recent findings
   The intestinal epithelium is uniquely equipped with a vast array of
   features to control immune barrier homeostasis at the gates of the
   healthy intestinal mucosa. Deficient Toll-like receptor or NOD-like
   receptor signalling in the intestinal epithelium may imbalance
   commensal-dependent homeostasis, facilitating mucosal injury and leading
   to inflammatory disease. Dysfunction of the NLRP3 inflammasome may
   trigger aggravation of mucosal inflammation and cancer and has been
   associated with human inflammatory bowel diseases. Deregulated autophagy
   may alter inflammasome activity.
   Summary
   Exciting progress has been made in better understanding the complex
   diversity of physiological functions of innate immune responses in the
   intestinal epithelial barrier. Regulatory platforms of signalling
   mechanisms exist which are closely related and interact. However, many
   questions remain to be answered and more puzzles have arisen which are
   highlighted here.}},

   Essential Newborn Care (ENC) course (universal precautions and
   cleanliness, routine neonatal care, resuscitation, thermoregulation,
   breastfeeding, kangaroo care, care of small infants, and common
   illnesses), and in the American Academy of Pediatrics Neonatal
   Resuscitation Program (in-depth basic resuscitation). Data were
   collected during 3 periods, after implementation of each training
   course.
   RESULTS: A total of 71 689 neonates were enrolled in the 3 study
   periods. All-cause, 7-day neonatal mortality rates decreased from 11.5
   deaths per 1000 live births to 6.8 deaths per 1000 live births after ENC
   training (relative risk: 0.59 {[}95\% confidence interval: 0.48-0.77]; P
   < .001), because of decreases in rates of deaths attributable to birth
   asphyxia and infection. Perinatal mortality rates but not stillbirth
   rates decreased. The 7-day neonatal mortality rate was decreased further
   after Neonatal Resuscitation Program training, after correction for loss
   to follow-up monitoring.
   CONCLUSIONS: ENC training for midwives reduced 7-day neonatal mortality
   rates in low-risk clinics. Additional in-depth basic training in
   neonatal resuscitation may reduce mortality rates further. Pediatrics

Abstract = {{It has been studied the changes in the water repellence and colour of
   two commercial lime-based mortars when treated with four commercial
   water repellents, in the context of their possible use in the
   restoration work on the Tower of Gold ({''}Torre del Oro{''}) at
   Seville. The low pressure water absorption test revealed that the
   treated surfaces were regarded to be sufficiently water repellent with
   the exception of Tegosivin HL 100-treated Cumen mortar. This treatment
   was the one that induced in both mortars a significant change in colour:
   a shift to higher b{*} values (more yellow) and a decrease in lightness.

Title = {{CEO Stock-Based Pay, Home-Country Risk, and Foreign Firms' Capital
   Acquisition in the US Market}},
Journal = {{CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Manuscript Type:
   Empirical
   Research Question/Issue:
   We ask two research questions: (1) How do CEO stock ownership and
   options influence the amount of equity capital that a foreign firm
   raises in US capital markets? (2) How does the foreign firm's
   home-country risk moderate these relationships?
   Research Findings/Insights:
   To test our hypotheses, we use a sample of firms from 40 countries that
   raised equity capital via ADR offerings between 1994 and 2005. Using a
   full-information maximum likelihood approach to estimate a model that
   accounts for sample selection associated with non-capital raising ADRs
   and non-listed ADRs, as well as hot and cold equity markets, we found
   that CEO stock and option ownership lead to a higher level of equity
   capital raised. Interestingly, the level of home-country risk of the
   issuing firm weakens the relationship between the CEO stock ownership
   and the amount of equity capital raised, but strengthens the
   relationship between CEO stock options and ADR equity capital raised.
   Theoretical/Academic Implications:
   We develop a framework that draws on behavioral decision making and
   agency theory to suggest that executive risk taking varies across
   countries and different forms of monitoring (stock ownership versus
   options) and that agents may exhibit risk-seeking as well as risk-averse
   behaviors. We also examined the potential corporate governance costs
   associated with principal-principal conflict as it relates to CEO
   stock-based compensation and the implications for raising equity
   capital. Because stock ownership and stock options have different risk
   profiles, and foreign firms operate in countries with different
   home-country risk, we theorize how home-country risk will moderate the
   relationship between CEO stock ownership or options with the amount of
   equity capital raised by a foreign firm in US stock markets through the
   issuance of American Depository Receipts (ADRs).
   Practitioner/Policy Implications:
   Our results show that US investors pay attention to the types of
   stock-based executive compensation used by firms that raise capital in
   the US. In particular, CEOs of firms from higher risk countries need to
   consider US investors' perceptions of their stock-based compensation
   because it may hamper the firm's effectiveness in raising capital in the
   US.}},

Title = {{Why Ethical Consumers Don't Walk Their Talk: Towards a Framework for
   Understanding the Gap Between the Ethical Purchase Intentions and Actual
   Buying Behaviour of Ethically Minded Consumers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{97}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{139-158}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Despite their ethical intentions, ethically minded consumers rarely
   purchase ethical products (Auger and Devinney: 2007, Journal of Business
   Ethics 76, 361-383). This intentions-behaviour gap is important to
   researchers and industry, yet poorly understood (Belk et al.: 2005,
   Consumption, Markets and Culture 8(3), 275-289). In order to push the
   understanding of ethical consumption forward, we draw on what is known
   about the intention-behaviour gap from the social psychology and
   consumer behaviour literatures and apply these insights to ethical
   consumerism. We bring together three separate insights - implementation
   intentions (Gollwitzer: 1999, American Psychologist 54(7), 493-503),
   actual behavioural control (ABC) (Ajzen and Madden: 1986, Journal of
   Experimental Social Psychology 22, 453-474; Sheeran et al.: 2003,
   Journal of Social Psychology, 42, 393-410) and situational context (SC)
   (Belk: 1975, Journal of Consumer Research 2, 157-164) - to construct an
   integrated, holistic conceptual model of the intention-behaviour gap of
   ethically minded consumers. This holistic conceptual model addresses
   significant limitations within the ethical consumerism literature, and
   moves the understanding of ethical consumer behaviour forward. Further,
   the operationalisation of this model offers insight and strategic
   direction for marketing managers attempting to bridge the
   intention-behaviour gap of the ethically minded consumer.}},
