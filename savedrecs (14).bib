Abstract = {{Knowledge is a strategically important resource, but research is needed
   to elucidate individual issues in knowledge sharing, particularly
   cross-contextual examinations. Thus, we developed a contextualized,
   extended model of knowledge sharing intentions based on the theory of
   planned behavior, and tested it using large samples of employees from
   the US, and from Ukraine, where anecdotal evidence suggests pandemic
   knowledge hoarding. Tests of the model in each country produced
   significant results for all of the path coefficients in the US, and for
   all but two paths in Ukraine. Comparative analysis for hypothesis
   testing indicated that, overall, individuals' dispositions and attitudes
   were more relevant for understanding knowledge sharing intentions in the
   individualistic context of the US, while collective, relational elements
   were stronger in Ukraine, but with notable exceptions, particularly the
   influence of societal knowledge control norms. The results provide
   important implications for theory concerning knowledge sharing across
   contexts, including institutional theory assumptions, and for
   efficaciously managing knowledge processes, including cross-national
   knowledge transfers.}},

Title = {{A novel model to characterize postnatal exposure to lipophilic
   environmental toxicants and application in the study of
   hexachlorobenzene and infant growth}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{156-162}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Infants are exposed to persistent environmental contaminants
   through breast milk, yet studies assessing the health effects of
   postnatal exposure are lacking. Existing postnatal exposure assessment
   is either too simple (lactation exposure model, LEM) or requires complex
   physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models.
   Objectives: We present equations for postnatal exposure calculations. We
   applied these equations to study the effect of hexachlorobenzene (HCB)
   on infant growth in the two first years of life.
   Methods: HCB was measured in breast milk samples in 449 mother-child
   pairs participating in the Norwegian birth cohort study HUIVIIS. We used
   these concentrations, mother's weight, height and age, together with
   child's weight at 8 age points, and proportion of milk consumed each
   month, to calculate HCB concentrations in the infant over age. We then
   estimated the association between HCB and infant growth using a linear
   mixed model.
   Results: Children exposed to HCB via mother's milk reached
   concentrations 1-5 times higher than the mother. HO was associated with
   lower weight gain in the first 2 years (-33 g per unit FEB and month,
   95\% CI: -38, -27 at 6 months). Associations were stronger during the
   first 3 months (-57 g per unit HCB and month, 95\% CI: -67, -49 at 1
   month), indicating a critical window of effect Our equations gave more
   precise estimates than the LEM.
   Conclusion: Our equations for postnatal exposure of lipophilic
   environmental toxicants give better results than the LEM and are easier
   to implement than the complex PBPK models. HCB exposure, especially
   during the first three months of life, has a negative effect on infant
   growth up to 2 years. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{1303-1313}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Climate change, via warmer springs and autumns, may lengthen the carbon
   uptake period of boreal tree species, increasing the potential for
   carbon sequestration in boreal forests, which could help slow climate
   change. However, if other seasonal cues such as photoperiod dictate when
   photosynthetic capacity declines, warmer autumn temperatures may have
   little effect on when carbon uptake capacity decreases in these species.
   We investigated whether autumn warming would delay photosynthetic
   decline in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) by growing
   seedlings under declining weekly photoperiods and weekly temperatures
   either at ambient temperature or a warming treatment 4 degrees C above
   ambient. Photosynthetic capacity was relatively constant in both
   treatments when weekly temperatures were > 8 degrees C, but declined
   rapidly at lower temperatures, leading to a delay in the autumn decline
   in photosynthetic capacity in the warming treatment. The decline in
   photosynthetic capacity was not related to changes in leaf nitrogen or
   chlorophyll concentrations, but was correlated with a decrease in the
   apparent fraction of leaf nitrogen invested in Rubisco, implicating a
   shift in nitrogen allocation away from the Calvin cycle at low autumn
   growing temperatures. Our data suggest that as the climate warms, the
   period of net carbon uptake will be extended in the autumn for boreal
   forests dominated by Norway spruce, which could increase total carbon
   uptake in these forests.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{470-482}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Medication adherence plays an important role in optimizing the outcomes
   of many treatment and preventive regimens in chronic illness.
   Self-report is the most common method for assessing adherence behavior
   in research and clinical care, but there are questions about its
   validity and precision. The NIH Adherence Network assembled a panel of
   adherence research experts working across various chronic illnesses to
   review self-report medication adherence measures and research on their
   validity. Self-report medication adherence measures vary substantially
   in their question phrasing, recall periods, and response items.
   Self-reports tend to overestimate adherence behavior compared with other
   assessment methods and generally have high specificity but low
   sensitivity. Most evidence indicates that self-report adherence measures
   show moderate correspondence to other adherence measures and can
   significantly predict clinical outcomes. The quality of self-report
   adherence measures may be enhanced through efforts to use validated
   scales, assess the proper construct, improve estimation, facilitate
   recall, reduce social desirability bias, and employ technologic
   delivery. Self-report medication adherence measures can provide
   actionable information despite their limitations. They are preferred
   when speed, efficiency, and low-cost measures are required, as is often
   the case in clinical care.}},

Title = {{Differences in change in coping styles between good responders, moderate

Journal = {{RESPIRATORY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1540-1545}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) improves exercise tolerance
   and health status in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   (COPD). Data on the effects of PR on coping styles are limited. Aim of
   the present study was to compare changes in coping styles between
   patients who had a good, moderate and no improvement in either exercise
   tolerance or health status after PR.
   Methods: Coping styles of 439 COPD patients undergoing PR were assessed
   by the Utrecht Coping List (UCL) at baseline and after PR. Patients'
   pulmonary function, six-minute walking distance (6MWD), St. George's
   Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression
   Scale (HADS-A and HADS-D) were recorded. Good, moderate and
   non-responders were defined on the basis of minimally clinically
   important difference (MCID) for SGRQ total score and/or 6MWD.
   Results: Overall, 54.0\% of the patients fulfilled the criteria for good
   responders, while 22.1\% were moderate responders. Change in passive
   reaction pattern coping style differed significantly between good
   responders and non-responders following PR (p < 0.001). Moreover, within
   the groups, changes in coping styles after PR occurred among the good
   responders, whereas the majority of moderate responders' and
   non-responders' coping styles were not significantly influenced by PR.
   Conclusion: Good responders decreased their passive reaction pattern
   coping style in contrast to non-responders after PR. In general, PR did
   not change the coping among moderate and non-responders. Further
   research is warranted to determine whether including interventions
   targeting coping styles may modify coping behaviour of COPD patients, as
   well as improvement in exercise tolerance or health status after PR. (C)

Volume = {{212}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Dielectric spectra in the frequency range of 0.1 <= nu/GHz <= 89 were
   recorded for acetonitrile, covering temperatures between 5 and 65
   degrees C. These data are accurately described by a single Debye
   equation. The obtained values for static relative permittivity,
   relaxation amplitude and relaxation time exhibit a smooth temperature
   dependence with low standard uncertainties. Thus, acetonitrile may serve
   as a dielectric reference for medium permittivities (epsilon approximate
   to 30 - 40). At 25 degrees C the dielectric spectrum was extended to 8
   THz. Its analysis revealed that the short-time dynamics of acetonitrile
   is dominated by dipole librarian and cage rattling. On the picosecond
   timescale these localized motions fade into rotational diffusion of the
   AN molecules, which is close to slip boundary conditions. Whilst static
   dipole-dipole correlations are present to some extent, dynamical
   correlations appear to be absent for diffusive dipole reorientation. (C)

Abstract = {{Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection endemic to the southwestern
   United States that typically causes a self-limited pulmonary illness.
   Extrapulmonary dissemination is extremely rare and typically localized
   to the skin, bone, and meninges. The gastrointestinal system has
   generally been thought to be spared from this disease. This report
   describes a patient who was initially diagnosed with pulmonary
   coccidioidomycosis with mediastinal lymphadenopathy and skin
   dissemination. Ten months after completion of treatment, he presented
   with nonspecific abdominal pain and diffuse musculoskeletal and
   constitutional symptoms. Radiographic imaging revealed near resolution
   of previously noted thoracic findings but new peritoneal thickening and
   enhancement suggestive of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Laparoscopic
   biopsies confirmed Coccidioides immitis by culture and histology without
   evidence of other abnormalities.
   This case is unique for several reasons. It is one of a relatively small
   number of cases that describes a diagnosis of peritoneal
   coccidioidomycosis and the first case identified in which a healthy
   patient developed extensive peritoneal disease in spite of near-complete
   resolution of pulmonary and skin manifestations after appropriate
   treatment. This case underscores the complexity of this disease and
   motivates more investigation into pathophysiology and treatment
   considerations of coccidioidomycosis in the gastrointestinal system. We
   will review the risk factors associated with dissemination, the
   interpretation of serologies, the characteristics of patients with
   peritoneal involvement, and finally, the current treatment guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{We study the one-dimensional metastable dynamics of internal interfaces
   for the initial boundary value problem for the following
   convection-reaction-diffusion equation
   partial derivative(t)u= epsilon partial derivative(2)(x)u - partial
   derivative(x)f(u) + f'(u).
   Metastable behaviour appears when the time-dependent solution develops
   into a layered function in a relatively short time, and subsequently
   approaches its steady state in a very long time interval. A rigorous
   analysis is used to study such behaviour by means of the construction of
   a one-parameter family \{U-epsilon(x; xi)\}(xi) of approximate
   stationary solutions and of a linearisation of the original system
   around an element of this family. We obtain a system consisting of an
   ODE for the parameter xi, describing the position of the interface
   coupled with a PDE for the perturbation v and defined as the difference
   v := u - U-epsilon. The key of our analysis are the spectral properties
   of the linearised operator around an element of the family
   \{U-epsilon\}: the presence of a first eigenvalue, small with respect to
   epsilon, leads to metastable behaviour when epsilon << 1.}},

Abstract = {{In patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM), liver resection
   offers the possibility of cure and long-term survival. The liver is a
   highly immunogenic organ harboring similar to 80\% of the body's tissue
   macrophages. Emerging data demonstrate a critical role of the immune
   response for cancer treatment. We investigated variations within genes
   involved in immune response checkpoints and their association with
   outcomes in patients with CLM who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy
   including bevacizumab and liver resection. Single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) in nine genes (CCL2, CCR2, LAG3, NT5E, PDCD1,
   CD274, IDO1, CTLA4 and CD24) were analyzed in genomic DNA from 149
   patients with resected bevacizumab-pretreated CLM by direct Sanger DNA
   sequencing, and correlated with response, recurrence-free survival
   (RFS), overall survival (OS), probability of cure and recurrence
   patterns. IDO1 (indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase) rs3739319 G > A and CD24
   rs8734 G > A showed a significant difference in 3-year OS rates. In
   addition, IDO1 rs3739319 G > A was significantly associated with
   extrahepatic recurrence. Recursive partitioning analyses revealed that
   IDO1 rs3739319 G > A was the dominant SNP predicting RFS and OS. Our
   data suggest that variants within genes involved in immune response
   checkpoints are associated with outcomes in patients with resected CLM
   and might lead to improved treatment strategies modulating anti-tumor
   immune response by targeting novel immune checkpoints.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To develop a regime of care for patients with head and neck cancers
   undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), with the support of
   a health advisor ( HA) and temporary access to the mouth care product
   Caphosol(TM).
   Materials and methods: A HA was temporarily employed to assess, monitor
   and refer patients as appropriate and ensure patients received and
   utilised supplies of Caphosol(TM). A retrospective audit was undertaken
   to provide a gap analysis of current service. The data were used to
   develop a pro forma for documenting assessments and monitoring lifestyle
   factors for IMRT patients. Assessments referrals and compliance, plus
   hospital admissions owing to treatment-related issues, were documented
   during the baseline audit and the temporary HA service and provision of
   Caphosol(TM).
   Results: The presence of a HA facilitated 100\% compliance with
   appropriate assessments, referrals and adherence to treatment. The data
   suggests that the additional provision of Caphosol(TM) may have reduced
   levels of mucositis and associated pain.
   Conclusion: It is recommended that a HA role be established within
   radiotherapy departments to facilitate lifestyle assessments, referrals
   and compliance with positive behaviour changes (e.g., stopping smoking).
   The use of Caphosol(TM) as a routine part of mouth care regime for IMRT
   patients also warrants further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a novel technique for determination of the refractive index
   of hard biological tissue as well as nonopaque technical samples based
   on optical coherence tomography (OCT). Our method relies on an inverse
   refractive-index correction (I-RIC), which matches a measured feature
   geometry distorted due to refractive-index boundaries to its real
   geometry. For known feature geometry, the refractive index can be
   determined with high precision from the best match between the distorted
   and corrected images. We provide experimental data for refractive-index
   measurements on a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and on an ex vivo
   porcine cranial-bone, which are compared to reference measurements and
   previously published data. Our method is potentially capable of in vivo
   measurements on rigid biological tissue such as bone as, for example, is
   required to improve guidance in robot-aided surgical interventions and
   also for retrieving complex refractive-index profiles of compound
   materials. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Development and use of models to predict and study the production and
   the environmental impacts of biomass cropping systems are of great
   interest for their sustainable development. Improvements were made to
   the research version of the STICS crop-soil model in order to simulate
   biomass production and environmental impacts of Miscanthus x giganteus
   cropping systems in the long term. This research version was then
   validated on a large database and in various pedoclimatic environments
   in France and UK. The model accurately simulated biomass production and
   nitrogen (N) content in aboveground biomass, from planting until 4 to 20
   years of cultivation. The model efficiency (EF) was 0.80 and 0.64 for
   biomass and N content, respectively, and the values of relative RMSE
   were 23 and 31 \%. Soil water and mineral N contents were also
   satisfactorily predicted (EF = 0.96 and 0.42; relative RMSE = 10 and 72
   \%). The model accurately reproduced the effect of management practices
   on the harvested biomass and N export. Yield gap analysis using
   simulations with and without active stresses revealed that Miscanthus x
   giganteus biomass production was limited by both water and N
   availability during the establishment phase but mainly limited by water
   availability during the post-establishment phase. The STICS crop-soil
   model can accurately predict Miscanthus x giganteus biomass production
   and environmental impacts such as water drainage and nitrate leaching
   and compare strategies with varying N fertilization, irrigation and
   harvest date.}},

Abstract = {{Depending on the temporal course, three forms of vertigo syndrome can be
   differentiated: 1) vertigo attacks, e.g. benign paroxysmal positional
   vertigo (BPPV), MeniSre's disease and vestibular migraine, 2) acute
   spontaneous vertigo lasting for days, e.g. acute unilateral
   vestibulopathy, brainstem or cerebellar infarction and 3) symptoms
   lasting for months or years, e.g. bilateral vestibulopathy and
   functional vertigo. The specific therapy of the various syndromes is
   based on three principles: 1) physical treatment with liberatory
   maneuvers for BPPV and balance training for vestibular deficits, 2)
   pharmacotherapy, e.g. for acute unilateral vestibulopathy
   (corticosteroids) and MeniSre's disease (transtympanic administration of
   gentamicin or steroids and high-dose betahistine therapy);
   placebo-controlled pharmacotherapy studies are currently being carried
   out for acute unilateral vestibulopathy, vestibular paroxysmia,
   prophylaxis of BPPV, vestibular migraine, episodic ataxia type 2 and
   cerebellar ataxia; 3) psychotherapy for functional dizziness.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Metric geometry in the sense of Hjelmslev and Bachmann studies metric
   planes of a very general kind without any assumption about order,
   continuity and the existence and uniqueness of joining lines. An order
   structure can be defined in an additional step by introducing a relation
   of betweenness which satisfies the axioms of order of Hilbert's
   Grundlagen der Geometrie, i.e., one-dimensional axioms which
   characterize the linear order of collinear points and a single plane
   order axiom which was proposed by Pasch. The Pasch axiom however is
   based on the assumption that any two points have a unique joining line.
   This is not necessarily satisfied by Cayley-Klein geometries (e.g. by
   Minkowskian planes) and even in plane absolute geometry the Pasch axiom
   is not a necessary condition for an ordering of the associated field of
   coordinates (see Sect. 5). The aim of this article is to introduce an
   order structure for the widest class of metric planes (without any
   assumption about the existence of joining lines, free mobility or some
   form of a parallel axiom) and to show that the correspondence between
   geometrical and algebraical order structures, which is well-known in
   affine and projective geometry, can be extended to plane absolute
   geometry. The article closes with a discussion of the role of the Pasch
   axiom in ordered metric geometry. An axiomatization of ordered metric
   planes in a first-order language is provided in an Appendix.}},

Abstract = {{Clostridium difficile is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated
   diarrhea and the etiologic agent responsible for C. difficile infection.
   Toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) are nearly indispensable virulence
   factors for Clostridium difficile pathogenesis. Given the toxin-centric
   mechanism by which C. difficile pathogenesis occurs, the selective
   sequestration with neutralization of TcdA and TcdB by nonantibiotic
   agents represents a novel mode of action to prevent or treat C.
   difficile-associated disease. In this preclinical study, we used
   quantitative enzyme immunoassays to determine the extent by which a
   novel drug, calcium aluminosilicate uniform particle size nonswelling
   M-1 (CAS UPSN M-1), is capable of sequestering TcdA and TcdB in vitro.
   The following major findings were derived from the present study. First,
   we show that CAS UPSN M-1 efficiently sequestered both TcdA and TcdB to
   undetectable levels. Second, we show that CAS UPSN M-1's affinity for
   TcdA is greater than its affinity for TcdB. Last, we show that CAS UPSN
   M-1 exhibited limited binding affinity for nontarget proteins. Taken
   together, these results suggest that ingestion of calcium
   aluminosilicate might protect gastrointestinal tissues from
   antibiotic-or chemotherapy-induced C. difficile infection by
   neutralizing the cytotoxic and proinflammatory effects of luminal TcdA
   and TcdB.}},

Abstract = {{Low-level red laser (LLRL)-tissue interactions have a wide range of
   medical applications and are garnering increased attention. Although the
   positive effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) have frequently been
   reported and enhanced collagen accumulation has been identified as one
   of the most important mechanisms involved, little is known about
   LLRL-collagen interactions. In this study, we aimed to investigate the
   influence of LLRL irradiation on collagen, in correlation with
   fibroblast response. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and fluorescence
   spectroscopy were used to characterize surfaces and identify
   conformational changes in collagen before and after LLRL irradiation.
   Irradiated and non-irradiated collagen thin films were used as culturing
   substrates to investigate fibroblast response with fluorescence
   microscopy. The results demonstrated that LLRL induced small alterations
   in fluorescence emission and had a negligible effect on the topography
   of collagen thin films. However, fibroblasts cultured on LLRL-irradiated
   collagen thin films responded to LRLL. The results of this study show
   for the first time the effect of LLRL irradiation on pure collagen.
   Although irradiation did not affect the nanotopography of collagen, it
   influenced cell behavior. The role of collagen appears to be crucial in
   the LLLT mechanism, and our results demonstrated that LLRL directly
   affects collagen and indirectly affects cell behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design.Medical economic model with multi-way sensitivity
   analysis.Objective.To compare the direct costs of growing rod (GR)
   versus Magnetic Expansion Control System (MG) from a payer's
   perspective. We hypothesized that over time the MG will become more
   cost-effective.Summary of Background Data.Traditional GRs provide
   effective treatment, but require periodic lengthening surgery. MG allows
   rod lengthening in clinic, but the implant is expensive. The cumulative
   cost savings are not well understood.Methods.Index surgery, implant
   cost, lengthening procedure, and revision surgery due to implant failure
   or infection were identified as major parameters contributing to the
   cumulative cost. The base, low, and high values for the cost and the
   incidence of each parameter were determined by literature reports,
   health care database search, or expert consultation. The cumulative cost
   was compared annually during 5 years of follow-up. Marginal cost was
   defined as the cost of (GR-MG) for each cumulative year. Final
   cumulative cost and extreme case scenario at year 5 were assessed by
   deterministic sensitivity analysis.Results.MG resulted in higher
   cumulative cost at years 1 and 2, and became lower cost at years 3
   through 5. The marginal cost at year 1 was a negative value of \$16K,
   and trended toward positive values of \$12K at year 3 and \$40K by year
   5. Sensitivity analysis revealed that in extreme case, MG could cost
   more, shown by a marginal cost of \$26K by implementing the extreme
   values of the 3 parameters carrying highest variance: MG-infection
   management, GR-revision surgery, and GR-lengthening
   procedure.Conclusion.MG achieved cost neutrality to GR at 3 years after
   index surgery. This is the first medical economic study in the United
   States comparing the cost of GR versus MG and demonstrates potential
   cost-effectiveness of MG from payer's perspective if in place for more
   than 3 years.Level of Evidence: 2}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that ring oscillators suffer from jittering due to
   radio frequency interference on their supply. This paper shows that
   there is another effect of radio frequency interference on the ring
   oscillator. Although its average voltage is zero, a sinusoidal
   interference in radio frequency range causes a nonzero accumulated drift
   on the oscillation of the ring oscillator. As a consequence, the
   operation frequency of the ring oscillator is shifted. A theory with
   accompanying equations is developed to explain that phenomenon. The
   proposed theory shows that the normalized frequency shift is determined
   by the amplitude of the interference, and is in a certain range almost
   independent from the frequency of the disturbance. The relationship
   between the interference amplitude and the frequency shift is determined
   by how the inverter delay depends on its dc supply voltage. Both
   transistor level simulations and measurements are performed to verify
   the theory. The valid range of the theory is discussed. The effect shown
   in this paper provides a potential method to detect the intensity of
   electromagnetic interference over a wide frequency range. It also
   represents a potential method to characterize the interference
   propagation path in packaged system, such as integrated circuits.}},

Abstract = {{The use of single-layer MoS2 in light emitting devices requires
   innovative methods to enhance its low photoluminescence (PL) quantum
   yield. In this work, we report that single-layer MoS2 with a strong PL
   can be prepared by oxidizing bilayer MoS2 using UV-ozone oxidation. We
   show that as compared to mechanically-exfoliated single-layer MoS2, the
   PL intensity of the single-layer MoS2 prepared by UV-ozone oxidation is
   enhanced by 20-30 times. We demonstrate that the PL intensity of both
   neutral excitons and trions (charged excitons) can be greatly enhanced
   in the oxidized MoS2 samples. These results provide novel insights into
   the PL enhancement of single-layer MoS2.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the effect of apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene polymorphism
   on the resting-state brain function, structure, and blood flow in
   healthy adults younger than 35 years, using multimodality magnetic
   resonance (MR) imaging.
   Seventy-six healthy adults (34 men, 23.7 +/- 2.8 y; 31 APOE epsilon
   4/epsilon 3 carriers, 31 epsilon 3/epsilon 3 carriers, and 14 epsilon
   2/epsilon 3 carriers) were included. For resting-state functional MRI
   data, default mode network (DMN) and amplitude of low-frequency
   fluctuation maps were extracted and analyzed. Voxel-based morphometry,
   diffusion tensor imaging from structural imaging, and cerebral blood
   flow based on arterial spin labeling MR imaging were also analyzed.
   Correlation analysis was performed between the above mentioned brain
   parameters and neuropsychological tests.
   There were no differences in neuropsychological performances, amplitude
   of low-frequency fluctuation, gray/white matter volumes, fractional
   anisotropy, mean diffusivity, or whole brain cerebral blood flow among
   the 3 groups. As for DMN, the epsilon 4/epsilon 3 group showed increased
   functional connectivities (FCs) in the left medial prefrontal cortex and
   bilateral posterior cingulate cortices/precuneus compared with the
   epsilon 3/epsilon 3 group, and increased FCs in the left medial
   prefrontal cortex and right temporal lobe compared with the epsilon
   2/epsilon 3 group (P<0.05, Alphasim corrected). No differences of DMN
   FCs were found between the epsilon 2/epsilon 3 and epsilon 3/epsilon 3
   groups. FCs in the right temporal lobe positively correlated with the
   performances of vocabulary learning, delayed recall, and graph recall in
   all participants (P < 0.05).
   APOE epsilon 4 carriers exhibited significantly increased DMN FCs when
   compared with epsilon 3 and epsilon 2 carriers. The epsilon 4 affects
   DMN FCs before brain structure and blood flow in cognitively intact
   young patients, suggesting DMN FC may serve as a potential biomarker for
   the detection of early manifestations of genetic effect.}},

Abstract = {{Transparent amorphous lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) thin films
   with different thickness have been prepared by RF magnetron sputtering
   at a growth rate of 14 nm/min. The mean ionic conductivity of
   as-deposited LiPON films determined by impedance spectroscopy was 4.9 mu
   S/cm at 22 degrees C with the activation energy of 0.55 eV. The
   electronic partial conductivity was measured to be 1.6 x 10(-6) mu S/cm
   by recording the current-time curves at a constant voltage. The optical
   transmission of UPON films were measured by UV-Vis/IR spectroscopy. The
   prepared LiPON films on silica glass substrate showed transmission
   higher than 80\% in the visible light range. The complex refractive
   index and bandgap (similar to 2.94 eV) were estimated by fitting the
   transmission data with the Tauc-Lorentz dielectric function model. The
   local structure of the film was investigated by X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. Both methods confirmed the
   incorporation of nitrogen in the matrix. Nitrogen is present in two
   different chemical environments, corresponding to P - N <(P)(P) and
   P-N=P. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry
   (ICP-OFS) and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) measurements
   showed that the composition of the LiPON film was Li3.13PO1.69N1.39. The
   high nitrogen content and low oxygen content appears to be responsible
   for the specific electrical and optical properties of the LiPON films.

Abstract = {{Aim. The aim was to quantify for the first time the physical and
   physiological profile of professional soccer players in official games
   using GPS and heart rate (HR) response. Methods. Thirty professional
   soccer players were investigated during a half in competitive club level
   matches (N.=348) using GPS devices. Results. The relative total distance
   was 118.9 +/- 10.7 m.min(-1) and player's Work-To-Rest Ratio was 2.1:1.
   Defenders covered the lowest total distance, while Second-Strikers
   (2ndS) and Wide-Midfielders (W-MD) traveled the greatest total distance.
   Defenders presented the lowest Work-To-Rest Ratio values. Playing
   position also impacted on all sprinting performance results, except in
   average sprint distance and time of sprint The number of sprints and
   repeated-sprint sequences recorded by the W-MD and Strikers (S) were
   significantly greater than any other group. The average HR recorded was
   87.1\%HRmax and the relationship between the external and internal load
   value (Effindex) was 1.4 with significant differences in both between
   playing positions. W-MD recorded a significantly smaller average HR than
   any other group and Centre-Backs showed a significantly smaller Effindex
   value than any other group. Conversely, W-MD showed a significantly
   greater Effindex value than any other group, except the 2ndS.
   Conclusion. This study has verified a number of statistically
   significant differences between the different playing positions. Coaches
   should be focused on the specific physical and physiological
   requirements of the playing positions to optimize the training
   prescription in soccer. The relationships between external and internal
   load measures among position-specific indicates that players with less
   overall running performance during match-play were the worst in
   Effindex.}},

Abstract = {{The hedgehog signaling cascade generates highly diverse, fine-tuned
   responses in response to the external stimulus by the sonic hedgehog
   (SHH) protein. This is required for the flawless functioning of the
   cell, its development, survival and proliferation; maintained through
   production of Glioma protein (GLI) and transcriptional activation of its
   target genes. Any change in the behavior of GLI response by ectopic
   expression of SHH or mutations in the core pathway components may cause
   serious consequences in the cell fate through rapid, uncontrolled and
   elevated production of GLI. Here, we present a simple but extensive
   computational model that considers the detailed reaction mechanisms
   involved in the hedgehog signal transduction and provides a detailed
   insight into regulation of GLI. For the first time, by explicit
   involvement of suppressor of fused (SUFU) and Hedgehog interacting
   protein (HHIP) reaction kinetics in the model, we try to demonstrate the
   vital importance of HHIP and SUFU in maintaining the graded response of
   GLI in response to SHH. By performing parameter variations, we capture
   the conversion of a graded response of GLI to an ultrasensitive switch
   under SUFU-deficient conditions that might predispose abnormal embryonic
   development and the irreversible switching response of GLI that
   corresponds to signal-independent pathway activation observed in
   cancers.}},

Abstract = {{Linear elastic analysis procedures are employed exclusively in the
   traditional seismic design of new structures and widely employed in the
   seismic assessment of existing structures. It is also a convenient tool
   for the initial checking of deformations in displacement-based design.
   The limitations that should be imposed on linear elastic procedures have
   been evaluated in this study by comparing the deformation-based response
   quantities obtained from response spectrum analysis with those from the
   nonlinear time history analysis. Both procedures were applied to
   different design variants of 5, 8, and 12 story moment frames, subjected
   to 20 strong motion components exhibiting a variety of intensities.
   Member plastic rotations and interstory drift ratios were employed as
   the basic response parameter in performance assessment. It has been
   found that average column demand to capacity ratio (DCR) (the ratio of
   flexural demand from linear elastic analysis to flexural capacity) and
   average beam DCR at the critical story are the most effective parameters
   in determining the validity range of linear elastic procedures in
   regular moment frames. Limiting values for these response parameters are
   proposed. Furthermore, amplification factors for member rotation demands
   predicted by the linear procedures are suggested for moment frames when
   these limiting values are exceeded. These factors ensure that the
   amplified linear elastic rotations are not smaller than 84 percentile
   (mean - 1sigma) of the rotations obtained from nonlinear time history
   analysis. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The Ni(II) adsorption capacity of carbon derived from Citrus
   limettioides peel (CLP), which is a novel waste material (CLPC), was
   evaluated regarding contact time, pH and adsorbent dose during batch
   adsorption processes with raw CLP. The optimal contact time for the
   adsorption of Ni(II) ions onto the peel and peel carbon was 3 h, and the
   optimal pH ranged from 5.0 to 8.0 for CLP and 4.0-8.0 for CLPC,
   respectively. The removal percentage decreased from 85.0 to 70.0 \% for
   CLP and remained nearly constant (99 \%) for CLPC when the initial
   Ni(II) concentration was increased from 10 to 50 mg L-1. The equilibrium
   data fit the Langmuir isotherm with a high R-2 value, indicating that
   the Ni(II) ions formed a homogenous monolayer on the adsorbent surface.
   Adsorption capacity of Ni(II) ions on peel (CLP) and peel carbon (CLPC)
   was found to be 25.64 and 38.46 mg g(-1), respectively. The surface
   morphology and functionality of the CLP and CLPC before and after
   adsorption were characterized using SEM, EDX and FT-IR. Various
   thermodynamic parameters, including the standard Gibbs free energy
   (Delta G degrees), standard enthalpy (Delta H degrees) and standard
   entropy (Delta S degrees), were evaluated. The CLP and CLPC were tested
   with Ni(II) plating wastewater through a batch-mode process over five
   cycles; CLPC showed better results than CLP.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular calcification increases the risk of cardiovascular mortality.
   We previously reported that expression of elastin decreases with
   progression of inorganic phosphorus (Pi)-induced vascular smooth muscle
   cell (VSMC) calcification. However, the regulatory mechanisms of elastin
   mRNA expression during vascular calcification remain unclear.
   MicroRNA-29 family members (miR-29a, b and c) are reported to mediate
   elastin mRNA expression. Therefore, we aimed to determine the effect of
   miR-29 on elastin expression and Pi-induced vascular calcification.
   Calcification of human VSMCs was induced by Pi and evaluated measuring
   calcium deposition. Pi stimulation promoted Ca deposition and suppressed
   elastin expression in VSMCs. Knockdown of elastin expression by shRNA
   also promoted Pi-induced VSMC calcification. Elastin pre-mRNA
   measurements indicated that Pi stimulation suppressed elastin expression
   without changing transcriptional activity. Conversely, Pi stimulation
   increased miR-29a and miR-29b expression. Inhibition of miR-29 recovered
   elastin expression and suppressed calcification in Pi-treated VSMCs.
   Furthermore, over-expression of miR-29b promoted Pi-induced VSMC
   calcification. RT-qPCR analysis showed knockdown of elastin expression
   in VSMCs induced expression of osteoblast-related genes, similar to Pi
   stimulation, and recovery of elastin expression by miR-29 inhibition
   reduced their expression. Our study shows that miR-29-mediated
   suppression of elastin expression in VSMCs plays a pivotal role in
   osteoblastic differentiation leading to vascular calcification.}},

   for analysis. Key phrases of the participant's role claims were
   investigated to identify themes vital to observe her self-image as a
   teacher. Findings also revealed that the interaction with social objects
   i.e. her students as human agency, was found to be most influential on

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of feed

   libitum immediately post-hatch until d 35 and birds deprived from feed
   but not from water over the first 48 h post-hatch. Blood for cholesterol
   analysis was collected on d 34. The same birds were sacrificed on d 36,
   and immediately breast meat, abdominal fat, heart and liver were
   collected and weighed. Feed deprivation over the first 48 h post-hatch
   retarded (P<0.05) growth performance of chickens, but had no impact
   (P>0.05) on the abdominal fat, fatty acid profile of meat, total serum
   cholesterol level as well as the weight of heart and liver of broiler.
   In conclusion, early post-hatch feeding is a beneficial means to enhance
   the final body weight of broilers without affecting the meat quality.}},

   after a cue, in one of two rectangular objects: either at the location
   that had been previously cued, at the uncued end of the cued object, or

   benefit in reaction time for stimuli near the hands in one experiment.
   Interestingly, we observed a same-object cost in sensitivity for stimuli
   near the hands in another experiment. The results reveal that
   object-based perception is disrupted in the near-hand space. This is

Abstract = {{This paper explores institutional mechanisms that might be required to

   Special attention is paid to community-based organic agriculture as a
   pathway to rural development. The Philippines has two decades of
   experience of community-based natural resource management. Unlike public
   natural resources such as forests, watersheds or fisheries, however, the
   community-based organic agriculture programme is intended to deal with
   the private property regime. Thus, if the programme is to be successful,
   agrarian land reform must continue. Integrated rice-duck farming is
   among the suitable and viable options for organic agriculture, given
   that rice is a major agricultural crop and duck meat is popular in the
   Philippines. Area-based organic food certification systems need to be
   formulated and a government-farmers partnership should be forged to
   facilitate farmers' access to domestic and international organic food

Abstract = {{Potato starch was modified with gamma-rays applying doses of 5, 10, 20
   and 30 kGy. The effect of irradiation on starch structure was assessed
   on the basis of blue value (BV), A(680)/A(545) ratio, apparent amylose
   content and lambda(max). The results showed that modification of starch
   led to the reduction of all parameters connected with the starch-iodine
   complex. The main effects of gamma-irradiation on starch granules
   revealed by scanning and transmission electron microscopies were cracks
   on the surface. Low-temperature nitrogen adsorption data showed that
   modification with gamma-rays increased specific surface area and volume
   of mesopores and decreased their average diameter. DSC data indicated
   decreased crystallinity of starch and facilitated retrogradation taking
   place after irradiation in the 20\% starch gels. Treatment with
   gamma-rays influenced also functional properties of potato starch
   increasing water absorption, least gelling concentration, solubility,
   paste clarity and susceptibility to alpha-amylolysis, and decreasing fat
   absorption and viscosity.}},

Abstract = {{A topological graph is k-quasi-planar if it does not contain k pairwise
   crossing edges. A 20-year-old conjecture asserts that for every fixed k,
   the maximum number of edges in a k-quasi-planar graph on n vertices is
   O(n). Fox and Pach showed that every k-quasi-planar graph with n
   vertices has at most n(log n)(O(log k)) edges. We improve this upper
   bound to 2(alpha(n)c) n log n, where alpha(n) denotes the inverse
   Ackermann function and c depends only on k, for k-quasi-planar graphs in
   which any two edges intersect in a bounded number of points. We also
   show that every k-quasi-planar graph with n vertices in which any two
   edges have at most one point in common has at most O(n log n) edges.
   This improves the previously known upper bound of 2(alpha(n)c) n log n

Abstract = {{Background: Recently disparities between the OSCE raw scores and global
   scores have resulted in the need treatment of the raw scores in
   different ways such as borderline regression and borderline group
   regression. The object of this paper is to present station scoring forms
   designed to satisfy predetermined criteria and minimum pass levels.
   Methods: Available samples of marking sheets and checklists designed by
   various examining bodies were scrutinized. Criteria were prioritized
   according to commonly used grading systems. The station rating scale
   (check list) was designed to allow the observer to concentrate on
   checking the performance of the candidate without marking at the same
   time. The station marks form enables entry of marks based on the
   criteria in the Station rating scale.
   Results: Three forms were designed. Forms 1 \& 2 should be prepared
   beforehand with real or standardized patients. Form 3 is a combination
   to be used when last minute stations are introduced. The mark allocated
   to each observable criterion is made within the limits of the specified
   criteria. The global score has been retained to check for
   inconsistencies and for longitudinal studies on validity and
   reliability.
   Conclusions: Prototype forms are presented; using predetermined,
   categorized grading criteria. The forms enable examiners to separate the
   observation stage from the actual allocation of marks. As in all OSCE
   settings, objectivity, validity and reliability will depend on
   prioritizing the selection of stations, clarity of the selected criteria
   and the training of examiners.}},

Abstract = {{Dialdehyde cellulose (DAC) has gained increasing interest because its
   (masked) aldehyde functionalities promise a rich follow-up chemistry and
   further conversion into different derivatives with varying properties.
   So far, the question of degradation upon DAC production and the
   resulting molar mass changes have remained unanswered since the problem
   of molar mass determination of DACs had not been solved. In this study,
   we present a comparison of two methods based on aqueous eluants, size
   exclusion chromatography and asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation
   (AsFlFFF), to determine the molar mass distribution of highly oxidized
   and thus water-soluble DACs, and to elucidate the impact of oxidation on
   the chain length of different cellulose substrates. Molar masses were
   determined by multi-angle laser light scattering in the case of both
   separation systems. The measurements were complemented by dynamic light
   scattering. AsFlFFF demonstrated an overall better separation
   efficiency, but at the expense of increased time consumption for method
   development. The results of molar mass analysis strongly depended on the
   eluant. Hemiacetal crosslinks are stable in near-neutral, low ionic
   strength eluants, while they have a tendency to be cleaved in acidic
   eluants or in solvents of higher ionic strength. By comparison of
   different dissolution strategies the optimal conditions for DAC analysis
   are proposed for both separation techniques. It is concluded that the
   extent of degradation upon dissolution can be significantly minimized by
   controlling the dissolution parameters, but degradation cannot be
   avoided completely.}},

Title = {{Progesterone Accelerates the Completion of Sperm Capacitation and
   Activates CatSper Channel in Spermatozoa from the Rhesus Macaque}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{During transit through the female reproductive tract, mammalian
   spermatozoa are exposed to increasing concentrations of progesterone
   (P4) released by the cumulus oophorus. P4 triggers massive calcium
   influx into human sperm through activation of the sperm-specific calcium
   channel CatSper. These properties of human spermatozoa are thought to be
   unique since CatSper is not progesterone sensitive in rodent sperm.
   Here, by performing patch clamp recording from spermatozoa from rhesus
   macaque for the first time, we report that they express P4-sensitive
   CatSper channel identically to human sperm and react to P4 by inducing
   responsiveness to zona pellucida, unlike human sperm, which respond
   directly to P4. We have also determined the physiologic levels of P4
   capable of inducing capacitation-associated changes in macaque sperm.
   Progesterone (1 mu M) induced up to a 3-fold increase in the percentage
   of sperm undergoing the zona pellucida-induced acrosome reaction with
   the lowest threshold as low as 10 nM of P4. Submicromolar levels of P4
   induced a dose-dependent increase in curvilinear velocity and lateral
   head displacement, while sperm protein tyrosine phosphorylation was not
   altered. Macaque spermatozoa exposed to 10 mu M of P4 developed fully
   hyperactivated motility. Similar to human sperm, on approaching cumulus
   mass and binding to zona pellucida, macaque spermatozoa display
   hyperactivation and undergo an acrosome reaction that coincides with the
   rise in the sperm intracellular calcium. Taken together, these data
   indicate that P4 accelerates the completion of capacitation and provides
   evidence of spermatozoa ``priming'' as they move into a gradient of
   progesterone in search for the oocyte.}},

Abstract = {{The evidence base for defining flow regimes to support healthy river
   ecosystems is weak, as there are few studies which quantify the
   ecological impact associated with different degrees of hydrological
   alteration. As a result, river flow standards used to manage water
   abstraction are largely based on expert judgement. Planned adaptive
   management studies on multiple rivers under the European Water Framework
   Directive represent an opportunity to learn about ecological flow
   requirements and improve the quantitative evidence base. However,
   identifying clear ecological responses to flow alteration can be a
   significant challenge, because of the complexity of river systems and
   the other factors which may confound the response. This paper describes
   the Adaptive River Management (ARM) framework, a flexible framework for
   implementing adaptive management of river flows that is transferable to
   other regions of the world. Application of the framework will ensure
   that the effectiveness of implemented management actions is appraised
   and that transferable quantitative data are collected that can be used
   in other geographical regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass has been found to be
   a potential alternative to mitigate the alarming situation of increasing
   energy demand, fast consumption of fossil fuels and climate change. The
   objective of the study was to investigate the optimum conditions for the
   alcohol extraction process from vegetables and fruit wastes, which make
   up a large portion of agricultural waste in Mauritius. Focus was made on
   the different process parameters affecting the hydrolysis and
   fermentation processes including acid concentration and biomass loading
   and yeast concentration, pH, temperature and retention time,
   respectively, to achieve maximum alcohol yield. Dilute acid hydrolysis
   was found to be a safer and more efficient process compared to
   concentrated acid hydrolysis, despite its high sugar yield. An optimum
   value of 4600 mg reducing sugar per 100 ml hydrolysate was achieved
   after treatment with 5\% (w/w) sulphuric acid and at a biomass loading
   of 20\% (w/w). Yeast growth and enzyme activities were found to be
   optimum at a pH of 5.0 and a temperature of 33 degrees C when using 5\%
   (w/v) SuperStart yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), hence favouring
   ethanol production. Activated charcoal (10\% w/v) was found to
   successfully remove inhibitors while keeping sugar degradation minimal.
   Therefore, under optimum extraction conditions, a maximum of 1.88\%
   (v/v) ethanol yield could be produced after 80 h of fermentation. The
   study indicates that bioethanol production from agricultural waste could
   be a promising technology in Mauritius due to its low cost, abundance
   and renewable nature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the plasma of dairy cows with 1-5 points of lameness, the mineral
   elements {[}calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), iodine (I),
   selenium (Se), molybdenum (Mo), and chromium (Cr)], the energy metabolic
   indicators {[}triglyceride (TG), glucose (Glu), total cholesterol (CHO),
   nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), lactate
   (LA), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)], and inflammatory indexes {[}bovine
   haptoglobin (BoHp), histamine (HIS), and immunoglobulin G (IgG)] were
   measured, respectively. Furthermore, the correlations of the measured
   indicators with the degrees of lameness were analyzed. The results
   showed that in the plasma of dairy cows with 2/3-5 points of lameness,
   for the mineral elements' levels, Ca, Cu, I, Se, and Fe significantly
   decreased, Cr significantly increased, and Mo showed a decreasing trend;
   for levels of the energy metabolism indicators, NEFA and BHBA
   significantly decreased, BUN and LA significantly increased, and Glu,
   CHO, and TG showed an increasing trend; for inflammation indexes, the
   concentrations of HIS, BoHp, and IgG all significantly increased; and
   further analysis indicated that the Mo, Fe, NEFA, BUN, BHBA, IgG, Ca,
   and Se had a significant correlation with the degrees of lameness.
   Resulting data revealed the changes of mineral elements, metabolism, and
   inflammation indexes in the plasma of dairy cows suffering from
   different degrees of lameness, which will provided basic knowledge for
   in-depth understanding of lameness in dairy cows.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Density functional theory calculations were performed to investigate the
   electronic structures of bipolar host materials comprising a backbone of
   linked acceptor moieties where each acceptor was also linked to a
   pendant donor moiety. The acceptor was triphenylphosphine oxide with two
   of its phenyls substituted with fluorine atoms or nitrile groups (CN).
   The donor was carbazole (CZ) substituted, or not, with t-butyl groups.
   The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these host molecules were mainly
   influenced by their respective hole-and electron-transport units. The
   t-butyl substituents on the CZ moieties had an adverse effect on the
   triplet energies (E-T) of the host molecules, especially for molecules
   where the phenyls of the backbone chain were substituted with CN groups.
   While introducing CN substituents onto the backbone chain decreased the
   energy difference between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states
   (Delta E-ST), it also caused the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO to
   narrow. Among the host molecules investigated, that in which one of the
   phenyls in the acceptor moiety was linked to the donor while the other
   two phenyls in the acceptor were substituted with CN substituents
   exhibited the highest E-T, balanced charge transport, a low
   charge-injection barrier, and a small Delta E-ST, and is therefore a
   promising candidate host material for use in blue-phosphorescent
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach to local control and system stability analysis of dc
   power systems having multiple sending and/or receiving terminals is
   presented. The terminals are classified as voltage-source (VS) and
   current-source (CS) terminals. A VS terminal has a filter capacitor in
   parallel with its dc interconnect ports and appears as a VS to the dc
   network, while a CS terminal has a filter inductor in series with its dc
   ports and appears as a CS to the dc network. A local controller
   regulates the current behind the capacitor in a VS terminal and the
   voltage behind the inductor in a CS terminal. Such local controls are
   designed based on local operation objectives and stability requirements
   of individual terminals. The capacitor voltages at VS terminals and
   inductor currents at CS terminals are not directly controlled, but are
   determined by the network topology and system dynamics. Supervisory
   system controls may be incorporated to influence VS terminal voltage and
   CS terminal current responses by changing local control set points.
   Different local control methods and their effects on system stability
   are presented for various network topologies. Small-signal methods to
   assess system stability are also discussed. An offshore wind farm with
   series-dc collection and high-voltage dc transmission is used as an
   example to demonstrate the proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal model of laser diode (LD) end-pumped Nd: YAG was
   established. We analyzed the thermal effect of the crystal during the
   generation of 1319 nm/1338 nm dual-wavelength laser. Together with the
   bonded and non-bonded Nd: YAG crystal characteristics, we proposed to
   consider the bonded crystal's internal temperature distribution of the
   three axes abc for the first time. The results showed that, compared
   with the non-bonded crystals, the bonded crystals could effectively
   reduce the crystal temperature. It provided a theoretical basis to solve
   the problem related to the thermal effect of the laser crystal and
   improve the laser output performance. The Nd: YAG laser crystal thermal
   model in this article could be widely applicable to similar laser
   crystals. The results provide a method to analyze and evaluate bonding
   crystal thermal compensation effectiveness by establishing the Nd: YAG
   crystal's temperature distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) represents a
   principle quality control mechanism to clear misfolded proteins in the
   ER; however, its physiological significance and the nature of endogenous
   ERAD substrates remain largely unexplored. Here we discover that IRE1
   alpha, the sensor of the unfolded protein response (UPR), is a bona fide
   substrate of the Sel1L-Hrdl ERAD complex. ERAD-mediated IRE1 alpha
   degradation occurs under basal conditions in a BiP-dependent manner,
   requires both the intramembrane hydrophilic residues of IRE1 alpha and
   the lectin protein OS9, and is attenuated by ER stress. ERAD deficiency
   causes IRE1 alpha protein stabilization, accumulation and mild
   activation both in vitro and in vivo. Although enterocyte-specific
   Sel1L-knockout mice (Se/1L(Delta IEC)) are viable and seem normal, they
   are highly susceptible to experimental colitis and
   inflammation-associated dysbiosis, in an IRE1 alpha-dependent but
   CHOP-independent manner. Hence, Sel1L-Hrdl ERAD serves a distinct,
   essential function in restraint of IRE1 alpha signalling in vivo by
   managing its protein turnover.}},

Abstract = {{Stretchability represents a key feature for the emerging world of
   realistic applications in areas, including wearable gadgets, health
   monitors, and robotic skins. Many optical and electronic technologies
   that can respond to large strain deformations have been developed. Laser
   plays a very important role in our daily life since it was discovered,
   which is highly desirable for the development of stretchable devices.
   Herein, stretchable random lasers with tunable coherent loops are
   designed, fabricated, and demonstrated. To illustrate our working
   principle, the stretchable random laser is made possible by transferring
   unique ZnO nanobrushes on top of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer
   substrate. Apart from the traditional gain material of ZnO nanorods, ZnO
   nanobrushes were used as optical gain materials so they can serve as
   scattering centers and provide the Fabry-Perot cavity to enhance laser
   action. The stretchable PDMS substrate gives the degree of freedom to
   mechanically tune the coherent loops of the random laser action by
   changing the density of ZnO nanobrushes. It is found that the number of
   laser modes increases with increasing external strain applied on the
   PDMS substrate due to the enhanced possibility for the formation of
   coherent loops. The device can be stretched by up to 30\% strain and
   subjected to more than 100 cycles without loss in laser action. The
   result shows a major advance for the further development of man-made
   smart stretchable devices.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, disposal of sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants and
   recovery of waste heat from steel industry, become two important
   environmental issues and to integrate these two problems, a two-stage
   high temperature sludge gasification approach was investigated using the
   waste heat in hot slags herein. The whole process was divided into two
   stages, i.e., the low temperature sludge pyrolysis at <= 900 degrees C
   in argon agent and the high temperature char gasification at >= 900
   degrees C in CO2 agent, during which the heat required was supplied by
   hot slags in different temperature ranges. Both the thermodynamic and
   kinetic mechanisms were identified and it was indicated that an
   Avrami-Erofeev model could best interpret the stage of char
   gasification. Furthermore, a schematic concept of this strategy was
   portrayed, based on which the potential CO yield and CO2 emission
   reduction achieved in China could be similar to 1.92 {*} 10(9) m(3) and
   1.93 {*} 10(6) t, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Transform Operator Pair Assisted Hilbert-Huang Transform for Signals
   With Instantaneous Frequency Intersections}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Due to low frequency resolution for closely spaced spectral components,
   i.e., the instantaneous frequencies (IFs) lie within an octave or even
   have intersections, the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) fails to separate
   such signals and consequently generates inaccurate time-frequency
   distribution (TFD). In this paper, a transform operator pair assisted
   HHT is proposed to improve the capability of the HHT to separate
   signals, especially those with IF intersections. The two operators of a
   pair are constructed to remove the chosen component that is clearly
   observed in the TFD of the signal, and then recover it from intrinsic
   mode functions (IMFs). With this approach, the components can be clearly
   separated and the intersections can also be identified in the TFD. Since
   a priori knowledge of the transform operator is usually not available in
   real applications, an iterative algorithm is presented to obtain a
   global transform operator. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
   is demonstrated by analysis of numerical signals and a real signal
   collected from a cracked rotor-bearing system during the start-up
   process. Moreover, the proposed approach is shown to be superior to the
   normalized Hilbert transform (NHT) as well as the ensemble empirical
   mode decomposition (EEMD).}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the electroless nickel plating on poly(ethylene
   terephthalate) (PET) surface was developed based on printing primer and
   then immersing in 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (KH550) solution. The
   mechanism of the surface activating and structural properties of nickel
   plating were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
   Hall measurements, optical microscope and T-peel adhesion strength.
   Results showed the formation of crystalline Ni and Ni-P coatings on the
   pretreated PET surface. The surface electrical resistivity of nickel
   coating was reduced from 12.18 to 0.09 ohm cm, and the adhesion strength
   were 9.74-9.89 N/cm, when the deposited time increased from 1 to 30 min.
   The average electromagnetic interference-shielding effectiveness of
   nickel-plated PET sheets maintained a relatively stable value (38.4-37.5
   dB) in a frequency range of 0.05-1.5 GHz. The electroless nickel plating
   was most possibly due to the formation of higher density of carboxyl
   groups and then graft copolymerization of amine groups onto the
   pretreated PET surface. Therefore, the pretreated PET surface was more
   prone to absorb tin sensitizer and palladium catalyst to form an active
   layer for electroless nickel plating.}},

Abstract = {{In Sweden, the new government that took office in 2006 gave the Public
   Employment Service instructions to introduce private contractors as a
   complement to publicly provided services. In this paper I use survival
   analysis in an intention-to-treat approach to compare time to employment
   of jobseekers in labor market areas that cooperated with private
   contractors with jobseekers in labor market areas that did not cooperate
   with private contractors, all within the program Job and Development
   Guarantee. I use register data from the Swedish Public Employment
   Service and exploit within region and period variation in a
   differences-in-differences approach. I find that the labor market areas
   that cooperated with private contractors had lower turnover to
   employment than labor market areas that did not cooperate with private
   contractors. The observed result could be due to different reasons.
   However, among other things, the contract agreement with private
   contractors was not optimally designed with a poor incentives structure.
   Moreover, the introduction of private contractors increased the
   administrative burden upon the staff of the Public Employment Service.}},

Abstract = {{The biogeochemical impacts of iron-rich dust to the oceans are known for
   Earth's recent record but unexplored for deep time, despite recognition
   of large ancient dust fluxes, particularly during the late Paleozoic. We
   report a unique Fe relationship for Upper Pennsylvanian mudrock of
   eolian origin that records lowstand (glacial) conditions within a
   carbonate buildup of western equatorial Pangaea (western United States)
   well removed from other detrital inputs. Here, reactive Fe unambiguously
   linked to dust is enriched without a corresponding increase in total Fe.
   More broadly, data from thick coeval loess deposits of western
   equatorial Pangaea show the same marked enrichment in reactive Fe. This
   enrichment-atypical compared to modern marine, fluvial, glacial, loess,
   and soil sediments-suggests an enhancement of the reactivity of the
   internal Fe pool that increased the bioavailability of the Fe for marine
   primary production. Regardless of the mechanism behind this enhancement,
   our data in combination with other evidence for high dust fluxes imply
   delivery of extraordinarily large amounts of biogeochemically reactive
   Fe to glacial-stage late Paleozoic seas, and modeling of this indicates
   major impacts on carbon cycling and attendant climatic feedbacks.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Neuroendocrine differentiation in colorectal carcinomas,
   detected using immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural techniques, has
   been studied as a prognostic marker for invention of targeted therapy.
   There are a few studies done on this aspect which have shown conflicting
   results ranging from poor prognosis to no prognostic significance.
   Aim: The aim of the study was to determine the clinical significance of
   neuroendocrine differentiation in colorectal carcinomas using
   immunohistochemical stains such as chromogranin A \& synaptophysin in
   relation to its prognostic significance.
   Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted wherein all
   the colorectal carcinomas, received in the Department of Pathology, over
   a period of 3 years, were reviewed. Neuroendocrine markers were done on
   53 cases of moderately, poorly and undifferentiated adenocarcinomas.
   Based on the degree of immunoreactivity for these markers, tumours were
   divided into group 0, group 1, group 2, group 3 \& group 4. Group 0 \& 1
   were categorized as neuroendocrine differentiation absent \& group 2, 3
   \& 4 as present. Neuroendocrine differentiation was correlated with age,
   sex, grade, stage, diagnosis \& survival. Follow up data of the cases
   was recorded.
   Results: Neuroendocrine differentiation was present in 18 cases
   (33.9\%). The degree of immunoreactivity for neuroendocrine markers in
   present study were; group 0-58\%, 1-7.5\%, 2-9\%, 3-13\% \& 4-11\%. The
   mean age of patients was 54 years with a slight male preponderance
   \{M:F::1.6:1\}. Most of the carcinomas with neuroendocrine
   differentiation belonged to Grade II (61\%) \& Stage II \& III (83\%).
   Neuroendocrine differentiation did not show any significant association
   with age, sex, location, histological type, grade, stage \& survival.
   Conclusion: The above results indicate that the presence of
   neuroendocrine differentiation cannot be recommended as a prognostic
   marker in colorectal carcinomas.}},

Abstract = {{MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNAs, evolutionarily conserved
   endogenous non-coding RNAs that regulate their target mRNA expression by
   either inactivating or degrading mRNA genes; thus playing an important
   role in the growth and development of an organism. Maruca vitrata is an
   insect pest of leguminous plants like pigeon pea, cowpea and mung bean
   and is pantropical. In this study, we perform BLAST on all known miRNAs
   against the transcriptome data of M. vitrata and thirteen miRNAs were
   identified. These miRNAs were characterised and their target genes were
   identified using TargetScan and were functionally annotated using
   FlyBase. The importance of the structure of pre-miRNA in the Drosha
   activity led to study the backbone torsion angles of predicted
   pre-miRNAs (mvi-miR-9751, mvi-miR-649-3p, mvi-miR-4057 and mvi-miR-1271)
   to identify various nucleotide triplets that contribute to the variation
   of torsion angle values at various structural motifs of a pre-miRNA. (C)

Abstract = {{Protein evolution is governed by processes that alter primary sequence
   but also the length of proteins. Protein length may change in different
   ways, but insertions, deletions and duplications are the most common. An
   optimal protein size is a trade-off between sequence extension, which
   may change protein stability or lead to acquisition of a new function,
   and shrinkage that decreases metabolic cost of protein synthesis.
   Despite the general tendency for length conservation across orthologous
   proteins, the propensity to accept insertions and deletions is
   heterogeneous along the sequence. For example, protein regions rich in
   repetitive peptide motifs are well known to extensively vary their
   length across species. Here, we analyze length conservation of
   coiled-coils, domains formed by an ubiquitous, repetitive peptide motif
   present in all domains of life, that frequently plays a structural role
   in the cell. We observed that, despite the repetitive nature, the length
   of coiled-coil domains is generally highly conserved throughout the tree
   of life, even when the remaining parts of the protein change, including
   globular domains. Length conservation is independent of primary amino
   acid sequence variation, and represents a conservation of domain
   physical size. This suggests that the conservation of domain size is due
   to functional constraints. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To evaluate antibacterial efficacies of 21 medicinal plants
   used by an Indian aboriginal tribe against infectious diseases caused by
   bacteria isolated from clinical samples.
   Methods: Standard biochemical procedures were followed for identifying
   bacteria that were isolated from several clinical samples. All of the
   bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity tests by
   Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method. From antibiograms of isolated
   Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, it was discernible that
   samples were multikirug resistant (MDR). The methanol leaf-extract of
   Solanum xanthocarpum was subjected to thin layer chromatography (TLC)
   for phytochemical analysis. Molecular docking of beta-lactamase enzyme
   of Escherichia coli with phytochemicals of S. xanthocarpum was performed
   to locate effective compounds.
   Results: The most effective 5 plants, which caused the size of the zone
   of inhibition to range from 21 to 27 mm, were Buchanania latifolia,
   Careya arborea, Ocimum tenuniflorum, Senna alata and S. xanthocarpum,
   for MDR bacteria. S. xanthocarpum had the lowest MIC value of 0.67 mg/ml
   and the lowest MBC value of 1.51 mg/ml against E. coli. In the TLC
   study, 9 spots of methanol leaf-extract of S. xanthocarpum were recorded
   with two solvent systems. The phytochemicals of S. xanthocarpum,
   solasodine and stigmasterol glucoside had the highest docking score
   values, -10.868 kcal/mol and -10.439 kcal/mol, respectively, against
   beta-lactamase.
   Conclusion: This study could prove in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of 5
   uncommon plants against MDR pathogenic bacteria. Solasodine and
   stigmasterol glucoside were computationally recorded as the best
   controlling chemicals from the plant S. xanthocarpum.}},

Abstract = {{Circadian clocks are a great evolutionary innovation and provide
   competitive advantage during the day/night cycle and under changing
   environmental conditions. The circadian clock mediates expression of a
   large proportion of genes in plants, achieving a harmonious relationship
   between energy metabolism, photosynthesis, and biotic and abiotic stress
   responses. Here it is shown that multiple paralogues of clock genes are
   present in soybean (Glycine max) and mediate flooding and drought
   responses. Differential expression of many clock and SUB1 genes was
   found under flooding and drought conditions. Furthermore, natural
   variation in the amplitude and phase shifts in PRR7 and TOC1 genes was
   also discovered under drought and flooding conditions, respectively.
   PRR3 exhibited flooding-and drought-specific splicing patterns and may
   work in concert with PRR7 and TOC1 to achieve energy homeostasis under
   flooding and drought conditions. Higher expression of TOC1 also
   coincides with elevated levels of abscisic acid (ABA) and variation in
   glucose levels in the morning and afternoon, indicating that this
   response to abiotic stress is mediated by ABA, endogenous sugar levels,
   and the circadian clock to fine-tune photosynthesis and energy
   utilization under stress conditions. It is proposed that the presence of
   multiple clock gene paralogues with variation in DNA sequence, phase,
   and period could be used to screen exotic germplasm to find sources for
   drought and flooding tolerance. Furthermore, fine tuning of multiple
   clock gene paralogues (via a genetic engineering approach) should also
   facilitate the development of flooding-and drought-tolerant soybean
   varieties.}},

Abstract = {{The invasion of fish and invertebrate species of Ponto-Caspian origin is
   in the forefront of freshwater research due to the extremely fast range
   expansion of many species and their radical effects on the structure and
   functioning of ecosystems in their non-native habitat. This study
   provides the first assessment of the offshore distribution of invasive
   Ponto-Caspian gobies along the longitudinal profile of the Danube River
   using the data of the Joint Danube Survey 3 research expedition. Six
   goby species were collected, the round goby Neogobius melanostomus, the
   monkey goby N. fluviatilis, the Kessler goby Ponticola kessleri, the
   racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus, the stellate tadpole-goby Benthophilus
   stellatus, and the tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris, which showed
   large differences in their offshore distribution along the river. N.
   fluviatilis was found for the first time as a new species in Austria,
   which shows the slow spread of this species upstream in the Danube River
   or alternatively, its introduction by ships. Offshore trawling confirmed
   the use of deep channel habitats by gobies, and is suggested as a useful
   tool for monitoring spatial and temporal trends in the dynamics of
   invasive benthic species for riverine fish biological research.}},

Abstract = {{Swine organs are the best animal model for urological experiments. The
   aim of the study was to evaluate the course and size of renal veins in
   swine. Such knowledge is important to both human and veterinary
   medicine. The study was conducted on 94 kidneys, 47 right and 47 left
   ones, taken from adult domestic swine (Sus scrofa domestica). The
   kidneys were dissected and corrosion casts were made. The average length
   of the left renal vein was 50.92 mm, while the length of the right renal
   vein was on average 30.13 mm. The lumen diameter was on average 10.94
   mm. The average cross-sectional area of renal veins was 100 mm(2). A
   renal vein most often arises from the anastomosis of two tributaries,
   and is usually formed outside the kidney. Right renal veins are more
   than half the length of left renal veins. A renal vein has a greater
   mean cross-sectional area than its individual direct tributaries. An
   additional renal vein in swine occurs rarely. From the anatomical point
   of view, renal veins of swine are similar to the equivalent vessels in
   human kidneys. Therefore, swine kidneys can be used as organs for
   experimental and training purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives:We undertook descriptive epidemiology of spot urine
   sodium-to-potassium ratio (Na/K) in a population sample to clarify the
   close relationship between Na/K and blood pressure level independently
   of potential confounding factors.Methods:Study participants consisted of
   9144 apparently healthy citizens (aged 5413 years). All clinical
   parameters were obtained at baseline.Results:Na/K was significantly
   higher in hypertensive individuals irrespective of antihypertensive
   medication status (normotension, 3.12 +/- 1.82; untreated hypertension
   3.50 +/- 1.96; treated hypertension, 3.72 +/- 2.53). As urinary Na
   (=0.092, P<0.001) and K (=-0.050, P<0.001) levels were inversely
   associated with BP, Na/K (=0.118, P<0.001) was more closely associated
   with BP than Na or K alone, as well as daily salt intake estimated from
   urinary Na (=0.088, P<0.001). Several factors were significantly
   associated with Na/K, namely age, sex, obesity, blood pressure, renal
   function, salt restriction status, serum phosphate and urinary
   creatinine level, and fasting period and season at urine sample
   collection. However, the association between Na/K and BP was independent
   of these factors (adjusted =0.112, P<0.001). No direct association was
   observed between Na/K and large arterial remodeling assessed by pulse
   wave analysis (P=0.496) or retinal arteriolar morphological change
   (P=0.431). Further, a genome-wide association study failed to identify
   any particular genotype influencing urinary Na and K
   levels.Conclusions:Although we clarified several factors that might
   affect spot urine Na/K, these relationships were not substantial enough
   to confound the association between urinary Na/K and BP. A simple
   measure of Na/K might be more representative of salt loading obtained
   from spot urine samples than Na excretion alone.}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: Quantitative ultrasound parameters based on form factor
   models were investigated as potential biomarkers of cell death in breast
   tumor (MDA-231) xenografts treated with chemotherapy. METHODS:
   Ultrasound backscatter radiofrequency data were acquired from MDA-231
   breast cancer tumor-bearing mice (n = 20) before and after the
   administration of chemotherapy drugs at two ultrasound frequencies: 7
   MHz and 20 MHz. Radiofrequency spectral analysis involved estimating the
   backscatter coefficient from regions of interest in the center of the
   tumor, to which form factor models were fitted, resulting in estimates
   of average scatterer diameter and average acoustic concentration (AAC).
   RESULTS: The AAC parameter extracted from the spherical Gaussian model
   was found to be the most effective cell death biomarker (at the lower
   frequency range, r(2) = 0.40). At both frequencies, AAC in the treated
   tumors increased significantly (P =.026 and.035 at low and high
   frequencies, respectively) 24 hours after treatment compared with
   control tumors. Furthermore, stepwise multiple linear regression
   analysis of the low-frequency data revealed that a multiparameter
   quantitative ultrasound model was strongly correlated to cell death
   determined histologically posttreatment (r(2) = 0.74). CONCLUSION: The
   Gaussian form factor model-based scattering parameters can potentially
   be used to track the extent of cell death at clinically relevant
   frequencies (7 MHz). The 20-MHz results agreed with previous findings in
   which parameters related to the backscatter intensity (i.e., AAC)
   increased with cell death. The findings suggested that, in addition to
   the backscatter coefficient parameter AAC, biological features including
   tumor heterogeneity and initial tumor volume were important factors in
   the prediction of cell death response.}},

Abstract = {{The autoimmune connective tissue diseases (ACTD) are a group of diseases
   which share clinical features and genetic inheritance. They are
   characterized by systemic autoimmunity and autoantibody production with
   a striking predilection for cellular components involved in
   transcription, translation and cellular transport. Although multiple
   triggers of autoimmunity have been proposed for this group of diseases
   including microbial agents such as viruses and bacteria, drugs,
   ultraviolet light, environmental toxins, stress, hormones and heavy
   metals, the prominence of autoantibodies to components of the
   transcription, translation, cellular transport-trail (TTTT) suggests
   that the agent(s) triggering the autoimmune response potentially utilize
   the TTTT. For the ACTD, viruses and viral agents are the likely triggers
   of autoimmunity as a result of aberrant viral latency with the
   production of autoantibodies to the components of the cellular TTTT
   machinery through multiple mechanisms, perhaps including molecular
   mimicry, bystander activation and epitope spreading. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A new thermoelectric material Ag8SnS6, with ultra-low thermal

   1.46x10(17) cm(-3). The thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity,
   thermal conduction mode, Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity
   are determined using the photo-thermal deflection technique combined

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of our study was to assess the incidence and
   predictors of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) in unselected patients
   undergoing coronary intervention either coronary angiography (CA) or
   percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), at Assiut university
   hospitals.
   Background: CIN is a frequent, potentially lethal complication after
   coronary intervention. It is the 3rd most common cause of
   hospital-acquired acute renal failure.
   Patients and methods: This is an observational prospective cohort study.
   Two hundred consecutive patients between December 2011 and August 2012
   underwent CA and PCI were enrolled in the study. Blood samples were
   collected at baseline and 3 days after interventions. All patients were
   followed up for 2 weeks for major adverse events.
   Results: CIN was observed in 23 (11.5\%) patients. According to Mehran
   risk score, 84.5\% of our patients had low risk for CIN, 15.5\% had
   moderate risk for CIN, and no one had high risk score. Multivariate
   logistic regression analysis of predictors for CIN, showed that the use
   of high osmolar contrast media (CM) (Telebrix) was associated with 4
   times higher incidence of CIN than the use of low osmolar CM (Ultravest)
   (OR = 4.07; 95\% CI= 1.1-15.1). None of our patients had clinical signs
   or symptoms of acute renal failure, or required haemodialysis at 2 weeks
   of follow up.
   Conclusion: Although most of our study population was at low risk, the
   incidence of CIN was relatively high due to the use of high osmolar CM.
   Further studies are needed for cost effectiveness in light of negligible
   clinical impact. (C) 2015 The Authors. Production and hosting by

Abstract = {{For meeting the requirements of the high-speed Internet and satisfying
   the Internet users, building fast routers with high-speed IP address
   lookup engine is inevitable. Regarding the unpredictable variations
   occurred in the forwarding information during the time and space, the IP
   lookup algorithm should be able to customize itself with temporal and
   spatial conditions. This paper proposes a new dynamic data structure for
   fast IP address lookup. This novel data structure is a dynamic mixture
   of trees and tries which is called Tree-Combined Trie or simply TC-Trie.
   Binary sorted trees are more advantageous than tries for representing a
   sparse population while multibit tries have better performance than
   trees when a population is dense. TC-trie combines advantages of binary
   sorted trees and multibit tries to achieve maximum compression of the
   forwarding information. Dynamic reconfiguration of TC-trie, made it
   capable of customizing itself along the time and scaling to support more
   prefixes or longer IPv6 prefixes. TC-trie provides a smooth transition
   from current large IPv4 databases to the large IPv6 databases of the
   future Internet.}},

Abstract = {{These studies probed the relationship between intrinsic efficacy and
   tolerance/cross-tolerance between Delta(9)-THC and synthetic cannabinoid
   drugs of abuse (SCBs) by examining in vivo effects and cellular changes
   concomitant with their repeated administration in mice. Dose-effect
   relationships for hypothermic effects were determined in order to
   confirm that SCBs JWH-018 and JWH-073 are higher efficacy agonists than
   Delta(9)-THC in mice. Separate groups of mice were treated with saline,
   sub-maximal hypothermic doses of JWH-018 or JWH-073 (3.0 mg/kg or 10.0
   mg/kg, respectively) or a maximally hypothermic dose of 30.0 mg/kg
   Delta(9)-THC once per day for 5 consecutive days while core temperature
   and locomotor activity were monitored via biotelemetry. Repeated
   administration of all drugs resulted in tolerance to hypothermic
   effects, but not locomotor effects, and this tolerance was still evident
   14 days after the last drug administration. Further studies treated mice
   with 30.0 mg/kg Delta(9)-THC once per day for 4 days, then tested with
   SCBs on day 5. Mice with a Delta(9)-THC history were cross-tolerant to
   both SCBs, and this cross-tolerance also persisted 14 days after
   testing. Select brain regions from chronically treated mice were
   examined for changes in CB1 receptor expression and function. Expression
   and function of hypothalamic CB1Rs were reduced in mice receiving
   chronic drugs, but cortical CB1R expression and function were not
   altered. Collectively, these data demonstrate that repeated
   Delta(9)-THC, JWH-018 and JWH-073 can induce long-lasting tolerance to
   some in vivo effects, which is likely mediated by region-specific
   downregulation and desensitization of CB1Rs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Mining-induced deformations of the ground surface and within the rock
   mass may pose danger not only for surface constructions but also for
   underground objects (e. g., tunnels, underground storages, garages),
   diverse types of pipelines, electric cables, etc. For a proper
   evaluation of hazard for surface and underground objects, such
   parameters as horizontal displacement and horizontal deformations,
   especially their maximum values, are of crucial importance. The paper is
   an attempt at a critical review of hitherto accomplished studies and
   state of the art of predicting horizontal displacement u, in particular
   the coefficient B, whose value allows determination of the value of
   maximum displacement if the value of maximum slope is known, or the
   value of maximum deformation if the value of maximum trough slope is
   recognized. Since the geodesic observations of fully developed
   subsidence troughs suggest that the value of the coefficient depends on
   the depth H, radius of main influences range r and properties of
   overburden rock, in particular the occurrence of sub-eras Paleogene and
   Neogene layers (old name: Quaternary and Tertiary) with low strength
   parameters, therefore a formula is provided in the present paper
   allowing for the estimation of the influence of those factors on the

Abstract = {{Intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm (ITPN) of the pancreas is rare
   compared with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). These
   entities are distinguished by endoscopic ultrasonography
   (EUS)-fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) on the basis of mucin
   production and the presence of a tubular or papillary growth pattern. In
   addition, there are several tumor types that should be distinguished
   from ITPN, such as solid pseudopapillary neoplasm, acinar cell
   carcinoma, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Herein, a case of an
   80-year-old man with ITPN, which was suspected based on EUS-FNAC
   findings at the time of review and confirmed by histological examination
   of the surgically resected specimen, has been presented. There have only
   been three reported cases that included the cytology of ITPN in the
   English language literature, all of which propose diagnostic features of
   ITPN based on cytological specimens. Here, a previously undescribed
   diagnostic feature of ITPN revealed by EUS-FNAC-tubules in contact with
   fibrovascular structures-correlated well with the histological findings

Abstract = {{Since the first microchannel heat sink was introduced, intense research
   on microchannel based heat sinks has been conducted to study the heat
   transfer mechanism and fluid flow characteristics in microscale channel
   structures. In this paper the determination of proper channel length of
   the microscale heat sink(s) is presented. The main aim is to introduce a
   methodology to define the maximum applicable channel length in order to
   achieve the maximum heat transfer from the substrate to the fluid
   without realizing unnecessarily long channels. It is important because
   superfluous parts of the channel(s) from the heat transfer point of view
   occupy important areas where further channel(s) can be realized. The
   proposed characteristic channel length depends on the fluid properties,
   the flow rate and the channel geometries. This approach could be more
   important in the case of the more-than-Moore 3D integration (e.g.:
   System-in-Packages, stacked dies structure, etc.) where removing the
   heat from the inner layers or forming homogenous temperature
   distribution within a selected die is the most up-to-date question
   nowadays. The determination of the proper length of the channel(s) gives
   a basis to design the optimal architecture of microscale heat sink
   structures. The commonly applied microscale cooling structures with
   radial arrangement and one inlet usually reach the highest achievable
   heat transfer at low pressure drop but occupy more surface area than
   needed at applied flow rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Transgenic plants have the potential to provide substantial benefits in
   the production of pharmaceutical compounds, valuable nutrition, and
   vaccines. Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter is the most general
   promoter in higher plants, and also used to express the transgene in
   liverwort. However, some genes, such as those found in other species,
   are difficult to express in liverwort. We reported previously that the
   5'-untranslated region (UTR) of liverwort ADH-like glucose dehydrogenase
   gene enhanced transient gene expression in liverwort. In this study, we
   tested the effects of 5'-UTR on the expression of Gracilaria
   vermiculophylla cyclooxygenase (GvCOX) gene in stably transformed
   liverwort. The GvCOX gene encodes the enzyme to produce prostaglandins
   used as pharmaceutical compounds. Cyclooxygenase activity in transgenic
   liverwort without 5'-UTR was low, although this mRNA was accumulated. In
   contrast, addition of the 5'-UTR to the GvCOX gene significantly
   increased cyclooxygenase activity in transgenic liverwort. We also found
   that the boundary sequences between the 5'-UTR and GvCOX gene affected
   mRNA accumulation level. Our system with the 5'-UTR provides a powerful
   tool for enhancing transgene expression in liverwort.}},

Abstract = {{Sentinel node (SN) mapping in esophageal cancer has been reported to be
   technically feasible with an acceptable detection rate and accuracy.
   However, the clinical significance and survival analysis findings
   associated with the metastatic status of SNs in patients with
   early-stage esophageal cancer have not been clarified. In this study, we
   investigated the clinical significance and survival impact of SN mapping
   in early-stage esophageal cancer.
   Among patients who were diagnosed preoperatively with clinical T1N0M0 or
   T2N0M0 esophageal cancer and who underwent SN mapping, 70 consecutive
   patients who were diagnosed with pathological T1 primary thoracic
   esophageal cancer were enrolled in this study. Sixty-four (91 \%)
   patients were diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma while 5 (7 \%)
   patients were with adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic injection of
   technetium-99m tin colloid was performed before surgery, and radioactive
   SNs were identified by preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and
   intraoperative gamma probing. Standard esophagectomy with
   lymphadenectomy was performed in all patients, and all resected nodes
   were evaluated by routine pathological examination.
   SNs were successfully detected in 65 (92.9 \%) of 70 patients with pT1
   esophageal cancer. The sensitivity to predict lymph node metastasis was
   91.7 \%, and the diagnostic accuracy based on SN status was 96.9 \%.
   Although there was a wide distribution of SNs from cervical to abdominal
   areas, 84.5 \% of the patients had no lymph node metastasis or had lymph
   node metastasis only in SN. The disease-specific survival of the
   patients with metastatic non-SNs was significantly worse relative to
   that of the patients with no lymph node metastasis or lymph node
   metastasis only in SN.
   This study demonstrated that radio-guided SN mapping is useful not only
   as an accurate diagnostic tool for detecting lymph node metastasis but
   also as a tool for prognostic stratification in patients with cN0 early
   esophageal cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the
   only curative therapy for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
   Donor T cells are critical for the graft-versus-tumor effect but carry
   the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). CD34 selection with
   immunomagnetic beads has been an effective method of depleting
   alloreactive donor T cells from the peripheral blood graft and has been
   shown to result in significant reduction in acute and chronic GVHD. We
   analyzed the outcomes of 102 adults (median age, 57.6 years) with
   advanced MDS who received a CD34-selected allo-HSCT between January 1997
   and April 2012 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The cumulative
   incidences of grades II to IV acute GVHD were 9.8\% at day 100 (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 5.0\% to 16.5\%) and 15.7\% at day 180 (95\%
   Cl, 9.4\% to 23.4\%). The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 1 year
   was 3.9\% (95\% CI, 1.3\% to 9.0\%). The cumulative incidences of
   relapse were 11.8\% at 1 year (95\% CI, 6.4\% to 18.9\%) and 15.7\% at 2
   years (95\% CI, 9.4\% to 23.4\%). Forty-eight patients were alive with a
   median follow-up of 71.7 months. Rates of overall survival (OS) were
   56.9\% at 2 years (95\% Cl, 48\% to 67.3\%) and 49.3\% at 5 years (95\%
   CI, 40.4\% to 60.2\%). Rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) were 52.0\%
   at 2 years (95\% Cl, 41.9\% to 61.1\%) and 47.6\% at 5 years (95\% CI,
   37.5\% to 56.9\%). The cumulative incidences of nonrelapse mortality
   were 7.8\% at day 100 (95\% CI, 3.7\% to 14.1\%), 22.5\% at 1 year (95\%
   CI, 15.0\% to 31.1\%), and 33.4\% at 5 years (95\% CI, 24.2\% to 42.6\%)
   post-transplant. The incidence of chronic GVHD/RFS overlapped with RFS.
   These findings demonstrate that ex vivo T cell depleted allo-HSCT by
   CD34 selection offers long-term OS and RFS with low incidences of acute
   and chronic GVHD and without an increased risk of relapse. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{The present study addresses the issue of how different forms of cultural
   capital may influence children's mathematics achievement in economies
   with different socioeconomic gradients. Data from 73,178 parent-child
   dyads from 10 economies with different socioeconomic gradients who
   participated in the Programme for International Student Assessment
   (PISA) 2012 were analysed using hierarchical linear modelling. The
   cultural capital variables examined comprised the availability of home
   educational resources and parental educational expectations of their
   children. Results showed that after controlling for parent education,
   student gender and student history of repeating grades in the past,
   there were statistically significant main and interaction effects (home
   educational resources 9 parent education and parental educational
   expectations 9 parent education) of cultural capital on student
   achievement. Furthermore, these effects explained more student
   achievement variance in high than in medium socioeconomic gradient
   economies (7.45\% vs 2.82\% respectively). In particular, the main
   effects for parental educational expectations, and interaction effect
   between parental educational expectations and parent education were more
   pronounced in high as compared with medium socioeconomic gradient
   economies. Overall, the results underscore the challenges confronting
   low socioeconomic status (SES) parents who aspire for social mobility
   for their children and the need for high SES parents to strategically
   `activate' their cultural capital advantages to benefit their children's
   achievement maximally.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Medication nonadherence is an imperative public health
   concern. Among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), poor
   adherence to antidiabetic agents is strongly associated with suboptimal
   glycemic control. Poor adherence and hyperglycemia greatly increase
   diabetes-related morbidity and mortality. At a national level, diabetes
   drug adherence using average proportion of days covered (PDC) is
   estimated to range between 36\% and 81\%, with an estimated range for
   diabetes control between 38\% and 47\%. At a state level. no such
   studies exist.
   OBJECTIVE: To estimate the level of medication adherence to antidiabetic
   agents and of diabetes control, and their association among patients
   with T2DM receiving medication treatment at the state and the
   Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) levels among the populations covered
   by commercial insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid.
   METHODS: The study population included adults with T2DM aged >= 18 years
   who were identified using ICD-9-CM code 250.xx, who received diabetes
   medication, and who were covered by private insurance, Medicare, or
   Medicaid in each state, the District of Columbia, and the top 50 MSAs.
   Medication adherence was measured by average PDC and the percentage of
   population that had a PDC >= 80\%. Diabetes control was identified using
   ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes. Patients who were not diagnosed with
   uncontrolled diabetes (250.x2 and 250.x3) were identified as being under
   control. The administrative claims databases used for this study
   included the 2012 medical and pharmacy claims from a large U.S. health
   plan, the complete 2011 Medicare Standard Analytical File linked with
   Part D claims, and the 2008 Mini-Medicaid Analytic eXtract (Mini-Max).
   Medication adherence and diabetes control were adjusted for age and sex
   to allow comparison across insurance coverage, states, and MSAs.
   RESULTS: For an insured patient population with T2DM that received
   diabetic drug treatment, average PDC was 79\%. However, 35\% of patients
   did not achieve an adherence of at least 80\% of PDC. In addition, at
   least 40\% of patients did not have their diabetes under control. Across
   insurance types, we found that patients insured with Medicare had
   relatively high average PDC and adherence levels (83\% and 71\%) in
   comparison with the commercially insured population (77\% and 60\%) and
   Medicaid patients (75\% and 57\%). In contrast, commercially insured
   patients had relatively better diabetes control (69\%) than those
   insured with Medicare and Medicaid (54\% and 53\%, respectively). At a
   state level, we found that commercially insured and Medicare populations
   have relatively smaller geographic variation in drug adherence than the
   Medicaid population.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study identified gaps in T2DM drug adherence and
   pinpointed geographic areas that lag in terms of diabetes drug adherence
   or diabetes control and would benefit from implementing strategies to
   increase drug adherence. Copyright (C) 2015, Academy of Managed Care

Abstract = {{Given recent epidemiological and practice trends, small kidney cancers
   are poised to become a focus of modern-day surgical care provided by
   urologists and urologic oncologists. For the past decade, partial
   nephrectomy has been viewed as preferable to radical nephrectomy for the
   treatment of many patients with early-stage kidney cancer, partly
   because observational studies suggest a survival benefit with nephron
   sparing. More recently, European Organisation for Research and Treatment
   of Cancer 30904 a phase 3 randomized control trial demonstrated better
   survival for patients treated with radical vs. partial nephrectomy.
   Shortly thereafter, an instrumental variable analysis reported a
   survival advantage with partial nephrectomy. Although seemingly
   contradictory, these studies are potentially reconcilable when
   considering methodological differences and other empiric work. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) in
   Japan resulted in significant releases of fission products. While
   substantial data exist concerning outdoor air radioactivity following
   the accident, the resulting indoor radioactivity remains pure
   speculation without a proper method for estimating the ratio of the
   indoor to outdoor airborne radioactivity, termed the airborne sheltering
   factor (ASF). Lacking a meaningful value of the ASF, it is difficult to
   assess the inhalation doses to residents and evacuees even when outdoor
   radionuclide concentrations are available. A simple model was developed
   and the key parameters needed to estimate the ASF were obtained through
   data fitting of selected indoor and outdoor airborne radioactivity
   measurement data obtained following the accident at a single location.
   Using the new model with values of the air exchange rate, interior air
   volume, and the inner surface area of the dwellings, the ASF can be
   estimated for a variety of dwelling types. Assessment of the inhalation
   dose to individuals readily follows from the value of the ASF, the
   person's indoor occupancy factor, and the measured outdoor radioactivity
   concentration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Amyloid myopathy is a rare manifestation of primary
   systemic amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, but it has not been
   reported to occur in secondary amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis. Methods: We
   describe a 46-year-old man with psoriasis vulgaris who presented with
   idiopathic upper and lower limb weakness and was eventually diagnosed
   with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Muscle biopsy findings were compatible
   with mild inflammatory myopathy. He died of cardiopulmonary arrest, and
   an autopsy was performed. Results: The autopsy revealed amyloid plaques
   immunopositive for AA (but not AL or transthyretin) in the perimysial,
   perivascular, and endomysial regions of the iliopsoas muscle. The final
   diagnosis was systemic AA amyloidosis with muscle amyloid angiopathy,
   possibly induced by psoriasis vulgaris. Conclusion: This is an extremely
   rare autopsy case of myopathy in a patient with systemic AA amyloidosis.
   The reason for the unusually large amount of amyloid deposition in
   muscle blood vessel walls remains unclear.}},

Abstract = {{The probe-liquid-substrate system, in which a micro-manipulation probe
   (MMP) is inserted into a liquid film of nanosuspension on a substrate,
   is very useful in nanomanipulations. With the MMP's vibration, a
   three-dimensional (3D) acoustic streaming field around the MMP is
   generated, which has been used to trap, transfer and rotate nanoentities
   in the liquid film. However, research on the details of the 3D acoustic
   streaming field in the probe-liquid-substrate system has been scarce. In
   this work, the 3D acoustic streaming field in a probe-liquid-substrate
   system for the contact-type trapping of individual nanowires is
   numerically investigated by the finite element method. The computational
   results show that the MMP root's elliptical vibration can generate an
   acoustic streaming field capable of trapping a single nanowire in the
   contact mode. This conclusion can well explain the experimental
   phenomena that the MMP can trap a single nanowire at some frequencies
   and cannot at others. The computational results clarify the effect of
   the distance between the MMP and substrate, the MMP's radius and length,
   and the water film's thickness on the acoustic streaming field.}},

Abstract = {{In the traditional model of monostatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR),
   the flying platform should have a uniform linear trajectory. In
   practice, the flight path of the SAR platform, which is highly nonlinear
   or curvy caused by 3-D velocity and acceleration, cannot be used in the
   traditional model. In this paper, a geometrical model of the monostatic
   SAR with general configurations is graphically illustrated by vector
   notation. Moreover, the gradient method is utilized to point out the
   effects of the motion parameters, namely, velocity vector and
   acceleration vector, on total bandwidth and image resolution. Based on
   the accurate model, a general frequency-domain algorithm, with the
   incorporations of pre- and postprocessing, is proposed to focus the raw
   data. Applicability is studied through theoretical analysis and
   numerical experiments. All these general analyses can be applied to
   different realizations of monostatic SAR mode, including spotlight SAR,
   sliding spotlight SAR, and Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans
   (TOPS) SAR.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Changes over time in preferences for life-sustaining
   treatments (LSTs) at end of life (EOL) in different patient cohorts are
   not well established, nor is the concept that LST preferences represent
   more than 2 groups (uniformly prefer/not prefer). Purpose: The purpose
   of this study was to explore heterogeneity and changes in patterns of
   LST preferences among 2 independent cohorts of terminally ill patients
   with cancer recruited a decade apart. Methods: Preferences for
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation, intensive care unit care, cardiac
   massage, intubation with mechanical ventilation, intravenous nutritional
   support, nasogastric tube feeding, and dialysis were surveyed among
   2,187 and 2,166 patients in 2003-2004 and 2011-2012, respectively.
   Patterns and changes in LST preferences were examined by multigroup
   latent class analysis. Results: We identified 7 preference classes:
   uniformly preferring, uniformly rejecting, uniformly uncertain, favoring
   nutritional support but rejecting other treatments, favoring nutritional
   support but uncertain about other treatments, favoring intravenous
   nutritional support with mixed rejection of or uncertainty about other
   treatments, and preferring LSTs except intubation with mechanical
   ventilation. Probability of class membership decreased significantly
   over time for the uniformly preferring class (15.26\%-8.71\%); remained
   largely unchanged for the classes of uniformly rejecting
   (41.71\%-40.54\%) and uniformly uncertain (9.10\%-10.47\%), and favoring
   nutritional support but rejecting (20.68\%-21.91\%) or uncertain about
   (7.02\%-5.47\%) other treatments, and increased significantly for the
   other 2 classes. The LST preferences of Taiwanese terminally ill
   patients with cancer are not a homogeneous construct and shifted toward
   less-aggressive treatments over the past decade. Conclusions:
   Identifying LST preference patterns and tailoring interventions to the
   unique needs of patients in each LST preference class may lead to the
   provision of less-aggressive EOL care.}},

Abstract = {{Sip1/tuftelin-interacting protein (STIP), a multidomain nuclear protein,
   is a novel factor associated with the spliceosome, yet its role and
   molecular function in cancer remain unknown. In this study, we show, for
   the first time, that STIP is overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer
   (NSCLC) tissues compared to adjacent normal lung tissues. The depletion
   of endogenous STIP inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation in vitro and in
   vivo, caused cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis. Cell cycle arrest
   at the G2/M phase was associated with the expression and activity of the
   cyclin B1-CDK1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1) complex. We also provide
   evidence that STIP knockdown induced apoptosis by activating both
   caspase-9 and caspase-3 and by altering the Bcl-2/Bax expression ratio.
   RNA sequencing data indicated that the MAPK mitogen-activated protein
   kinases, Wnt, PI3K/AKT, and NF-kappa B (nuclear factor
   kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) signalling pathways
   might be involved in STIP-mediated tumour regulation. Collectively,

Abstract = {{A common understanding of magnetization switching in microwave-assisted
   magnetization reversal is that the rotation direction of the microwaves
   should be the same as the precession direction of the magnetization. In
   this letter, however, we show that microwaves initially rotating
   opposite to the magnetization precession destabilize the magnetization
   at an equilibrium and induce switching more efficiently when the
   microwave frequency depends on time. This argument is analytically
   deduced from an energy balance equation. We also establish a model
   satisfying this condition and confirm magnetization switching solely by
   microwaves by using numerical simulation. (C) 2015 The Japan Society of

Title = {{Segmenting tree crowns from terrestrial and mobile LiDAR data by

Abstract = {{The rapid development of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) techniques
   is advancing ecological and forest research. During the last decade,
   numerous single tree segmentation techniques have been developed using
   airborne LiDAR data. However, accurate crown segmentation using
   terrestrial or mobile LiDAR data, which is an essential prerequisite for
   extracting branch level forest characteristics, is still challenging
   mainly because of the difficulties posed by tree crown intersection and
   irregular crown shape. In the current work, we developed a comparative
   shortest-path algorithm (CSP) for segmenting tree crowns scanned using
   terrestrial (T)-LiDAR and mobile LiDAR. The algorithm consists of two
   steps, namely trunk detection and subsequent crown segmentation, with
   the latter inspired by the well-proved metabolic ecology theory and the
   ecological fact that vascular plants tend to minimize the transferring
   distance to the root. We tested the algorithm on mobile-LiDAR-scanned
   roadside trees and T-LiDAR-scanned broadleaved and coniferous forests in
   China. Point-level quantitative assessments of the segmentation results
   showed that for mobile-LiDAR-scanned roadside trees, all the points were
   classified to their corresponding trees correctly, and for
   T-LiDAR-scanned broadleaved and coniferous forests, kappa coefficients
   ranging from 0.83 to 0.93 were obtained. We believe that our algorithm
   will make a contribution to solving the problem of crown segmentation in
   T-LiDAR scanned-forests, and might be of interest to researchers in
   LiDAR data processing and to forest ecologists. In addition, our
   research highlights the advantages of using ecological theories as
   guidelines for processing LiDAR data. (C) 2015 International Society for

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore the association between the initial 60 days of
   prescriptions for psychotropic medications and final workers'
   compensation claim outcomes. Methods: A cohort of 11,394 claimants
   involved in lost time injuries between 1999 and 2002 were followed
   through December 31, 2009. Logistic regressions and Cox Proportional
   Hazard Models were used in the analysis. Results: The initial 60 days of
   prescriptions for psychotropic medications were significantly associated
   with a final claim cost at least \$100,000. Odds ratios were 1.88 for
   short-acting opioids, 2.14 for hypnotics, antianxiety agents, or
   antidepressants, and 3.91 for long-acting opioids, respectively.
   Significant associations were also found between decreased time lost
   from work and decreased claim closures during the study period.
   Conclusions: Early prescription of opioids and other psychotropic drugs
   may be useful predictors of high claim costs and time lost from work.}},

Abstract = {{During the last years, DNA profiling techniques have become more
   sensitive and mixtures with multiple contributors occur often.
   Nevertheless, interpretation of mixture profiles is the most complex
   task in the forensic field. The ISFG published recommendations for the
   interpretation of mixed DNA profiles that may have allelic drop-out or
   drop-in. The DNA commission of the ISFG has supported the use of
   likelihood ratios (LRs) as preferable to other methods. LR can be
   calculated by probabilistic programs, using semi and fully continuous
   (probabilistic) methods. These methods increase the efficiency of
   forensic laboratories and improve the consistency and transparency of
   the reported results. LRmix is an open-source system dedicated to the
   interpretation of forensic DNA profiles with a particular focus on
   complex DNA mixtures. This software is programmed on a LR model and
   facilitates the calculation of LR for complex mixtures, with partial
   profiles with known and unknown contributors. Here, we report the
   re-analysis of two old complex cases processed in our laboratory in the
   last years. In both cases, we used the software LRmix Studio with
   interesting consequences: in one case we solved the crime, in the other
   one, the results allowed the case to be reopened. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study aims to accurately determine supercritical CO2/brine relative
   permeability, using a hybrid Genetic Algorithm-Radial Basis Function
   (GA-RBF) neural network. CO2 sequestration, along with some enhanced oil
   recovery (EOR) processes, demands an exact knowledge of relative
   permeability in order to ensure the viability of the operation. Previous
   studies have shown that errors in CO2/brine relative permeability data
   might result in a four-fold error in injectivity estimation. This, as
   well as several recent studies regarding the relative permeability of
   CO2/brine systems, has indicated the importance of this parameter. The
   developed GA-RBF model was determined to be in excellent accordance with
   experimental data, yielding average absolute relative deviations (AARD)
   of 4.66\% and 2.11\% for CO2 and brine relative permeability,
   respectively. In addition, comprehensive comparisons between classic
   models and the proposed GA-RBF model have been carried out. Based on
   these comparisons, it may be concluded that the proposed model is
   superior to the classic method (simple correlation) in terms of its
   accuracy in determining the viability of CO2 sequestration operations.

Abstract = {{This study adopts an Explanatory Mixed Methods Research Design to better
   understand whether teachers' traditional and constructivist conceptions
   of teaching and learning may have any role to play in the formation or
   alleviation of teacher prejudice. In the quantitative phase, two
   instruments were administered to 124 foreign language teachers at
   Iranian universities and higher education institutes. The results
   obtained from the analysis of questionnaires pointed to the prevalence
   of constructivist teaching inclinations among Iranian English language
   teachers. Moreover, the results of relational analysis indicated
   significant positive correlations between traditional conceptions of
   teaching and learning and teachers' bias towards perfectionism as well
   as their biases against the use of learners' first language (L1) and
   their risk-taking behavior. Besides, negative correlations were also
   found between the constructivist conceptions of language teaching and
   learning and teachers' bias in favor of the Western culture as well as
   their bias against learners' use of the L1. In the second phase of the
   study, semi-structured interviews with participants were held to come up
   with an in-depth understanding of their conceptions of teaching and
   learning as well as their different second language (L2) teaching
   biases. Besides, to enhance the trustworthiness of the inferences made
   and to find out whether or not the teachers' perceptions matched their
   actual classroom practices, classroom observations were also carried
   out. The integrated findings from the three phases of this study were
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) structures, in particular stone bunds
   and conservation trenches, have been extensively installed in Tigray
   since the 1980's. As the effectiveness of stone bunds and trenches in
   reducing runoff and soil loss depends on their retention capacities, it
   can be expected that this effectiveness declines over time due to
   infilling with sediment. However, little is known about the rate of this
   decline during subsequent years. We therefore assessed the effectiveness
   of SWC structures for two land use types, three slope classes and during
   three consecutive rainy seasons. Rainfall, runoff and soil loss were
   measured using 21 large (600-1,000 m(2)) runoff plots at Mayleba
   catchment. Results show that all studied SWC structures are more
   effective in reducing soil loss than runoff. Conservation trenches are
   generally more effective in reducing runoff and soil loss than stone
   bunds. However, due to their infilling with sediment, their
   effectiveness quickly declines over time. By the end of the third rainy
   season, their effectiveness was reduced to about one third of their
   initial effectiveness. The effectiveness of stone bunds remained fairly
   constant during three consecutive rainy seasons. These findings have
   important implications, as they demonstrate that many of the installed
   SWC structures (especially in rangelands) are only very effective for
   short periods (one to two years). Regular sediment removal from
   conservation trenches is therefore crucial to preserve their
   effectiveness over longer periods.}},

Abstract = {{From 1938 to 1950, there was a spirited debate about whether
   decreasing-average-cost industries should set prices at marginal cost,
   with attendant subsidies if necessary. In 1938, Harold Hotelling
   published a forceful and far-reaching proposal for marginal cost pricing
   entitled ``The General Welfare in Relation to Problems of Taxation and
   of Railway and Utility Rates.{''} After several years and many pages of
   discussion, Ronald Coase gave a name and a clear formulation to the
   debate in his 1946 article ``The Marginal Cost Controversy.{''} We will
   tell much of the story of this controversy by comparing the frameworks
   of Hotelling and Coase, while also bringing in other contributors and
   offering some thoughts about contemporary relevance. The arguments
   marshaled by Coase (and his contemporaries) not only succeeded in this
   particular debate, as we shall see, but more generally served as part of
   the foundation for various fields of modern economics, particularly
   institutional, regulatory, and public choice economics as well as law
   and economics. Yet the underlying issues are quite difficult to resolve,
   and the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments for marginal cost
   pricing can turn on specific elements of the industry.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We examined intra-basin spatial variability of sedimentary geochemical
   and isotopic signals using a network of five sediment cores from a small
   lake in southern Costa Rica with a history of prehistoric maize
   agriculture in its watershed. All cores show a similar pattern of
   agricultural activity (2000-1000 cal yr BP), a transitional period of
   forest recovery (1000-675 cal yr BP), and a period after forest
   reestablishment (675-400 cal yr BP). During the agricultural period,
   bulk sediment stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13(TOC)) indicate
   significant forest clearance, percent total organic carbon (\%TOC) is
   low due to accelerated erosion and dilution from mineral inputs to the
   lake, and carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios are consistent with increased
   productivity. At the conclusion of the agricultural period, delta
   C-13(TOC) and \%TOC indicate rapid forest recovery and reduced mineral
   inputs and C/N ratios suggest lower lake productivity. There is little
   between-core variation in the magnitude of the agricultural signal for
   the four cores taken near the shore, but these cores indicate different
   timing for the end of widespread agriculture in the watershed. Three of
   these four cores indicate nearly all agriculture ended by 1000 cal yr
   BP, but in the fourth core agricultural indicators persist until 675 cal
   yr BP. The core from the center of the lake shows a gradual decline in
   proxies indicating agriculture from 950 to 650 cal yr BP, which suggests
   sediment-reworking processes are integrating material from the entire
   basin as it is transported to the deeper portions of the lake.
   Differences between the records from the cores recovered near the shore
   illustrate the potential of multiple core studies to create spatially
   explicit paleoenvironmental reconstructions, while the delayed and less
   abrupt changes in the core from the center of the lake highlight the
   importance of sediment reworking of paleoenvironmental indicators.}},

Abstract = {{When larch (Larix spp.) is processed in the wood industry, the sawdust
   is currently disposed of as waste or used as combustible material, even
   though it is rich in biologically active compounds. In this study the
   effect of larch sawdust supplementation on blood parameters as well as
   milk composition was examined in healthy mid-lactating dairy cows.
   Twenty-four multiparous Italian Friesian dairy cows were assigned to
   groups receiving either 300 g/day/cow of larch sawdust or a control
   diet, and treatments were continued for a 20 day period.
   Milk parameters were unaffected by treatment. A lower plasma total
   protein concentration was observed and can be attributed to a decrease
   in globulin concentration. A lower plasma urea concentration was also
   detected in the larch group. Moreover, biomarkers of liver function were
   influenced by the treatment. Total bilirubin was lower in larch-treated
   animals, and cholesterol tended to be lower. In addition, an interaction
   between day and treatment was observed for very low density lipoprotein.
   The concentration of other parameters, including reactive oxygen
   metabolites, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and
   nitrotyrosine, did not differ between treatments. The observed benefits,
   together with the good palatability, make larch sawdust a promising
   candidate for the development of beneficial feed supplements for
   livestock. Further studies will be useful, particularly to evaluate its
   efficacy in different health conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Scholars have documented the emergence of apparently race-neutral
   discourses that serve to entrench racial stratification following the
   elimination of de jure segregation. These discourses deny the existence
   of both present-day racism and the contemporary effects of histories of
   racial oppression. Researchers posit that individuals are socialized
   into these views, but little empirical attention has been paid to the
   processes through which such socialization occurs. Focusing on the South
   African case study, I draw on five months of daily observations in
   seventeen 9th-grade history classrooms, content analysis of notes
   distributed in class, and 170 in-depth interviews with teachers and
   students to document how and why students are taught not to attend to
   the effects of apartheid on their society. To mitigate race-based
   conflict in their local school context, teachers told both sides of the
   story, highlighting that not all whites were perpetrators and not all
   blacks were victims. By decoupling the racialized coding of victims and
   perpetrators, and sidelining discussions of beneficiaries, teachers
   hindered students' abilities to make connections to the present. In
   outlining how and why individuals are taught about the irrelevance of
   the past, this study contributes to literatures on race, education,

Abstract = {{Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication requires reverse
   transcription of its RNA genome into a double-stranded cDNA copy, which
   is then integrated into the host cell chromosome. The essential steps of
   reverse transcription and integration are catalyzed by the viral enzymes
   reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN), respectively. In vitro,
   HIV-1 RT can bind with IN, and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of IN is
   necessary and sufficient for this binding. To better define the RT-IN
   interaction, we performed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
   experiments to map a binding surface on the IN CTD in the presence of RT
   prebound to a duplex DNA construct that mimics the primer-binding site
   in the HIV-1 genome. To determine the biological significance of the
   RT-IN interaction during viral replication, we used the NMR chemical
   shift mapping information as a guide to introduce single amino acid
   substitutions of nine different residues on the putative RT-binding
   surface in the IN CTD. We found that six viral clones bearing such IN
   substitutions (R231E, W243E, G247E, A248E, V250E, and I251E) were
   noninfectious. Further analyses of the replication-defective IN mutants
   indicated that the block in replication took place specifically during
   early reverse transcription. The recombinant INs purified from these
   mutants, though retaining enzymatic activities, had diminished ability
   to bind RT in a cosedimentation assay. The results indicate that the
   RT-IN interaction is functionally relevant during the reverse
   transcription step of the HIV-1 life cycle.
   IMPORTANCE
   To establish a productive infection, human immunodeficiency virus type 1
   (HIV-1) needs to reverse transcribe its RNA genome to create a
   double-stranded DNA copy and then integrate this viral DNA genome into
   the chromosome of the host cell. These two essential steps are catalyzed
   by the HIV-1 enzymes reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN),
   respectively. We have shown previously that IN physically interacts with
   RT, but the importance of this interaction during HIV-1 replication has
   not been fully characterized. In this study, we have established the
   biological significance of the HIV-1 RT-IN interaction during the viral
   life cycle by demonstrating that altering the RT-binding surface on IN
   disrupts both reverse transcription and viral replication. These
   findings contribute to our understanding of the RT-IN binding mechanism,
   as well as indicate that the RT-IN interaction can be exploited as a new
   antiviral drug target.}},

Title = {{Node Mobility Support Between Multi-hop 6LoWPAN Networks Based on Proxy
   Mobile IPv6}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) has seen rapidly advancing as it is
   emerging as next technology revolution. IPv6 over Low-power Wireless
   Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) plays a main communication interface in
   IoT since it is able to bridge the lightweight underlying IEEE 802.15.4
   protocols and IPv6. Proxy MIPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based localized
   mobility management which ideal for 6LoWPAN network because the mobile
   node in the PMIPv6 domain is not involved with IP mobility signalling.
   However, PMIPv6 is restricted to communicate in single hop network. It
   is impractical for 6LoWPAN network which is composed of low-power sensor
   nodes that have limited transmission power. In this paper, a new
   mobility support mechanism named the Sensor Prefix-Mapping Scheme
   (SP-MS) is proposed in the context of providing efficient node mobility
   support. The experiment is carried out by deploying two constrained
   6LoWPAN networks with Contiki Operating System and a PMIPv6 backhaul
   network with OpenAirInterface Proxy Mobile IPv6. The results proved the
   efficiency of proposed SP-MS; the 0.79 \% round-trip delay increment
   with increasing number of hops when all nodes are sending packets
   simultaneously is considered insignificant. Besides, the handoff
   components are optimized to outperform the previous MIPv6 implementation
   (Roth et al. in Proceedings of the 9th ACM symposium on performance
   evaluation of wireless ad hoc, sensor, and ubiquitous networks, pp.
   77-84, 2012) in term of inter-network handoff delay in one hop scenario.
   These findings suggest the efficiency of proposed SP-MS to support node
   mobility between multi-hop 6LoWPAN networks based on PMIPv6.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the relationship between giving and politics, and
   between distant causes and local concerns, by analyzing the award of the
   title ``Prince of the Land of Israel{''} to rabbis and leaders in
   Europe. Often awarded to men of standing and means, the title came with
   an expectation to deliver aid to the Holy Land in times of need.
   Although the title was held by different bearers throughout the
   seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries-often by more than one at a
   time-the most famous such ``prince{''} was David Oppenheim (1664-1736),
   chief rabbi of Prague and insatiable bibliophile. Oppenheim was singled
   out for this title owing to his place in a network of exchange that
   spanned Europe and the Mediterranean, and an examination of the
   expectations and actions associated with that position follows the
   circulation not only of people but also of money and goods, such as
   books. It allows us to investigate how both donors and recipients of
   charity engaged in such transactions to pursue particular ends,
   revealing the currency of symbolism underlying this economy of exchange.
   Finally, it seeks to understand the Land of Israel as a field for the
   interactions of discrete Jewish networks as they converged in a single
   space and to gauge the impact of that convergence.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, three methods are used to calibrate a grating-based
   Optical Spectrum Analyzer (OSA). The first method is used to calibrate
   OSA over the full spectral range by using a set of well characterized
   laser sources. These lasers, whose wavelengths cover OSA range, are well
   characterized using a highly accurate wavemeter. The Accuracy and
   stability for some lasers are found sufficient to calibrate OSA without
   the need to have an online measurement with a wavemeter. The second
   method uses the advantage of phase matching in non-linear crystals to
   generate frequency doubled light with exactly half the wavelength to
   measure OSA wavelength scale accuracy, resolution and linearity. In the
   third method, a Hydrogen Cyanide ((HCN)-C-13-N-14) gas cell -(HCN) is
   used as wavelength reference to calibrate OSA in the wavelength range
   1533-1557 nm.}},

Abstract = {{Tinea capitis is a common dermatophyte infection affecting scalp and
   hair of pre-pubertal children. With introduction of Griseofulvin in
   1958, there has been considerable improvement in the treatment of tinea
   capitis. A seven-year-old male child was brought to the dermatology
   clinic. He presented with diffuse white scaly patches of alopecia on
   scalp of one- year duration. The child was sent to the microbiology
   section of the National Health laboratory, Botswana for the collection
   of the samples. The samples consisted of scalp scrapings and few plucked
   hairs from the suspicious areas, which were collected by swab and
   scalpel blade methods. Potassium hydroxide (10\% KOH) mounts were
   prepared for scales and hair samples. Scales were positive for fungal
   elements and endothrix type of perforation was seen in hair. Cultures on
   Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) and Derm agar were incubated at 25
   degrees C, which yielded white variant of Trichophyton violaceum after
   two weeks of incubation. T. vioaceum (white variant) grew in all the
   plates. After six weeks of treatment with griseofulvin, the repeat
   culture grew only T. violaceum (violet strain). The child showed a
   definite clinical improvement.}},

Abstract = {{The study evaluates various sea surface temperature (SST) indices and
   their teleconnections with Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR)
   simulated by Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) coupled general
   circulation model (CGCM). The indices considered for evaluations are
   Nino indices (Nino 4, Nino 3.4, Nino 3 and Nino 1+2) of Pacific Ocean
   (PO) and Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) indices {[}eastern IO (IOD E),
   western IO (IODW) and dipole mode index (DMI)] of Indian Ocean (IO). The
   study has been carried out for the season June to September (JJAS) using
   JMA hindcast SST simulated on various initial conditions May, April,
   March and February (here after leads 0, 1, 2 and 3, respectively) during
   the period 1979-2010. The extended reconstructed SST (ERSST) from
   National Center for Environmental Prediction is used as observed SST.
   The important outcome of this study is that the inverse relationship
   between Nino 3.4 and ISMR is found to be re-established in recent years
   after a period of weakening. The JMA model is able to simulate the same
   with highest skill on lead 1. The PO SST characteristics including
   climatology, spatial anomaly pattern and interannual variability of Nino
   indices are well captured in the model lead 0 simulation (correlation
   coefficient is above 0.80). The model simulation on lead 0 is able to
   predict the El Nino Southern oscillation (ENSO) events during hindcast
   period with good skill. It is also noted from this study that the model
   skill to simulate PO SST characteristics is decreasing with increase of
   lead time. This study is also showing that the model has some deficiency
   to simulate IO SST characteristics. The model performance in the
   simulation of IOD events is not appreciable. Thus, this study is
   recommending JMA model as an efficient ENSO predicting tool, however the
   model requires improvements to predict IOD events.}},

Abstract = {{Background Lutetium-based scintillators with high-performance
   electronics introduced time-of-flight (TOF) reconstruction in the
   clinical setting. Let G be the total signal to noise ratio gain in a
   reconstructed image using the TOF kernel compared with conventional
   reconstruction modes. G is then the product of G(1) gain arising from
   the reconstruction process itself and (n-1) other gain factors
   (G(2),G(3),...G(n)) arising from the inherent properties of the
   detector.
   Methods We calculated G(2) and G(3) gains resulting from the
   optimization of the coincidence and energy window width for prompts and
   singles, respectively. Both quantitative and image-based validated Monte
   Carlo models of Lu2SiO5 (LSO) TOF-permitting and Bi4Ge3O12 (BGO)
   TOF-nonpermitting detectors were used for the calculations.
   Results G(2) and G(3) values were 1.05 and 1.08 for the BGO detector and
   G(3) was 1.07 for the LSO. A value of almost unity for G(2) of the LSO
   detector indicated a nonsignificant optimization by altering the energy
   window setting. G was found to be approximate to 1.4 times higher for
   the TOF-permitting detector after reconstruction and optimization of the
   coincidence and energy windows.
   Conclusion The method described could potentially predict image noise
   variations by altering detector acquisition parameters. It could also
   further contribute toward a long-lasting debate related to
   cost-efficiency issues of TOF scanners versus the non-TOF ones. Some
   vendors re-engage nowadays to non-TOF product line designs in an effort
   to reduce crystal costs. Therefore, exploring the limits of image
   quality gain by altering the parameters of these detectors remains a
   topical issue. Copyright (C) 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights

   environmental protection. Rhythmical massage using moor extract and
   oxalis ointment poultice to the abdomen are part of the tradition of
   Anthroposophic nursing when managing stress induced by emotional and
   physical trauma. An elderly lady with specific characteristics diagnosed
   as Broken Heart Syndrome received one treatment a week for 4 weeks given
   by an Anthroposophic nurse at an integrative medical center. Between
   treatments, education was given to enable self-treatment in the home.
   The nursing treatments, each using lavender footbaths, moor extract

Abstract = {{Apple volatile aroma depends of complex interaction among organic
   compounds. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of
   1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) application on volatile profile and quality
   on `Royal Gala' apples produced in Southern Brazil and stored under
   controlled atmosphere condition (CA; 1.0kPa O-2 + 1.2kPa CO2; 0.5+0.1
   degrees C; 94+1\% relative humidity). Volatile profile was determined
   after eight month of CA storage plus 7 days of shelf life via
   solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and analyzed by gas chromatography
   coupled to mass spectrometer. In the volatile profile were identified 8
   esters, 11 alcohols, 6 aldehydes, 6 acids, 2 ketones, 1 ether and 1
   terpene. 1-MCP application reduced significantly the main volatile
   compounds production by `Royal Gala' apples produced in Southern Brazil.
   Its application decreases significantly the esters production,
   especially 2-methyl-butyl acetate and hexyl acetate, compared to `Royal
   Gala' apples storage under CA. 1-methylcyclopropene application decrease
   ethylene production and respiration rate. Apples treated with 1-MCP
   exhibit higher hexanal and 2(E)-hexenal production.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate the adjuvant effect of the B
   subunits of cholera toxin (CT) and the thermolabile enterotoxin of
   Escherichia coli (LT) by the intrarectal route of immunization and
   compare them to the whole molecules CT and LT-R192G, a non toxic mutant
   of LT, using 2/6-VLP as an antigen, in mice.
   All molecules induced similar antigen specific antibody titers in serum
   and feces, whereas different T cell profiles were observed. CTB and LTB,
   conversely to Cl' and LT-R192G, did not induce detectable production of
   IL-2 by antigen specific T cells. Moreover, CTB, conversely to LT-R192G,
   Cl' and LTB, did not induce antigen specific CD4+CD25+Foxp3- and Foxp3+
   T cells, thus showing different effects between the B subunits
   themselves. However, all molecules induced an antigen specific Th17
   response. In conclusion, B subunits are potent adjuvants on B cell
   responses by the intrarectal route. Although their impact on T cell
   responses are different, all molecules induce a 2/6-VLP-specific Th17 T
   cell response that may play a major role in helping B cell responses and
   thus in adjuvanticity and protection. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{173-189}},

Abstract = {{In competitive endurance sport, athletes permanently regulate their
   performance to achieve the best result without threatening organismic
   integrity. This conscious and subconscious allocation of energy reserves
   in relation to an endpoint is termed pacing and depends on
   sport-specific experience as well as on the perception and the effects
   of fatigue. Pacing can be visualized as the profile of performance or
   speed over the distance of a competition and is subject to multiple
   influencing factors. Following a short description of the foundations,
   fatigue mechanisms, models of pacing and methods to analyze pacing, the
   present non-systematic review explores the potential influence of
   athletic performance, gender and various competitive and environmental
   conditions on the pacing behavior of recreational and competitive
   athletes in endurance sports competition. Of the 157 studies identified
   initially, 17 studies were included most of which focused on pacing in
   runners and cyclists. Factors correlated to pacing patterns include, but
   are not limited to, the kind of locomotion, the round of competition and
   the criteria for competitive success. Athletes on a higher level of
   performance and women show a more even pacing than athletes on a lower
   level of performance and men. In high ambient temperatures, the pacing
   pattern is more positive. Most changes of pacing behavior associated
   with these factors also correlate with changes in competitive
   performance or time. When compared with models of successful pacing and
   with recommendations from exercise physiology, the present results
   indicate the potential to improve pacing behavior and offer evidence to
   coaches and athletes for training and preparation of competition.
   However, the pacing strategies recommended in the literature and the
   changes in pacing behavior associated with the factors mentioned, can
   presumably be generalized to a limited extent only.}},

Abstract = {{Though it is debatable whether the number of persons in the United
   States who `believe' in something spiritual has declined, there is no
   doubt that the social authority of religious organizations has declined.
   Further, when people do hold explicit religious beliefs, they now tend
   to be asked to keep such to themselves, for the sake of manners or the
   `rights' of others to `freedom from religion.' Thus, at the end of
   Christendom, due to religious privatization and institutional
   marginalization, the legitimacy of Christian language and concepts in
   bioethical discourse is increasingly denied. Christians, therefore, must
   be able to explain (1) that their values are based on faith, (2) but
   that does not preclude the translation of those values in ways that
   allow cooperation with others, (3) though some beliefs will lead to
   conflict given the increasing denial of the intrinsic value of human
   life. The history of the secularization of bioethics is outlined, and
   the basis for cooperation between Christians and non-Christians
   described, even as the former maintain their distinct communities and

Abstract = {{Global momentum around women's, children's, and adolescents' health,
   coupled with the ambitious and equalizing agenda of the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs), has exposed a tension between the need for
   comprehensive, multi-actor, rights-based approaches that seek to ``close
   the gaps{''} and a growing economic and political imperative to
   demonstrate efficiency, effectiveness, and returns on specific
   investments. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a framework
   to measure ``results{''} in a way that offers a more nuanced
   understanding of the impact of human rights-based approaches and their
   complexity, as well as their contextual, multi-sectoral, and evolving
   nature. We argue that the impact of human rights-based approaches is
   best measured across a spectrum of change-at the individual,
   programmatic, structural, and societal levels. Such an analysis would
   allow for more accurate assessments of the cumulative effect of these
   changes. The paper also underscores the long-overdue need to better
   define the parameters of a human rights-based approach to health. This
   is an important part of the research agenda on human rights and health
   in the context of the SDGs and the Global Strategy for Women's,
   Children's and Adolescents' Health, and amid calls for better
   measurement and greater accountability for resources, results, and
   rights at all levels. While this paper focuses on women's, children's,
   and adolescents' health, the proposed framework can apply as readily to
   other areas of health and provides a new frame of reference for
   assessing the impact of human rights-based approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorouracil (5-FU; Adrucil (R)) is a pyrimidine analog antineoplastic
   chemotherapy agent which works by interfering with DNA and RNA
   synthesis. It has an uncommon toxicity called hyperammonemic
   encephalopathy. This neurotoxicity is associated with a high-dose
   administration of 5-FU (2,600 mg/m(2)/week), with an incidence rate of
   5.7\%, and is not normally seen with the current dose of 1,200 mg/m(2)
   infused over 46 h. The mechanism behind this neurotoxicity is not known
   but is possibly due to accumulation of fluorocitrate, a byproduct of
   5-FU metabolism. This byproduct inhibits the Krebs cycle, which causes
   impairment of the adenosine triphosphate-dependent urea cycle. By
   impairing this cycle, ammonia is not converted to urea, which in turn
   this leads to an accumulation of ammonia. The accumulated ammonia in the
   brain is metabolized to glutamine, which has been suggested to cause an
   increase in intracranial pressure and cerebral edema. This case report
   discusses how a 40-year-old male with colorectal cancer experienced
   5FU-induced hyperammonemia and was treated for it and how reducing the
   dose by 50\% led to resolution of this symptom from reoccurring.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To provide a contemporary estimate of singleton neonatal
   mortality based on birthweight and gestational age at delivery from 2001
   to 2010, and to compare this with a similar data set from 1985 to 1994.
   Study design: Record linkage of maternity data and neonatal mortality
   data. Population: All singleton preterm deliveries from 24 to 36 weeks
   inclusive between 2001 and 2010.
   Setting: Scotland, UK.
   Methods: NHS National Services Scotland uses a standardized maternity
   discharge record to collect details of maternities in Scotland. These
   delivery records were linked to the infant death files from the National
   Records of Scotland. Main outcome measure: Neonatal death.
   Results: Between 2001 and 2010 there were 525,997 liveborn singleton
   deliveries of which 31,280 were preterm (5.95\%). In this preterm group
   the neonatal mortality rate was 18.2/1000, a significant reduction from
   41.3/1000 in 1985-1994 (P <0.001). The neonatal mortality rate fell with
   advancing gestation from 451/1000 at 24 weeks to 2.74/1000 at 36 weeks.
   Conclusions: This is the largest recent study to use both birthweight
   and gestational age at delivery to consider neonatal mortality. These
   data will aid the management and prognostic guidance of preterm
   delivery. (C) 2015 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by

Abstract = {{Given recent debates and reinterpretation of large-scale shell deposits
   as monuments rather than midden in the emerging dialogue in world
   archaeology regarding shell sites, we need better quantitative
   assessments of the temporality of shell deposit formation. Here we
   couple Bayesian analysis of radiocarbon dates with the results from our
   study of shell isotopes from C. virginica from the Crystal River and the
   Roberts Island Shell Mound Complex, neighboring and temporally
   overlapping shell mound sites on the central Gulf Coast of Florida.
   Linking these two lines of data is a new methodological approach which
   provides a more detailed understanding of the temporality of traditions.
   The results indicate that midden accumulation occurred throughout the
   year in the later phases of occupation at both sites. In contrast,
   oyster from mound deposits appears to indicate season of collection
   predominately during the colder months of the year This contrast between
   mound and midden season of collection suggests that episodes of feasting
   and associated monument construction may have been of relatively limited
   temporal duration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, I consider the ideologies that emerge when disability
   and LGBTQ rights advocates' ubiquitous calls for visibility collide. I
   argue that contemporary visibility politics encourage the production of
   post-racial and post-spatial ideologies. In demanding visibility,
   disability and LGBTQ rights advocates ignore, ironically, visible
   markers of (racial) difference and assume that being ``out, loud, and
   proud{''} is desirable trans-geographically. I bring together disability
   studies and queer rural studies-fields that have engaged in remarkably
   little dialogue-to analyze activist calls for LGBTQ and disability
   visibility. The discourses evident in such calls transcend movements and
   virtual spaces and emerge as some of the LGBTQ women in the rural
   Midwest whom I interviewed discuss their relations to (their own and
   others') LGBTQ sexuality and disability. I analyze several cases to
   illustrate how visibility discourses compel the erasure of material
   bodies, and in the process, render certain (spatialized and racialized)
   experiences obsolete. I close by considering how my critique of
   visibility discourses might influence critical discussions of identity
   politics more broadly.}},

   study}},
Journal = {{BMC SPORTS SCIENCE MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Background: Massage is often applied with the intention of improving
   flexibility or reducing stiffness in musculotendinous tissue. There is,
   however, a lack of supporting evidence that such mechanical effects
   occur. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of massage
   on the passive mechanical properties of the calf muscle complex.
   Methods: Twenty nine healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 45 years of
   age had their calf muscle compliance and ankle joint dorsiflexion range
   of motion (ROM) measured using an instrumented footplate before,
   immediately and 30 minutes after a ten minute application of deep
   massage or superficial heating to the calf muscle complex. Repeated
   measures analysis of variance was used to determine differences between
   testing sessions and the types of intervention. Reliability testing for
   the measurement method was conducted using analysis of variance both
   within and between testing sessions.
   Results: There was no significant change in calf muscle stiffness or
   ankle dorsiflexion range of motion with or without the application of
   calf massage. Inter-and intra-session reliability were very high, ICC >
   0.88 (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Although individuals' perception of a change in tissue
   characteristics following massage has been reported, there was no
   evidence that soft tissue massage led to a change in the passive
   mechanical properties of the calf muscle complex. The findings of this
   study suggest that the use of massage to increase tissue flexibility
   prior to activity is not justified.}},

Abstract = {{Proponents of ``green and clean{''} fuel argue that land acquisitions
   for biofuel development could result in significant economic benefits,

   minimal negative impacts on the environment. With a dominant focus on
   these purported benefits, comparatively little attention has been given
   to the processes and impacts of land acquisitions on the local people

   bio-ethanol development in Chisumbanje, Zimbabwe, this paper assesses
   the processes and local livelihood implications of land acquisitions for
   biofuel development and considers who is likely to bear the costs. Our
   findings show that local communities felt they were not consulted in the
   land acquisition process and despite the promises of local livelihood
   enhancement from biofuel development, displaced households (farmers)
   perceived that the costs incurred from biofuel development were more

Abstract = {{beta-Thalassemia, a hereditary anemic disorder, is often associated with
   skeletal complications that can be found in both males and females. The
   present study aimed to investigate the age-and sex-dependent changes in
   bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular microstructure in
   beta(IVSII-654) knockin thalassemic mice. Dual-energy X-ray
   absorptiometry and computer-assisted bone histomorphometry were employed
   to investigate temporal changes in BMD and histomorphometric parameters
   in male and female mice of a beta(IVSII-654) knockin mouse model of
   human beta-thalassemia, in which impaired splicing of beta-globin
   transcript was caused by hemizygous C -> T mutation at nucleotide 654 of
   intron 2. Young, growing beta(IVSII-654) mice (1 mo old) manifested
   shorter bone length and lower BMD than their wild-type littermates,
   indicating possible growth retardation and osteopenia, the latter of
   which persisted until 8 mo of age (adult mice). Interestingly, two-way
   analysis of variance suggested an interaction between sex and
   beta(IVSII-654) genotype, i.e., more severe osteopenia in adult female
   mice. Bone histomorphometry further suggested that low trabecular bone
   volume in male beta(IVSII-654) mice, particularly during a growing
   period (1-2 mo), was primarily due to suppression of bone formation,
   whereas both a low bone formation rate and a marked increase in
   osteoclast surface were observed in female beta(IVSII-654) mice. In
   conclusion, osteopenia and trabecular microstructural defects were
   present in both male and female beta(IVSII-654) knockin thalassemic
   mice, but the severity, disease progression, and cellular mechanism
   differed between the sexes.}},

Abstract = {{Encoding properties of sensory neurons are commonly modeled using linear
   finite impulse response (FIR) filters. For the auditory system, the FIR
   filter is instantiated in the spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF),
   often in the framework of the generalized linear model. Despite
   widespread use of the FIR STRF, numerous formulations for linear filters
   are possible that require many fewer parameters, potentially permitting
   more efficient and accurate model estimates. To explore these
   alternative STRF architectures, we recorded single-unit neural activity
   from auditory cortex of awake ferrets during presentation of natural
   sound stimuli. We compared performance of > 1000 linear STRF
   architectures, evaluating their ability to predict neural responses to a
   novel natural stimulus. Many were able to outperform the FIR filter. Two
   basic constraints on the architecture lead to the improved performance:
   (1) factorization of the STRF matrix into a small number of spectral and
   temporal filters and (2) low-dimensional parameterization of the
   factorized filters. The best parameterized model was able to outperform
   the full FIR filter in both primary and secondary auditory cortex,
   despite requiring fewer than 30 parameters, about 10\% of the number
   required by the FIR filter. After accounting for noise from finite data
   sampling, these STRFs were able to explain an average of 40\% of A1
   response variance. The simpler models permitted more straightforward
   interpretation of sensory tuning properties. They also showed greater
   benefit from incorporating nonlinear terms, such as short term
   plasticity, that provide theoretical advances over the linear model.
   Architectures that minimize parameter count while maintaining maximum
   predictive power provide insight into the essential degrees of freedom
   governing auditory cortical function. They also maximize statistical
   power available for characterizing additional nonlinear properties that
   limit current auditory models.}},

Abstract = {{Like other contemporary ``fundamentalist{''} communities, Nigerian
   Salafis have proven adept at transmitting messages and winning followers
   through electronic media. This article argues that Nigerian Salafis
   pursue an ideal of electronic media as spaces where an intellectual
   meritocracy, based on the ability to deploy proof-texts, can flourish.
   This ideal derives from Salafi conceptions of religious knowledge and
   draws its impetus from Nigerian Salafis' status as a minority that faces
   political and theological opponents with greater institutional power.
   Salafis engage media in an attempt to level the playing field. They work
   strategically with religious knowledge: they extend the status of
   proof-texts to media other than scripture, and they present messages in
   locally resonant idioms. Nigerian Salafis exemplify one way in which
   religious communities seek to manage new media spaces where the meaning
   of texts, the boundary between public and private, and the nature of
   religious authority are questioned and transformed.}},

Title = {{An adult osteopetrosis model in medaka reveals the importance of
   osteoclast function for bone remodeling in teleost fish}},

Abstract = {{Osteoclasts play important roles during bone growth and in maintaining
   bone health and bone homeostasis. Dysfunction or lack of osteoclasts
   leads to increased bone mass and osteopetrosis phenotypes in mouse and
   human. Here we report a severe osteopetrosis-like phenotype in
   transgenic medaka fish, in which membrane bound EGFP (mEGFP) was
   expressed in osteoclasts under control of the cathepsin K promoter
   (ctsk:mEGFP). In contrast to reporter lines with GFP expression in the
   cytoplasm of osteoclasts, adult fish of the mEGFP line developed bone
   defects indicative for an osteoclast dysfunction. Activity of
   tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) was down-regulated and excess
   bone was observed in most parts of the skeleton. The osteopetrotic
   phenotype was particularly obvious at the neural and haemal arches that
   failed to increase their volume in growing fish. Excess bone caused
   severe constriction of the spinal cord and the ventral aorta. The
   continuation of tooth development and the failure to shed teeth resulted
   in severe hyperdontia. Interestingly, at the vertebral column vertebral
   body arches displayed a severe osteopetrosis, while vertebral centra had
   no or only a mild osteopetrotic phenotype. This confirms previous
   reports from cichlids that, different from the arches, allometric growth
   of fish vertebral centra initially does not depend on the action of
   osteoclasts. Independent developmental mechanism that shapes arches and
   vertebral centra can also lend support to the hypothesis that vertebral
   centra and arches function as independent developmental modules.
   Together, this medaka osteopetrosis model confirms the importance of
   proper osteoclast function during normal skeletal development in teleost
   fish that requires bone modeling and remodeling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Rapid capacity fading is one of the major obstacles that seriously

   Compositing SnO2 with carbon to form SnO2/carbon composites with

   Herein, an interestingly interconnected quasi-ball-in-ball nanostructure
   SnO2/carbon composite, denoted as Cs@void@SnO2@C, has been successfully
   fabricated by a simple and novel strategy. When used as anode materials
   for lithium-ion batteries, the Cs@void@SnO2@C exhibits high lithium

   of 793.7 mAh g(-1) after 450 cycles at 200 mA g(-1), and a reversible
   capacity of 486.3 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles even at 1000 mA g(-1). The

Abstract = {{Thyroid nodules are relatively more prevalent in iodine-deficiency area,
   and the incidence increased sharply in the past decade in these areas.
   Workup of malignant from benign nodules in clinic was the main problem
   for managing thyroid nodules.
   An overall search for the articles about the diagnostic performance of
   real/time elastography (RTE) and shear wave elastography (SWE) before
   April 2015 in the databases of PubMed, Embase, and Google scholar. The
   pooled sensitivity, specificity, and summary receiver operating
   characteristic (SROC) curve were obtained from individual studies with a
   random-effects model. Subgroup and meta-regression analysis were also
   performed.
   Fifty-six studies involved in 2621 malignant nodules and 7380 benign
   nodules were contained in our meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and
   specificity of RTE was 83.0\% and 81.2\%, which is higher than SWE
   (sensitivity: 78.7\%, specificity: 80.5\%). The areas under the SROC
   curve of RTE and SWE were 0.885 and 0.842 respectively. RTE had higher
   diagnostic value for Caucasians than Asians. Stran ratio (SR) assessment
   had higher diagnostic performance than elasticity score (ES) system.
   Similarly, it had higher diagnostic value when malignant nodules were
   more than 50.
   In summary, the results revealed that RTE had higher diagnostic
   performance than SWE in differentiating malignant from benign nodules.
   However, future international multicenter studies in the region of
   thyroid risk need to further assess the diagnostic performance of RTE.}},

Abstract = {{Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been demonstrated as an
   efficient tool for elemental analyses of transparent dielectric
   materials such as glasses or crystals for more than ten years. The
   induced plasma is however much less studied compared to that induced on
   the surface of a metal. The purpose of this work is therefore to
   characterize the plasma induced on the surface of a glass sample for
   analytical purpose as a function of the ablation laser wavelength,
   infrared (IR) or ultraviolet (UV), and the ambient gas, air or argon.
   The surface damage of the samples was also observed for ablation with IR
   or UV laser pulse when the sample was a float glass or a frosted one.
   Optimized ablation fluence was then determined. The morphology of the
   plasma was observed with time-resolved spectroscopic imaging, while the
   profiles of the electron density and temperature were extracted from
   time- and space-resolved emission spectroscopy. The analytical
   performance of the plasmas was then studied in terms of the
   signal-to-noise ratio for several emission lines from some minor
   elements, Al, Fe, contained in glasses, and of the behavior of
   self-absorption for another minor element, Ca, in the different ablation
   conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The major active constituents from Amaryllidaceae family were reported
   to be Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (AAs), which exhibited a wide spectrum of
   biological activities, such as anti-tumor, anti-viral, and
   acetyl-cholinesterase-inhibitory activities. In order to better
   understand their potential as a source of bioactive AAs and the
   phytochemical variations among three different species of Lycoris herbs,
   the HPLC fingerprint profiles of Lycorisaurea (L. aurea), L. radiata,
   and L. guangxiensis were firstly determined and compared using LC-UV and
   LC-MS/MS. As a result, 39 peaks were resolved and identified as AAs, of
   which nine peaks were found in common for all these three species, while
   the other 30 peaks could be revealed as characteristic AAs for L. aurea,
   L. radiata and L. guangxiensis, respectively. Thus, these AAs can be
   used as chemical markers for the identification and quality control of
   these plant species. To further reveal correlations between chemical
   components and their pharmaceutical activities of these species at the
   molecular level, the bioactivities of the total AAs from the three plant
   species were also tested against HepG2 cells with the inhibitory rate at
   78.02\%, 84.91\% and 66.81\% for L. aurea, L. radiata and L.
   guangxiensis, respectively. This study firstly revealed that the three
   species under investigation were different not only in the types of AAs,
   but also in their contents, and both contributed to their
   pharmacological distinctions. To the best of our knowledge, the current
   research provides the most detailed phytochemical profiles of AAs in
   these species, and offers valuable information for future valuation and
   exploitation of these medicinal plants.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. Primary: To report a research protocol to analyse the relationship
   between the degree of heart failure and the health-related quality of
   life of patients and their family caregivers. Secondary: To identify the
   characteristics of heart failure patients and their caregivers and the
   association between these characteristics and hospital admissions.
   Moreover, to conduct a longitudinal analysis of the relationship between
   patients' and that of their family caregivers.
   Background. As heart failure progresses, it reduces the patient's
   quality of life and progressive functional deterioration requires
   hospital admission and the provision of healthcare resources. The
   availability of a family caregiver is a key element in addressing and
   managing this healthcare problem and some research results have
   associated this factor with the prognosis for heart failure.
   Design. Multicentre cohort nested case-control study.
   Methods. Exploratory analysis: Descriptive statistics, measures of
   central tendency and dispersion or percentages. Bivariate analysis:
   Using Student's t-test and chi-square test, ANOVA and non-parametric
   tests. Survival analysis: Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariate analysis:
   Cox's proportional hazards model. All calculations performed with an
   alpha level of 0.05.
   Discussion. Lack of family support for patients with HF or greater
   duration of care is associated with more hospitalizations and increased
   depression among caregivers. Further longitudinal studies with a large
   population sample are required.}},

Abstract = {{Strain RIPI 110(T) was isolated from a soil sample collected from an
   oil-contaminated site on Siri Island, Persian Gulf, Iran. Cells of the
   novel isolate were Gram-stain-negative, facultatively anaerobic,
   non-motile and rod-shaped. Cells divided asymmetrically by budding and
   formed rosette-like clusters. The optimum pH and temperature for growth
   were pH 7 and 30 degrees C, while the strain was able to grow at pH
   5.5-8 and 15-35 degrees C. Strain RIPI 110(T) utilized only complex
   carbon sources and pyruvate as the sole carbon source and could not grow
   under photoautotrophic conditions. The highest 16S rRNA gene sequence
   similarities, 93.9, 93.9 and 93.5 \%, were obtained with Variibacter
   gotjawalensis GJW-30(T), Rhodoplanes roseus 941(T) and Rhodoplanes
   elegans AS130(T), respectively. The major cellular fatty acids were
   summed feature 8 (C-18 : 1 omega 7c/omega 6c), C-16 : (0) and C-19 : 0
   cyclo omega 8c. Polar lipid analyses revealed that strain RIPI 110(T)
   contained phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol,
   phosphatidylglycerol, an unknown aminophospholipid and four unknown
   phospholipids. Ubiquinone-10 was the predominant quinone component. The
   DNA G+C content was 59.4 mol\%. On the basis of the 16S rRNA gene
   sequence analysis, in combination with chemotaxonomic and physiological
   data, the novel isolate could not be classified in any recognized
   genera. Strain RIPI 110(T) is thus considered to represent a novel
   species of a new genus within the order Rhizobiales, for which the name
   Pseudorhodoplanes sinuspersici gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type
   strain of the type species is RIPI 110(T) (=IBRC-M 10770(T)=CECT
   8374(T)).}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Raspberry plants, belonging to the species of Rubus idaeus,
   are known for their excellent therapeutic properties as they are
   particularly rich in compounds with strong antioxidant activity, which
   promote health and well-being of human cells. Besides their high content
   of phenolic compounds, Rubus plants are rich in oil-soluble compounds,
   which are also primary components of the hydrolipidic film barrier of
   the skin. As plant cell cultures represented a valuable system to
   produce interesting compounds and ingredients for cosmetic applications,
   we developed liquid suspension cultures from Rubus idaeus leaves and
   used them to obtain an active ingredient aimed at improving hydration
   and moisturization capacity in the skin.
   METHODS: Rubus idaeus cells, grown in the laboratory under sterile and
   controlled conditions as liquid suspension cultures, were processed to
   obtain an oil-soluble (liposoluble) extract, containing phenolic
   compounds and a wide range of fatty acids. The extract was tested on
   cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts and then on the skin invivo, to
   assess its cosmetic activities.
   RESULTS: When tested on skin cell cultures, the extract induced the
   genes responsible for skin hydration, such as aquaporin 3, filaggrin,
   involucrin and hyaluronic acid synthase, and stimulated the expression
   and the activity of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, involved in ceramide
   production. Moreover, the liposoluble extract increased the synthesis of
   the extracellular matrix components in cultured fibroblasts and showed a
   remarkable skin-hydrating capacity when tested on human skin invivo.
   CONCLUSIONS: Thanks to these activities, the Rubus idaeus liposoluble
   extract has several potential applications in skin care cosmetics: it
   can be used as hydrating and moisturizing ingredient in face and body
   lotions, and as anti-ageing product in face creams specifically designed
   to fight wrinkle formation.}},

Abstract = {{Picosecond blue-light induced infrared absorption (BLIIRA) was
   investigated in periodically poled KTiOPO4, Rb:KTiOPO4, RbTiOPO4,
   KTiOAsO4 and RbTiOAsO4. The dependence of BLIIRA on blue light average
   power and intensity as well as on crystal temperature was studied. The
   results show the presence of at least two different types of color
   centers. A higher level of remnant absorption was observed in the
   phosphates compared to the arsenates. We attribute the largest portion
   of the induced absorption to photo-generated electrons and holes
   self-trapped in the proximity to Ti4+ and O2- ions, respectively,
   forming polaron color centers. Stabilization of these centers is aided
   by the presence of mobile alkali metal vacancies in the crystal. The
   lower level of remnant absorption in arsenates is related to higher
   population of thermal phonons related to TiO6 group vibrations in
   arsenates. (C)2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we perform a consistency investigation for the
   initialization of Monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
   filters by utilizing an existing closed-form solution for metric
   velocity, landmark distance and attitude determination. This closed-form
   solution offers a consistent initial estimate for the state as well as
   the covariance of the considered system. The resulting initialization
   equations solely rely on monocular images and measurements of an
   inertial measurement unit (IMU) with 9 degrees of freedom. Furthermore
   they do not require any prior knowledge or assumptions about the
   estimates or the surrounding static environment. Based on these
   analytical expressions, we will derive conditions which are required in
   order to gain consistent initial estimates. The actual consistency, the
   accuracy of the initial state and the properties of the initial
   covariance will then be discussed thoroughly on the basis of simulated
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The last 25 years have been in many Polish cities a period of intensive
   modernization and renewals of the existing public spaces. Most of all
   the resurfacing of the pavement and changing of street furniture have
   been held. In many cases, the transformations in the urban areas were
   integrated with exclusion from traffic. The question arises what
   criteria architects or landscape architects follow and what design
   solutions apply. It is also interesting how the new shape of the floor
   in public spaces (understood here as a pavement and street furniture
   together) can help to create integrating and activating space for
   residents. And how it can affect the quality of life in a wider area.
   This article attempts to answer these questions based on new solutions

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown benefit not only from postoperative
   chemotherapy but also from a short interval to initiation of treatment
   after resection of primary colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was
   to determine difference in timing to postoperative chemotherapy for
   minimally invasive resection (MIR) vs. open resection (OR) of colorectal
   cancer liver metastases (CRCLM).
   This is a retrospective review of 1:1 matched patients undergoing MIR (n
   = 66) and OR (n = 66) for CRCLM at a single institution.
   Patients undergoing MIR of CRCLM had significantly shorter length of
   hospital stay, fewer major complications, and shorter interval to
   postoperative chemotherapy (median 42 vs. 63 days, p < 0.001).
   Univariable analysis showed that surgical approach, postoperative
   complications, blood loss, number of lesions, and length of stay were
   associated with timing to chemotherapy. On multivariable analysis,
   surgical approach was still associated with timing to chemotherapy, and
   postoperative complications resulted in a delay of chemotherapy among
   patients who underwent OR but not among those who underwent MIR. In
   addition, worse disease-free survival was seen among patients who
   received postoperative chemotherapy more than 60 days after surgery.
   By modifying the deleterious effects of postoperative complications on
   timing of postoperative chemotherapy, patients undergoing MIR for CRCLM
   are treated with chemotherapy sooner after surgery compared to those
   undergoing OR.}},

Abstract = {{Natural gas-fueled combined cycle (NGCC) allows to reach the best
   performance among power plants fed by fossil fuels, but causes
   considerable CO2 emissions. With the aim of reducing greenhouse gases
   impact, NGCC could be integrated with post-combustion CO2 removal
   systems, typically based on chemical solvents like amines, that cause
   very large net efficiency penalties (about 9-12 percentage points at
   90\% overall CO2 capture). To reduce these high capture penalties,
   exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) has been studied. To further enhance the
   overall plant efficiency, the recovery of available low temperature heat
   from the solvent-based CO2 removal systems could be also performed. Low
   temperature heat is available in flue gas coolers (80-100 degrees C), in
   the amine reboiler water cooling (130-140 degrees C) and in the splitter
   condenser (100-130 degrees C). This waste thermal energy could be
   recovered by means of an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) that is able to
   convert heat into electricity efficiently even at comparably low
   temperatures. N-Butane was found to be as the most promising organic
   working fluid for the cycle operating temperatures and pressures. ORC
   produces additional electrical power improving the global performance of
   the power plant, for example, up to 1-1.5 percentage points in
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Today we speak about education that would, in a, new. humanistic spirit,
   form cultural capacities of modern man in respect with the rising
   demands brought by his life in the time of digital media. It reveals
   that such education is confronted with the risk of, intertechnicism. and
   deficiency, or loss of the virtue of, understanding. in modern man and
   the phenomenon of, self-promoting. of today's digital media. In relation
   to these, modern education should promote more emphasis on development
   and forming of thinking, concentrating also on relevant, value and
   moral-based ideas or understanding.. We speak about creative and
   critical thinking that sets a reflective attitude of human towards his,
   Me., towards his experience and cognisance, today especially in the
   context of digital media. It is Philosophy that seems to be, in this
   respect, a significant educational factor that co-forms a rationally
   thinking,, wise. human being who is not a slave to the modern digital
   media and flood of information, but a self-confident, free and
   responsible individuality standing in a partnership with them. We also
   speak about the importance of Philosophy in, media education. that
   understands critical thinking as the key media competence and,
   ultimately, creative and critical usage of media with emphasis on moral
   aspects, especially on responsibility ethos.}},

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) production is diminished in many patients with
   cardiovascular and renal disease. Asymmetric dinnethylarginine (ADMA) is
   an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthesis, and elevated plasma levels of
   ADMA are associated with poor outcomes. Dimethylarginine
   dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH1) is a methylarginine-metabolizing enzyme
   that reduces ADMA levels. We reported previously that a DDAH1 gene
   variant associated with increased renal DDAH1 mRNA transcription and
   lower plasma ADMA levels, but counterintuitively, a steeper rate of
   renal function decline. Here, we test the hypothesis that reduced
   renal-specific ADMA metabolism protects against progressive renal
   damage. Renal DDAH1 is expressed predominately within the proximal
   tubule. A novel proximal tubule-specific Ddah1 knockout (Ddahl(PT-1-))
   mouse demonstrated tubular cell accumulation of ADMA and lower NO
   concentrations, but unaltered plasma ADMA concentrations. Ddahl(PT-/-)
   mice were protected from reduced kidney tissue mass, collagen
   deposition, and profibrotic cytokine expression in two independent renal
   injury models: folate nephropathy and unilateral ureteric obstruction.
   Furthermore, a study of two independent kidney transplant cohorts
   revealed higher levels of human renal allograft
   methylarginine-metabolizing enzyme gene expression associated with
   steeper function decline. We also report an association among DDAH1
   expression, NO activity, and uromodulin expression supported by data
   from both animal and human studies, raising the possibility that kidney
   DDAH1 expression exacerbates renal injury through uromodulin-related
   mechanisms. Together, these data demonstrate that reduced renal tubular
   ADMA metabolism protects against progressive kidney function decline.
   Thus, circulating ADMA may be an imprecise marker of renal
   methylarginine metabolism, and therapeutic ADMA reduction may even be
   deleterious to kidney function.}},

Abstract = {{Clear cell follicular carcinoma is a rare type of thyroid cancer and
   some with aggressive biological behavior. The cytoplasmic clearing of
   the neoplastic cells has been attributed to the accumulation of various
   substances, such as glycogen, lipid, mucin, and thyroglobulin, or
   distension of mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum. However, the
   molecular mechanisms responsible for the characteristic appearance of
   the cell cytoplasm and the biological behavior remain unknown. We report
   here a case of aggressive clear cell follicular carcinoma of the thyroid
   with molecular profile using targeted next generation sequencing (NGS)
   that presented as a metastatic tumor in a woman with a history of breast
   carcinoma. The NGS data revealed the coexisting of a well-characterized
   loss-of-function TP53 R248Q mutation and a putative gain-of-function
   mutation of TSHR L272V, which was suggested by the overexpression of
   thyroglobulin and SLC5A5 (NIS) genes in this tumor. TP53 mutations are
   usually related with dedifferentiation, progression, and metastasis of
   thyroid carcinomas. Identification of TP53 R248Q in this tumor
   correlated with its aggressive clinical behavior. Gain-of-function
   mutation of TSHR can overstimulate the thyroid follicular cells as the
   elevated level of TSH does and might have contributed to the development
   of clear cell morphology in this tumor. This report represents the first
   case of clear cell follicular carcinoma of the thyroid with NGS analysis
   and more molecular characterization is needed to elucidate the
   pathogenesis and provide more prognosis-relevant information for this
   uncommon variant of thyroid carcinomas.}},

   understanding is an important cognitive state that philosophers should
   seek to analyse. This paper offers a new perspective on understanding by
   looking to work in philosophy of mind and cognitive science.
   Understanding is normally taken to be inside the head. I argue that this
   view is mistaken. Often, understanding is a state that criss-crosses
   brain, body and world. To support this claim, I draw on extended
   cognition, a burgeoning framework in cognitive science that stresses the
   crucial role played by tools, material representations and the wider
   environment in our cognitive processes. I defend an extended view of
   understanding against likely objections and argue that it has important
   consequences for questions concerning the nature of understanding and
   its relationship to explanation.}},

Abstract = {{Intergenerational mobilitythe association between parents' and adult
   children's economic wellbeingis an important sociological concept
   because it provides information about inequality of opportunity in
   society, and it has gained relevance in the recent past due to the
   increase economic inequality in most of the affluent world. This article
   provides an overview of the different measures of mobility used by
   sociologists and economists, as well as main empirical findings about
   mobility. I then move to topics that push mobility analysis beyond its
   bivariate focus: The association between intergenerational mobility and
   economic inequality, the mechanisms for mobility, and the validity of
   mobility as a measure of inequality of opportunity. I suggest that the
   association between mobility and inequality is likely spurious, driven
   by varying institutional arrangements across countries, and that
   mobility analysis is most useful when focused on describing the
   bivariate intergenerational association across countries and over time.
   Resume La mobilite intergenerationnelle - l'association entre le
   bien-etre economique des parents et celui de leurs enfants devenus
   adultes - est un concept sociologique important dans la mesure oU il
   fournit une information sur l'inegalite des chances en societe. Il fait
   depuis peu l'objet d'une attention croissante en raison de
   l'augmentation des inegalites economiques dans le monde riche. Cet
   article presente les differentes mesures de mobilite utilisees par les
   sociologues et les economistes, ainsi que leurs principaux resultats de
   recherche. J'en viens ensuite a des sujets qui poussent l'etude de
   mobilite au dela de son approche bivariee traditionnelle : l'association
   entre la mobilite intergenerationnelle et l'inegalite economique, les
   mecanismes de mobilite, et la validite de la mobilite comme mesure de
   l'inegalite des chances. Je suggere dans cet article que l'association
   entre mobilite et inegalite est probablement fallacieuse, influencee par
   des arrangements institutionnels variables d'un pays a un autre, et que
   l'analyse de mobilite est la plus utile lorsqu'elle se concentre sur la
   description de l'association intergenerationnelle bivariee entre les
   pays et dans le temps.
   Zusammenfassung Die Generationenmobilitat - eine Verbindung aus
   wirtschaftlichem Wohlergehen der Eltern und jener der erwachsenen Kinder
   - ist ein wichtiges soziologisches Konzept, das uber die
   gesellschaftliche Chancenungleichheit informiert. Aufgrund der
   zunehmenden wirtschaftlichen Ungleichheiten in reichen Landern steigt
   das Interesse fur dieses Konzept. Dieser Beitrag stellt die
   verschiedenen Mobilitatsma ss nahmen vor, die von Soziologen und
   Wirtschaftswissenschaftlern benutzt werden, sowie deren wichtigsten
   Forschungsergebnisse. In der Folge werde ich Mobilitatsstudien
   vorstellen, die uber ihren ursprunglichen bivariaten Ansatz hinausgehen:
   die Verbindung aus Generationsmobilitat und wirtschaftlicher
   Ungleichheit, Mobilitatsmechanismen und Bedeutung der Mobilitat als Ma
   ss einheit fur Chancenungleichheit. Ich behaupte, dass es sich
   wahrscheinlich um eine Scheinverbindung zwischen Mobilitat und
   Ungleichheit handelt, beeinflusst durch institutionelle Vereinbarungen,
   die von Land zu Land unterschiedlich sind, und dass die
   Mobilitatsanalyse am besten greift, wenn sie auf die sowohl lander- als
   auch zeitubergreifende Beschreibung der intergenerationellen, bivariaten

Abstract = {{Antimicrobial peptides have emerged as new therapeutic agents for
   fighting multi-drug-resistant bacteria. However, the process of
   optimizing peptide antimicrobial activity and specificity using large
   peptide libraries is both tedious and expensive. Therefore,
   computational techniques had to be applied for process optimization. In
   this work, the representation of the molecular structure of peptides
   (mastoparan analogs) by a sequence of amino acids has been used to
   establish quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs) for
   their antibacterial activity. The data for the studied peptides were
   split three times into the training, calibration and test sets. The
   Monte Carlo method was used as a computational technique for QSAR models
   calculation. The statistical quality of QSAR for the antibacterial
   activity of peptides for the external validation set was: n = 7, r(2) =
   0.8067, s = 0.248 (split 1); n = 6, r(2) = 0.8319, s=0.169 (split 2);
   and n = 6, r(2) = 0.6996, s=0.297 (split 3). The stated statistical
   parameters favor the presented QSAR models in comparison to 2D and 3D
   descriptor based ones. The Monte Carlo method gave a reasonably good
   prediction for the antibacterial activity of peptides. The statistical
   quality of the prediction is different for three random splits. However,
   the predictive potential is reasonably well for all cases. The presented
   QSAR modeling approach can be an attractive alternative of 3D QSAR at
   least for the described peptides. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   survival and urological complication rates. We reviewed our database
   searching for pediatric patients who underwent kidney transplantation
   from August 1985 through November 2012. Preoperative data and
   postoperative complications were recorded. Graft survival rates were
   analyzed and compared based on the type of donor, donor's age from
   deceased donors, and recipients' ESRD cause. Kaplan-Meier curves with
   log rank and Wilcoxon tests were used to perform the comparisons. There
   were 305 pediatric kidney transplants. The mean recipient's age was 11.7
   yr. The mean follow-up was 11.0 yr. Arterial and venous thrombosis rates
   were 1.6\% and 2.3\%, respectively, while urinary fistula and
   symptomatic vesicoureteral reflux were diagnosed in 2.9\% and 3.6\% of
   cases, respectively. Deceased kidney transplantation had a lower graft
   survival rate than living kidney transplantation (log rank, p = 0.005).
   Donor's age (p = 0.420) and ESRD cause (p = 0.679) were not
   significantly related to graft survival rate. In long-term follow-up,
   type of donor, but not donor's age, impacts on graft survival rate. ESRD
   cause has no impact on graft survival rate, showing that well-evaluated
   recipients may have good outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{AIMS - We examined the effects of temperamental dispositions, friends
   using alcohol and parental monitoring on grade 7 students' alcohol use
   patterns. DESIGN - The analyses were drawn from a cross-sectional survey
   of 3710 grade 7 students (mean age = 12.53) that participated in a large
   Norwegian school-based intervention study. Alcohol user patterns were
   measured through combining self-reported lifetime alcohol experience,
   heavy episodic drinking and any alcohol involvement in the previous 30
   days. Behavioural inhibition/activation sensitivity (BIS/BAS), parental
   monitoring and the number of friends using alcohol were measured through
   the adolescents' self-report. RESULTS - As many as 68.8\% of boys and
   83.3\% of girls were non-users of alcohol, whereas 9.1\% of boys and
   3.9\% of girls reported use of alcohol last month. Heavy episodic
   drinking last month was reported by 3.1\% of the boys and by 0.8 \% of
   the girls. A multinomial regression analysis revealed strong
   associations between the number of friends using alcohol and alcohol
   user patterns, moderate inverse associations between parental monitoring
   and alcohol user patterns, and a weak association between BIS/BAS
   components and alcohol user patterns. CONCLUSION - The results
   demonstrate the importance of socio-environmental factors in a period in
   which alcohol use is predictive of later negative outcomes.}},

Pages = {{1319-1327}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{An understanding of the processes that determine plant community
   structure is a requisite for the planning and evaluation of restoration
   efforts on river floodplains. Variable disturbance regimes derived from
   flood pulses increase the susceptibility of river floodplains to
   colonizations by new species and establish invasibility as a potentially
   important factor in plant community assembly and dynamics. The role of
   invasibility in the restoration of a wet prairie community on the
   Kissimmee River floodplain in central Florida was evaluated by
   quantifying temporal species turnover rates during wet and dry season
   sampling over a 12-year pre-restoration and post-restoration period.
   Turnover rates increased with reestablishment of annual inundation
   regimes and were significantly greater on the reflooded floodplain than
   on the drained, channelized floodplain. Recurrent periods of increased
   invasibility were associated with repeated high-amplitude flood pulses
   and accompanied by increased diversity of plant communities within the
   wet prairie landscape. Neither invasibility nor beta diversity was
   strongly related to the variable hydroperiods or depths provided by
   local topography and restoration of seasonal hydrologic regimes. Results
   suggest that invasibility is a functional process by which the restored
   flood pulse has reestablished the structure and diversity of the wet
   prairie. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Shallow free gas is investigated in seismoacoustic data in 10 frequency
   bands covering a frequency range between 0.2 and 43 kHz. At the edge of
   a gassy patch in the Bornholm Basin (Baltic Sea), compressional wave
   attenuation caused by free gas is estimated from reflection amplitudes
   beneath the gassy sediment layer. Imaging of shallow free gas is
   considerably influenced by gas bubble resonance, because in the
   resonance frequency range attenuation is significantly increased. At the
   resonance frequency of the largest bubbles between 3 and 5 kHz, high
   scattering causes complete acoustic blanking beneath the top of the
   gassy sediment layer. In the wider resonance frequency range between 3
   and 15 kHz, the effect of smaller bubbles becomes dominant and the
   attenuation slightly decreases. This allows acoustic waves to be
   transmitted and reflections can be observed beneath the gassy sediment
   layer for higher frequencies. Above resonance beginning at similar to 19
   kHz, attenuation is low and the presence of free gas can be inferred
   from the decreased reflection amplitudes beneath the gassy layer. Below
   the resonance frequency range (< 1 kHz), attenuation is generally very
   low and not dependent on frequency. Using the geoacoustic model of
   Anderson and Hampton, the observed frequency boundaries suggest gas
   bubble sizes between 1 and 4-6 mm, and gas volume fractions up to 0.02\%
   in a similar to 2 m thick sediment layer, whose upper boundary is the
   gas front. With the multifrequency acoustic approach and the Anderson
   and Hampton model, quantification of free gas in shallow marine
   environments is possible if the measurement frequency range allows the
   identification of the resonance frequency peak. The method presented is
   limited to places with only moderate attenuation, where the amplitudes
   of a reflection can be analyzed beneath the gassy sediment layer.}},

Abstract = {{Following the detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
   (MRSA) ST398 in food-producing animals, both livestock and wildlife, and
   derived products, are considered potential sources of MRSA in humans.
   There is a paucity of data on MRSA in foods in Italy, and the data
   regarding wild animals are particularly scarce. A total of 2162 food
   samples collected during official monitoring activities in 2008 were
   analyzed for the detection of S. aureus. Also, samples from 1365 wild
   animals collected by the National Reference Center for Wild Animal
   Diseases in 2003-2009 were subjected to anatomopathological examination.
   S. aureus isolates were processed for phenotypic and molecular
   methicillin resistance determinations.
   S. aureus was found in 2.0\% of wild animal carcasses and in 3.2\% of
   wild boar lymph nodes: none showed methicillin resistance. The
   prevalence of S. aureus in food was 17.1\%. Two MRSA strains, both from
   bulk tank milk (prevalence 0.77\%) were isolated: the strains were
   resistant to tetracycline, had spa-type t899, and were negative for the
   Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene. The low prevalence of MRSA suggests
   that the risk of transmission to humans via food is limited. However,
   attention should be paid to the cattle food chain, which may be a
   potential route of transmission of LA-MRSA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Background:Intestinal inflammation is associated with systemic
   translocation of commensal antigens and the consequent activation of B
   and T lymphocytes. The long-term consequences of such immune activation
   are not completely understood.
   Methods:C57BL/6 mice were subjected to 2 courses of treatment with
   dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce colitis. Two to 7 weeks after the
   DSS treatment, the mice were infected intraperitoneally with Salmonella
   enterica serovar Typhimurium. The outcome of infection was evaluated
   based on survival and tissue pathogen burden.
   Results:Mice that had recovered from DSS colitis displayed a significant
   increase in resistance to S. Typhimurium infection as indicated by
   improved survival and decreased tissue pathogen numbers. The
   colitis-induced increase in resistance to systemic salmonellosis lasted
   for as long as 7 weeks after discontinuing DSS and was dependent on T
   lymphocytes but not on B cells. Interestingly, depletion of CD4(+) and
   CD8(+) T cells just before the Salmonella infection did not alter the
   colitis-induced increase in resistance. Mice that had recovered from
   colitis had evidence of persistent activation of resident peritoneal
   macrophages and enhanced Salmonella-induced neutrophil recruitment to
   the peritoneum. Macrophage depletion with clodronate liposomes abrogated
   the colitis-induced increase in resistance to Salmonella.
   Conclusions:Taken together, our results indicate that DSS colitis leads
   to a long-lasting increase in resistance to Salmonella infection that is
   initiated in a T cell-dependent manner but is ultimately mediated
   independently of B and T cells as a result of persistent changes in
   innate immune cell function.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the application of the simulation-optimization
   approach to optimize groundwater intake for the water supply of Tarnow
   agglomeration (southern Poland). Tarnow agglomeration is supplied with
   water from extensively exploited surface and groundwater intakes located
   at the confluence of the rivers Dunajec and Biala. Groundwater intakes
   capture water from the Quaternary aquifer, which is recharged by
   rainfall and direct infiltration from the rivers and irrigation ditches.
   Hydrogeological conditions occurring within the area under consideration
   were mapped by using a single-layer numerical model in Processing
   Modflow software. After calibrating the simulation model, a
   simulation-optimization approach was developed with the aim of aiding
   the process of searching for the best scheme of exploitation of
   groundwater intake. The unit response matrix method was used to connect
   the simulation model with the optimization procedure. In the
   optimization task the objective functions concerning the total volume of
   groundwater intake discharge and infiltration amount from the River
   Dunajec or irrigation ditches were applied. Several constraints
   concerned both the maximum and minimum capacity of individual wells and
   the entire intake, as well as desirable or undesirable drawdown values
   in selected control points and control areas. Finally, twelve variants
   of optimization tasks, for different boundary conditions and different
   objective functions, were solved and optimal schemes of well discharge
   distribution within the intake were calculated. The results of
   optimization show that, depending on the intended objective and the
   constraints imposed, the best exploitation scenario under the given
   conditions may be found.}},

Abstract = {{Simple Summary: Social licking is often associated with good animal
   welfare, but little is known about this behavior in cattle. Licking
   behavior was compared in heifers housed indoors versus on pasture.
   Licking frequency was four-fold higher when heifers were indoors.
   However, when considering all social interactions recorded (licking and
   aggressions) licking events represented about 10\% of all interactions
   regardless of housing. This behavior happened more frequently between
   heifers that were observed more repeatedly in close vicinity of each
   other. Provision of smaller indoor floor spaces likely brought animals
   into closer proximity thus facilitating social interactions.
   Abstract: Housing affects social behaviors, such as competition, but
   little work has addressed affiliative behaviors. This study compared
   social licking (SL) in pregnant heifers housed indoors (in a free-stall
   barn) versus outdoors (on pasture), and relationships with competition,
   feeding and physical proximity to others. Six heifer groups were
   observed during two six-hour-periods in both treatments. The total
   number of social events (SL and agonistic interactions) was four times
   higher when heifers were housed indoors compared to pasture (546 +/- 43
   vs. 128 +/- 7 events/group; P < 0.05). SL as a ratio of the total number
   of social events was similar in the two treatments (12\% vs. 8\% of
   interactions, free-stall and pasture, respectively; P > 0.05). Housing
   did not affect how the SL bout was initiated and terminated, the
   duration, the body part licked and behavior preceding licking (P >
   0.05). Animals in close proximity showed higher rates of SL (P < 0.0001)
   but not agonistic interactions (P > 0.05). A previous agonistic event
   did not predict occurrence or the role of heifers in the following
   licking event. The higher stocking density indoors likely resulted in
   increased social interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Efforts have been made to retard the progressive
   debilitating pain and joint dysfunction in patients with knee
   osteoarthritis. We aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of a
   low-cost minimalist footwear on pain, function, clinical and
   gait-biomechanical aspects of elderly women with knee osteoarthritis.
   Methods: Throughout a randomized, parallel and controlled clinical
   trial, fifty-six patients with medial knee osteoarthritis were randomly
   allocated to an intervention (n = 28) or control group (n = 28), and
   assessed at baseline and after three and six months. The intervention
   involved wearing Moleca footwear for at least 6 h/day, 7 days/week, over
   6 months. The pain subscale of the Western Ontario and McMaster
   Universities Osteoarthritis Index was the primary outcome. The secondary
   outcomes were the other subscales, Lequesne score, distance walked in 6
   min, knee oedema and effusion, knee adduction moment and paracetamol
   intake. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using two-way casewise
   ANOVA (< .05) and Cohen's d coefficient.
   Findings: Intervention group showed improvement in pain (effect size:
   1.41, p < .001), function (effect size: 1.22, p = .001), stiffness
   (effect size: 0.76, p = .001), Lequesne score (effect size: 1.07, p <
   .001), and reduction by 21.8\% in the knee adduction moment impulse (p =
   .017) during gait wearing Moleca (R). The analgesic intake was lower in
   the intervention group.
   Interpretation: The long-term use of Moleca (R) footwear relieves pain,
   improves self-reported function, reduces the knee loading while wearing
   Moleca (R), refrains the increase of analgesic intalce in elderly women
   with knee ostearthritis and can be considered as a conservative
   mechanical treatment option. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ELECTORAL STUDIES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{189-199}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{There is an emerging consensus that niche parties are fundamentally
   different from mainstream parties because niche parties do not moderate
   their policy positions strategically. However, there is theoretical
   reason to believe that niche parties have an electoral incentive to
   shift their policy positions in the same direction as parties that are
   proximate to them in their most salient policy space. This paper
   examines whether niche parties respond to such electoral incentives,
   using data on government coalitions from the Parliament and Government
   Composition Database, and party behavior from the Comparative Manifesto
   Project in 17 Western style democracies. The results suggest that niche
   parties tend to respond strategically to the perceived behavior of
   proximate parties, especially on their most salient policy dimension.

Abstract = {{Transition research has recently been criticized to lack of
   geographically sensitive concepts to address sustainability transitions
   and environmental innovation processes. This has generated a number of
   suggestions how space, place and scale can be better incorporated into
   transitions studies. Moreover, it has led to a quickly growing number of
   empirical studies that explicitly deal with geographical aspects of
   transition processes. This special issue takes stock of these recent
   developments by assembling a set of eight exemplary papers that
   illustrate the added value of an explicitly geographical perspective on
   sustainability transitions. The contributions include a conceptual
   paper, a literature review and six empirical papers that offer
   representative examples of recent work. Taken together, these
   contributions testify to the vitality of the emerging research on the
   geography of sustainability transitions. This introduction to the
   special issue provides an overview of the special issue and offers

Abstract = {{This research examines the effect of perceived closeness to a source of
   money on people's likelihood to take financial risks. Across two
   experiments using gambling decision scenarios, we find that people make
   riskier choices when the monetary cost of the decision is high (vs. low)
   and when they perceive the source of the money as distant from (vs.
   close to) the self. Study 1 demonstrates that people make riskier
   decisions when someone else is paying than when they are paying, but
   only when the monetary cost of the gamble is relatively high (vs. low).
   Study 2 demonstrates that people make riskier decisions with a distant
   (vs. close) other's money, presumably because they perceive a close
   (distant) other's resources as similar to (different from) their own
   resources. The findings support the notion that the source of money
   affects how people mentally account for it, with proximity to the self
   as a determining factor.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional current transformers (CTs) detect fault currents and
   transfer signals to overcurrent protection relays for indicative and
   protective purposes as a part of the protection coordination system in a
   power network. By characterizing the transient response to a power
   failure, a reliable and accurate protection relay can be achieved. In
   this study, we propose a new Hall overcurrent protection relay (HCO)
   using Hall effect CTs based on the transient exponential signatures of
   fault current analysis. To minimize the distortion phenomena seen in
   fault current measurements because of the hysteresis caused by the CTs'
   iron cores, and to obtain faster tripping signals, we adapt an HCO to
   accurately detect nonsinusoidal fault waves and to improve protection
   coordination accuracy. The experimental results indicate that the HCO
   significantly improves the protection system's accuracy and response
   speed for various power systems applications.}},

Abstract = {{Renal transplantation is the optimum treatment for end-stage renal
   failure. B cells have been identified in chronic allograft damage (CAD)
   and associated with the development of tertiary lymphoid tissue within
   the human renal allograft. We performed renal transplantation in mice to
   model CAD and identified B cells forming tertiary lymphoid tissue with
   germinal centers. Intra-allograft B220(+) B cells comprised of IgM(high)
   CD23(-) B cells, IgM(lo) CD23(+) B cells, and IgM(lo) CD23(-) B cells
   with elevated expression of CD86. Depletion of B cells with anti-CD20
   was associated with an improvement in CAD but only when administered
   after transplantation and not before. Isolated intra-allograft B cells
   were cultured and shown to synthesize multiple cytokines, the most
   abundant of these were GRO-alpha (CXCL1), RANTES (CCL5), IL-6 and MCP-1
   (CCL2). Tubular loss was observed with T cell accumulation within the
   allograft and development of interstitial fibrosis, whilst type III
   collagen deposition was observed in areas of F4/80(+) macrophages and
   PDGFR-beta(+) and transgelin(+) fibroblasts, all of which were reduced
   by B cell depletion. We have shown that intra-allograft B cells are key
   mediators of CAD. B cells possibly contribute to CAD by intra-allograft
   secretion of cytokines and chemokines.}},

Journal = {{NMR IN BIOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Previous investigations have indicated that the default-mode network
   (DMN) is highly involved in memory processing in the parahippocampal
   gyrus (PHC). However, because of susceptibility-related signal loss,
   parahippocampal activation in the DMN is difficult to detect in
   resting-state functional MRI experiments that are conducted using a
   3.0-T MRI scanner. This study investigated the magnetic field gradients
   of various brain regions and attempted to compensate for signal loss in
   the PHC using an optimized slice orientation. The field gradients,
   signal intensities and DMN functional connectivity (FC) of the PHC were
   investigated using datasets acquired from 18 healthy volunteers. The
   results show that the field gradient component parallel to the main
   magnetic field dominates the PHC. The results indicate that the signal
   intensities and FC of the DMN are significantly low in the PHC when the
   slice orientation of the imaging plane is transversal. Whether the voxel
   dimension is isotropic or anisotropic exerts a minimal effect in
   altering the slice orientation dependence. In conclusion, the results of
   this study support the selection of the coronal or sagittal planes for
   imaging of the DMN. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (Mecp2) is an X-linked gene encoding a
   methylated DNA-binding nuclear protein which regulates transcriptional
   activity. The mutation of MECP2 in humans is associated with Rett
   syndrome (RTT), a neurodevelopmental disorder. Patients with RTT
   frequently show abnormal sleep patterns and sleep-associated problems,
   in addition to autistic symptoms, raising the possibility of circadian
   clock dysfunction in RTT. In this study, we investigated circadian clock
   function in Mecp2-deficient mice. We successfully generated both male
   and female Mecp2-deficient mice on the wild-type C57BL/6 background and
   PER2(Luciferase) (PER2(Luc)) knock-in background using the clustered
   regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system.
   Generated Mecp2-deficient mice recapitulated reduced activity in mouse
   models of RTT, and their activity rhythms were diminished in constant
   dark conditions. Furthermore, real-time bioluminescence imaging showed
   that the amplitude of PER2(Luc)-driven circadian oscillation was
   significantly attenuated in Mecp2-deficient SCN neurons. On the other
   hand, in vitro circadian rhythm development assay using Mecp2-deficient
   mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) did not show amplitude changes of
   PER2(Luc) bioluminescence rhythms. Together, these results show that
   Mecp2 deficiency abrogates the circadian pacemaking ability of the SCN,
   which may be a therapeutic target to treat the sleep problems of
   patients with RTT.}},

Title = {{HOW SIMILAR IS TOO SIMILAR: THE PREDICTABILITY OF COURT DECISIONS IN
   MUSICAL LYRICS COPYRIGHT CASES}},

Abstract = {{The number of music copyright cases involving lyrics has increased
   significantly in recent years. At the same time, litigation has become
   more geographically dispersed, affecting courts in every circuit. With
   this increased frequency and spread of cases, it is important that
   courts apply copyright law consistently. However, the test for whether
   two works are so substantially similar as to constitute infringement is
   made through the eyes of an ``ordinary observer{''} rather than a music
   expert, and courts have differed in treating this as an objective or
   subjective test. In this study, I examined the consistency of the
   ordinary observer test in determining how similar was too similar.
   Despite the various ways in which different courts have interpreted how
   to implement this test, I found that the similarity judgments in courts
   throughout the country were actually quite consistent. In fact, they
   were so consistent that I was able to accurately predict the court's
   outcome over 90\% of the time using a simple similarity metric that
   counted overlapping words, phrases, and lines. My similarity metric was
   based purely on theory and was never fitted to any data set. Further, I
   was able to implement my similarity analyses using modified software
   algorithms commonly used for plagiarism detection, allowing me to
   automatically generate dozens of song comparisons in a fraction of a
   second. My results indicate that courts' decisions on substantial
   similarity follow a relatively simple pattern analysis that while
   fact-specific was not so nuanced as to be unpredictable. This simple,
   yet reproducible, approach is perhaps befitting of the ordinary observer
   the test seeks to represent. Moreover, if outcomes may be accurately
   predicted ahead of time by a simple similarity metric, many more cases
   could potentially be settled without litigation. This could provide a
   useful settlement tool as the number of musical lyrics copyright
   infringement cases continues to rise.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Preoperative and intraoperative diagnoses of lymph node (LN)
   metastasis in patients with gastric cancer is essential to determine the
   extent of LN dissection in order to establish individualized treatment
   strategies. We investigated the theranostic value of a newly developed
   drug delivery system employing nanoparticles loaded with the indocyanine
   green (ICG) derivative ICG-loaded lactosome (ICGm) using a murine
   draining LN metastasis model of gastric cancer.
   Methods. In the experimental draining LN metastasis model of human
   gastric cancer, the right hind footpads of nude mice were injected with
   cancer cells. Three weeks later, either ICGm or ICG solution was
   injected through the tail vein. Forty-eight hours after the
   administration of a photosensitizer, in vivo and ex vivo imaging and
   photodynamic therapy (PDT) were performed, and size of the LNs was
   measured.
   Results. In vivo imaging revealed metastatic LNs in the ICGm-treated
   mice but not in the ICG-treated mice. PDT using ICGm induced apoptosis
   and significantly inhibited the growth of metastatic LNs.
   Conclusions. ICGm presents a novel theranostic nanodevice for LN
   metastasis of gastric cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale studies measure mathematics-related affect using
   questionnaires developed by researchers in primarily English-based
   countries and according to Western-based theories. Influential
   comparative conclusions about different cultures and countries are drawn
   based on such measurements. However, there are certain premises involved
   in these kinds of ``imposed-etic approaches,{''} such as (1)
   universalism within the examined components, (2) universalism within the
   components' significances, (3) the congruence between languages and
   conceptions, and (4) the components' coverage of the phenomena.
   Therefore, researchers have criticized these premises citing a large
   number of reasons. In this study, the validity of conclusions based on
   results relying on the imposed-etic approach is questioned by examining
   to what extent the premises behind this approach can be justified. We
   investigate the premise of universality within the examined components
   by scrutinizing the limitations of a typical questionnaire. To what
   extent can such a questionnaire reveal affective domain structures for
   pupils in two countries as dissimilar as Finland and Chile? We found
   that there can be no meaningful precision. Universalism across
   components within the mathematics-related affect structure is not
   guaranteed in the two cultures, and the use of such questionnaires is
   simply unjustifiable. We also thoroughly examined the three other
   premises underpinning the Western-based imposed-etic perspective.}},

Abstract = {{When females mate multiply, postcopulatory sexual selection can occur
   via sperm competition and cryptic female choice. Although postcopulatory
   selection has the potential to be a major force in driving evolution,
   few studies have estimated its strength in natural populations.
   Likewise, although polyandry is widespread across taxa and is the focus
   of a growing body of research, estimates of natural female mating rates
   are still limited in number. Microsatellites can be used to estimate the
   number of mates represented in females' sperm stores and the number of
   sires contributing to their offspring, enabling comparisons both of
   polyandry and of two components of postcopulatory selection: the
   proportion of males that mate but fail to sire offspring, and the degree
   of paternity skew among the males that do sire offspring. Here, we
   estimate the number of mates and sires among wild females in the
   Hawaiian swordtail cricket Laupala cerasina. We compare these estimates
   to the actual mating rates and paternity shares we observed in a
   semi-natural population. Our results show that postcopulatory sexual
   selection operates strongly in this species: wild females mated with an
   average minimum of 3.6 males but used the sperm from only 58\% of them.
   Furthermore, among the males that did sire offspring, paternity was
   significantly skewed. These patterns were similar to those observed in
   the field enclosure, where females mated with an average of 5.7 males
   and used the sperm from 62\% of their mates, with paternity
   significantly skewed among the sires.}},

Abstract = {{Arterial baroreceptors can be divided into two categories dependent on
   whether their axons are myelinated (A-fiber) or unmyelinated (C-fiber).
   We investigated the effect of periaxonal resiniferatoxin (RTX), a
   blocker of C-fiber baroreceptor activity, on the open-loop static
   characteristics of the arterial baroreflex. The baroreceptor region of
   the right aortic depressor nerve was isolated, and intra-baroreceptor
   region pressure (BRP) was changed from 60 to 180 mm Hg in 10
   anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Open-loop static characteristics of
   the neural arc from BRP to efferent sympathetic nerve activity (SNA),
   peripheral arc from SNA to arterial pressure (AP), and total reflex arc
   from BRP to AP were estimated. Although blocking C-fiber activity with
   RTX resulted in a lower response range (33.7 +/- 4.6\% and 49.4 +/-
   4.8\%, P < 0.01) and higher minimum SNA (78.0 +/- 4.7\% and 53.6 +/-
   5.0\%, P < 0.001) of the steady-state neural arc, the peak SNA response
   to BRP was greater at a BRP of 160 mm Hg (37.87 +/- 5.83\% and 26.28 +/-
   4.90\%, P = 0.01). RTX also resulted in a lower response range (27.8 +/-
   5.0 mm Hg and 40.9 +/- 5.2 mm Hg, P < 0.01) and higher minimum AP (92.4
   +/- 4.7 mm Hg and 79.1 +/- 4.9 mm Hg, P < 0.001) of the total reflex arc
   Despite these changes, the maximum slope of the neural arc and the
   maximum gain of the total reflex arc did not differ significantly after
   RTX. These data suggest that A-fiber baroreceptors can regulate AP and
   maintain the maximum gain when systemic AP is around the normal
   operating range. In contrast, C-fiber baroreceptors are critically
   important for reductions in SNA and AP when systemic AP is raised above
   the normal operating range. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Maternal intuitive eating as a moderator of the association between
   concern about child weight and restrictive child feeding}},
Journal = {{APPETITE}},

Volume = {{95}},

Abstract = {{Mothers who are concerned about their young child's weight are more
   likely to use restrictive feeding, which has been associated with
   increased food seeking behaviors, emotional eating, and overeating in
   young children across multiple prospective and experimental studies. In
   the present study, we examined whether mothers' intuitive eating
   behaviors would moderate the association between their concern about
   their child's weight and their use of restrictive feeding. In a sample
   of 180 mothers of young children, two maternal intuitive eating
   behaviors (i.e., eating for physical reasons, trust in hunger and
   satiety cues) moderated this association after controlling for maternal
   age, body mass index, years of education, race/ethnicity, awareness of
   hunger and satiety cues and perceptions of child weight. More
   specifically, concern about child weight was unrelated to restrictive
   feeding for mothers with higher levels of eating for physical reasons
   and trust in hunger and satiety cues. However, concern about child
   weight was positively related to restrictive feeding among mothers with
   lower or average levels of eating for physical reasons and trust in
   hunger and satiety cues. These findings indicate that it may be
   important address maternal intuitive eating within interventions
   designed to improve self-regulated eating in children, as mothers who
   attend these interventions tend to be highly concerned about their
   child's weight and, if also low in intuitive eating, may be at risk for
   using restrictive feeding behaviors that interfere with children's
   self-regulated eating. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A structural study has been carried out involving geometry optimization
   of different capsules and encapsulated complexes of single monomers,
   homodimers and heterodimers of benzoic acid and benzamide and
   substituted dimers, as well as hydrogen-bonded networks of benzamide
   addressing experimental observation, where cages offering similar
   cavities but made up of slightly different cavitands result in
   strikingly different dimer distributions. This is attributed, according
   to the present results, mainly to the fact that the two cages have
   different formation energy and different dimer encapsulation energy. The
   generation of hydrogen-bonded networks of the amide in solution acts
   competitively to encapsulation. In addition, the trends of the different
   quantities associated with encapsulation such as dimerization energy, \%
   dimer distribution and encapsulation energies, as the size of the dimers
   is increased, are examined. Furthermore, the efficacy of the ONIOM(DFT
   or MP2 and CCSD:PM6) method with respect to the calculation of \%
   distribution of encapsulated dimers in limited cavities is studied. The
   results show that when the interaction of the guests with the cage is
   significant, the ONIOM \% distributions do not agree with the
   experimental finding, as full DFT does, due to PM6 method, where the use
   of semi-empirical PM6 method changes the ordering of the low in energy
   encapsulated complexes.}},

Journal = {{ASIAN SPINE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{942-951}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Study Design: Clinical adjacent segment pathology (CASP) is common after
   cervical disc surgery. A critical examination of 320 patients operated
   for cervical disc prolapse revealed that CASP can also occur in patients
   with congenital and degenerative fusion of cervical spine. This has not
   been studied in depth and there is a need for a practically applicable
   classification of CASP.
   Purpose: To develop a new classification scheme of CASP.
   Overview of Literature: A review of the literature did not reveal a
   practically applicable classification incorporating the occurrence of
   CASP in congenital and degenerative fusion cases.
   Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 320 patients operated (509
   disc spaces) on for cervical disc prolapse. Cases (n=316) were
   followed-up for 3-11 years. Random sampling of 220 patients with
   postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 165 cases was
   analyzed.
   Results: Six symptomatic CASP cases required resurgery (1.9\%), eight
   cases involved MRI proven CASP with axial neck pain only and 13 patients
   were asymptomatic with radiological adjacent segment pathology (RASP).
   The frequency rate was 8.5\% (27/316). Four cases of congenital or
   degenerative fusion of vertebra developed CASP requiring surgery. CASP
   is classified as primary or secondary follows. Primary A1 was congenital
   fusion of vertebra and primary A2 was degenerative fusion of the
   vertebra. Secondary, which was after cervical disc surgery, comprised B1
   (RASP in asymptomatic patients), B2 (CASP in patients with axial neck
   pain), and B3 (CASP with myeloradiculopathy). B3 was subdivided into
   single-level CASP (B3a) and multiple-level CASP (B3b).
   Conclusions: Symptomatic CASP requiring resurgery is infrequent. CASP
   can occur in patients with congenital and degenerative fusion of the
   cervical spine. A new classification for CASP along with treatment
   strategy is proposed. Patients in Primary CASP and B3 CASP require
   resurgery while others require only observation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the success
   rate of staged localized alveolar ridge augmentation using titanium
   micromesh. In addition, the factors that influenced the success were
   analyzed.
   Methods Twenty-three alveolar ridges (posterior mandible 12, anterior
   maxilla 7, anterior and posterior maxilla 3, and posterior maxilla 1)
   were augmented using titanium micromesh and were retrospectively
   assessed.
   Results Thirty sites were judged as successful with a success rate of
   56.6 \% (posterior mandible 58.3 \%, anterior maxilla 57.1 \%, anterior
   and posterior maxilla 33.3 \%, and posterior maxilla 100 \%). The span
   of the augmentation site was significantly correlated with the success
   rate (goodness test of fit for chi-square, p<0.05). The success rate was
   low if infection of the grafted material was observed, while the
   exposure of titanium mesh had no negative impact.
   Conclusions This limited study suggested that the predictability of
   augmented bone volume in staged alveolar ridge augmentation using
   titanium micromesh was not sufficient to expect an ideal and planned
   implant placement. The success was influenced by the distance of the
   augmentation site and the infection of the graft material, which were
   associated with moderate to severe vertical ridge resorption and/or
   mechanical and functional loading on the surgical site.}},

Abstract = {{Over the years, the people of Akpugo community in Nkanu West L.G.A.,
   Enugu State, South-East Nigeria have suffered from frequent building
   collapse without knowing the cause. This study integrates geotechnical
   and geophysical techniques to evaluate possible factors responsible for
   this anomaly. Areas with cracked and non-cracked buildings were studied
   to assess the geotechnical properties of the soils. Samples were taken
   at different locations and subjected to x-ray diffraction analysis,
   grain size analysis, specific gravity, Atterberg limits, permeability,
   compaction, and triaxial tests. Electrical resistivity method was also
   used to delineate the geo-electrical layers and to image the lateral
   variations of the subsurface. Results revealed that problematic zone
   (areas with cracked buildings) has lower permeability (4.018-7.016 x
   10(-7) m/s), lower angle of shearing resistance (10-14A degrees), and
   medium to high plasticity index (25.1-38.33), while the non-problematic
   zone (areas without cracked buildings) has higher permeability
   (1.55-1.925 x 10(-6) m/s), higher angle of shearing resistance (15-18A
   degrees), and low plasticity index (18.1-19.4). The x-ray diffraction
   results of the problematic zone revealed a significant amount of
   smectite which has a very high swelling and shrinkage potential. The
   presence of substantial quantity of smectite in the soils of the
   problematic zone may be a strong factor in the structural problems. The
   electrical resistivity profiling delineated the boundary between the
   problematic zone and non-problematic zone and showed that the
   problematic zone has lower resistivity values (2-25 a{''}broken vertical
   bar m) while the non-problematic zone has higher resistivity values
   (20-170 a{''}broken vertical bar m).}},

Abstract = {{The present study was carried out to evaluate the neuroprotective effect
   of quercetin (QE) in protecting the cadmium (Cd)-induced neuronal injury
   in frontal cortex of rats. A total of 30 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats
   were randomly divided into three groups of 10 animals each: control, Cd
   treated and Cd treated with QE. The Cd-treated group was injected
   subcutaneously with cadmium chloride (CdCl2) dissolved in saline at a
   dose of 2 ml/kg/day for 30 days, resulting in a dosage of 1 mg/kg Cd.
   The rats in QE-treated groups were given QE (15 mg/kg body weight) once
   a day intraperitoneally starting 2 days prior to Cd injection, during
   the study period. Rats were sacrificed at the end of the study and the
   frontal cortex tissues were removed for biochemical and
   histopathological investigation. To date, there is no available
   information on the effect of QE on neuronal injury after Cd exposure.
   Rats intoxicated with Cd for 30 days, significantly increased tissue
   malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and significantly decreased enzymatic
   antioxidants superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase
   in the frontal cortex tissue. Administration of QE with Cd significantly
   diminished the levels of MDA and significantly elevated the levels of
   enzymatic antioxidants in the frontal cortex tissue. The
   histopathological studies in the brain of rats also supported that QE
   markedly reduced the Cd-induced histopathological changes and well
   preserved the normal histological architecture of the frontal cortex
   tissue. The caspase-3 immunopositivity was increased in degenerating
   neurons of the Cd group. Treatment with QE markedly reduced the
   immunoreactivity of degenerating neurons. In conclusion, the results of
   the current study suggest that QE may be beneficial in combating the
   Cd-induced neurotoxicity in the brain of rats. We believe that further
   preclinical research into the utility of QE may indicate its usefulness
   as a potential treatment for neurodegeneration after Cd exposure in
   rats.}},

Abstract = {{This paper developed a model of the long-run demand for tourism in
   Thailand from nine countries in ASEAN. The aggregate tourism demand
   model was developed, and the elasticities were estimated using
   appropriate econometric methods based on characteristics and limitation
   of the available data in each country. The results show that, ASEAN
   tourist markets are more important than Europe markets in terms of
   number and growth of receipts, and each market have difference price
   elasticities. The economic growth of ASEAN countries in the last 2-3
   decades helped stimulated the expansion of ASEAN tourist market in
   Thailand. Most tourists from ASEAN countries to Thailand were more
   sensitive to Thai price than cheaper prices from competing destinations
   resulting in higher own price elasticities that cross price
   elasticities. Moreover, it was observed that for the countries bordered
   by Thailand such as Lao PDR., Malaysia and Myanmar, their price
   elasticities were higher than other countries. That is because people
   from these countries often traveled to Thailand on weekend for shopping,
   relaxing and enjoying night entertainment, hence the greater flexibility
   to change plan if price rises. This study suggests that Thailand should
   develop a specialized marketing plan to accommodate each individual
   countries based on their elasticities. Moreover, Thailand should seize
   the opportunity of growing ASEAN tourists markets, propelled by rising
   economic growth and liberalization of ASEAN in 2015, in screening and
   specializing in high-end market.}},

Abstract = {{Students make sense of mathematical ideas using a variety of
   representations including physical models, pictures, diagrams, spoken
   words, and mathematical symbols. As students' understanding of
   mathematical ideas becomes more general and abstract, there is a need to
   express these ideas using mathematical notation. This paper describes
   students' movement from model building and personal notations to elegant
   use of mathematical symbols that show their understanding of advanced
   counting ideas. Specifically, this paper shows how earlier ideas from
   investigations of specific combinatorics problems (questions about
   making pizzas with different toppings and using cubes to build towers)
   are retrieved and built upon using the formal mathematical register to
   explain the meaning of Pascal's Identity, the addition rule of Pascal's
   Triangle. This analysis also shows the power of shared communication in

   early maladaptive schemas that could affect dating relationships are
   formed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze emotional

   cognitive schemas in youth and adolescents who have maintained at least
   one dating relationship. Emotional dependency, early maladaptive schemas
   and variables associated with dating relationships in young adolescents
   were examined in 1092 participants from different school and colleges.
   Emotional dependency was found to be significantly higher in boys
   depending on age. Early maladaptive schemas also showed a significant
   correlation with Emotional Dependency. These results provide insights
   into adolescents' dating relationships and how emotional dependency

Abstract = {{In shallow sublittoral rocky habitats of the Southeast Pacific, two
   conspicuous ecological systems exist; kelp beds dominated by large
   Laminariales algae, and barren grounds dominated by crustose coralline
   algae and sea urchins. The aim of this study was to examine the
   successional development of micro-periphyton communities in both
   ecological systems using a colonization experiment conducted in Northern
   Chile. In both ecological systems, we installed replicated ceramic
   plates at 10 m depth and samples were taken after 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 14
   days of exposure. Bacteria, diatoms, protozoans and small eukaryotes
   were identified, quantified and analysed. The succession of
   micro-periphyton communities in both ecological systems followed a
   common pattern consisting of a net accumulation of functional groups and
   taxa over time; however, the total density of all groups was
   significantly higher in the kelp beds. In addition, the community
   structure of the developing micro-periphytons was different and specific
   for each ecological system. Although previous studies have suggested
   that kelp beds and barren grounds are capable of switching from one
   state to the other without substantial changes in biodiversity, our
   results show that each of these ecological systems promotes its own
   successional development, suggesting that they are unique,
   self-organized entities. This study is the first step towards an
   understanding of these ecological systems operating independently at
   this scale of organization.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about how old-growth and massive forests are responding
   to environmental change. We investigated tree-ring growth and carbon
   isotopes of the long-lived and high biomass Fitzroya cupressoides in two
   stands growing in contrasting environmental conditions in the Coastal
   Range (similar to 300years old) and Andean Cordilleras (>1500years old)
   of southern Chile. The interannual variability in C-13 was assessed for
   the period 1800-2010, and changes in discrimination and intrinsic water
   use efficiency (iWUE) were evaluated in relation to changes in climate
   and tree-ring growth during the last century. C-13 discrimination has
   significantly decreased, and iWUE has increased since the 1900s in both
   sites. However, these trends in isotopic composition have been
   accompanied by different growth patterns: decreasing growth rates in the
   Coastal Range since the 1970s and increasing growth rates in the Andes
   since the 1900s. Trees growing in the Coastal Range have become more
   efficient in their use of water, probably due to reduced stomatal
   conductance caused by increases in CO2 and warming. Trees growing in the
   Andes have also become more water use efficient, but this has been
   likely due to increased photosynthetic rates. Fitzroya forests,
   including particularly old-growth stands, are responding to recent
   environmental changes, and their response has been site dependent. The
   growth of forests under a more Mediterranean climate influence and
   restrictive soil conditions in the Coastal Range has been more
   negatively affected by current warming and drying; while the growth of
   old stands in the wet Andes has been positively affected by changes in
   climate (decreasing cloudiness) and increasing CO2. Permanent monitoring
   of these endangered forests under ongoing environmental changes is
   needed in order to reassure the long-term preservation of this
   millennial-aged species.}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown in ionospheric research that modelling total electron
   content (TEC) during storm conditions is a big challenge. In this study,
   TEC modelling was performed over Sutherland (32.38 degrees S, 20.81
   degrees E, 41.09 degrees S geomagnetic), South Africa, during storm
   conditions, using a combination of empirical orthogonal function (EOF)
   and regression analyses techniques. The neural network (NN) technique
   was also applied to the same TEC data set, and its output was compared
   with TEC modeled using the EOF model. TEC was derived from GPS
   observations, and a geomagnetic storm was defined for Dst <= -50 nT. The
   hour of the day and the day number of the year, F-10.7p and A indices,
   were chosen as inputs for the modeling techniques to take into account
   diurnal and seasonal variation of TEC, solar, and geomagnetic
   activities, respectively. Both EOF and NN models were developed using
   GPS TEC data for storm days counted from 1999 to 2013 and tested on
   different storms. For interpolation, the EOF and NN models were
   validated on storms that occurred during high and low solar activity
   periods (storms of 2000 and 2006), while for extrapolation the
   validation was done for the storms of 2014 and 2015, identified based on
   the provisional Dst index data. A comparison of the modeled TEC with the
   observed TEC showed that both EOF and NN models perform well for storms
   with nonsignificant ionospheric TEC response and storms that occurred
   during period of low solar activity. For storms with significant TEC
   response, TEC magnitude is well captured during the nighttime and early
   morning, but short-term features, TEC enhancement, and depression are
   not sufficiently captured by the models. Statistically, the NN model
   performs 12.79\% better than the EOF model on average, over all storm
   periods considered. Furthermore, it has been shown that the EOF and NN
   models developed for a specific station can be used to estimate TEC over
   other locations within a latitudinal and longitudinal coverage of 8.7
   degrees and 10.6 degrees, respectively. This is an important result as
   it reduces the data dimensionality problem for computational purposes.}},

Abstract = {{In patients with multiple myeloma (MM) undergoing autologous
   hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT), peripheral blood
   progenitor cells may be collected following mobilization with growth
   factor alone (GF) or cytotoxic chemotherapy plus GF (CC+GF). It is
   uncertain whether the method of mobilization affects post-transplant
   outcomes. We compared these mobilization strategies in a retrospective
   analysis of 968 patients with MM from the Center for International Blood
   and Marrow Transplant Research database who received an auto-Ha in the
   US and Canada between 2007 and 2012. The kinetics of neutrophil
   engraftment (>= 0.5 x 10(9)/L) was similar between groups (13 vs 13
   days, P=0.69) while platelet engraftment (>= 20 x 10(9)/L) was slightly
   faster with CC+GF (19 vs 18 days, P=0.006). Adjusted 3-year PFS was 43\%
   (95\% confidence interval (CI) 38-48) in GF and 40\% (95\% CI 35-45) in
   CC+GF, P=0.33. Adjusted 3-year OS was 82\% (95\% CI 78-86) vs 80\% (95\%
   CI 75-84), P=0.43 and adjusted 5-year OS was 62\% (95\% CI 54-68) vs
   60\% (95\% CI 52-67), P=0.76, for GF and CC+GF, respectively. We
   conclude that MM patients undergoing auto-Ha have similar outcomes
   irrespective of the method of mobilization and found no evidence that
   the addition of chemotherapy to mobilization contributes to disease
   control.}},

Abstract = {{For industrial applications of photocatalytic processes aimed to the
   removal of pollutants from wastewater, a good solution for a final
   scale-up would be the choice of a continuous catalytic fixed bed
   photoreactor, able to work both with artificial light and with solar
   light. The optimal design needs a deep study starting from fluid dynamic
   considerations, together with the evaluation of the light's distribution
   inside the reactor core. In this work, flat plate geometry was chosen
   and a structured bed photoreactor for wastewater treatment was designed
   and implemented starting from an optimized N-doped TiO2 photocatalyst
   immobilized on glass spheres. The fluid dynamic study of the structured
   bed reactor was intensely carried out through a CFD model. Instead of
   the traditional LVRPA, the Helmholtz equation, set with the Dirichlet
   conditions on the boundary, was used to model the light distribution
   inside the photoreactor. Based on the results of the modeling
   optimization, a laboratory scale photoreactor was developed. In order to
   obtain kinetic parameters, photocatalytic tests were carried out using a
   model pollutant. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model was applied for
   estimating the kinetic parameters of the catalyst, starting, from
   experimental data collected at different inlet pollutant concentrations.
   The kinetic expression together with the photons' spatial distribution
   was incorporated in the mass balance to achieve the theoretical
   distribution of the pollutant concentration in the reactor. The model
   was validated comparing the experimental data obtained at different
   contact times. The developed mathematical modeling allows to determine
   the best operating conditions to optimize the irradiation and the
   reactor volume, being a flexible method for a further scale-up of the
   photoreactor. The developed flat plate structured bed photoreactor was
   able to operate in continuous mode. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Introduction: Mobile extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is
   reserved for critically unstable patients who may not otherwise survive
   transfer to the ECMO center. We describe our experience with mobile
   ECMO.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed adult patients between 2010 and
   2014 who were referred for ECMO support and were too unwell for
   conventional transfer. They were cannulated at their referring center by
   our team and subsequently transported back to our hospital on ECMO.
   Results: A total of 102 patients were put on ECMO by our team. Of 102
   patients, 95 (93\%) were managed by venovenous ECMO, and 7 (7\%), by
   venoarterial ECMO. The average distance traveled was 195 miles (SD, +/-
   256.8; range, 3.6-980). Transportation was via road in 77 cases (77\%),
   by air in 22 cases (22\%), and in 3 cases (3\%) a combination of road
   and air was used. A double-lumen Avalon cannula was used in 72 patients
   (70\%). One patient had a ventricular tachycardia arrest during
   cannulation but was successfully resuscitated. There was no mortality or
   major complications during transfer.
   Conclusion: The use of mobile ECMO in adult patients is a safe modality
   for transfer of critically unwell patients. We have safely used
   double-lumen cannulas in most of these patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{1,3-Diatyltriazenes (1) were let to react with {[}RuCl2(p-cymene)](2) in
   the presence of trimethylamine to give neutral
   1,3-diatyltriazenido(p-cymene)ruthenium(11) complexes,
   {[}RuCl(p-cymene)(ArNNNAr)] (2). The molecular composition of the
   products 2 was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The
   structures of the selected complexes were confirmed by a single crystal
   X-ray analysis. All triazenido-ruthenium complexes were highly cytotoxic
   against human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells with IC50 below 6 mu M, as
   determined by a spectrophotometric MTT
   (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) method.
   The most active was {[}RuCl(p-cymene)(ArNNNAr)] (Ar = 4-Cl-3-(CF3)-C6H3)
   (2g) with IC50 of 0.103 +/- 0.006 mu M. In comparison with the data for
   the non-coordinated triazenes 1, the triazenido-ruthenium complexes 2
   exhibited up to 560-times higher activity. Three selected complexes were
   highly cytotoxic also against several tumor cell lines: laryngeal
   carcinoma HEp-2 cells and their drug-resistant HEp-2 subline (7 T),
   colorectal carcinoma HCT-116 cells, lung adenocarcinoma H460 cells, and
   mammary carcinoma MDA-MB-435 cells. The compounds 2g and
   {[}RuCl(p-cymene)(ArNNNAr)] (Ar = 4-I-C6H4) (2j) were similarly
   cytotoxic against parental and drug-resistant cells. Time and dose
   dependent accumulation of the cells in the S phase of the cell cycle was
   induced by the compound 2g, triggering apoptosis. Our preliminary
   results indicate triazenido-ruthenium complexes as promising anticancer
   drug candidates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesWe adapted a rapid monitoring method to South Sudan, a new
   nation with one of the world's highest maternal and child mortality
   rates, aiming to assess coverage of maternal, neonatal and child health
   (MNCH) services at the time of independence, and introducing a
   monitoring and evaluation system (M\&E) for equity-sensitive tracking of
   progress related to Millennium Development Goals (MDG) 4 and 5 at
   national, state and county levels to detect local variability.
   MethodsWe conducted a national cross-sectional household survey among
   women from six client populations in all, but six of South Sudan's 79
   counties. We used lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) to measure
   coverage with diverse MNCH indicators to obtain information for
   national-, state- and county-level health system management
   decision-making.
   ResultsNational coverage of MNCH services was low for all maternal and
   neonatal care, child immunisation, and child care indicators. However,
   results varied across states and counties. Central Equatoria State
   (CES), where the capital is located, showed the highest coverage for
   most indicators (e.g. 4 antenatal care visits range: 4.5\% in Jonglei to
   40.1\% in CES). Urban counties often outperformed rural ones.
   ConclusionsThis adaptation of LQAS to South Sudan demonstrates how it
   can be used in the future as an M\&E system to track progress of MDGs at
   national, state and county levels to detect local disparities. Overall,
   our data reveal a desperate need for improving MNCH service coverage in
   all states.}},

Pages = {{38-46}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The old industrial buildings, now located near the city centres,
   redeveloping into commercial or residential use is very popular, but
   energy and especially comfort conditions not analysed because usually
   the specific projects are not made. This article provides an analysis of
   various aspects of energy demand and indoor thermal comfort when old,
   often unused industrial buildings are redeveloped for residential use.
   The results of the analysis, if the buildings are in use, show such
   redevelopment to be very efficient in terms of saving energy resources.
   In order to analyse thermal comfort of the redeveloped building, two
   different heating systems, radiator heating and floor heating, were
   examined. The performance of these systems was analysed with respect to
   three different room heights and window-to-wall ratios (hereinafter
   referred to as WWR). In order to simulate temperature distribution,
   computational fluid dynamics (hereinafter referred to as CFD) software
   SolidWorks (R) FlowSimulation was used. The results of the research
   demonstrate the acceptability of the heating systems in terms of indoor
   climate and thermal comfort as well as facilitate further discussion for
   future research in the field. (C) 2015 International Energy Initiative.

Abstract = {{We synthesized (ZnO nanoparticles)/polypyrrole (ZnO\_NPs/PPy) hybrid
   nanocomposites and used them as additives in an epoxy paint to protect
   SAE 1020 carbon steel from corrosion. The nanocomposites were obtained
   by chemical polymerization of pyrrole in aqueous solution and sodium
   dodecyl sulfate solution containing dispersed ZnO nanoparticles. We
   characterized the nanoparticles by infrared absorption
   spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A large disparity in
   the distribution of ZnO particle sizes became evident from the TEM
   images, which also show the formation of hybrid nanocomposites
   consisting of polypyrrole coated ZnO nanoparticles. Electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open circuit potential (OCP) tests,
   which were performed on SAE 1020 carbon steel plates coated with epoxy
   and ZnO\_NPs/PPy, have shown that epoxy paints have their efficiency as
   anticorrosive coatings significantly improved when ZnO\_NPs/PPy hybrid

Abstract = {{One of the largest detriments in the abalone aquaculture industry is the
   inherently low growth rate of this marine gastropod. In order to
   confront this issue, greater molecular knowledge is needed on growth

   for groups of California red abalones (Haliotis rufescens) cultured
   under the same conditions, but with high growth rates (HGR) or low
   growth rates (LGR). De nova assembly generated 44312 contigs used as
   references for RNA-Seq analysis. Results showed a total of 1437
   differentially expressed contigs, among which, 435 were up-regulated in
   the HGR group and 1002 in LGR individuals. Overall, LGR abalones
   evidenced a greater number of exclusive transcripts and differentially
   transcribed genes. These results provide a valuable resource of novel
   transcripts in this species and further understandings of the molecular
   bases regulating growth traits in H. rufescens. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Globalization is one of the widely considered factors in today's
   manufacturing industries. This paradigm may be adopted for new
   technologies such as additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing has
   been identified as an innovative manufacturing technology in recent
   years. The characteristics of this manufacturing technology, especially
   its support for quick design to manufacturing, have dominated it as an
   efficient generation of manufacturing techniques for today's global
   manufacturing paradigm. This article discusses the requirements and
   necessities of additive manufacturing with respect to a globalized
   perspective. Considering the two major requirements studied as
   integration of manufacturing operations and enabling collaboration in
   distributed manufacturing networks, this article proposes an idea as an
   enabler of additive manufacturing in the global paradigm. This idea
   proposes the application of Cloud manufacturing paradigm as one of the
   recent researches for global manufacturing environments. The
   capabilities of the Cloud manufacturing to fulfill the requirements and
   necessities of additive manufacturing in global paradigm are discussed
   and elaborated through a comprehensive case study. The case study uses
   the recent researches of the authors for an integrated and collaborative
   distributed Cloud manufacturing platform named XMLAYMOD platform. This
   article discusses the different aspects of the Cloud manufacturing-based
   solution for additive manufacturing systems.}},

Title = {{A comparative analysis between two techniques for the prediction of

Journal = {{INNOVATIONS IN SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Software engineers should estimate the necessary resources (time,
   people, software tools among others) to satisfy software project
   requirements; this activity is carried out in the planning phase. The
   estimated time for developing software projects is a necessary element
   to establish the cost of software projects and to assign human resources
   to every phase of software projects. Most companies fail to finish
   software projects on time because of a poor estimation technique or the
   lack of the same. The estimated time must consider the time spent
   eliminating software defects injected during each of the software
   phases. A comparative analysis between two techniques (fuzzy linear
   regression and statistical linear regression) to perform software defect
   estimation is presented. These two techniques model uncertainty in a
   different way; statistical linear regression models uncertainty as
   randomness, whereas fuzzy linear regression models uncertainty as
   fuzziness. The main objective of this paper was to establish the kind of
   uncertainty associated with software defect prediction and to contrast
   these two prediction techniques. The KC1 NASA data set was used to do
   this analysis. Only six of the metrics included in KC1 data set and
   lines of code metric were used in this comparative analysis. Descriptive
   statistics was first used to have an overview of the main
   characteristics of the data set used in this research. Linearity
   property between predictor variables and the variable of interest number
   of defects was checked using scatter plots and Pearson's correlation
   coefficient. Then the problem of multicollinearity was verified using
   inter-correlations among metrics and the variance inflation factor. Best
   subset regression was applied to detect the most influencing subset of
   predictor variables; this subset was later used to build fuzzy and
   statistical regression models. Linearity property between metrics and
   number of defects was confirmed. The problem of multicollinearity was
   not detected in the predictor variables. Best subset regression found
   that the subset composed of 5 variables was the most influencing subset.
   The analysis showed that the statistical regression model in general
   outperformed the fuzzy regression model. Techniques for making software
   defect prediction should be carefully employed in order to have quality
   plans. Software engineers should consider and understand a set of
   prediction techniques and know their weaknesses and strengths. At least,
   in the KC1 data set, the uncertainty in the software defect prediction
   model is due to randomness so it is reasonable to use statistical linear
   regression instead of fuzzy linear regression to build a prediction
   model.}},

Abstract = {{AimsTo provide an overview of the gambling landscape and
   gambling-related problems in France, including the history, legislation,
   gambling policy and epidemiological data on excessive gambling.
   MethodA literature review, using Medline, PsycInfo and Toxibase/OFDT
   databases, based on the systematic monitoring of scientific literature
   since 2008 (including French and international papers).
   ResultsSince 1776 and the creation of the royal lottery, state monopoly
   has been the main pillar of gambling policy in France. Increases in
   gambling venues and opportunities, growing evidence of gambling-related
   problems, pressures from the European Commission and the growth of
   on-line gambling have led to major changes in this policy: while
   land-based gambling remains mainly in the form of a state monopoly,
   on-line gambling was partially liberalized in 2010, and regulation
   authorities were established. The first epidemiological survey was
   conducted in 2010. Rates of problematic gambling in France are within
   the average of other European countries. Treatment has begun to be made
   available within addiction centres.
   ConclusionA majority of on-line gamblers in France use legal websites,
   which was one of the initial goals of liberalization. Recent studies
   confirm that the prevalence of problem gambling in France is far higher
   among on-line gamblers than among land-based gamblers; however, this
   difference cannot be attributed only to greater addictiveness of on-line
   gambling.}},

Abstract = {{We report on optical field enhanced nonlinear absorption and on the
   optical limiting properties of a 1-D photonic crystal with ZnO defect,
   fabricated by rf sputtering technique. The structural properties of the
   photonic crystal are studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   images. Light transmission spectroscopy measurement shows a broad
   photonic band gap with a defect mode. Open aperture Z-scan measurement
   with 532 nm pulsed laser illustrates a four times enhancement in the
   nonlinear absorption coefficient, due to local field enhanced two-photon
   absorption in the photonic crystal structure with respect to the single
   layer of ZnO reference. The enhancement of the nonlinear absorption in
   the photonic crystal, due to the strong confinement of the optical field
   around ZnO defect layer, leads to an optical power limiting behavior in
   the photonic crystal. The limiting threshold of the photonic crystal is
   found to be 0.74 J/cm(2) @ 532 nm with 6 ns pulse width, 10 Hz

Abstract = {{Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is promoted as a treatment of choice
   for adult depression in the developed world. In low- and middle-income
   countries (LAMICS), the standard treatment protocol is often adapted to
   meet the socio-cultural needs of the context. The authors conducted a
   systematic review of all controlled studies of culturally-adapted CBT
   involving adults with depression resident in LAMICS. The pooled mean
   effect size from 11 studies (n = 1602) was large, suggesting that CBT
   appears efficacious in treating depression in impoverished contexts.
   Specifically, treatments implemented with individuals were more
   successful than those administered to groups. Interventions employed by
   lay workers proved similarly successful. These results are encouraging,
   as the widespread adoption of CBT may potentially contribute to reducing
   the treatment gap for depression in resource-poor LAMICS.}},

Abstract = {{Transpersonal psycho therapy is based on transpersonal psychology and
   considers that the psyche is multidimensional and that there are several

   potentials that exceed the limits of their ego and integrate the
   spiritual experience within a broader understanding of the human psyche
   and consciousness. Altered states of consciousness have been used as
   psychotherapy in transpersonal psychology for decades. Although there
   are very well known techniques to induce altered state of consciousness
   as holotropic breathwork, neurotechnology offers an alternative way not
   only to induce these states for transpersonal therapy but also to
   measure the level of a state of consciousness. The objective of this

   and the main technologies that can be used to induce and measure altered

Abstract = {{Planners and decision-makers in the wastewater sector are often

   the identification of cost-effective local wastewater management
   solutions for any given demographic and physical context. By using
   universally available input data the tool allows decision-makers to
   compare different wastewater solutions for any given wastewater
   situation. This paper introduces the ALLOWS-GIS tool. Its application

Abstract = {{Prominent theories of morality have integrated philosophy with
   psychology and biology. Although this approach has been highly
   generative, we argue that it does not fully capture the rich and dynamic
   nature of moral cognition. We review research from the dual-process
   tradition, in which moral intuitions are automatically elicited and
   reasoning is subsequently deployed to correct these initial intuitions.
   We then describe how the computations underlying moral cognition are
   diverse and widely distributed throughout the brain. Finally, we
   illustrate how social context modulates these computations, recruiting
   different systems for real (vs. hypothetical) moral judgments, examining
   the dynamic process by which moral judgments are updated. In sum, we
   advocate for a shift from dual-process to dynamic system models of moral
   cognition.}},

   This paper discusses how by using a mixture of special composts and
   lignite (brown coal) it was possible to improve highly acidic, infertile
   and low water holding natural sandy soil to enable many different
   Australian native plants to be grown successfully in the Royal Botanic

Abstract = {{The sugar nucleotide dTDP-L-rhamnose is critical for the biosynthesis of
   the Group A Carbohydrate, the molecular signature and virulence
   determinant of the human pathogen Group A Streptococcus (GAS). The final
   step of the four-step dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis pathway is catalyzed
   by dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose reductases (RmlD). RmlD from the Gram-negative
   bacterium Salmonella is the only structurally characterized family
   member and requires metal-dependent homo-dimerization for enzymatic
   activity. Using a biochemical and structural biology approach, we
   demonstrate that the only RmlD homologue from GAS, previously renamed
   GacA, functions in a novel monomeric manner. Sequence analysis of 213
   Gram-negative and Gram-positive RmlD homologues predicts that enzymes
   from all Gram-positive species lack a dimerization motif and function as
   monomers. The enzymatic function of GacA was confirmed through
   heterologous expression of gacA in a S. mutans rmlD knockout, which
   restored attenuated growth and aberrant cell division. Finally, analysis
   of a saturated mutant GAS library using Tn-sequencing and generation of
   a conditional-expression mutant identified gacA as an essential gene for
   GAS. In conclusion, GacA is an essential monomeric enzyme in GAS and
   representative of monomeric RmlD enzymes in Gram-positive bacteria and a
   subset of Gram-negative bacteria. These results will help future screens
   for novel inhibitors of dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{In this meta-analysis, we investigated the effects of methods for
   providing item-based feedback in a computer-based environment on
   students' learning outcomes. From 40 studies, 70 effect sizes were
   computed, which ranged from -0.78 to 2.29. A mixed model was used for
   the data analysis. The results show that elaborated feedback (EF; e.g.,
   providing an explanation) produced larger effect sizes (0.49) than
   feedback regarding the correctness of the answer (KR; 0.05) or providing
   the correct answer (KCR; 0.32). EF was particularly more effective than
   KR and KCR for higher order learning outcomes. Effect sizes were
   positively affected by EF feedback, and larger effect sizes were found
   for mathematics compared with social sciences, science, and languages.
   Effect sizes were negatively affected by delayed feedback timing and by
   primary and high school. Although the results suggested that immediate
   feedback was more effective for lower order learning than delayed
   feedback and vice versa, no significant interaction was found.}},

Abstract = {{Background Lapatinib has proven efficacy as monotherapy and in
   combination with capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer
   (MBC) overexpressing HER2 and/or EGFR. Gemcitabine also has anti-tumor
   activity in MBC and a favourable toxicity profile. In this phase I study
   lapatinib and gemcitabine were combined. Methods Female patients with
   advanced BC were given lapatinib once daily (QD) in 28-day cycles with
   gemcitabine administered on day 1, 8 and 15. Physical examinations,
   vital signs and blood sampling for hematology, clinical chemistry and
   pharmacokinetics (PK) and radiological assessments of disease were
   performed at regular intervals. Results In total, 33 patients were
   included. Six dose-limiting toxicities were observed, mostly grade 3
   increases in liver function tests. Most common toxicities were fatigue
   (73 \%), nausea (70 \%), diarrhea (58 \%), increases in ALAT and ASAT
   (55 and 52 \%, respectively) and rash (46 \%). The maximum tolerated
   dose was lapatinib 1250 mg QD with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2). Lapatinib
   and gemcitabine PK did not appear to be influenced by each other.
   Anti-tumor activity was observed with one patient (4 \%) showing
   complete response and six (23 \%) partial response. Conclusion Despite a
   slightly increased toxicity profile compared to their respective
   monotherapies, lapatinib and gemcitabine can be safely combined while
   showing signs of anti-tumor activity.}},

Abstract = {{A large body of work has established an influence of other people's
   actions on our own actions. For example, actors entrain to the movements
   of others, in studies that typically employ continuous movements.
   Likewise, studies on co-representation have shown that people
   automatically co-represent a co-actor's task, in studies that typically
   employ discrete actions. Here we examined entrainment and
   co-representation within a single task paradigm. Participants sat next
   to a confederate while simultaneously moving their right hand back and
   forth between two targets. We crossed whether or not the participant and
   the confederate moved over an obstacle and manipulated whether
   participants generated discrete or continuous movement sequences, while
   varying the space between the actors and whether the actors could see
   each other's movements. Participants moved higher when the confederate
   cleared an obstacle than when he did not. For continuous movements, this
   effect depended on the availability of visual information, as would be
   expected on the basis of entrainment. In contrast, the co-actor's task
   modulated the height of discrete movements, regardless of the
   availability of visual information, which is consistent with
   co-representation. Space did not have an effect. These results provide
   new insights into the interplay between co-representation and
   entrainment for discrete- and continuous-action tasks.}},

Abstract = {{The autonomy of implementing agencies often seems to trigger
   reregulation of those agencies. Reregulation has two dimensions: the
   layering of different control mechanisms and the growth of the rules
   within those layers. Using a case study of social housing in Belgium, we
   explain the tendency to reregulate once autonomy is provided. We
   attribute the layering of rules to a conflict regarding oversight
   between the established legal profession and an ascending management
   profession. Crozier's vicious circle of bureaucratization helps to
   explain the growth of regulation within layers. The legal culture of the
   Rechtsstaat is a catalyst for both professional competition and

Abstract = {{The spread of aquatic invasive species during wildland firefighting
   activities is a concern when water sources and equipment are transported
   across watersheds or into pristine areas. In the present study, we
   investigated the capability of wildland firefighting foams to inactivate
   organisms in bench-scale laboratory experiments. Specifically,
   Escherichia coli and coliphage Phi X174 were used to test the
   disinfection potential of foams against bacteria and virus species as an
   indicator of their efficacy against more resistant organisms. The U.S.
   Department of Agriculture Forest Service firefighting foams tested in
   this study did not inactivate E. coli or coliphage during maximum
   exposure conditions that are feasible during firefighting activities,
   i.e., 10\% (v:v) mix ratio and a 60-min contact time. We did not examine
   whether firefighting foams were effective at displacing bacterial and
   viral organisms when used solely as a surfactant on solid surfaces. We
   conclude that fire retardant foams are not effective disinfection agents
   and will not reduce the risk of spreading aquatic invasive viral species
   during firefighting activities. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Germline variants in subunit D of the succinate dehydrogenase gene (SDHD
   variants) are associated with an increased risk of developing
   paragangliomas. The aim of this study was to compare mortality rates and
   survival in a Dutch cohort of SDHD variant carriers with those in the
   general population. The study was conducted at the Leiden University
   Medical Center, a tertiary referral center for patients with
   paragangliomas. Included subjects all tested positive for SDHD variants
   before 1 July 2012 and visited the departments of Otorhinolaryngology or
   Endocrinology at least once or had a diagnosed paraganglioma and a SDHD
   variant-positive family history. Clinical data were retrieved from
   medical records, information on mortality was obtained from the
   Municipal Personal Records Database, and mortality rates for the Dutch
   population were obtained from the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics,
   stratified by sex, age and date. SDHD variant carriers were followed
   from the date of first SDHD variant-related contact until death,
   emigration or 12 December 2012 and the standardized mortality ratio
   (SMR) was calculated. Two-hundred and seventy-five SDHD variant carriers
   were included in the study, of which 80\% carried the c.274G>T,
   p.(Asp92Tyr) variant, had a mean duration of follow-up of 7.6 years,
   yielding 2242 person-years of observation for analysis. There were 18
   deaths in the SDHD variant carrier group; two were paraganglioma
   related. The SMR for the whole cohort was 1.07 (95\% confidence interval
   0.67-1.73). In conclusion, mortality in SDHD variant carriers is not
   substantially increased. Additional studies are required to confirm
   these findings.}},

Abstract = {{On the basis of a study of a group of Zambian men identifying both as

   and religious identity and critically addresses the ``surprise{''} some
   scholars have expressed about the general religiosity of LGBTI (lesbian,
   gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex) people in Africa. The study
   demonstrates that participants are not just victims subjected to
   homophobic religious and political discourses but have agency: resisting
   discourses of demonization, they humanize themselves by making claims
   toward the universal category of love-both their own inclination to
   loving relationships and their share in God's love. Hence, they claim
   space for themselves as full citizens of Zambia as a ``Christian
   nation.{''} This article particularly highlights how some aspects of
   Pentecostalism appear to contribute to ``queer empowerment,{''} and
   argues that the religiosity of African LGBTIs critically interrogates

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Perioperative blood transfusion in patients with colorectal
   cancer has been associated with increased cost, morbidity, mortality,
   and decreased survival. Five years ago, a transfusion reduction
   initiative (TRI) was implemented. We sought to evaluate the 5-year
   effectiveness and patient outcomes before and after the TRI.
   METHODS: Patients who underwent colorectal resection for adenocarcinomas
   before (January 2006 to October 2009) and after the TRI (November 2009
   to December 2013) were reviewed.
   RESULTS: A total of 484 patients were included; 267 and 217 patients
   were in the pre- and post-TRI groups, respectively. Decreased overall
   transfusion rates were sustained throughout the entire post-TRI era
   (17\% vs 28\%, P 5.006). Three-year colorectal cancer disease-free
   survival rates were similar in the pre-and post-TRI eras at 85.3\% (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]: 79.9 to 89.3) and 81.6\% (95\% CI: 71.9 to
   88.2), respectively. Three-year disease-free survival rate was lower in
   those receiving BTs vs those without BTs at 78.4\% (95\% CI: 65.7 to
   86.8) vs 85.3\% (95\% CI: 80.4 to 89.1), respectively.

Abstract = {{Bioenergetics models are commonly used to predict effects of changes in
   metabolic rates and food availability on growth. However, food intake
   rate generally is assumed to vary asWd, where d = 2/3, an assumption
   based on observations from feeding trials in laboratory studies.
   Further, the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) is specifically
   integrated using this assumption. We argue that when considered from an
   ecological perspective, d is highly uncertain, dependent on how swimming
   speed, reactive distance, and prey biomass varies ontogenetically with
   the growth of a predator. Incorrectly specifying d leads to incorrect
   predictions of consumption and metabolism, especially at younger ages
   that are typically under-sampled. Three alternate means of detecting
   departures from d = 2/3 are provided, the most promising of which
   involves fixing initial length of the generalized VBGF to the length at
   endogenous feeding and directly calculating von Bertalanffy parameters
   (L-8, K, t(0)). Using this approach, it may be possible to more
   accurately estimate consumption and metabolism and to characterize
   lifetime growth.}},

Abstract = {{BiFeO3 is synthesized by the solvothermal method and the effect of La
   and co-doped alkaline elements (Ba and Ca) on the structural, magnetic
   and photocatalytic properties of BiFeO3 are studied. XRD pattern
   confirms the rhombohedral structure of BiFeO3 and Rietveld refinement is
   performed to study the change in bond length and angles of the samples.
   The structural distortion induced by dopants is further analyzed by
   Raman spectra. Particles of irregular morphology are observed from TEM.
   The optical band gap of the samples is found to be increased on doping
   and is in the visible region (2.02-2.11 eV). Magnetic measurements
   reveal that there is an enhancement of saturation magnetization in doped
   samples. The degradation of methylene blue is carried out in the absence
   and presence of H2O2 at two different pH values 2 and 6 under visible
   light. In the presence of H2O2 at pH value 2, the degradation of dye is
   found to be higher for BFO and the decrease in the photocatalytic
   activity rate is observed in the case of doped samples. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In the nanoscale regime, many multigate devices are explored to reduce
   their size further and to enhance their performance. In this paper,
   design of a novel device called, Triple Material Surrounding Gate Tunnel
   Field effect transistor (TMSGTFET) has been developed and proposed. The
   advantages of surrounding gate and tunnel FET are combined to form a new
   structure. The gate material surrounding the device is replaced by three
   gate materials of different work functions in order to curb the short
   channel effects. A 2-D analytical modeling of the surface potential,
   lateral electric field, vertical electric field and drain current of the
   device is done, and the results are discussed. A step up potential
   profile is obtained which screens the drain potential, thus reducing the
   drain control over the channel. This results in appreciable diminishing
   of short channel effects and hot carrier effects. The proposed model
   also shows improved ON current. The excellent device characteristics
   predicted by the model are validated using TCAD simulation, thus
   ensuring the accuracy of our model.}},

Abstract = {{Our analysis is based on firm-specific data compiled from the Russian

   seek to identify the factors behind Russia's dramatically improved
   corporate sector performance from the beginning of the 2000s to December
   2007. We argue that improved long-term corporate performance was a
   consequence of several policy initiatives associated with the
   state-dominated banking sector, which enabled statesubsidized investment
   funds to be channeled from a structurally reengineered energy sector to
   targeted investment projects located in other industries. We claim that
   Russia's industrial strategy closely conforms to Alexander
   Gerschenkron's catch-up theory.}},

Abstract = {{Both in-plane shear modulus and in-plane shear strength of multiscale
   hybrid composites have been studied. Carbon fibre-based laminates have
   been fabricated including functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes by
   means of solvent spraying method and hot compression process. Mechanical
   in-plane shear characterization has been carried out using off-axis
   three-point flexure test. Fibre volume fraction of multiscale hybrid
   composites has been determined through thermogravimetric analysis and
   fracture surfaces after testing have been imaged by scanning electron
   microscopy. Results reveal that the inclusion of functionalized
   multiwall carbon nanotubes on laminates has a small influence on
   in-plane shear modulus, although it increases up to 15\% of the in-plane
   shear strength. Multiwall carbon nanotube functionalization improves
   shear stress transmission between matrix and carbon nanotubes, which
   represents a reinforcement effect responsible for the increase in
   in-plane shear strength. Scanning electron micrographs have confirmed
   in-plane shear tests results.}},

Abstract = {{Feasibility of waste lime sludge (LS) obtained from acetylene gas
   production industry was studied during co-composting of vegetable waste
   for enhanced volatile solids reduction. Four different trials were
   carried out with varying percentage of LS combinations i.e. trial 1,
   trial 2, trial 3 and trial 4. Increased addition of waste LS raised the
   levels of pH in the compost, thereby volatizing the nitrogen as ammonia
   in trial 3 and 4. However, appropriate addition of LS in trial 2
   increased the microbial activity and resulted in higher volatile solids
   reduction (22.1\%) which was found double fold increase when compared to
   trial 1, where 11\% VS reduction was observed. Hence, with proper
   combination of waste materials and addition of LS, a maximum temperature
   of 66.5 and 61.4 degrees C was observed in trial 1 and 2 respectively.
   Temperature level above 50 degrees C for more than 4 to 7 days was
   observed during the process, thus satisfying the regulatory requirements
   for PFRP (Process to Further Reduce Pathogens). Therefore, the present
   study concluded that appropriate amount of LS addition increased the
   organic matter reduction drastically. However in trial 3 and 4, where 2
   and 3\% addition of LS were not appreciable in terms of proper
   degradation and stability at the end of composting period.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{How do migrant colonists and indigenous populations differ in their land
   and labor allocation in the Amazon, and what does this imply for their
   income levels/livelihoods and the environment? We address this by
   analyzing patterns of on- and off-farm employment of rural populations,
   both mestizo and indigenous, in the Ecuadorian Amazon. We use data from
   an unusual survey that covers both mestizo and indigenous households. As
   elsewhere in rural areas of the developing world, off-farm employment is
   found to be the principal income source for 68\% of the population and
   accounts for 53\% of total household income on average. Within off-farm
   employment, farm wage employment is most common for the poor, who
   usually have little human (education) or natural capital (agricultural
   land). For educated individuals, in contrast, non-farm wage employment
   is commonly the choice. In the Amazon, the government (national,
   provincial, municipal) is the main employer, which is linked to recent
   large government investment in infrastructure and decentralization,
   leading to significant expansion of non-farm employment opportunities
   for rural populations close to major towns. The implications of this for
   livelihoods, sustainable development and the environment are explored in
   the conclusions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Band selective adiabatic inversion radio frequency pulses were employed
   for multi-slice T-2 distribution measurements in porous media samples.
   Multi-slice T-2 measurement employing longitudinal Hadamard encoding has
   an inherent sensitivity advantage over slice-by-slice local T-2
   measurements. The slice selection process is rendered largely immune to
   B-1 variation by employing hyperbolic secant adiabatic inversion pulses,
   which simultaneously invert spins in several well-defined slices. While
   Hadamard encoding is well established for local spectroscopy, the
   current work is the first use of Hadamard encoding for local T-2
   measurement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, impairments of dyadic coping
   are associated with reduced quality of life. However, existing studies
   have a cross-sectional design. The present study explores changes in
   dyadic coping over time and its long-term effects on quality of life of
   both patients suffering from COPD and their partners. Dyadic coping,
   psychological distress, health-related quality of life, and exercise
   capacity were assessed in 63 patients suffering from COPD with their
   partners, at baseline and 3-year-follow-up. Correlation analyses and
   actor-partner interdependence models (APIMs) were conducted. Patients'
   delegated dyadic coping (taking over tasks) and common dyadic coping
   (mutual coping efforts when both partners are stressed) rated by the
   spouses decreased. Correlation analyses showed that patients' quality of
   life at follow-up was positively influenced by partners' stress
   communication (signaling stress). Partners' quality of life at follow-up
   was negatively influenced by patients' negative dyadic coping (reacting
   superficially, ambivalently or hostilely) and positively influenced by
   partners' delegated dyadic coping rated by patients (taking over tasks).
   APIMs mostly supported these results. It seems important that both
   partners communicate about stress and provide appropriate instrumental
   and emotional support to maintain quality of life.}},

Abstract = {{Progressively, higher education institutions have been incorporating
   sustainable development strategies and actions into teaching, research,
   infrastructure and campus operations. Recent years have witnessed a
   resurgence in environmental sustainability networks in universities in
   Latin America. A group of Chilean universities, including the
   Universidad de Talca, signed a Cleaner Production Agreement with the
   National Agency for Cleaner production in Chile. The measurement of
   corporate greenhouse gas emissions is included among the objectives of
   this agreement. For developing countries there are few peerreviewed
   studies that analyze greenhouse gas emissions generated by universities.
   The scarcity is most evident in Latin American universities. In this
   context, this study presents the evaluation of greenhouse gas emissions
   for the Curico campus of the Universidad de Talca. The emissions are
   classified according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol standard into scopes
   1, 2 and 3. The total emissions for the campus in 2012 was 1.0
   tCO(2)e/student, of which 68\% correspond to scope 3,16\% correspond to
   scope 1 and 16\% to scope 2. The principal contributors to the
   greenhouse gas emissions are student commuting, staff commuting and
   electricity consumption. The comparison with other higher education
   institutions worldwide, mostly situated in developed countries,
   indicates that for the Curico campus the greenhouse gas emissions value
   is below average. Moreover, an analysis was carried out for four
   scenarios with emissions reduction proposals. The most effective
   scenario is related to students using bicycles rather than motor
   vehicles. This study may be a useful guide for the application of
   emission reduction options in other countries, particularly in Latin
   America, where there are universities that have similar characteristics
   and lack environmental information. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background and Aims: Idiopathic frozen shoulder can be successfully
   treated conservatively. Manipulation under anesthesia, in randomized
   controlled studies, has proven to bring no additional benefit to other
   treatments. However, manipulation under anesthesia still is a used
   method mainly among patients with unbearable pain or too longstanding
   restriction of shoulder motion. Manipulation under anesthesia may lead
   to significant improvement in shoulder motion and function. However, the
   best timing for manipulation under anesthesia is still unclear. We
   therefore investigated whether timing of manipulation under anesthesia
   has influence on the results of manipulation under anesthesia,
   concerning range of motion, pain, and function.
   Material and Methods: We followed 57 patients (65 shoulders; 31 in
   women) at 2-14years after manipulation under anesthesia evaluating range
   of motion, pain, and function. Their mean age at manipulation under
   anesthesia was 54.0years. A total of 10 patients had diabetes. The time
   between the onset of symptoms and manipulation averaged 8.8months. We
   formed two groups, those mobilized between 6 and 9months after the onset
   of symptoms (Group A, 25 shoulders), and the others (Group B, 40
   shoulders). We recorded visual analog scale pain, range of motion,
   Simple Shoulder Test, and Constant-Murley scores.
   Results: Patients manipulated between 6 and 9months after the onset of
   symptoms had significantly better abduction and external rotation, less
   pain at rest and at night, and better Simple Shoulder Test than the
   others.
   Conclusions: It seems that timing has statistically significant
   influence on results of manipulation of the idiopathic frozen shoulder.
   The best time for manipulation under anesthesia, if non-operative
   treatment has failed to alleviate pain or limitation of shoulder motion
   is too cumbersome, might be between 6 and 9months from the onset of the
   symptoms. However, the clinical importance of results can be questioned.}},

Abstract = {{Background Genetic material from large patient cohorts is increasingly
   central to translational genetic research. However, patient blood
   samples are a finite resource and their supply and storage are often
   dictated by clinical and not research protocols. Our experience supports
   difficulty in amplifying DNA from blood stored in herparin; a scenario
   that other researchers may have or will encounter. This technical note
   describes a number of simple steps that enable successful PCR
   amplification.
   Methods DNA was extracted using the Illustra Nucleon Genomic DNA
   Extraction Kit. PCR amplification was attempted using a number of
   commercially available PCR mastermixes.
   Results PCR DNA amplification failed using ReddyMix (TM) PCR Master Mix,
   Thermo-StartA (R) (Thermo Scientific Inc. US) and ZymoTaq (TM) (Zymo
   research, US) PCR mastermixes, as demonstrated absence of products on
   gel electrophoresis. However, using the Invitrogen (TM) (Thermo
   Scientific Inc., US) PlatinumA (R) Taq DNA Polymerase, PCR products were
   identified on a 1\% agarose gel for all samples. PCR products were
   cleaned with ExoSAP-ITA (R) (Affymetrix Inc., US) and a sequencing
   reaction undertaken using a standard Big Dye protocol. Subsequent
   genotyping was successful for all samples for alleles at the CDH1 locus.
   Conclusion From our experience a standard phenol/chloroform purification
   and using the Invitrogen (TM) PlatinumA (R) Taq has enabled the
   amplification of whole blood samples taken into lithium heparin and
   stored frozen for up to a month. This simple method may enable
   investigators to utilise blood taken in lithium heparin for DNA
   extraction and amplification.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we describe the molecular characterization of six human
   Mycobacterium bovis clinical isolates, including three multidrug
   resistant (MDR) strains, collected in Mexico through the National Survey
   on Tuberculosis Drug Resistance (ENTB-2008), a nationally representative
   survey conducted during 2008-2009 in nine states with a stratified
   cluster sampling design. The genetic background of bovine M. bovis
   strains identified in three different states of Mexico was studied in
   parallel to assess molecular relatedness of bovine and human strains.
   Additionally, resistance to first and second line anti-tuberculosis (TB)
   drugs and molecular identification of mutations conferring drug
   resistance was also performed. All strains were characterized by
   spoligotyping and 24-loci MIRU-VNTRs, and analyzed using the SITVIT2 (n
   = 112,000 strains) and SITVITBovis (n = 25,000 strains) proprietary
   databases of Institut Pasteur de la Guadeloupe. Furthermore, data from
   this study (n = 55 isolates), were also compared with genotypes recorded
   for M. bovis from USA (n = 203), Argentina (n = 726), as well as other
   isolates from Mexico (independent from the present study; n = 147), to
   determine any evidence for genetic relatedness between circulating M.
   bovis strains. The results showed that all human M. bovis cases were not
   genetically related between them or to any bovine strain. Interestingly,
   a high degree of genetic variability was observed among bovine strains.
   Several autochthonous and presumably imported strains were identified.
   The emergence of drug-resistant M. bovis is an important public health
   problem that jeopardizes the success of TB control programs in the
   region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Some individuals with Obsessive Compulsive
   Disorder (OCD) may experience recurrent intrusive distressing images,
   which may be emotionally linked to past aversive memories. Our aim was
   to investigate whether Imagery Rescripting was an effective intervention
   for such individuals with OCD.
   Method: Twelve cases who experienced intrusive distressing images are
   presented in a A(1)BA(2)CA(3) single case experimental design. After a
   baseline of symptom monitoring (A(1)), participants had a control
   intervention of talking about the memory related image (B), followed by
   symptom monitoring (A(2)), a single session of Imagery Rescripting (C)
   and further monitoring for up to 3 months (A(3)).
   Results: Minimal change was seen following the control intervention.
   However, at 3 months following ImRs, there was a drop in the Yale-Brown
   Obsessive Compulsive Scale, with a decrease from a mean of 24.1 to 10.7.
   Reliable improvement was achieved in 9 out of the 12 cases and
   clinically significant change in 7 out of 12 at 3-month follow up. The
   limitations are that all cases were selected on the basis that they had
   an aversive memory linked to their imagery.
   Conclusions: Imagery Rescripting is a promising therapeutic technique
   for OCD as an adjunct to CBT where intrusive images are linked to
   aversive memories. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this overview, we focus on the different and current methods of
   acid-base characterization of heterogeneous catalysts and on their
   potential relation with catalytic properties in gas and liquid phases.
   Special emphasis is drawn on the main techniques currently employed such
   as the use of Hammett's indicators, the use of basic or acidic probes of
   different strength for adsorption measurements in microcalorimetry and
   of their thermal programmed desorption, the use of other techniques such
   as FTIR, ESR, NMR, photoluminescence, Raman, UV-Vis, and XPS, to
   identify and describe acid-base sites, the use of model catalytic
   reactions, and of theoretical/modeling approaches. Relationships between
   such a characterization and catalytic properties in different acid or
   base reactions are discussed, and implemented for different catalysts
   and different reactions. The concept of thermodynamic acidity/basicity
   (determined via chemical physical characterization) versus reactivity
   (determined via catalytic properties) of acid-base sites is presented,
   and explains why relationships between acid-base properties and
   catalytic properties are very often met but are difficult to be
   established unambiguously and cannot be generalized. The case of
   acid-base properties in liquid phase ``polar{''} (water, alcohol) and
   ``apolar{''} (cyclohexane) as ``effective{''} and ``intrinsic{''}
   properties, respectively, and their relation with catalytic properties

Abstract = {{Problem
   A threefold higher prevalence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) has been
   reported in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Nevertheless,
   the role of ANA in reproductive failure is still unclear. The aim of
   this study was to investigate the role of ANA during early pregnancy in
   vivo.
   Method of study
   We used pregnant mice treated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) obtained from
   normal healthy subjects (NHS); ANA(+) sera of patients with RPL; and
   ANA+ sera from women with uncomplicated pregnancies (HW). Placental
   immunohistochemical/immunofluorescence staining was performed to detect
   complement and immune complex deposition. ELISA was performed to
   evaluate complement levels.
   Results
   ANA(+) IgG from RPL women significantly increased embryo resorption
   rate, reduced C3, and increased C3a serum levels compared to NHS IgG or
   ANA(+)-HW IgG. Increased C3 deposition and increased immune complex
   staining in placental tissues from mice treated with ANA(+)-RPL IgG
   fraction compared to NHS- and ANA(+)-HW-IgG-treated mice were found.
   Conclusion
   ANA(+) IgG injection in mice is able to induce fetal resorption and
   complement activation. The presence on placental tissues of immune
   complexes and complement fragments suggests the complement activation as
   a possible mechanism of placental damage.}},

Abstract = {{Postembiyonic frog development requires a thyroid hormone (TH)-dependent
   metamorphic transition from an aquatic larva to a terrestrial frog. Such
   change in environment involves lung maturation in preparation for
   breathing air. However, little is known regarding the underlying
   molecular events and the role of THs in this process. Using quantitative
   real-time polymerase chain reaction, we evaluated Rana (Lithobates)
   catesbeiana lung mRNA transcripts representing key elements of TH and
   oxidative stress signaling pathways during natural and TH-induced
   precocious metamorphosis. TH induction was evaluated in two ways: 1) in
   vivo through interperitoneal injection of 10 pmol/g body weight of
   3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) into premetamorphic tadpoles and analysis
   after 48 h, and 2) in serum-free organ culture in the presence of 10 nM
   T3 after 48 h. Abundance of transcripts encoding the transcriptional
   regulators TH receptors alpha and beta, TH-induced bZip protein, and
   CCAAT/enhancer binding protein 1 was increased during postembryonic
   development and following administration of exogenous THs to
   premetamorphic tadpoles in vivo and culture. In contrast, mRNA
   representing Krtippel-like factor 9 and cold-inducible RNA binding
   protein revealed differential effects between natural and precocious
   metamorphosis. Elevated levels of catalase and Cu/Zn superoxide
   dismutase mRNA were observed at the end of metamorphosis with transcript
   levels displaying minimal TH-dependency. No change in stress-responsive
   heat shock protein 30 mRNA abundance was noted. The results support a
   role for TH-dependent reprogramming of the lung transcriptome during
   frog development and reveal a requirement for increased antioxidant
   capacity following anuran metamorphosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Printable electrolytes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are
   prepared using a low volatile solvent, gamma-butyrolactone (gBL).
   Various polymers including polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyacrylonotrile
   (PAN), and poly(acrylonitrile-co-vinylacetate) (PAN-VA) are used to
   regulate the viscosity of the electrolytes. The results show that PAN is
   the best polymer interms of viscosity, conductivity, and performance of
   the DSSCs. Increasing the concentration of PAN increases the viscosity
   of the electrolyte paste, which is advantageous to the operation of a
   printing process but decreases the electrolyte conductivity and cell
   performance. This drawback can be compensated by introducing of TiO2 or
   TiC nanofillers. The quasi-solid-state DSSC prepared using a printing
   process achieves a conversion efficiency (7.85\%) similar to that of the
   corresponding liquid cell (7.87\%). The stability test shows that the
   presence of TiO2 nanofillers triggers a gradual desorption of dye,
   decreasing DSSC performance. However, this problem does not appear for
   the electrolyte using TiC nanofillers, with cell efficiency retaining
   96\% of its initial value after a 500 h test. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Enteral glutamine differentially regulates Nrf 2 along the villus-crypt
   axis of the intestine to enhance glutathione levels}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aim: Glutamine is an important energy source for the
   intestinal epithelium, and its supplementation protects intestinal
   epithelial cells by induction of glutathione. However, mechanisms of
   glutathione induction in cells at various stages of differentiation
   along the crypt to villus axis are not well understood. This study
   examined induction of glutathione in response to glutamine along the
   intestinal villus-crypt axis and evaluated regulatory mediators involved
   in the process.
   Methods: Animals were administered 4\% glutamine in feed for 7 days,
   following which enterocytes at various stages of differentiation were
   isolated and glutathione levels and signaling mediators involved in its
   regulation were studied.
   Results: In control animals, glutathione levels were higher in the
   intestinal crypt than in the villus or middle region. This was
   accompanied by elevated expression of the modifier subunit of
   glutathione synthetase (GCLM) and the transcription factor Nrf2 when
   compared with cells from the villus and middle regions. These levels
   were further enhanced by glutamine throughout the intestine, although
   the effects were more dramatic in the crypt. In parallel to glutathione
   induction, glutamine supplementation also altered actin dynamics and
   proliferation in cells of the crypt.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the variation of glutathione
   levels along the villus-crypt axis in the intestine is due to gradients
   in expression of mediators such as glutamate cysteine ligase modifier
   subunit and Nrf2. The protective effects of glutamine supplementation
   seem to be most pronounced in the crypt, where it upregulates
   proliferation, glutathione levels and alters actin dynamics.}},

Title = {{A case of severe ectopic ACTH syndrome from an occult primary -
   diagnostic and management dilemmas}},
Journal = {{ENDOCRINOLOGY DIABETES AND METABOLISM CASE REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Resection of primary tumour is the management of choice in patients with
   ectopic ACTH syndrome. However, tumours may remain unidentified or
   occult in spite of extensive efforts at trying to locate them. This can,
   therefore, pose a major management issue as uncontrolled
   hypercortisolaemia can lead to life-threatening infections. We present
   the case of a 66-year-old gentleman with ectopic ACTH syndrome from an
   occult primary tumour with multiple significant complications from
   hypercortisolaemia. Ectopic nature of his ACTH-dependent Cushing's
   syndrome was confirmed by non-suppression with high-dose dexamethasone
   suppression test and bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling. The
   primary ectopic source remained unidentified in spite of extensive
   anatomical and functional imaging studies, including CT scans and
   Dotatate-PET scan. Medical adrenolytic treatment at maximum tolerated
   doses failed to control his hypercortisolaemia, which led to recurrent
   intra-abdominal and pelvic abscesses, requiring multiple surgical
   interventions. Laparoscopic bilateral adrenalectomy was considered but
   decided against given concerns of technical difficulties due to
   recurrent intra-abdominal infections and his moribund state. Eventually,
   alcohol ablation of adrenal glands by retrograde adrenal vein approach
   was attempted, which resulted in biochemical remission of Cushing's
   syndrome. Our case emphasizes the importance of aggressive management of
   hypercortisolaemia in order to reduce the associated morbidity and
   mortality and also demonstrates that techniques like percutaneous
   adrenal ablation using a retrograde venous approach may be extremely
   helpful in patients who are otherwise unable to undergo bilateral
   adrenalectomy.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic structures of 1-hexyl- and 1-octyl- substituted
   3-methylimidazolium (mim), -pyridinium (py), 4-methylpyridinium (mpy)
   cations and halide (Cl- or Br-) ion-pairs have been obtained from the
   M06-2x/6-31 + +G(d,p) density functional theory. The imidazolium cation
   binds strongly to the anion than py or mpy. Theoretical calculations
   demonstrated that Cl- ion-pairs possess stronger and more directional
   hydrogen bonding than those containing Br- ions bringing about the
   distinct structural features in the ion-pairs which are explained in
   terms of non-covalent interactions reduced density gradient analysis.
   Calculated vibrational frequencies have shown that the methine C1-H1
   vibration of the cation shifts to lower wavenumber (red shift) in the
   Cl- ion-pairs while the shift in the opposite direction was predicted
   for the Br- ion-pairs The direction of frequency shift of
   characteristics stretching vibration has been explained through the
   change in dipole moment of ion-pair with respect to the stretching
   coordinate of the corresponding covalent bond. As opposed to Cl-
   ion-pairs, the Br- ion-pairs reveal partial derivative mu/partial
   derivative r<0. Effect of hydration on the structure and energetics of
   the ion-pair has been simulated by subsequent addition of one to three
   water molecules. Cation-anion binding and polarizabilities of solvated
   ion-pairs increase steadily with the number of water molecules. A charge
   transfer from the anion in hydrated ion-pairs is evident from the
   natural bond orbital analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Over the past 23 years (1990 to 2012), French beef cattle farms have
   expanded in size and increased labour productivity by over 60\%,
   chiefly, though not exclusively, through capital intensification (labour
   capital substitution) and simplifying herd feeding practices (more
   concentrates used). The technical efficiency of beef sector production
   systems, as measured by the ratio of the volume value (in constant
   euros) of farm output excluding aids to volume of intermediate
   consumption, has fallen by nearly 20\% while income per worker has held
   stable thanks to subsidies and the labour productivity gains made. This
   aggregate technical efficiency of beef cattle systems is positively
   correlated to feed self-sufficiency, which is in turn negatively
   correlated to farm and herd size. While volume of farm output per
   hectare of agricultural area has not changed, forage feed
   self-sufficiency decreased by 6 percentage points. The continual
   increase in farm size and labour productivity has come at a cost of
   lower production-system efficiency a loss of technical efficiency that
   20 years of genetic, technical, technological and knowledge-driven

Abstract = {{Fibrin gels are attractive biomaterials for local delivery of a variety
   of agents, from drugs to proteins. Similarly, polymer-anticancer-drug
   conjugates and nanoparticles are emerging as potential candidates for
   cancer treatment. Combining these different approaches, we have studied
   the efficacy of fibrin gels loaded with cisplatin (DDP) and a complex of
   DDP with hyaluronate (DDP-HA) for tumor growth inhibition in a melanoma
   model. Loaded gels prepared at relatively high fibrinogen concentration
   (22 mg/ml) showed good in vitro antiproliferative activities, prolonged
   release of the anticancer drug, and a long persistence (10-15 days) in
   vivo when implanted subcutaneously (sc) in immunodeficient mice. Gels
   loaded with DDP or DDP-HA containing 1/3 or even 1/6 of their systemic
   dose (6 mg/kg) and positioned under the tumor mass in mice bearing a sc
   human SK-Mel-28 tumor showed an antitumor activity better than that of
   the original parent compound given intraperitoneally (ip). Moreover, in
   an additional experiment in vivo, fibrin gels loaded with N-trimethyl
   chitosan-based nanoparticles containing a DDP-HA complex were assayed,
   resulting in a further 8 \% improvement of anticancer activity, with
   lesser adverse systemic toxic effects. Taken together, these results
   suggest that the combination of fibrin gels and drugs complexed with
   suitable macromolecules holds great promise for loco-regional anticancer
   therapy of melanoma and other surgically removable cancer types.}},

Abstract = {{Preventive healthcare (PH) programs and services aim at reducing the
   likelihood and severity of potentially life-threatening illness by early
   detection and prevention. The effectiveness of these programs depends on
   the participation level and the accessibility of the users to the
   facilities providing the services. Factors that impact the accessibility
   include the number, type, and location of the facilities as well as the
   assignment of the clients to these facilities. In this paper, we study
   the impact of system-optimal (i.e., directed) choice on the design of
   the preventive healthcare facility network under congestion. We present
   a model that simultaneously determines the location and the size of the
   facilities as well as the allocation of clients to these facilities so
   as to minimize the weighted sum of the total travel time and the
   congestion associated with waiting and service delay at the facilities.
   The problem is set up as a network of spatially distributed M/G/1 queues
   and formulated as a nonlinear mixed integer program. Using simple
   transformation of the nonlinear objective function and piecewise linear
   approximation, we reformulate the problem as a linear model. We present
   a cutting plane algorithm based exact (oee--optimal) solution approach.
   We analyze the tradeoff between travel time and queuing time and its
   impact on the location and capacity of the facilities as well as the
   allocation of clients to these facilities under a directed choice
   policy. We present a case study that deals with locating mammography
   clinics in Montreal, Canada. The results show that incorporating
   congestion in the PH facility network design substantially reduces the
   total time spent by clients. The proposed model allows policy makers to
   direct clients to facilities in an equitable manner resulting in better
   accessibility.}},

Abstract = {{The study of acoustic communication in animals often requires not only
   the recognition of species specific acoustic signals but also the
   identification of individual subjects, all in a complex acoustic
   background. Moreover, when very long recordings are to be analyzed,
   automatic recognition and identification processes are invaluable tools
   to extract the relevant biological information. A pattern recognition
   methodology based on hidden Markov models is presented inspired by
   successful results obtained in the most widely known and complex
   acoustical communication signal: human speech. This methodology was
   applied here for the first time to the detection and recognition of fish
   acoustic signals, specifically in a stream of round-the-clock recordings
   of Lusitanian toadfish (Halobatrachus didactylus) in their natural
   estuarine habitat. The results show that this methodology is able not
   only to detect the mating sounds (boatwhistles) but also to identify
   individual male toadfish, reaching an identification rate of ca. 95\%.
   Moreover this method also proved to be a powerful tool to assess signal
   durations in large data sets. However, the system failed in recognizing
   other sound types. (C) 2015 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Today in heritage studies memory looms larger than ever, there are
   memory parks, memory politics, and memory wars, there is discussion of
   `dissonant', `dark', and `difficult' heritage linked to memories of
   traumatic past events. But what to we mean when we use the word `memory'
   in the field of heritage? How is the divide between its social and
   individual realms bridged? This article theorizes the intimate
   relationship between heritage and memory by focusing on three areas.
   First, it maps out the vocabulary that has emerged from the
   heritage-memory dyad including how notions of collective memory and
   lieux de memoire have been used, and occasionally misused, as well as
   the metaphors employed in the process. Second, the emergence of memory
   studies is considered, providing a brief overview of its foundations as
   well as assessing how it differs from, overlaps with, and contributes to
   heritage research. A third section offers a brief review of recent
   developments in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and evolutionary
   biology relating to memory and how this might inform heritage studies.
   The concluding discussion provides a synthesis of the theoretical and
   empirical contribution of memory research to furthering out
   understanding of cultural heritage and proposes directions for future
   work on the area of confluence between the two.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this article is to formalize the ``special bus
   lanes within the area of intersection{''} method that allows providing
   buses with space-time priority at signalized intersections (mostly of
   the isolated type), including those with no more than two traffic lanes
   in each direction at the approaches to the intersection. The article
   establishes the limits for efficient application of this method, and
   describes the results of a simulation experiment conducted in the VISSIM
   environment to investigate the functioning of the method on an actual
   intersection. The most critical phase of implementation of this method
   is to determine the optimum length of the special bus lane at the
   approach to the intersection. The optimum length of special bus lanes at
   the approaches to isolated or coordinated intersections is determined
   based on the maximum length of queued vehicles which is computed using
   the simulation models developed in the Objective-C language. The article
   covers the basic characteristics of those models, their structure and
   building principles, and also provides the model validation results.
   Simulation models can be used both for determination of the optimum
   length of special bus lanes at the approaches to signalized
   intersections and for analysis of intersection performance based on the
   maximum length of queued vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{Bone marrow stimulation (BMS) techniques represent the first-line
   treatment for unstable osteochondral lesions of the talus or after
   conservative treatment failure. These techniques are intended to
   penetrate the subchondral bone to elicit bleeding and allow precursor
   cells and cytokines from bone marrow to populate the lesion. However,
   the fibrocartilaginous repair tissue arising after marrow stimulation
   confers inferior mechanical and biological properties compared with the
   original hyaline cartilage. The limitations of BMS can be overcome by
   the use of the soluble chitosan-based polymer BST-CarGel (Piramal Life
   Sciences, Laval, Quebec, Canada). When mixed with freshly drawn
   autologous whole blood and applied to a lesion surgically prepared by
   BMS, BST-CarGel acts as a natural bioscaffold that increases the
   quantity and improves the residency of the blood clot formed in the
   cartilage lesion, enhancing the local healing response. The use of
   BST-CarGel has been previously described in the knee and hip joints with
   successful results. We describe the arthroscopic technique for
   BST-CarGel application in combination with BMS techniques for the
   treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus.}},

Abstract = {{In the past several decades, mothering has intensified by a number of
   measures. Explanations for this intensification tend to forefront
   women's concerns about others, such as concerns about their children's
   future economic security. This qualitative 3-year longitudinal study of
   U.S. mothers of young children looks at women's own needs in relation to
   their mothering intensity. It finds an additional factor contributing to
   this intensity is compensatory connection, or increasing the attention
   and prioritization given to one element of one's life in order to make
   up for insecurity experienced in other realms. Specifically, women who
   experience their partnerships or work lives to be insecure are the women
   most prone to draw on ideals of the centrality of the mother-child
   relationship and to exhibit pronounced attachment behaviors with their
   children. As partnership and work insecurities can occur across class,
   this study nuances prior work on class differences in mothering.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: To identify and reduce reasons for delays in
   procedure start times, particularly the first cases of the day, within
   the interventional radiology (IR) divisions of the Department of
   Radiology using principles of continuous quality improvement.
   Materials and Methods: An interdisciplinary team representative of the
   IR and preprocedure/postprocedure care area (PPCA) health care
   personnel, managers, and data analysts was formed. A standardized form
   was used to document both inpatient and outpatient progress through the
   PPCA and IR workflow in six rooms and to document reasons for delays.
   Data generated were used to identify key problems areas, implement
   improvement interventions, and monitor their effects. Project duration
   was 6 months.
   Results: The average number of on-time starts for the first case of the
   day increased from 23\% to 56\% (P value < .01). The average number of
   on-time, scheduled outpatients increased from 30\% to 45\% (P value <
   .01). Patient wait time to arrive at treatment room once they were ready
   for their procedure was reduced on average by 10 minutes (P value <
   .01). Patient care delay duration per 100 patients was reduced from 30.3
   to 21.6 hours (29\% reduction). Number of patient care delays per 100
   patients was reduced from 46.6 to 40.1 (17\% reduction). Top reasons for
   delay included waiting for consent (26\% of delays duration) and
   laboratory tests (12\%).
   Conclusions: Many complex factors contribute to procedure start time
   delays within an IR practice. A data-driven and patient-centered,
   interdisciplinary team approach was effective in reducing delays in IR.}},

Title = {{A gesture-free geometric approach for mid-air expression of design
   intent in 3D virtual pottery}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{11-24}},

Abstract = {{The advent of depth cameras has enabled mid-air interactions for shape
   modeling with bare hands. Typically, these interactions employ a finite
   set of pre-defined hand gestures to allow users to specify modeling
   operations in virtual space. However, human interactions in real world
   shaping processes (such as pottery or sculpting) are complex, iterative,
   and continuous. In this paper, we show that the expression of user
   intent in shaping processes can be derived from the geometry of contact
   between the hand and the manipulated object. Specifically, we describe
   the design and evaluation of a geometric interaction technique for
   bare-hand mid-air virtual pottery. We model the shaping of a pot as a
   gradual and progressive convergence of the pot's profile to the shape of
   the user's hand represented as a point-cloud (PCL). Thus, a user does
   not need to learn, know, or remember any gestures to interact with our
   system. Our choice of pottery simplifies the geometric representation,
   allowing us to systematically study how users use their hands and
   fingers to express the intent of deformation during a shaping process.
   Our evaluations demonstrate that it is possible to enable users to
   express their intent for shape deformation without the need for a fixed
   set of gestures for clutching and deforming a shape. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective. In utero exposure to maternal antibodies and cytokines are
   potential risk factors for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The aim of
   this study was to determine whether children born to mothers with
   systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have an increased risk of ASD
   compared to children born to mothers without SLE.
   Methods. The study population was derived from the Offspring of SLE
   Mothers Registry (OSLER), a large population-based cohort identified
   through healthcare databases in Quebec (1989-2009) comprising all women
   who had >= 1 hospitalization for a delivery (stillbirth or live birth)
   after SLE diagnosis. As general population controls, a randomly selected
   group of women without SLE was matched >= 4:1 to the mothers with SLE
   for age and year of delivery. Children born live to mothers with SLE and
   those born live to matched controls were identified, and a recorded
   diagnosis of ASD was ascertained for each child. Multivariate analyses
   were performed to adjust for parents' demographic characteristics, sex,
   birth order of the child, maternal comorbidities, and obstetric
   complications.
   Results. In total, 509 women with SLE had 719 children, and 5,824
   matched controls had 8,493 children. Children born to women with SLE
   were more frequently found to have a diagnosis of ASD compared to
   controls (frequency of recorded ASDs 1.4\% {[}95\% confidence interval
   (95\% CI) 0.8-2.5] versus 0.6\% {[}95\% CI 0.5-0.8]), a difference of
   0.8\% (95\% CI 0.1-1.9). The mean age at ASD diagnosis was younger in
   offspring of SLE mothers (mean 3.8 years, 95\% CI 1.8-5.8) compared to
   offspring of controls (mean 5.7 years, 95\% CI 4.9-6.5). In primary
   multivariate analysis, SLE offspring had a substantially increased risk
   of ASD compared to controls (odds ratio 2.19, 95\% CI 1.09-4.39).
   Conclusion. Compared to children from the general population, children
   born to women with SLE have an increased risk of ASD, although, in
   absolute terms, it represents a rare outcome. These
   hypothesis-generating data provide direction for additional studies of
   maternal autoimmunity and ASD risk.}},

Abstract = {{Single crystals of barium hexaferrites with compositions BaFe12O19 and
   BaFe11.5Al0.5O19 were grown from carbonate flux. The Al substitution
   results in a reduction of the unit cell volume from 697.54(7)
   angstrom(3) for unsubstituted hexaferrite to 695.93(3) angstrom(3) for
   the Al-substituted phase and the Curie temperature from 450 to 420
   degrees C. The magnetization of BaFe11.5Al0.5O19 samples was measured
   between 3 and 300 K in external magnetic fields of 0.001 and 0.05 T. The
   temperature dependence of the magnetization at a magnetic field of 0.001
   T demonstrates irreversibility, which disappeared at 0.05 T field.
   Millimeter-wave characterization of BaFe11.5Al0.5O19 slabs loaded in a
   WR-10 waveguide was carried out in the frequency range of 75 to 100 GHz.
   In this range electromagnetic resonances were observed at the
   frequencies of 78.6 GHz and 96.3 GHz. The resonant microwave absorption
   level was controlled by value of bias magnetic field. (C) 2015 Published

Abstract = {{To present mid-term outcomes from an international, multi-institutional
   cohort of patients undergoing vessel-sparing excision and primary
   anastomosis urethroplasty for the reconstruction of the anterior
   urethra.
   From June 2003 to December 2011, 68 patients underwent vessel-sparing
   anterior urethral reconstruction at five different international
   institutions using the vessel-sparing technique described by Jordan et
   al. (J Urol 177(5):1799-1802, 2007).
   Patients' age range was from 3 to 82 years (mean 51.2). Stricture length
   ranged from 1 to 3 cm (mean 1.78). After a mean follow-up of 17.6
   months, 95.6 \% of patients had a widely patent urethral lumen. Three
   patients failed the procedure, requiring either direct vision internal
   urethrotomy or urethral dilation, after which all were free of symptoms
   and did not require further instrumentation. Complications were minimal
   and as expected following open urethroplasty.
   Preservation of blood supply is a noble pursuit in surgery; however, it
   can be technically difficult and often requires more time and effort.
   This vessel-sparing technique for anterior urethral reconstruction is
   reproducible and appears to be reliable in this international cohort.
   Larger studies and longer follow-up are needed to support these
   encouraging results.}},

Title = {{Skeletal material from larger Eusauropterygia (Reptilia:
   Eosauropterygia) with nothosaurian and cymatosaurian affinities from the
   Lower Muschelkalk of Winterswijk, The Netherlands}},

Abstract = {{Eusauropterygian elements from the Lower Muschelkalk (Vossenveld
   Formation) of Winterswijk, The Netherlands, comprising three mandibles
   and a selection of postcranial material, are described. The new
   mandibles correspond to crania larger than eusauropterygian cranial
   material previously known from this locality. The postcranial material
   represents a selection of isolated and associated material of comparably
   large size. Two of the mandibles conform to the morphology commonly
   recognized in Nothosaurus from the Lower Muschelkalk, but the third
   mandible accommodates five fangs per ramus in the symphyseal domain and
   exhibits a symphyseal ratio of 1.04, a condition not yet described for
   Eusauropterygia from the Vossenveld Formation. Body length for the
   animals represented by the finds was estimated through dimensional
   comparison with MB.R.27, a nearly complete skeleton from the lower
   Middle Muschelkalk locality of Rudersdorf (Germany) assigned to
   Nothosaurus marchicus. Body length estimates for the individuals
   represented by the largest mandible and by a selection of associated
   postcranial material exceed 1,500 mm; approximately 50 \% larger than
   the eusauropterygian taxa from Winterswijk described so far.
   Furthermore, certain morphological characters identified in one mandible
   and in the postcranial elements suggest a cymatosaurian affinity over a
   nothosaurian affinity. The present study indicates eusauropterygian
   diversity during the Lower Muschelkalk was greater than traditionally
   believed. This challenges the concept of a slow paced, gradual biotic
   response to the origination and expansion of the Muschelkalk Sea, which
   commenced only 5 million years after the Permian-Triassic mass
   extinction event.}},

Abstract = {{The gas electron diffraction (GED) study of succinic anhydride
   (dihydro-2,5-furandione) is used as a benchmark example for the reliable
   determination of the structure of floppy molecules with saturated
   non-rigid ring. According to results of B3LYP calculations, the molecule
   has a planar skeleton (C-2v total symmetry), whereas the MP2 optimized
   structure has a non-planar ring with the torsional angle phi(C-C-C-C) of
   up to 11A degrees (C-2 symmetry). It has been revealed that the increase
   in the quality of ab initio calculations up to CCSD(T) level and the
   enlargement of basis set up to quadruple-zeta size decrease the
   non-planarity of the molecular skeleton, which is approximated to be
   planar in the best-estimated ab initio structure. The semiexperimental
   equilibrium structure () has been determined from the GED data with the
   application of the so-called dynamic (pseudo-conformer) model describing
   the large-amplitude ring-twisting motion. Vibrational corrections
   Delta(r (a) - r (e)) to the experimental internuclear distances have
   been calculated from the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ quadratic and cubic force
   constants. The best-estimated ab initio structure agrees well with the
   structure. This fact points to the reliability and a high accuracy of
   both experimental data and applied theory.}},

Title = {{Minimum Standards for the Spatial Accessibility of Primary Care: A
   Systematic Review}},
Journal = {{GESUNDHEITSWESEN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{949-957}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Regional disparities of access to primary care are
   substantial in Germany, especially in terms of spatial accessibility.
   However, there is no legally or generally binding minimum standard for
   the spatial accessibility effort that is still acceptable. Our objective
   is to analyse existing minimum standards, the methods used as well as
   their empirical basis.
   Methods: A systematic literature review was undertaken of publications
   regarding minimum standards for the spatial accessibility of primary
   care based on a title word and keyword search using PubMed, SSCI/Web of
   Science, EMBASE and Cochrane Library.
   Results: 8 minimum standards from the USA, Germany and Austria could be
   identified. All of them specify the acceptable spatial accessibility
   effort in terms of travel time; almost half include also distance(s).
   The travel time maximum, which is acceptable, is 30 min and it tends to
   be lower in urban areas. Primary care is, according to the identified
   minimum standards, part of the local area (Nahbereich) of so-called
   central places (Zentrale Orte) providing basic goods and services. The
   consideration of means of transport, e.g. public transport, is
   heterogeneous. The standards are based on empirical studies,
   consultation with service providers, practical experiences, and regional
   planning/central place theory as well as on legal or political
   regulations.
   Conclusions: The identified minimum standards provide important insights
   into the effort that is still acceptable regarding spatial
   accessibility, i.e. travel time, distance and means of transport. It
   seems reasonable to complement the current planning system for
   outpatient care, which is based on provider-to-population ratios, by a
   gravity-model method to identify places as well as populations with
   insufficient spatial accessibility. Due to a lack of a common minimum
   standard we propose - subject to further discussion - to begin with a
   threshold based on the spatial accessibility - limit of the local area,
   i.e. 30 min to the next primary care provider for at least 90 \% of the
   regional population. The exceeding of the threshold would necessitate a
   discussion of a health care deficit and in line with this a potential
   need for intervention, e.g. in terms of alternative forms of health care
   provision.}},

Abstract = {{Recent challenges to public health regulation such as Indonesia's

   Responding states are faced with high expectations in justifying their

   evidence in international trade and investment law and seeks to derive
   lessons for policymakers in developing public health regulation with

Abstract = {{Background: The aim of this study was to see whether lessons could be
   learned from the prospectively maintained nationwide database on
   solitary pancreas transplantation (SPTx) performed in the UK. Methods:
   Two hundred and forty-five SPTx were utilized from the 2004-2013 period
   (113 pancreas transplant alone and 132 pancreas after kidney). The
   statistical analysis included donor, recipient, transplant variables,
   and the effect of a rejection episode on graft survival. Results: Cold
   ischemia time (CIT), CIT > 12 h, donor body mass index (BMI) > 30, and
   non-lymphocyte-depleting induction immunosuppression achieved p-value <
   0.05 in the unadjusted univariate hazard model analysis. In a
   multivariate analysis, variables that persisted in demonstrating
   increased independent risk included CIT > 12 h (hazard ratio {[}HR]
   1.94, p = 0.035) and the use of non-depleting induction
   immunosuppression (HR 1.95, p = 0.002). Factors such as bladder-drained
   grafts and donor variables including age, BMI, and donation after
   cardiac death (DCD) vs. donation after brain-stem death did not attain
   significance. Rejection reduces the overall graft survival by
   approximately 1000 d (1841 +/- 114 d vs. 915 +/- 119 d, p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Cold ischemia time < 12 h and the use of depleting
   antibodies as induction immunosuppression have a positive effect on
   pancreas allograft survival. Other factors such as bladder-drained
   grafts and donor variables such as age, BMI, and DCD status did not
   attain significance in a multivariate analysis.}},

Title = {{Lower pain and faster treatment with mechanico-chemical endovenous
   ablation using ClariVein (R)}},
Journal = {{PHLEBOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To assess the efficacy of the ClariVein (R) system of
   mechanico-chemical ablation of superficial vein incompetence.
   Method ClariVein (R) treatment uses a micropuncture technique and a 4-Fr
   sheath to allow a catheter to be placed 1.5cm from the saphenofemoral
   junction. Unlike laser (endovenous laser treatment (EVLT)) or
   radiofrequency ablation (RFA), no tumescence is required. The technique
   depends on a wire rotating at 3500r/min causing endothelial damage
   whilst liquid sclerosant (1.5\% sodium tetradecyl sulphate) is infused.
   The wire is pulled back whilst continuously infusing sclerosant along
   the target vessel's length. Initially, 8mL of dilute sclerosant was
   used, but this was subsequently increased to 12 mL. No routine post-op
   analgesia was prescribed and specifically no non-steroidal
   anti-inflammatory drugs. Procedure times and pain scores (visual
   analogue scale) were recorded and compared to EVLT and RFA. All patients
   were invited for duplex post-procedure.
   Results Fifty-one great saphenous veins and six short saphenous veins
   were treated and followed up with duplex in the 10 months from July
   2011. No major complications or deep vein thrombosis were reported.
   Duplex showed patency of three treated veins with two more veins having
   only a short length of occlusion, giving a technical success rate of
   91\%. Comparison with 50 RFA and 40 EVLT showed procedure times were
   significantly less for ClariVein (R) (23.08.3min) than for either RFA
   (37.9 +/- 8.3min) or EVLT (44.1 +/- 11.4min). Median pain scores were
   significantly lower for ClariVein (R) than RFA and EVLT (1 vs. 5 vs. 6,
   p<0.01).
   Conclusion Mechanochemical ablation with the ClariVein (R) system is
   safe and effective. After some initial failures, the use of 12mL of
   dilute sclerosant results in a very high technical success rate >90\%
   which accords with the limited published literature. Procedure times and
   pain scores are significantly better than for RFA and EVLT. We await the
   long-term clinical outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Elastography is a promising method for the identification and
   differentiation of malignant tissue in several organ systems. The
   primary aim was to evaluate the inter-and intraobserver reproducibility
   of endorectal strain elastography differentiation of adenomas and
   adenocarcinomas. The secondary aim was to compare the performance of
   strain elastography to endorectal ultrasonography (ERUS) examinations.
   Materials and Methods: Consecutive inclusion of 95 ERUS examinations and
   110 elastography video loops with ERUS overlay mode. Video loops were
   randomized and evaluated by eight observers on two separate occasions.
   Observers were blinded to all clinical information except the
   circumferential location of the tumor. A continuous visual analog scale
   (VAS) and a categorical scale (W-score) were used for elastography
   evaluation. ERUS loops were T-staged according to the TNM classification
   system. Histopathological evaluation of surgical resection specimen was
   used as the reference standard.
   Results: Strain elastography visual evaluation yielded intraobserver
   variability from 0.86 to 0.97 and interobserver variability of 0.99. VAS
   strain elastography differentiation of adenomas (pT0) and
   adenocarcinomas (pT1-4) yielded sensitivity, specificity, accuracy,
   positive and negative predictive values of 0.94, 0.71, 0.89, 0.92 and
   0.78, respectively. The corresponding ERUS values were 0.83, 0.64, 0.79,
   0.88 and 0.54, respectively.
   Conclusion: Visual evaluation of elastography loops is highly
   reproducible in an offline setting with blinded observers, and
   correlates significantly with pT-stages. Strain elastography performs
   better than ERUS and might consequently improve staging.}},

Abstract = {{RAGE is a central driver of tumorigenesis by sustaining an inflammatory
   tumor microenvironment. This study links the soluble forms of RAGE
   (sRAGE and esRAGE) with clinical outcome of melanoma patients. Moreover,
   tissue expression of RAGE was analyzed using immunohistochemistry on two
   independent tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 35 or 257 primary
   melanomas, and 41 or 22 benign nevi, respectively. Serum concentrations
   of sRAGE and esRAGE were measured in 229 Stage III-IV patients using
   ELISA and plasma concentrations of sRAGE were analyzed in an independent
   second cohort with 173 samples of Stage I-IV patients. In this cohort,
   three well-described SNPs in the RAGE gene were analyzed. RAGE protein
   expression was highly upregulated in primary melanomas compared to
   benign nevi in the two TMA (p < 0.001 and p = 0.005) as well as in
   sun-exposed melanomas (p = 0.046). sRAGE and esRAGE were identified as
   prognostic markers for survival as diminished sRAGE (p = 0.034) and
   esRAGE (p = 0.012) serum levels correlated with poor overall survival
   (OS). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that diminished serum
   sRAGE was independently associated with poor survival (p = 0.009).
   Moreover, diminished sRAGE was strongly associated with impaired OS in
   the second cohort (p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis
   including the investigated SNPs revealed an independent correlation of
   the two interacting promoter SNPs with impaired OS. In conclusion, the
   soluble forms of RAGE and variants in its genetic locus are prognostic
   markers for survival in melanoma patients with high risk for
   progression.}},

Abstract = {{Dystrophinopathies may be associated with dilated cardiomyopathy,
   characterized by an impairment of left ventricular ejection fraction and
   potentially complicated by clinical heart failure. Conduction system
   disease and supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias may also be

   muscular dystrophy, intermediate in Becker dystrophy, and lower in
   female carriers. Cardiac follow-up is indicated in any patient with a
   mutation in the dystrophin gene, based on electrocardiogram and
   echocardiography, and must be closer, at least on a yearly basis, in
   patients with the highest cardiac risk. Systematic cardiac workups allow
   an earlier diagnosis of cardiac involvement and a prompt treatment.
   First-line treatments are angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and
   other heart failure treatments, which must be systematically initiated
   at the age of 10 years or earlier in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and

Journal = {{NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1093+}},

Abstract = {{When storm surge and heavy precipitation co-occur, the potential for
   flooding in low-lying coastal areas is often much greater than from
   either in isolation. Knowing the probability of these compound events
   and understanding the processes driving them is essential to mitigate
   the associated high-impact risks(1,2). Here we determine the likelihood
   of joint occurrence of these two phenomena for the contiguous United
   States (US) and show that the risk of compound flooding is higher for
   the Atlantic/Gulf coast relative to the Pacific coast. We also provide
   evidence that the number of compound events has increased significantly
   over the past century at many of the major coastal cities. Long-term
   sea-level rise is the main driver for accelerated flooding along the US
   coastline(3,4); however, under otherwise stationary conditions (no
   trends in individual records), changes in the joint distributions of
   storm surge and precipitation associated with climate variability and
   change also augment flood potential. For New York City (NYC)-as an
   example-the observed increase in compound events is attributed to a
   shift towards storm surge weather patterns that also favour high
   precipitation. Our results demonstrate the importance of assessing
   compound flooding in a non-stationary framework and its linkages to
   weather and climate.}},

Title = {{Low vitamin D levels have become less common in primary
   hyperparathyroidism}},
Journal = {{OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2837-2843}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We compared temporal trends in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid
   hormone (PTH) in two primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) cohorts
   recruited 20 years apart. The prevalence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels
   <20 and <30 ng/mL declined by 30-50 \%, respectively, and was
   accompanied by lower PTH. In the older cohort, higher PTH may be due to
   lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D.
   Introduction Vitamin D deficiency may exacerbate PHPT. Whether there
   have been temporal trends in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels in PHPT
   is unclear. The prevalence of low vitamin D levels (25OHD <20 and <30
   ng/mL) and associated biochemical and bone mineral density (BMD)
   profiles were assessed in two PHPT cohorts recruited over 20 years
   apart.
   Methods This is a cross-sectional comparison of serum 25OHD levels,
   calciotropic hormones, and BMD between two PHPT cohorts recruited at the
   same hospital: the ``old{''} (N = 103) and ``new{''} (N = 100) cohorts
   were enrolled between 1984 and 1991 and between 2010 and 2014,
   respectively.
   Results Mean 25OHD levels were 26 \% higher in the new cohort (23 +/- 10
   vs. 29 +/- 10 ng/mL, p < 0.0001). Levels of 25OHD <20 and <30 ng/mL
   declined from 46 and 82 \%, respectively, to 19 and 54 \% (both p <
   0.0001). Supplemental vitamin D use was common in the new (64 \%) but
   not the old cohort (0 \%). The new cohort demonstrated 33 \% lower serum
   PTH levels (p < 0.0001). Neither serum nor urine calcium differed. BMD
   was higher in the new cohort at all skeletal sites (all p < 0.001).
   Conclusion With the rise in vitamin D supplementation over the last two
   decades, low 25OHD levels are no longer common in PHPT patients in the
   New York area. Those with 25OHD <20 and <30 ng/mL have declined by over
   50 and 30 \%, respectively. The lower mean PTH levels in the new cohort
   are most likely accounted for by higher vitamin D intake. Whether
   improved vitamin D status also underlies the relatively higher BMD in
   the more vitamin D replete cohort of PHPT patients is unknown.}},

Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{777-798}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{This article contends that there are general (but defeasible) reasons
   not to engage in penetrative sex. If there are such reasons, then we are
   able to refute a predominant justification for the current drafting of
   the crimes of rape and assault by penetration. The implication is that
   for such crimes the provision of consent ought to be available as a
   justificatory defence rather than the absence of consent being an
   element of the offence. This argument is developed out of three
   propositions that are substantiated in this article: (i) that there is a
   conceptual distinction between the elements of an offence and a
   justificatory defence that is based upon general reasons against
   performing an act and specified reasons in favour of performing the act;
   (ii) that a general feature of penetrative sex is the application of
   force to a person's vagina or anus; and (iii) that the principle of
   (reflexive) self- ownership is able to explain the wrongness of
   nonconsensual penetrative sex. Given these three propositions, I will
   suggest that there are general (but defeasible) reasons not to engage in
   penetrative sex as the application of force that is required to achieve
   penetration is an infringement of a person's rights of self-ownership.
   This analysis reveals that proponents of the view that there are no
   general reasons not to engage in penetrative sex ultimately presume that
   a person exercises their rights of control over their body in favour of
   sexual activity. The purpose of this article is to isolate, and then
   displace, this presumption.}},

Title = {{Broca's region and Visual Word Form Area activation differ during a
   predictive Stroop task}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{257-270}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Competing theories attempt to explain the function of Broca's area in
   single word processing. Studies have found the region to be more active
   during processing of pseudo words than real words and during infrequent
   words relative to frequent words and during Stroop (incongruent) color
   words compared to Non-Stroop (congruent) words. Two related theories
   explain these findings as reflecting either ``cognitive control{''}
   processing in the face of conflicting input or a linguistic prediction
   error signal, based on a predictive coding approach. The latter implies
   that processing cost refers to violations of expectations based on the
   statistical distributions of input. In this fMRI experiment we attempted
   to disentangle single word processing cost originating from cognitive
   conflict and that stemming from predictive expectation violation.
   Participants (N = 49) responded to whether the words ``GREEN{''} or
   ``RED{''} were displayed in green or red (incongruent vs congruent
   colors). One of the colors, however, was presented three times as often
   as the other, making it possible to study both congruency and frequency
   effects independently. Auditory stimuli saying ``GREEN{''} or ``RED{''}
   had the same distribution, making it possible to study frequency effects
   across modalities. We found significant behavioral effects of both
   incongruency and frequency. A significant effect (p <.05 FWE) of
   incongruency was found in Broca's region, but no effect of frequency was
   observed and no interaction. Conjoined effects of incongruency and
   frequency were found in parietal regions as well as in the Visual Word
   Form Area (VWFA). No interaction between perceptual modality and
   frequency was found in VVVFA suggesting that the region is not strictly
   visual. These findings speak against a strong version of the prediction
   error processing hypothesis in Broca's region. They support the idea
   that prediction error processes in the intermediate timeframe are
   allocated to more posterior parts of the brain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Although undergraduate engineering ethics courses often include the
   development of moral sensitivity as a learning objective and the use of
   active learning techniques, teaching centers on the transmission of
   cognitive knowledge. This article describes a complementary assignment
   asking students to perform an ethics ``experiment{''} on themselves that
   has a potential to enhance affective learning and moral imagination. The
   article argues that the focus on cognitive learning may not promote, and
   may even impair, our efforts to foster moral sensitivity. In contrast,
   the active learning assignments and exercises, like the ethics
   ``experiment{''} discussed, offer great potential to expand the scope of
   instruction in engineering ethics to include ethical behavior as well as
   knowledge. Engineering ethics education needs to extend beyond the
   narrow range of human action associated with the technical work of the
   engineer and explore ways to draw on broader lifeworld experiences to
   enrich professional practice and identity.}},

Title = {{Compensation for Blood Plasma Donation as a Distinctive Ethical Hazard:
   Reformulating the Commodification Objection}},
Journal = {{HEC FORUM}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{401-416}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this essay, I argue that the Commodification Objection (suitably
   redescribed), locates a phenomenon of real moral significance. In
   defending the Commodification Objection, I review three common
   criticisms of it, which claim firstly, that commodification doesn't
   always lead to instrumentalization; secondly, that commodification isn't
   the only route to such an outcome; and finally, that the Commodification
   Objection applies only to persons, and human organs (and, therefore,
   blood products) are not persons. In response, I conclude that (i) moral
   significance does not require that an undesirable outcome be a necessary
   consequence of the phenomenon under examination; (ii) the relative
   likelihood of an undesirable mode of regard arising provides a
   morally-relevant distinguishing marker for assessing the comparative
   moral status of social institutions and arrangements; and (iii) sales in
   blood products (and human organs more generally) are sufficiently
   distinct from sales of everyday artefacts and sufficiently close to
   personhood to provide genuine grounds for concern. Accordingly,
   criticisms of the Commodification Objection do not provide grounds for
   rejecting the claim that human organ sales in general and compensation
   for blood plasma donation in particular can have morally pernicious
   `commodificatory effects' upon our attitudes, for what human organ sales
   provide is a distinctive ethical hazard.}},

Abstract = {{Data to inform fisheries management are often limited in remote or low
   economic value fisheries. Here, we use a Bayesian hierarchical modeling
   structure and two alternative migration timing models to estimate the
   annual escapement of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to the Chignik
   River (Alaska, USA) in years with little data, borrowing information
   from data-rich years to inform parameter estimates. Additionally, we
   examined trends in peak migration timing between 1922 and 2013 and
   relative to environmental conditions. Our analyses show that annual
   escapement estimates are prone to substantial errors unless daily
   escapement is enumerated for at least 7 days after peak migration date.
   Finally, peak migration date was negatively correlated with the strength
   of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in May-August, and increased over
   time, though the significance of these associations was dependent on the
   specific form of the migration timing model used. The modeling approach
   we present here is easily adaptable to similar situations where data
   from alternative periods of time or spatial locations can be used to
   objectively inform local parameter estimates of population
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The partitioning of reproduction among individuals in communally
   breeding animals varies greatly among species, from the monopolization
   of reproduction (high reproductive skew) to similar contribution to the
   offspring in others (low skew). Reproductive skew models explain how
   relatedness or ecological constraints affect the magnitude of
   reproductive skew. They typically assume that individuals are capable of
   flexibly reacting to social and environmental changes. Most models
   predict a decrease of skew when benefits of staying in the group are
   reduced. In the ant Leptothorax acervorum, queens in colonies from
   marginal habitats form dominance hierarchies and only the top-ranking
   queen lays eggs (functional monogyny). In contrast, queens in colonies
   from extended coniferous forests throughout the Palaearctic rarely
   interact aggressively and all lay eggs (polygyny). An experimental
   increase of queen:worker ratios in colonies from low-skew populations
   elicits queen-queen aggression similar to that in functionally
   monogynous populations. Here, we show that this manipulation also
   results in increased reproductive inequalities among queens. Queens from
   natural overwintering colonies differed in the number of developing
   oocytes in their ovaries. These differences were greatly augmented in
   queens from colonies with increased queen:worker ratios relative to
   colonies with a low queen:worker ratio. As assumed by models of
   reproductive skew, L. acervorum colonies thus appear to be capable of
   flexibly adjusting reproductive skew to social conditions, yet in the
   opposite way than predicted by most models.}},

   Adsorption is a promising method to remove the corrosive sulfur in

   characterized by X-ray fluorescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
   BET analysis, thermo-gravimetric/differential scanning calorimetry and
   X-ray diffraction. The results showed that active ions, Ce, Cu, and Ag,
   had highly decentralized into the lattice location of zeolites and
   occupied the cationic position. The adsorbents achieved good adsorption

Title = {{Influence of the Discretization Methods on the Distribution of
   Relaxation Times Deconvolution: Implementing Radial Basis Functions with
   DRTtools}},
Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{184}},
Pages = {{483-499}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The distribution of relaxation times (DRT) is an approach that can
   extract time characteristics of an electrochemical system from
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Computing the
   DRT is difficult because it is an intrinsically ill-posed problem often
   requiring regularization. In order to improve the estimation of the DRT
   and to better control its error, a suitable discretization basis for the
   regularized regression needs to be chosen. However, this aspect has been
   invariably overlooked in the specialized literature. Pseudo-spectral
   methods using radial basis functions (RBFs) are, in principle, a better
   choice in comparison to other discretization basis, such as piecewise
   linear (PWL) functions, because they may achieve fast convergence.
   Furthermore, they can yield improved estimation by extending the
   estimated DRT to the entire frequency spectrum, if the underlying DRT
   decays to zero sufficiently fast outside the measured frequency range.
   Additionally, their implementation is relatively easier than other types
   of pseudo-spectral methods since they do not require ad hoc collocation
   point distributions. The as-developed novel RBF-based DRT framework was
   tested against controlled synthetic EIS spectra and real experimental
   data. Our results indicate that the RBF discretization performance is
   comparable with that of the PWL discretization at normal data collection
   range, and with improvement when the EIS acquisition is incomplete. In
   addition, we also show that applying RBF discretization for deconvolving
   the DRT problem can lead to faster numerical convergence rate as
   compared with that of PWL discretization only at error free situation.
   As a companion to this work we have developed a MATLAB GUI toolbox,
   which can be used to solve DRT regularization problems. (C) 2015

   ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},

Abstract = {{Material removal mechanism depends on the material property and
   machining parameters during machining process. This paper investigates
   the brittle removal mechanism of ductile materials with ultrahigh-speed
   machining. Based on the theory of stress wave propagation, the
   prediction model of critical cutting speed for ultrahigh-speed machining
   is proposed. The predicted critical cutting speed values are then
   validated with ultrahigh-speed machining experiments of Inconel 718 and
   7050-T7451 aluminum alloy at the cutting speeds range from 50 m/min to
   8000 m/min. The experimental results show that fragmented chips are
   produced above the critical cutting speed of 7000 m/min for Inconel 718
   and 5000 m/min for 7050-T7451 aluminum alloy. The scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) micrographs of fragmented chip fracture surface and
   finished workpiece surface are analyzed. Large amounts of cleavage steps
   and brittle cracks are observed on the fragmented chip surface. With the
   brittle cracks remains, the finished surface quality of ultrahigh-speed
   machining is worse than that of high-speed machining. The results show
   that the material property undergoes ductile-to-brittle transition so
   the brittle regime machining of ductile materials can be implemented
   with ultrahigh-speed machining. Taking both the machining efficiency and
   machining quality into account, the ultrahigh-speed machining is
   recommended to apply in rough machining or semifinishing, while
   high-speed machining is recommended to apply in finishing process. In
   the end, the definition and essence of ultrahigh-speed machining are
   concluded. This paper is enticing from both the engineering and the
   analytical perspectives aimed at revealing the mechanism of
   ultrahigh-speed machining and optimizing the machining parameters.}},

   energy effects of exogenous climatic variables; and (2) second-stage
   Tobit regression for further detailed efficiency analysis. A case study
   involving 3-year longitudinal panel data of 189 residential buildings

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to investigate the application value of

   according to the median values of NLR or PLR (NLR low: <4.62 or NLR
   high: 4.62 and PLR low: <235 or PLR high: 235, respectively). Low
   baseline NLR level correlated with improved clinicopathological
   characteristics, including smaller tumor size, well differentiation and
   less metastasis. Low baseline PLR level also associated with less
   metastasis. Patients with a low baseline level of NLR or PLR had an
   improved response to chemotherapy. Patients with a higher baseline NLR
   and PLR had decreased progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
   survival (OS) ratios. Alterations in the NLR and PLR levels were
   associated with therapeutic efficacy and prognosis. The patients who
   remained in or switched to the low NLR level subgroup subsequent to
   first-line chemotherapy had an improved response and improved OS ratios,
   compared to the patients remaining in or switching to the high NLR level
   group. Similar results were observed when the PLR level was

Abstract = {{In this paper, a coupled smoothed finite element method (S-FEM) is
   developed to deal with the structural-acoustic problems consisting of a
   shell configuration interacting with the fluid medium. Three-node
   triangular elements and four-node tetrahedral elements that can be
   generated automatically for any complicated geometries are adopted to
   discretize the problem domain. A gradient smoothing technique (GST) is
   introduced to perform the strain smoothing operation. The discretized
   system equations are obtained using the smoothed Galerkin weakform, and
   the numerical integration is applied over the further formed edge-based
   and face-based smoothing domains, respectively. To extend the edge-based
   smoothing operation from plate structure to shell structure, an edge
   coordinate system is defined local on the edges of the triangular
   element. Numerical examples of a cylinder cavity attached to a flexible
   shell and an automobile passenger compartment have been conducted to
   illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the coupled S-FEM for
   structural-acoustic problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, an extraction method and environmental scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) are employed to reveal the changes in the occurrence
   mode of fluorine in a coal-fired power plant in Inner Mongolia, China.
   The different occurrence states of fluorine during coal combustion and
   emission show that fluorine in coal mainly assumes insoluble inorganic
   mineral forms. The results illustrate that the three typical occurrence
   modes in coal are CaF2, MgF2 and AlF3. The fluorine in fly ash can be
   captured by an electrostatic precipitator (EPS) or a bag filter. In
   contrast, the gaseous fluorine content in flue gas is only in the range
   of several parts per million; thus, it cannot be used in this study. The
   occurrence mode of fluorine in bottom ash and slag is inorganic
   villiaumite (e.g., soluble NaF, KF and insoluble CaF2) which is
   difficult to break down even at high temperatures. The occurrence mode
   of fluorine with the highest content in fly ash is physically adsorbed
   fluorine along the direction of the flue gas flow. The insoluble
   inorganic mineral fluoride content in fly ash is also high, but the
   gradually increasing fluorine content in fly ash is mainly caused by
   physical adsorption. Fluorine in the coal-fired power plant discharges
   mostly as solid products; however, very little fluorine emitted into the
   environment as gas products (HF, SiF4) cannot be captured. The
   parameters used in this study may provide useful references in
   developing a monitoring and control system for fluorine in coal-fired
   power plants.}},

Abstract = {{Novel ternary nanocomposites consisting of poly(vinylidene fluoride)
   (PVDF), surface-modified BaTiO3 (BT) nanoparticles, and reduced graphene
   oxide (rGO) were successfully prepared via a facile solution-processed
   method. The mutual electrostatic assemble of surface modified BT
   nanoparticles and rGO nanosheets paves the way for their homogeneous
   dispersion in the PVDF matrix, which was further confirmed by the SEM
   results. Similar with previously reported percolative systems, the
   obtained ternary PVDF/BT/rGO nanocomposites exhibit a typical
   percolation transition with the percolation threshold lied in the range
   from 0.6 wt\% to 0.8 wt\% of rGO filler. More importantly, the ternary
   nanocomposites not only show a high dielectric constant but also
   maintain rather low dielectric loss below the percolation threshold
   compared with binary PVDF/BT nanocomposites. For instance, a high
   dielectric constant (similar to 87) and relatively low dielectric loss
   (similar to 0.03) at 1 kHz could be achieved for our proposed
   PVDF/BT/rGO nanocomposites at 0.6 wt\% fraction of rGO filler. In
   addition, the dielectric constant of the proposed nanocomposites
   exhibits a temperature dependency over a wide frequency range. On the
   other hand, the fraction of rGO filler also has a remarkable effect on
   the dielectric properties of the nanocomposites. We expect that these
   proposed nanocomposites would be potential candidates for utilization in
   modern electronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Over-activated PI3K/Akt signaling, a pathway strongly related to cancer
   survival and proliferation, has been reported recently to be involved in
   pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell apoptosis and proliferation in
   pulmonary hypertension (PH). In this study, we observed greatly
   increased lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) expression accompanied with over-activated
   PI3K/Akt signaling in a standard rat model of PH induced by
   monocrotaline. In view of the close relationship between Lcn2 and
   PI3K/Akt pathway, we hypothesized that the up-regulated Lcn2 might be a
   trigger of over-activated PI3K/Akt signaling in PH. Our results showed
   that Lcn2 significantly activated the PI3K/Akt pathway (determined by
   augmented Akt phosphorylation and up-regulated Mdm2) and significantly
   promoted proliferation (assessed by Ki67 staining) in cultured human
   pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that
   inhibition of Akt phosphorylation (LY294002) abrogated the Lcn2-promoted
   proliferation in cultured human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. In
   conclusion, Lcn2 significantly promoted human pulmonary artery smooth
   muscle cell proliferation by activating PI3K/Akt pathway. Further study
   on the role and mechanism of Lcn2 will help explore novel therapeutic
   strategies based on attenuating over-activated PI3K/Akt signaling in PH.}},

Journal = {{HABITAT INTERNATIONAL}},

Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{23-34}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Sustainable land use policies are concerned with the kind of world we
   want to live in now, and in future, and therefore inevitably involve
   some form of community involvement or consultation process. Hong Kong's
   sustainable land use planning system is well developed, involving
   considerable community participation and therefore serves as a good
   model for similarly situated cities. However, although there are several
   recent studies involving aspects of its land use planning system, none
   has yet examined the system as a whole from the perspective of
   sustainability.
   To correct this, this paper describes the land use conditions of Hong
   Kong from both demand and supply perspectives, reviewing its statutory
   and administrative procedures of land development and allocation
   together with the sustainable urban renewal practices involved. Problems
   in current sustainable land use planning and management, such as
   difficulties in urban renewal, the inherent shortage of land and the
   lengthy time involved due to need for coordination and responsiveness to
   multiple stakeholders, and outdated and overcomplicated administrative
   processes were also analyzed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Aim: The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between
   genetic mutations in matrix metalloproteinase-10 (MMP-10) and
   susceptibility to pelvic organ prolapse (POP).
   Material and Methods: From September 2011 to December 2013, 263 subjects
   were recruited, including 91 patients with POP (case group) and 172
   non-POP patients (control group). Total MMP-10 concentrations in serum
   were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The genotyping of
   MMP-10 was achieved by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
   All data were analyzed with SPSS 18.0.
   Results: We found that parity, menopause, history of total hysterectomy,
   and family history of POP were all significantly higher in the POP group
   than in the control group (P = 0.017, P = 0.046, P = 0.0029 and P <
   0.001, respectively). Serum MMP-10 levels were obviously higher in the
   POP group than in the control group (P < 0.05). In addition, there was a
   statistically significant difference between the two groups in the
   distribution frequency of the MMP-10 (rs17435959G/C) genotype (P <
   0.05). However, the distribution frequency of the MMP-10 (rs17293607C/T)
   genotype between the two groups showed no significant differences (P >
   0.05). Furthermore, the patients with parity > 2 and postmenopausal
   women had elevated serum MMP-10 levels, and the patients with parity > 2
   and postmenopausal women who carried the G/C+C/C genotype in the MMP-10
   gene had an increased risk of POP.
   Conclusion: We support the view that the rs17435959 polymorphism of the
   MMP-10 gene may be associated with an increased risk of POP.}},

Abstract = {{Thin-walled composite structures are becoming increasingly popular over
   metals for crashworthy applications in the automotive industry due in
   part from advantages such as their higher strength to weight ratio. In
   this study, the analysis of the crash behavior was conducted by means of
   a series of quasi-static axial compression tests and LS-DYNA
   simulations. A set of comparative quasi-static compression tests were
   conducted on simple composite tubes with different lay-up orientations.
   Based on experimental data on load/displacement and on the comparison
   between results of experiments and simulations, the factors affecting
   energy-absorbing capacity were discussed and the mechanism of failure in
   composites during the crushing process was concluded. Load versus
   displacement diagrams confirm that the composite cylindrical attenuator
   shows high energy-absorbing characteristics and efficiencies. The
   energy-absorbing capacity is strongly affected by the ply wrap angle.
   Specific energy absorption increases with the increasing of angle of the
   fiber. Based on the analysis of these experiments and simulations,
   factors influencing the value of specific energy absorption are
   determined and design principles of composite impact attenuators are
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus often have depression
   or depressive symptoms, impaired family functioning and poor quality of
   life. This study aimed to examine relationships among psychological
   variables, including depressive symptoms, family functioning and quality
   of life, for Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes and to explore the
   influencing factors on quality of life for these patients.
   Method: In this cross-sectional study, 257 patients with type 2 diabetes
   and 259 nondiabetic community controls completed the Beck Depression
   Inventory, the Family Assessment Device, and the Quality of Life
   Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form.
   Results: Patients with type 2 diabetes reported significant family
   impairment in the dimension of affective involvement compared with
   nondiabetic community controls (p<0.05). Mean Family Assessment Device
   scores were negatively associated with quality of life scores among
   patients with type 2 diabetes. Age, depressive symptoms, duration of
   diabetes, communication, affective involvement and behavioural control
   were associated with quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes.
   Conclusions: The results indicate that having type 2 diabetes was
   associated with some difficulties with family functioning and that poor
   family functioning was associated with a poorer quality of life.
   Additional factors, including older age, depressive symptoms, duration
   of diabetes, and some dimensions of family functioning, were found to be
   associated with quality of life in Chinese individuals with type 2

Abstract = {{Along with increased complexity of the models used for scientific
   activities and engineering come diverse and greater uncertainties.
   Today, effectively quantifying the uncertainties contained in a model
   appears to be more important than ever. Scientific fellows know how
   serious it is to calibrate their model in a robust way, and
   decision-makers describe how critical it is to keep the best effort to
   reduce the uncertainties about the model. Effectively accessing the
   uncertainties about the model requires mastering all the tasks involved
   in the numerical experiments, from optimizing the experimental design to
   managing the very time consuming aspect of model simulation and choosing
   the adequate indicators and analysis methods.
   In this paper, we present an open framework for organizing the
   complexity associated with numerical model simulation and analyses.
   Named mtk (Mexico Toolkit), the developed system aims at providing
   practitioners from different disciplines with a systematic and easy way
   to compare and to find the best method to effectively uncover and
   quantify the uncertainties contained in the model and further to
   evaluate their impact on the performance of the model. Such requirements
   imply that the system must be generic, universal, homogeneous, and
   extensible. This paper discusses such an implementation using the R
   scientific computing platform and demonstrates its functionalities with
   examples from agricultural modeling.
   The package mtk is of general purpose and easy to extend. Numerous
   methods are already available in the actual release version, including
   Fast, Sobol, Morris, Basic Monte-Carlo, Regression, LHS (Latin Hypercube
   Sampling), PLMM (Polynomial Linear metamodel). Most of them are compiled
   from available R packages with extension tools delivered by package mtk.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption and coadsorption of naphthalene, 1-naphthol and Cd2+ onto
   graphene oxide (GO), chemically reduced graphene (CRG) and annealing
   reduced graphene (ARG) were compared to determine the unique adsorption
   properties of graphene nanosheets. The adsorption capability of organic
   pollutants followed the order CRG > ARG > GO, and all three adsorbents
   showed stronger adsorption to 1-naphthol than to naphthalene. In
   addition to a pi-pi interaction, the strong adsorption of 1-naphthol
   onto graphene nanosheets was mainly attributed to the n-pi
   electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions between the -OH groups of
   1-naphthol and the electron-depleted sites on graphene nanosheets. The
   adsorption of 1-naphthol on reduced graphene materials increased with
   increasing pH and reached a maximum around its pKa, supporting the n-pi
   EDA interaction mechanism. GO with more functional groups on the
   nanosheets over CRG and ARG exhibited a strong affinity with Cd2+. The
   adsorption of Cd2+ onto GO and CRG facilitated the coadsorption of
   naphthalene and 1-naphthol via surface-bridging mechanisms, such as
   cation-pi interactions. Notably, though ARG showed no significant Cd2+
   adsorption, the suppressed coadsorption of naphthalene onto ARG may be
   attributed to the sieving effect by hydrated Cd2+ binding to the
   micropore edges on ARG. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of gestational diabetes mellitus
   (GDM) and pre-pregnancy obesity on macrosomia and large for gestational
   age (LGA).
   STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 587 GDM women
   and 478 non-GDM women from 2012 to 2013. We collected their data of the
   pre-pregnancy weight, sociodemographic data, medical histories, clinical
   treatment, and followed-up the outcomes of delivery including birth
   weight. Multiple logistic regression models were used to test
   associations between pre-pregnant obesity and macrosomia/LGA and between
   GDM and macrosomia/LGA.
   RESULT: Of 1065 women we studied, obese women had 4.17 times and 2.27
   times increased risk of developing macrosomia (95\% CI: 2.52 to 6.91)
   and LGA (95\% CI: 1.60 to 3.21), respectively, than non-obese women
   after adjustment for maternal age, gestational weeks and GDM. We did not
   find GDM is a risk factor for macrosomia or LGA after GDM treatment.
   CONCLUSION: Pre-pregnancy obesity accounts for a high prevalence of
   macrosomia. Interventions that focus on pre-pregnancy obesity have the
   potential to reach far more women at risk of macrosomia.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are considered to be responsible for
   recurrence in breast cancer. The 68kDa Src-associated protein in mitosis
   (Sam68) has been linked to the development and progression of breast
   cancer; however, the posttranscriptional regulation and role of Sam68 in
   BCSC self-renewal remain unclear.Sam68 was ectopically overexpressed or
   knocked down using a siRNA; the self-renewal potential of breast cancer
   cell lines was assessed using flow cytometry, in vitro mammosphere
   culture and a xenograft model in NOD/SCID mice. Activation of
   beta-catenin was assessed by immunohistochemical staining, Western
   blotting, and luciferase reporter gene assays. The ArrayExpress dataset
   GSE45666 was used to identify conserved microRNAs downregulated in
   breast cancer; real-time PCR, Western blotting, luciferase reporter
   assay, and xenografted tumor model were used to confirm miR-204
   regulated Sam68.We found that endogenous Sam68 expression correlated
   positively with the self-renewal potential of breast cancer cell lines.
   Overexpression of Sam68 promoted, whereas knockdown reduced, breast
   cancer cell self-renewal potential in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo.
   The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway was identified as a functional mediator of
   Sam68-induced self-renewal in SKBR-3 and MCF-7 cells. Furthermore,
   miR-204 was found to be frequently downregulated in human breast cancer
   and confirmed to directly target Sam68; miR-204 inhibited the
   self-renewal of breast cancer cell lines by targeting and suppressing
   Sam68.Our study reveals that Sam68 is regulated by miR-204 and may play
   an important role in the self-renewal of BCSCs via activating the
   Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Sam68 may represent a novel therapeutic target
   for breast cancer.}},

Abstract = {{We described a system which could recognize handwritten digits on a
   temperature sensing terminal. In this system, a handwritten digit was
   inputted as a sequence of temperature matrices, subjected to simple
   preprocessing, and then classified by a trainable cascade-correlation
   neural network (CCNN). Before classification, hybrid feature extraction
   was done to improve the recognition rate. The CCNN was trained on a set
   of 800 digits from approximately 40 different writers handwriting on the
   temperature sensing terminal, and tested on 200 digits from other
   writers handwriting on the temperature sensing terminal. Results of
   comparison experiments with three other classifiers indicated that the
   CCNN classifier achieved better results: a recognition rate of 99\% with
   1\% rejection. The recognition rate of the online handwritten digit
   recognizer improved significantly for the temperature sensing terminal.}},

Abstract = {{Nano-sized TiCx/2009Al composites (with 5, 7, and 9 vol\% TiCx) were
   fabricated via the combustion synthesis of the 2009Al-Ti-CNTs system
   combined with vacuum hot pressing followed by hot extrusion. In the
   present study, CNTs were used as the carbon source to synthesize
   nano-sized TiCx particles. An attempt was made to correlate the effect
   of ground CNTs by milling and the distribution of synthesized nano-sized
   TiCx particles in 2009Al as well as the tensile properties of nano-sized
   TiCx/2009Al composites. Microstructure analysis showed that when ground
   CNTs were used, the synthesized nano-sized TiCx particles dispersed more
   uniformly in the 2009Al matrix. Moreover, when 2 h-milled CNTs were
   used, the 5, 7, and 9 vol\% nano-sized TiCx/2009Al composites had the
   highest tensile properties, especially, the 9 vol\% nano-sized

Journal = {{NITRIC OXIDE-BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{Background: Recent studies have reported that NOS3 plays an important
   role in cardiovascular pathology, whereas the association of NOS3 and
   hypertension (HT) has been controversial between African Americans and
   European whites. Here, we aimed to further investigate the genetic
   effect of unexplored loci at NOS3 on the susceptibility of HT in the Han
   Chinese population.
   Methods and results: The association of three polymorphisms; rs4496877,
   rs1808593 and rs3918186 to HT was tested in a case control study that
   included 2012 HT cases and 2210 controls. Association analysis showed
   that there was no significant association between rs4496877, rs1808593
   and rs3918186 of NOS3 and HT in the whole study population.
   Stratification analysis indicated that rs3918186 was significantly
   associated with HT in the >55-year-old population (OR = 1.245, 95\% CI =
   1.010-1.534, P = 0.04). The rs4496877 and rs1808593 were significantly
   associated with HT in the male population (P = 0.015) and <55-year-old
   population (P = 0.025), respectively (OR = 3.254, 95\% CI = 1.257-8.425
   and OR = 1.683, 95\% CI = 1.066-2.657, respectively). Quantitative trait
   analysis showed that there were significant differences in systolic
   blood pressure (SBP) among the genotypes (AA, AT and TT) of rs3918186 in
   the nonintervention populations (P = 0.016). GMDR analysis showed that
   drinking and rs3918186 had significant interaction effects for risk of
   HT.
   Conclusions: The findings of this study indicated that the rs4496877,
   rs1808593 and rs3918186 polymorphisms of NOS3 contribute to the genetic
   susceptibility of HT and that rs3918186 was associated with SBP in the
   Chinese population. Age and gender might modify the genetic effect of
   NOS3 on HT, and drinking significantly interacts with rs3918186. (C)

Abstract = {{Waterborne epoxy coatings were modified by adding mesoporous-TiO2
   nanoparticles (meso-TiO2). In order to achieve proper dispersion of
   meso-TiO2 in the epoxy-based coating and make possible chemical
   interactions between meso-TiO2 and polymeric coating, meso-TiO2 was
   treated with polyethylenimine (PEI) of various molecular weights.
   Corrosion performance of mild steel coated specimens was investigated
   employing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and salt spray
   test. Coatings with meso-TiO2/PEI (600 molecular weight) possessed the
   best corrosion performance among the coating specimens. The EIS results
   showed that the resistance value of coating with meso-TiO2/PEI (600
   molecular weight) was above 9.87 x 10(7) Omega cm(2) which was higher
   than neat epoxy coating. Possible chemical interactions between
   polymeric matrix and treated nanoparticles caused high barrier
   properties and high degree of cross-linking. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{A novel template protection scheme for multibiometrics based on fuzzy

Journal = {{SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{99-109}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, biometrics template protection has been extensively
   studied and lots of schemes have been proposed. However, most of them
   have not considered the forgery, large difference of intra-class and the
   security of unimodal biometrics leakage. And there is no multibiometrics
   template scheme based on the fusion of dual iris, thermal and visible
   face images. In this paper, a novel multibiometrics template protection
   scheme based on fuzzy commitment and chaotic system, and the security
   analysis approach for unimodal biometrics leakage are proposed. Firstly,
   the thermal face images are captured to overcome the forgery. Then, the
   fuzzy commitment is generated from the corporation of error correcting
   code (ECC) and the fusion binary features. Additionally, the dual iris
   feature vectors are encrypted via the chaotic system, and the score
   level fusion based on Aczel-Alsina triangular-norm (AA T-norm) is
   implemented to acquire the final verification performance. Finally, the
   entropy of both mutlibiometrics and unimodal information leakage is
   analyzed to show the security of the proposed approach. The experimental
   tests are conducted on a virtual multibiometrics database, which merges
   the challenging CASIA-Iris-Thousand and the NVIE face database. The
   verification performance decreases from EER of 3 x 10(-2) to 1.163 x
   10(-1) \%, but the multibiometrics template security is enhanced from
   80.53 to 167.80 bits based on BCH ECC (1,023, 123, 170).}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanism of HIV-1 latency is crucial to the viral
   reservoir eradication. Human cellular miRNAs can modulate HIV-1
   expression by targeting of viral RNAs or host gene transcripts. To
   identify miRNAs modulating HIV-1 latency, we determined the miRNA
   expression profiles of HIV-1 latently infected and productively infected
   cells by microarray and qRT-PCR. Among the differentially expressed
   miRNAs, miR-196b and miR-1290 targeted the 3' untranslated region of
   HIV-1 and affected its expression. Ectopic expression of these two
   miRNAs efficiently suppressed HIV-1 production and infectivity. Specific
   inhibitors of these miRNAs substantially counteracted their effects on
   HIV-1, as measured either as viral production and infectivity in
   HEK-293T cells or as HIV-1 RNA expression or viral production in cells
   isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals. Our study emphasizes the role
   of cellular miRNAs in HIV-1 latency regulation, and it suggests that
   inhibitors of miR-196b and miR-1290 could be used to activate latent
   HIV-1. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{Crop root water uptake has strong correlations with transpiration and
   yield. An accurate prediction of crop root water uptake can benefit
   understanding of the law of transpiration and soil water movement. Under
   water and salinity stress, maize root water uptake will decrease because
   of soil water pressure and osmotic head. Usually such reduction of water
   uptake can be expressed by models such as the additive model and the
   multiplicative model. Based on a field irrigation experiment, we
   calculated spring maize root water uptake in this study by setting
   different combinations of water amount and saline concentration based on
   the water balance method. One additive model and four multiplicative
   models of root water uptake were calibrated and verified in order to
   simulate the impact of water and salt stress on root water uptake. The
   result shows that multiplicative models are better than the additive
   model in simulating the experimental data from different treatments.
   Therefore, the multiplicative model is recommended as the optimal model
   of root water uptake of spring maize under water and salinity stress in
   the arid region of north-west China. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{To assess whether global and regional myocardial strains from

   area strain, global longitudinal strain (GLS), global radial strain,
   global circumferential strain, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
   and wall motion score index (WMSI) were measured and compared with the
   corresponding SPECT-detected MISs. Patients were sub-grouped into
   massive MIS group (MIS a parts per thousand yen 12 \%) and small MIS
   group (MIS < 12 \%). Myocardial strains of all the LV segments were
   compared with the corresponding MIS. Global myocardial strain
   parameters, LVEF and WMSI of the patients were significantly different
   from the control group (all P < 0.05) and correlated well with MISs,
   most significantly for GLS (r = 0.728, P < 0.01). Significant
   differences in myocardial strain parameters were found between the
   massive and small MIS groups (all P < 0.05). Receiver operating
   characteristic curve analysis indicated that GLS had a highest
   diagnostic value and when the cutoff was -13.8 \%, the area under the
   curve was 0.84, with the 70.6 \% sensitivity and 87.5 \% specificity.
   Significant differences of myocardial strain parameters were observed
   between segments with and without transmural MIs (P < 0.01). 3D-STE
   myocardial strain parameters evaluated LV global MIS, 3D GLS had the
   highest diagnostic value. It also preliminarily gauged the degree of

   intense and persistent. Such temperature inversions have resulted in the
   worst air quality in the nation. In this paper, the historical
   properties of Cache Valley's winter inversions are examined by using two
   meteorological stations with a difference in elevation of approximately
   100 m and a horizontal distance apart of similar to 4.5 km. Differences
   in daily maximum air temperature between two stations were used to
   define the frequency and intensity of inversions. Despite the lack of a
   long-term trend in inversion intensity from 1956 to present, the
   inversion frequency increased in the early 1980s and extending into the
   early 1990s but thereafter decreased by about 30\% through 2013. Daily
   mean air temperatures and inversion intensity were categorized further
   using a mosaic plot. Of relevance was the discovery that after 1990
   there was an increase in the probability of inversions during cold days
   and that under conditions in which the daily mean air temperature was
   below -15 degrees C an inversion became a certainty. A regression model
   was developed to estimate the concentration of past particulate matter
   of aerodynamic diameter 2.5 m (PM2.5). The model indicated past episodes
   of increased PM2.5 concentrations that went into decline after 1990;
   this was especially so in the coldest of climate conditions.}},

Abstract = {{By considering the nonmonotonic d-wave gap effect, the energy and
   momentum dependence of quasiparticle scattering interference is studied
   in the presence of a single impurity. It is shown that the pattern of
   the quasiparticle scattering peaks in the full Brillouin zone of
   electron-doped cuprate superconductors is very different from that in
   the hole-doped case described by the Octet model. This difference is the
   result of the nonmonotonic d-wave superconducting gap in the
   electron-doped case. As the energy increases, the position of the local
   peaks in the Brillouin zone moves rapidly. In particular, the
   characteristic peaks of the electron-doped cuprate superconductors
   appear between the antinodal and nodal directions, unlike in the
   hole-doped case.}},

Abstract = {{Pink beams are now widely used for small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
   data collection owing to their high intensity. However, the wavelength
   spread of a pink beam is a factor of 100 higher than that of a
   monochromatic beam, thus causing the experimental data to be smeared. To
   reveal the influence of polychromaticity on shape reconstruction, four
   geometric bodies (sphere, cube, helix and long cylinder) were used for
   SAXS data analysis. The results reveal that the influence of
   polychromaticity on the process of shape reconstruction is significantly
   more dependent on the geometry of the body than on its size. Scattering
   objects with smoothed scattering curves can tolerate a higher wavelength
   spread than those with tortuous curves. It is further demonstrated that
   the structural parameters calculated from the smeared data sets have
   little deviation from the ideal ones, which indicates the possibility of
   using a light source with a greater wavelength spread than a
   conventional pink beam for special time-resolved SAXS experiments.
   Finally, it is concluded that SAXS data collected in pink-beam mode can
   be used directly for structural calculations and model reconstructions
   without a desmearing procedure.}},

   In this work, a novel energy-based method is developed that takes

Abstract = {{Great efforts have been made to synthesize ZnO nanowires (NWs) as
   building blocks for a broad range of applications because of their
   unique mechanical and mechanoelectrical properties. However, little
   attention has been paid to the correlation between the NWs synthesis
   condition and these properties. Here we demonstrate that by slightly
   adjusting the NW growth conditions, the cross-sectional shape of the NWs
   can be tuned from hexagonal to circular. Room temperature
   photoluminescence spectra suggested that NWs with cylindrical geometry
   have a higher density of point defects. In situ transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) uniaxial tensile-electrical coupling tests revealed
   that for similar diameter, the Young's modulus and electrical
   resistivity of hexagonal NWs is always larger than that of cylindrical
   NWs, whereas the piezoresistive coefficient of cylindrical NWs is
   generally higher. With decreasing diameter, the Young's modulus and the
   resistivity of NWs increase, whereas their piezoresistive coefficient
   decreases, regardless of the sample geometry. Our findings shed new
   light on understanding and advancing the performance of ZnO-NW-based
   devices through optimizing the synthesis conditions of the NWs.}},

Abstract = {{Prenatal ethanol exposure can cause extensive apoptotic
   neurodegeneration throughout the developing central nervous system
   (CNS), which results in cognitive deficits and memory decline. However,
   the underlying mechanisms need further study. Single-minded 2 (Sim2), a
   transcriptional repressor, is reportedly involved in diseases that
   impair learning and memory, such as Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's
   disease. It is still unknown whether Sim2 is involved in regulating
   ethanol-mediated neuronal injury that might ultimately lead to neuronal
   dysfunction and subsequent learning and memory deficits. To study the
   effects of ethanol on Sim2 expression and neuronal injury, we used
   animal models and cell culture experiments. Our results indicated that
   in SH-SY5Y cells, ethanol exposure increased Sim2 expression and levels
   of cleaved caspase 3, which is a marker for cells undergoing apoptosis.
   Silencing Sim2 expression attenuated caspase 3 activation and cellular
   apoptosis. We also found that protein kinase A (PKA) activation induced
   Sim2 expression, as did ethanol. Inhibiting the PKA signaling pathway
   with H-89 decreased Sim2 expression and cleavage of caspase 3 that was
   induced by ethanol in vivo and in vitro. We further found that PKA
   regulated Sim2 expression at the transcriptional level. These results
   demonstrate that ethanol leads to increased Sim2 expression via the PKA
   pathway, ultimately resulting in apoptotic cell death.}},

Abstract = {{miRNA expression profiles are widely investigated in the major cancers,
   but their specific roles and functions in cancers have not yet to be
   fully elucidated. In this study, miRNA expression profiles were
   determined in clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) and in matched
   normal kidney tissues by using a miRNA microarray platform which covers
   a total of 851 human miRNAs. Differential expression of 74 miRNAs were
   identified between ccRCC specimens and their matched adjacent
   noncancerous tissues, of which 30 were significantly upregulated in
   ccRCCs, and the other 44 were downregulated (fold change >= 2, P <
   0.05). Interestingly, miR-200c was commonly downregulated in ccRCC
   specimens and ccRCC cell lines with significant functional consequences.
   Growth curve and FACS assay indicated that overexpression of miR-200c
   suppressed cell growth and induced cell-cycle arrest at G(0)-G(1) phases
   in SN12-PM6 and 786-O cells. Furthermore, miR-200c could suppress in
   vivo tumor growth of SN12-PM6 cells in mice. Bioinformatics exposed
   cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) as a potential target of miR-200c,
   which was validated using a luciferase reporter assay. Mechanistic
   investigations revealed that miR-200c was directly responsible for
   suppressing the expression of CDK2 in ccRCC cell lines and xenografts.
   Taken together, miR-200c plays an antioncogenic role in ccRCC, through
   controlling cell growth and cell-cycle progression by downregulating the
   G(1)-S regulator CDK2. (C) 2015 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{Domestic goats are important meat production animals; however, data from
   transcriptional profiling of skeletal muscle tissue in goat have thus
   far been scarce. We used comparative transcriptional profiling based on
   RNA sequencing of longissimus thoracis muscle tissue obtained from fetal
   goat muscle tissue (27512850 clean cDNA reads) and 6-month-old goat
   muscle tissue (27582908 reads) to identify genes that are differentially
   expressed, novel transcript units and alternative splicing events. Gene
   annotation revealed that 15960 and 14981 genes were expressed in the
   fetal and juvenile libraries respectively. We detected 6432
   differentially expressed genes and, when considering GO terms, found 34,
   27 and 55 terms to be significantly enriched in molecular function,
   cellular component and biological process categories respectively.
   Pathway analysis revealed that larger numbers of differentially
   expressed genes were enriched in fetal myogenesis or cell proliferation
   and differentiation-related pathways (such as Wnt), genes involved in
   the cell cycle and the Notch signaling pathway, and most of the
   differentially expressed genes involved in these pathways were
   downregulated in the juvenile goat library. These genes may be involved
   in various regulation mechanisms during muscle tissue differentiation
   between the two development stages examined herein. The identified novel
   transcript units, including both non-coding and coding RNA, as well as
   alternative splicing events increase the level of complexity of
   regulation mechanisms during muscle tissue formation and
   differentiation. Our study provides a comparative transcriptome analysis
   on goat muscle tissue, which will provide a valuable genomic resource
   for future studies investigating the molecular basis of skeletal muscle
   development.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose studying the impact of clustering on
   near-duplicate video (NDV) retrieval. The aim is to reduce the search
   space at retrieval time through a pre-processing clustering step
   performed on the dataset off-line and retrieving NDVs based on the
   formed clusters. Our contribution is a novel clustering framework
   inspired by a bioinformatics technique, namely DNA multiple sequence
   alignment (MSA). A series of video keyframes in chronological order is
   represented as an alphabetical genome, analogous to a DNA sequence and
   MSA is employed to automatically partition the NDVs in a video
   collection into clusters. After discussing the advantages and
   shortcomings of the main state-of-the-art clustering approaches for
   video clustering in the theoretical part of the paper, we empirically
   evaluate the performance of the proposed MSA-based framework against
   five clustering algorithms representative of these mainstream
   approaches: Birch, Cure, Dbscan, Expectation-Maximization and Proclus.
   Also, we show that our clustering-based approach, while being
   significantly faster than non-clustering-based n-gram and edit distance
   NDV retrieval techniques, yields better mean average precision retrieval
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In public goods game (PGG), player's cooperative behavior is not pure
   economical rationality, but social preference and prosocial intuition
   play extremely important roles as well. Social preference and prosocial
   intuition can be guided by heuristics from one's neighbors in daily
   life. To better investigate the impacts of heuristics on the evolution
   of cooperation, four types of agents are introduced into our spatial
   PGG. Through numerical simulations, results show that the larger
   percentages of cooperators with independent thought, the easier
   emergence and maintenance of collective cooperative behaviors.
   Additionally, we find that differentia heuristic capability has great
   effect on the equilibrium of PGG. Cooperation can be obviously promoted,
   when heuristic capability of cooperators with independent thought is
   stronger than that of defectors with independent thought. Finally, we
   observe that cooperators with independent thought and defectors with
   independent thought are favorable for the formation of some high quality
   clusters, which can resist the invasion between each other. Our work may
   help us understand more clearly the mechanism of cooperation in real

Abstract = {{This study addresses dynamic positioning technology of deepwater FPSO
   moored to the seabed via a turret based spread mooring system, referred
   to as Position Mooring (PM). In normal weather conditions, the mooring
   system constrains the FPSO to the predefined region. In extreme seas,
   however, the mooring system behaves in a limited fashion to constrain
   the position such that the thruster force is also needed in order to
   avoid damage to the mooring lines. A controller based on structural
   reliability is presented for turret-moored FPSO. First, a mathematical
   model of FPSO in terms of the kinematics and dynamics and the
   environmental disturbance is established. Second, a mathematical model
   of one single mooring line is set up based on the catenary equation.
   Thereafter, the mathematical model for the whole turret mooring system
   is established. Third, a PID and a state feedback controller based on
   structural reliability are designed to ensure mooring lines safety.
   Finally, a series of simulation tests are carried out for a
   turret-moored FPSO. The simulation results show that the dynamic tension
   of the mooring line is effectively reduced due to introduction of a
   reliability index in terms of controller design.}},

Abstract = {{Gemcitabine (GEM) remains a major chemotherapeutic drug for pancreatic
   cancer, but resistance to GEM has been a big problem, as its response
   rate has been decreasing year by year.
   The effect of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDAI) valproic acid
   (VPA) was compared with tranilast and RI-1 as a combinatorial treatment
   with GEM in four pancreatic cancer cell lines, BxPC-3, PK45p, MiaPaCa-2
   and PK59. Cell viability assays were carried out to check the cytotoxic
   effects, western blotting was carried out for DNA repair mechanisms, and
   localization was determined by immunofluorescence.
   The sensitization factors (i.e., the fold ratio of cell viability for
   GEM/GEM plus drug) reveal that VPA increases the cytotoxic sensitization
   to GEM at approximately 2.7-fold, 1.2-fold, 1.5-fold and 2.2-fold in
   BxPC-3, MiaPaCa-2, PK-45p and PK-59 cell lines, respectively. Moreover,
   GEM induces activation of the DNA repair protein H2AX proportional to
   the dosage. Interestingly, however, this effect can be abrogated by VPA.
   These results indicate that VPA enhances GEM-induced cytotoxicity in
   GEM-resistant pancreatic cancer cells, possibly through inhibition of
   DNA damage signaling and repair. Our study suggests VPA as a potential
   therapeutic agent for combinatorial treatment with GEM in pancreatic
   cancer.}},

Abstract = {{A systematical method is presented to derive the state space equations
   of anisotropic magneto-electro-elastic materials of orthogonal
   curvilinear coordinates in Hamiltonian system. Based on the
   three-dimensional theory of magneto-electro-elasticity, the constitutive
   relations and the Lagrangian function of the total potential are
   rewritten in terms of the generalized displacements, i.e.,
   displacements, electric potential and magnetic potential, and their
   derivatives. The Legendre transform is then applied to release the
   Hamiltonian function and the canonical equations are obtained through
   variational operation. The canonical equations in curvilinear
   coordinates, i.e., the desired state equations, can be degenerated
   readily to the ones of spherical coordinates, cylindrical coordinates
   and rectangular coordinates. These equations are also deduced
   conveniently for piezoelectric and elastic materials since these
   derivation are rendered in terms of matrix. As an example of
   application, a magneto-electro-elastic cylindrical shell with four
   simply supported edges is studied when it is bended by sinusoidal load.

Abstract = {{Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are important signaling
   proteins in VEGF signaling pathway which play key roles in inducing
   endothelial cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, vascular
   permeability, inhibition of apoptosis and virus infection. In the
   present study, we isolated and characterized two VEGF genes, LvVEGF1 and
   LvVEGF2 from Litopenaeus vannamei. The deduced amino acid sequences of
   both LvVEGF1 and LvVEGF2 contained a signal peptide, a typical PDGF/VEGF
   domain and a cysteine knot motif (CXCXC). Tissue distribution analysis
   showed that LvVEGF1 was predominantly expressed in lymphoid organ (Oka)
   while LvVEGF2 was mainly detected in gill and hemocytes. The
   transcriptional levels of LvVEGF1 in Oka and LvVEGF2 in gill or
   hemocytes were apparently up-regulated during WSSV infection.
   Double-stranded RNA interference was used for further functional
   studies. The data showed that silencing of LvVEGF1 and LvVEGF2 caused a
   decrease of the copy numbers of the virus in WSSV infected shrimp and a
   reduction of the cumulative mortality rate of shrimp during WSSV
   infection. The present study indicated that LvVEGF1 and LvVEGF2 might
   facilitate WSSV infection, which provided new evidence to understand the
   function of VEGF signaling pathway during WSSV infection in shrimp. (C)

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Set8/PR-Set7/KMT5a methyltransferase plays critical roles in
   governing transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression and
   tumorigenesis. Although CRL4(Cdt2) was reported to regulate Set8
   stability, deleting the PIP motif only led to partial resistance to
   ultravioletinduced degradation of Set8, indicating the existence of
   additional E3 ligase(s) controlling Set8 stability. Furthermore, it
   remains largely undefined how DNA damage-induced kinase cascades trigger
   the timely destruction of Set8 to govern tumorigenesis. Here, we report
   that SCF beta-TRCP earmarks Set8 for ubiquitination and degradation in a
   casein kinase I-dependent manner, which is activated by DNA-damaging
   agents. Biologically, both CRL4(Cdt2) and SCF beta-TRCP-mediated
   pathways contribute to ultraviolet-induced Set8 degradation to control
   cell cycle progression, governing the onset of DNA damage-induced
   checkpoints. Therefore, like many critical cell cycle regulators
   including p21 and Cdt1, we uncover a tight regulatory network to
   accurately control Set8 abundance. Our studies further suggest that
   aberrancies in this delicate degradation pathway might contribute to
   aberrant elevation of Set8 in human tumours.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A series of experiments were conducted in a wave basin (50 in long, 10
   in wide and 5 in deep) generating two waves propagating at an angle by a
   directional wavemaker. When the two waves were selected from a resonant
   triplet, an initially non-existing wave grew as the waves propagated
   down the tank. The linear growth rate of the resonating wave agreed well
   with third order resonance theory based on Zakharov's reduced gravity
   equation. Additional experiments with opposing and coflowing mean
   current with large temporal and spatial variations were conducted. As
   the flow rate increased, the linear growth was suppressed. As reproduced
   numerically with Zakharov's equation, the resonant interaction saturated
   at time scales inversely proportional to the magnitude of the forced
   random resonance detuning It is conjectured that the resonance is
   detuned by the variation and not by the mean of the current field due to
   wavelength-dependent Doppler shift and to the refraction of Wave rays.
   Further analysis of the spectral evolution revealed that while discrete
   peaks appear at high frequencies as a result of dynamical cascading, a
   continuously saturated spectrum develops in the background as the
   current speed increases. Additional experiments were conducted studying
   the evolution of the random directional wave on a dynamical time scale
   under the influence of current. Due to random resonance detuning by the
   current, the spectral tail tended to be suppressed.}},

Abstract = {{Objectisves: The purpose of this study was to identify the independent
   risk factors for fast-track failure (FTF) in cardiac surgery patients.
   Design: A retrospective analysis.
   Setting: A university-affiliated heart center.
   Participants: In a 2-year period, 1,704 consecutive preselected patients
   undergoing elective cardiac surgery were treated according to the local
   fast-track protocol in the postanesthetic care unit (PACU), bypassing
   the intensive care unit (ICU).
   Measurements and Results: Independent risk factors for FTF in the
   univariate regression analysis were tested in a multivariate regression
   analysis. FTF was defined as any transfer of the preselected patient to
   the ICU. FTF was primary when the patient was transferred directly from
   the postanesthetic care unit to the ICU and secondary when the patient
   was transferred from the intermediate care unit or ward to the ICU. FTF
   rate was 11.6\% for primary and 5.6\% for secondary FrF. In the
   multivariate regression analysis, age >70 years, female sex, prolonged
   surgery, and prolonged cross-clamp time could be defined as independent
   risk factors for FTF.
   Conclusions: In a preselected patient population, fasttrack treatment
   could be done with a low FTF rate. Independent risk factors for FTF are
   age, female sex, prolonged surgery, and prolonged cross-clamp time. (C)

Title = {{Coping Responses Among Hospice Family Caregivers: A Confirmatory Factor
   Analysis}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Context. Hospice family caregivers must often cope with significant
   stressors. Research into the ways caregivers attempt to cope with these
   stressors has been challenged by pronounced difficulties
   conceptualizing, measuring, and categorizing caregiver coping.
   Objectives. The purpose of this study was to begin addressing these
   challenges by determining the structure of coping among hospice family
   caregivers.
   Methods. Hospice family caregivers (n = 223) residing in the midsouthern
   U.S. completed the Ways of Coping Questionnaire as part of a
   cross-sectional survey. To examine the validity of various coping
   response factor structures, researchers conducted multiple confirmatory
   factor analyses.
   Results. Although individual coping behaviors were able to be sorted
   into broader ``ways of coping{''} (i.e., first-order factors), data did
   not support the further grouping of ways of coping into more general
   ``families of coping{''} (i.e., secondorder factors). Folkman and
   Lazarus's proposed structure of coping, which comprises eight
   first-order factors or subscales, better fit the data than the tested
   alternatives.
   Conclusion. Despite its broad appeal, grouping ways of coping responses
   into families of coping based on the presupposed nature of the responses
   (e.g., positive or negative) lacked empirical support for this sample of
   hospice family caregivers, which suggests that relying on families of
   coping may oversimplify complex responses from caregivers. Rather than
   trying to characterize coping responses into broader families, hospice
   support for caregiver coping strategies may be more effective when based
   on individualized assessments of each caregiver's ways of coping and the
   consequences of those coping responses on their quality of life. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is atherogenic and LDL
   particles are reduced in diameter in the presence of insulin resistance,
   forming small, dense LDL. This study was conducted to assess the
   relationship between commonly used lipid indices and LDL particle size
   and furthermore to clarify the best surrogate lipid markers that could
   conveniently be used to estimate LDL particle size in children.
   Methods: We determined LDL particle diameter by gradient gel
   electrophoresis in 1578 children aged 10-12 years. At the fasting state,
   the relationships between measured LDL particle size and lipid variables
   {[}total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C),
   high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), atherogenic index
   {[}(TC-HDL-C)/HDL-C, TG/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and LDL-C/apolipoprotein B
   (Apo B) and non-HDL-C (TC-HDL-C)] were analyzed.
   Results: The LDL particle diameter was 26.64 (mean)0.48 (SD) nm in boys
   (n=820) and 26.66 +/- 0.49nm in girls (n=758); there was not a
   statistically significant difference. There were statistically
   significant correlations between LDL particle size and TG or HDL-C
   concentrations (r=0.28 approximate to 0.37), but the correlations with
   LDL-C and ApoB were very weak. The combined lipid measures, such as
   atherogenic index, TC/HDL-C, TG/HDL-C, and LDL-C/HDL-C showed moderate
   correlations (r=0.33 approximate to 0.38) with LDL particle size;
   however, the correlation of non-HDL-C with LDL particle size was weak
   (r=0.18 approximate to 0.19). Simple HDL-C measure appeared to be of
   comparable value to combined lipid measures.
   Conclusions: Our data indicate that various lipid indices are not
   superior to HDL-C levels alone as a clinical tool for estimating LDL
   particle size. Non-HDL-C was less valuable in this aspect.}},

Title = {{The Role of Standing Waves in Driving Persistent Anomalies of Upward
   Wave Activity Flux}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLIMATE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{9941-9954}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Northern Hemisphere stratospheric polar vortex strength variability is
   known to be largely driven by persistent anomalies in upward wave
   activity flux. It has also been shown that attenuation and amplification
   of the stationary wave is the primary way in which wave activity flux
   varies. This study determines the structure of the wave anomalies that
   interfere with the climatological wave and drive this variability. Using
   a recently developed spectral decomposition it is shown that fixed-node
   standing waves are the primary drivers of the linear interference
   phenomenon. This is particularly true for the low-frequency component of
   the upward wave activity flux. The linear part of the flux is shown to
   be more persistent than the total flux and has significant tropospheric
   standing wave precursors that lead changes in the strength of the
   stratospheric polar vortex. Evidence is presented that
   current-generation high-top climate models are able to credibly simulate
   this variability in wave activity fluxes and the connection to polar
   vortex strength. Finally, the precursors to displacement and split
   sudden stratospheric warmings are examined. Displacement events are
   found to be preceded by about 25 days of anomalously high upward wave
   activity flux forced by standing waves amplifying the climatology. Split
   events have more short-lived wave activity flux precursors, which are
   dominated by the nonlinear part of the flux.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure
   deficit (VPD) were observed within small patches of pondcypress
   (Taxodium distichum var. imbricarium) compared with adjacent, largely
   treeless, vegetation communities. These patches, locally called cypress
   domes, displayed increasing differences in microclimate between their
   exterior or edges and interiors with increasing distance toward their
   centers. We sought to assess whether seasonal inundation of these small
   swamps results in a hydrologic switch in which the presence of standing
   water overwhelms the effects of edge distance on microclimate variation.
   Hydrology does appear to exert substantial control over the edge effect
   on microclimate, but the effects of distance from the edge remained
   discernable during periods of inundation. We also studied the effects of
   a wildfire that occurred 2 y before data collection. We expected to find
   warmer and drier conditions in domes affected by recent fire. Contrary
   to our expectations, previously burned domes were either similar to
   unburned domes or, in some cases, cooler and more humid than unburned
   domes, possibly because of vigorous regrowth after fire in these highly
   productive, fire-adapted subtropical ecosystems.}},

   equalizer with a simple adaptive channel estimator to approach the
   near-optimal performance for mobile users. Furthermore, the method can
   be readily extended to the receivers incorporating with time-domain
   equalizers in other wireless communication scenarios such as OFDM
   systems over doubly selective channels. Using the Givens rotation based
   Cholesky factorization, the optimum feedforward and feedback

Abstract = {{Novel polymer composites PEN/PVDF were prepared from poly(arylene ether
   nitrile) (PEN) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) via solution mixing.
   Due to the toughening effect of PVDF, PEN/PVDF blends with 5 wt \% PVDF
   exhibit higher tensile strength (106 MPa) and breaking elongation
   (8.09\%) than pure PEN does. Because of introduction of PVDF and
   interfacial polarization, the dielectric constant of PEN/PVDF blends at
   1 kHz and room temperature increases from 3.3 to 4.5 with increasing
   content of PVDF. The dissipation factor (tan delta) of PEN/PVDF blends
   is relatively low (< 0.04) in a very wide frequency range from 250 Hz to
   100 kHz. The PEN/PVDF blends show certain piezoelectric behavior (d (33)
   from 0.9 to 1 pC/N) due to the contribution of PVDF. After polarization,
   the piezoelectric coefficient d (33) somewhat increases. The results
   suggest that PEN/PVDF blends will have potential application in

Abstract = {{A low on-resistance normally-off GaN double-channel
   metal-oxide-semiconductor high-electron-mobility transistor
   (DC-MOS-HEMT) is proposed and demonstrated in this letter, which
   features a 1.5-nm AlN insertion layer (ISL) located 6 nm below the
   conventional barrier/GaN interface, forming a second channel at the
   interface between the AlN-ISL and the underlying GaN. With gate recess
   terminated at the upper channel, normally-off operation was obtained
   with V-th of + 0.5 V at I-DS = 10 mu A/mm or +1.4 V from the linear
   extrapolation of the transfer curve. The lower heterojunction channel is
   separated from the etched surface in the gate region, thereby
   maintaining its high field-effect mobility with a peak value of 1801
   cm(2)/(V.s). The on-resistance is as small as 6.9 Omega.mm for a
   DC-MOS-HEMT with L-G/L-GS/L-GD = 1.5/2/15 mu m, and the maximum drain
   current is 836 mA/mm. A high breakdown voltage (>700 V) and a steep
   subthreshold swing of 72 mV/decade are also obtained.}},

Title = {{Existence and Stability of a Spike in the Central Component for a

Abstract = {{We study a three-component consumer chain model which is based on
   Schnakenberg type kinetics. In this model there is one consumer feeding
   on the producer and a second consumer feeding on the first consumer.
   This means that the first consumer (central component) plays a hybrid
   role: it acts both as consumer and producer. The model is an extension
   of the Schnakenberg model suggested in Gierer and Meinhardt (Kybernetik
   12:30-39, 1972) and Schnakenberg (J Theoret Biol 81:389-400, 1979) for
   which there is only one producer and one consumer. It is assumed that
   both the producer and second consumer diffuse much faster than the
   central component. We construct single spike solutions on an interval
   for which the profile of the first consumer is that of a spike. The
   profiles of the producer and the second consumer only vary on a much
   larger spatial scale due to faster diffusion of these components. It is
   shown that there exist two different single spike solutions if the feed
   rates are small enough: a large-amplitude and a small-amplitude spike.
   We study the stability properties of these solutions in terms of the
   system parameters. We use a rigorous analysis for the linearized
   operator around single spike solutions based on nonlocal eigenvalue
   problems. The following result is established: If the time-relaxation
   constants for both producer and second consumer vanish, the
   large-amplitude spike solution is stable and the small-amplitude spike
   solution is unstable. We also derive results on the stability of
   solutions when these two time-relaxation constants are small. We show a
   new effect: if the time-relaxation constant of the second consumer is
   very small, the large-amplitude spike solution becomes unstable. To the
   best of our knowledge this phenomenon has not been observed before for
   the stability of spike patterns. It seems that this behavior is not
   possible for two-component reaction-diffusion systems but that at least
   three components are required. Our main motivation to study this system
   is mathematical since the novel interaction of a spike in the central
   component with two other components results in new types of conditions
   for the existence and stability of a spike. This model is realistic if
   several assumptions are made: (i) cooperation of consumers is prevalent
   in the system, (ii) the producer and the second consumer diffuse much
   faster than the first consumer, and (iii) there is practically an
   unlimited pool of producer. The first assumption has been proven to be
   correct in many types of consumer groups or populations, the second
   assumption occurs if the central component has a much smaller mobility
   than the other two, the third assumption is realistic if the consumers
   do not feel the impact of the limited amount of producer due to its
   large quantity. This chain model plays a role in population biology,
   where consumer and producer are often called predator and prey. This
   system can also be used as a model for a sequence of irreversible
   autocatalytic reactions in a container which is in contact with a
   well-stirred reservoir.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal conductivity of single-crystal materials is crucial in the
   fields of lasers and nonlinear optics. Understanding the physical
   mechanism of thermal conductivity in such systems is therefore of great
   importance. In the present work, first principles calculations were
   employed to study the thermal conductivity of the infrared nonlinear
   optical materials, CdSiP2 and AgGaS2. These compounds crystallize in
   similar structures but with an order-of-magnitude difference in thermal
   conductivity. The average Gruneisen paramemeters are -0.8 and -2.6 for
   CdSiP2 and AgGaS2, respectively; these values are indicative of the
   soft-mode phenomenon of acoustic phonons. Crystal structures are
   considered unstable at low temperature through the whole Brillouin zone,
   especially in the region from K-point X to Gamma. Acoustic phonon
   anharmonicity is concluded to be the main factor that determines the
   magnitude of thermal conductivity. (C) 2015 Author(s). All article

Abstract = {{Indole-based receptors such as biindole, carbazole, and indolocarbazole
   are regarded as some of the most favorable anion receptors in molecular
   recognition. This is because indole groups possess N-H groups as
   hydrogen-bonding donors. The introduction of amide groups in the indole
   framework can induce strong binding properties and good water
   solubility. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of
   N-(indol-3-ylglyoxylyl)benzylamine derivatives as novel and simple anion
   receptors. The receptors derived by aryl and aliphatic amines can
   selectively recognize F- based on a color change from
   colorless-to-yellow in DMSO. The receptors derived by hydrazine hydrate
   can recognize F-, AcO-, and H2PO4- by similar color changes in DMSO and
   can even enable the selective recognition of F- in a DMSO-H2O binary
   solution by the naked eye. Spectrographic data indicate that complexes
   are formed between receptors and anions through multiple
   hydrogen-bonding interactions in dual solutions.}},

Abstract = {{We report the investigation of surface properties of Pt/C and Pt Re/C
   catalysts using in situ spectroscopic tools and a fundamental
   understanding of their catalytic performances in glycerol aqueous-phase
   reforming (APR). We found that adding Re to Pt/C improves its activity
   significantly, which is consistent with our previous observation in
   glycerol steam reforming. However, the difference in reaction
   selectivity is much more pronounced in APR. Compared to Pt/C, Pt Re/C
   yielded significantly more liquid products, while the selectivity to H2
   and CO2 decreased by more than 40\%. In operand X-ray absorption
   spectroscopy and attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) with in
   situ capability as well as Raman spectroscopy were employed to
   investigate the catalyst surface properties and the roles of Re. In
   operando X-ray absorption fine structure shows treatment. Additionally,
   ATR-IR using CO as a probe molecule demonstrated that desorption of CO
   from the Pt Re/C surface is more facile than that from Pt/C in the
   aqueous phase. We propose that well-dispersed Re oxide species in the
   proximity of Pt work as the active sites, providing both metal and acid
   functionalities, while the terminal Re-O moiety has little contribution
   to the overall reactivity as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known concerning the sites and the ratios of the lipase
   secretions in insects, therefore we undertook an examination of the
   lipase secretion of fed and unfed adult female Gryllus bimaculatus. The
   ratio of triacylglyceride lipase, diacylglyceride lipase, and
   phosphatidylcholine lipase secreted by fed females in the caecum and
   ventriculus is 1:1.4:0.4. These activities decrease in the caecum by
   30-40\% in unfed females. The total lipase activity (TLA) in the caecum
   is about 10 times that in the ventriculus. Minimal lipase secretion
   occurs before and during the final moult, and remains at this level in
   unfed crickets, indicating a basal secretion rate. In 2-day-old fed
   females, about 10\% of the TLA in the entire gut is found in the crop,
   about 70\% in the caecum, 20\% in the ventriculus, and 3\% in the ileum.
   Lipases in the ventriculus are recycled back to the caecum and little is
   lost in the feces. Oleic acid stimulated in vitro lipase secretion, but
   lipids did not. Feeding stimulated lipase secretion, starvation reduced
   lipase secretion, but this does not prove a direct prandal regulation of
   secretion, because feeding also induced a size and volume increase of
   the caecum. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

   in rat L6 myotubes, mouse NSC-34 motor neurone-like cells, and HepG-2
   human liver carcinoma. Upon 96 h incubation, 2 exhibited a significant
   cytotoxic effect on all three types of cells via activation of two cell
   death mechanisms (apoptosis and necrosis). Complex 2 exhibited better
   potency and efficacy than the canonical cytotoxic drug cisplatin.
   Moreover, during shorter incubations, complex 2 demonstrated a
   significant SOD mimetic activity, and it was more effective and more
   potent than the well-known SOD mimetic TEMPOL. In addition, complex 2
   was able to interact with DNA and, cleave DNA in the presence of sodium

Journal = {{BRAIN AND LANGUAGE}},

Volume = {{151}},
Pages = {{12-22}},

Abstract = {{In this study, healthy volunteers were scanned using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural systems involved in
   processing the threatening content conveyed via visually presented
   ``threat words.{''} The neural responses elicited by these words were
   compared to those elicited by matched neutral control words. The results
   demonstrate that linguistic threat, when presented in written form, can
   selectively engage areas of lateral temporal and inferior frontal
   cortex, distinct from the core language areas implicated in aphasia.
   Additionally, linguistic threat modulates neural activity in
   visceral/emotional systems (amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus and
   periaqueductal gray), and at earlier stages of the visual-linguistic
   processing stream involved in visual word form representations (ventral
   occipitotemporal cortex). We propose a model whereby limbic activation
   modulates activity at multiple nodes along the
   visual-linguistic-semantic processing stream, including a perisylvian
   ``semantic access network{''} involved in decoding word meaning,
   suggesting a dynamic interplay between feedforward and feedback
   processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related
   symptoms among sexual minority (SM) and heterosexual women and the
   influence of social support on the relationship between SM status and
   symptoms. We hypothesized that SM women would endorse higher symptoms of
   PTSD and related difficulties and that social support would moderate the
   relationship between SM status and symptoms. The sample, women seeking
   treatment for PTSD related to interpersonal violence (n = 477; mean age
   = 36.07 years; 22.9\% SM) completed clinician-administered measures of
   PTSD and self-report measures of trauma-related difficulties and social
   support. The rate of PTSD diagnosis was higher for SM women. Social
   support and SM status were significantly associated with suicidality,
   self-perceptions, depression, somatic complaints, and functional
   impairment. The interaction between social support and SM status was
   significant for both functional impairment ( = -.26) and somatic
   complaints ( = -.39). High social support had an equal, positive effect
   among SM and nonminority women, whereas low social support had a greater
   negative impact among SM women. Results suggested the particular
   salience of social support on functioning and symptom severity among SM
   women and the potential importance of including interventions addressing
   social support into PTSD treatments for SM women.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: to translate the Prenatal Psychosocial Profile (PPP) to be
   used in Brazil; to perform its crosscultural adaptation; and to evaluate
   its reliability and validity.
   Design: methodological study.
   Setting: the study was conducted in 10 prenatal care clinics at the city
   of Porto Alegre/Brazil.
   Participants: 241 women pregnant women.
   Methods: the adaptation process consisted in: translation; first version
   synthesis; expert committee evaluation; back translation; pre-test of
   the PPP version in Portuguese (PPP-VP); validation; the data with the
   participants was collected in 2007, by trained student nurses that
   approached the women while they were waiting for prenatal consultation.
   Findings: the mean scores for all subscales were similar to the ones
   found by the original authors; internal consistency was verified through
   Cronbach's alpha, with values of 0.71 for the stress subscale; 0.96 for
   support from the partner; 0.96 for support from others; and 0.79 for
   self-esteem; validity was supported through factorial analysis;
   construct and criterion validities were also established.
   Conclusion: PPP-VP should be used as a tool to obtain a psychosocial
   profile which can lead to nursing interventions that will reduce health
   risk behaviours during pregnancy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Methods This retrospective study included 287 healthy singleton
   pregnancies. The fetal thymus was shown in an axial plane of the upper
   mediastinum. Color Doppler imaging was applied to outline the thy-box:
   ie, the area between the brachiocephalic artery posteriorly and internal
   mammary arteries laterally. Measurements of the lateral and
   anteroposterior diameters of the thymus with and without color Doppler
   imaging were compared.
   Results The thymus was shown in 95\% of the cases (273 of 287) between
   13 and 16 weeks' gestation. The mean lateral thymus diameter +/- SD with
   color Doppler imaging (5.30 +/- 0.7 mm) was significantly longer in
   comparison to the measurement without color Doppler imaging (5.06 +/-
   0.8 mm; P < .001), whereas the anteroposterior diameter was
   significantly shorter (3.19 +/- 0.9 versus 3.26 +/- 0.8 mm; P = .044).
   Normal percentiles of thymus measurements for gestational age were
   constructed.
   Conclusions The fetal thymus can be clearly and accurately shown as
   early as 13 weeks' gestation by using the thy-box. Measurements with
   color Doppler imaging were significantly different from those without
   and hence are preferable, as color Doppler imaging can delineate the
   thymus borders more accurately.}},

Abstract = {{Observational skills, honed through experience with the literary and
   visual arts, bring together in a timely manner many of the goals of the
   medical humanities, providing thematic cohesion through the act of
   seeing while aiming to advance clinical skills through a unified
   practice. In an arts observation pedagogy, nature writing serves as an
   apt model for precise, clinically relevant linguistic noticing because
   meticulous attention to the natural world involves scientific precision;
   additionally, a number of visual metaphors employed in medicine are
   derived from close observation of the natural world. Close reading
   reinforces observational skills as part of integrative,
   multidisciplinary clinical practice. Literary precision provides an
   educational bridge to recognizing the importance of detail in the
   clinical realm. In weighing multiple perspectives, observation applied
   to practice helps learners understand the nuances of the role of
   witness, activating reflection consonant with the viewer's professional
   identity. The realization that seeing is highly filtered through the
   observer's values allows the act of observation to come under scrutiny,
   opening the observer's gaze to disturbance and challenging the values
   and precepts of the prevailing medical culture. Application of
   observational skills can, for example, help observers recognize and
   address noxious effects of the built environment. As learners describe
   what they see, they also develop the communication skills needed to
   articulate both problems and possible improvements within their
   expanding sphere of influence. The ability to craft this speech as
   public narrative can lead to interventions with positive impacts on
   physicians, their colleagues, and patients.}},

Abstract = {{We use an extensive database to compare empirical observations and
   previously proposed empirical models against recently developed
   mechanistic formulations for the induced polarization (IP) response in
   porous media as a function of pore space geometry and interfacial
   chemistry. These comparisons support the argument that the pore-volume
   normalized internal surface (S-por) is the most important geometric
   parameter influencing the polarization. The specific polarizability
   derived from the empirical relationship between imaginary conductivity
   sigma `' and S-por is independent of the porosity. By contrast,
   equivalent specific polarizability terms in recently proposed
   mechanistic models are found to be significantly correlated with
   porosity, and thus do not appear to represent an interfacial chemistry
   factor independent of the pore space geometry. Furthermore, the database
   shows no evidence for a significant decrease in the counterion mobility
   of clayey materials relative to clay-free materials, as postulated in
   recent studies. On the contrary, a single value of c(p) is consistent
   with no significant differences in ionic mobility given that all samples
   were saturated with a NaCl solution close to a common salinity of about
   100 mS/m. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Correlations among and identification of the source volcanoes for over
   60 Late Glacial and Holocene tephras preserved in eight lacustrine
   sediment cores taken from small lakes near Coyhaique, Chile (46 degrees
   S), were made based on the stratigraphic position of the tephra in the
   cores, lithostratigraphic data (tephra layer thickness and grain size),
   and tephra petrochemistry (glass color and morphology, phenocryst
   phases, and bulk-tephra trace element contents determined by ICP-MS).
   The cores preserve a record of explosive eruptions, since similar to
   17,800 calibrated years before present (cal years BP), of the volcanoes
   of the southernmost Andean Southern Volcanic Zone (SSVZ). The suggested
   source volcanoes for 55 of these tephras include Hudson (32 events),
   Mentolat (10 events), and either Maca or Cay or some of the many minor
   monogenetic eruptive centers (MECs; 13 events) in the area. Only four of
   these eruptions had been previously identified in tephra outcrops in the
   region, indicating the value of lake cores for identifying smaller
   eruptions in tephrochronologic studies. The tephra records preserved in
   these lake cores, combined with those in marine cores, which extend
   these records back to 20,000 cal years BP, prior to the Last Glacial
   Maximum, suggest that no significant temporal change in the frequency of
   explosive eruptions was associated with deglaciation. Over this time
   period, Hudson volcano, one of the largest and longest lived volcanoes
   in the Southern Andes, has had >55 eruptions (four of them were very
   large) and has produced >45 km(3) of pyroclastic material, making it
   also one of the most active volcanoes in the SVZ in terms of both
   frequency and volume of explosive eruptions.}},

Abstract = {{Some researchers have been arguing that eyewitness identification data
   from lineups should be analyzed using Receiver Operating Characteristic
   (ROC) analysis because it purportedly measures underlying
   discriminability. But ROC analysis, which was designed for 2 x 2 tasks,
   does not fit the 3 x 2 structure of lineups. Accordingly, ROC proponents
   force lineup data into a 2 x 2 structure by treating false-positive
   identifications of lineup fillers as though they were rejections. Using
   data from lineups versus showups, we illustrate how this approach
   misfires as a measure of underlying discriminability. Moreover, treating
   false-positive identifications of fillers as if they were rejections
   hides one of the most important phenomena in eyewitness lineups, namely
   filler siphoning. Filler siphoning reduces the risk of mistaken
   identification by drawing false-positive identifications away from the
   innocent suspect and onto lineup fillers. We show that ROC analysis
   confuses filler siphoning with an improvement in underlying
   discriminability, thereby fostering misleading theoretical conclusions
   about how lineups work. (C) 2015 Society for Applied Research in Memory

Abstract = {{Welsh, MC, Allen, DL, Batliner, ME, and Byrnes, WC. Revisiting the
   force-joint angle relationship after eccentric exercise. J Strength Cond
   Res XX(X): 000-000, 2015The purpose of this study was to evaluate
   force-angle curve fitting techniques pre-eccentric exercise, quantify
   changes in curve characteristics postexercise, and examine the
   relationship between curve changes and markers of muscle damage.
   Fourteen males unaccustomed to eccentric exercise performed 60 eccentric
   muscle actions of the elbow flexors. Maximal voluntary isometric force
   was measured throughout a range of angles pre- (Pre1 and Pre2),
   immediately post (IP), and 1, 2, 4, and 7 days postexercise. Force-angle
   curves for each visit were constructed using second-order polynomials.
   Changes in curve characteristics (optimal angle, peak force, curve
   height), range of motion, soreness, and creatine kinase activity were
   quantified. Optimal joint angle and force at optimal angle were
   significantly correlated from Pre1 to Pre2 (ICC = 0.821 and 0.979,
   respectively). Optimal angle was significantly right shifted (p = 0.035)
   by 10.4 +/- 12.9 degrees from Pre2 to IP and was restored by 1 day post
   exercise. Interestingly, the r(2) value for curve fit was significantly
   decreased (p < 0.001) from Pre2 (r(2) = 0.896) to IP (r(2) = 0.802) and
   1 day post exercise (r(2) = 0.750). Curve height was significantly
   decreased (39\%) IP and restored to pre-exercise height by 4 days
   postexercise. There was no correlation between optimal angle or curve
   height and other damage markers. In conclusion, force-angle
   relationships can be accurately described using second-order
   polynomials. After eccentric exercise, the force-angle curve is
   flattened and shifted (downward and rightward), but these changes are
   not correlated to other markers of muscle damage. Changes in the
   force-angle relationship are multifaceted, but determining the
   physiological significance of these changes requires further
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is characterized by bone marrow fibrosis,
   myeloproliferation, extramedullary hematopoiesis, splenomegaly and
   leukemic progression. Moreover, the bone marrow and spleens of
   individuals with PMF contain large numbers of atypical megakaryocytes
   that are postulated to contribute to fibrosis through the release of
   cytokines, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Although the
   Janus kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib provides symptomatic relief, it does
   not reduce the mutant allele burden or substantially reverse fibrosis.
   Here we show through pharmacologic and genetic studies that aurora
   kinase A (AURKA) represents a new therapeutic target in PMF. Treatment
   with MLN8237, a selective AURKA inhibitor, promoted polyploidization and
   differentiation of megakaryocytes with PMF-associated mutations and had
   potent antifibrotic and antitumor activity in vivo in mouse models of
   PMF. Moreover, heterozygous deletion of Aurka was sufficient to
   ameliorate fibrosis and other PMF features in vivo. Our data suggest
   that megakaryocytes drive fibrosis in PMF and that targeting them with
   AURKA inhibitors has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) publishes
   evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of papillary thyroid
   carcinoma (PTC). We sought to identify factors associated with receiving
   treatment compliant with the 2006 ATA guidelines for advanced-stage PTC.
   Methods. The 2006 ATA guideline compliance was examined in patients with
   stage III and IV PTC extrapolated from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
   End Results (SEER).
   Results. Sixty percent of patients received ATA-compliant treatment. A
   stepwise increase in compliance occurred between 2006 and 2009 (p-value
   trend = .0003). Age 45 to 64 years versus >= 65 (odds ratio {[}OR] =
   0.682; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 0.57-0.81; p <. 0001) and
   higher income (p trend = .012) were associated with an increased
   likelihood of receiving ATA-compliant care. African Americans (OR =
   0.56; 95\% CI = 0.42-0.76; p - .0001) and single patients (OR = 0.81;
   95\% CI = 0.67-0.97; p = .02) were less likely to receive ATA-compliant
   care.
   Conclusion. This study highlights specific populations at risk for
   receiving non-ATA-compliant care for PTC and underscores the need to
   further implement guideline-based practice. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{To acquire epidemiological data on the bovine viral diarrhea virus
   (BVDV) and identify cattle persistently infected (PI) with this virus,
   4,327 samples from Holstein dairy cows were screened over a four-year
   period in Beijing, China. Eighteen BVD viruses were isolated, 12 from PI
   cattle. Based on genetic analysis of their 5'-untranslated region
   (5'-UTR), the 18 isolates were assigned to subgenotype BVDV-1m, 1a, 1d,
   1q, and 1b. To investigate the innate immune responses in the
   peripheral-blood mononuclear cells of PI cattle, the expression of
   Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors, interferon-alpha
   (IFN-beta), IFN-beta, myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1 (MX1),
   and interferon stimulatory gene 15 (ISG15) was assessed by qPCR. When
   compared with healthy cattle, the expression of TLR-7, IFN-alpha, and
   IFN-beta mRNA was downregulated, but the expression of MX1 and ISG-15
   mRNA was upregulated in PI cattle. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that
   the expression of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and IRF-7 was
   lower in PI cattle than in healthy cattle. Thus, BVDV-1m and la are the
   predominant subgenotypes in the Beijing region, and the strains are
   highly divergent. Our findings also suggest that the TLR-7/IRF-7
   signaling pathway plays a role in evasion of host restriction by BVDV.}},

   this value for SCC was 145.07 X 10(-6) m(2) (p = 0.000132). The mean
   circumference of AC cells was 42.43 X 10(-6) m, while for SCC cells it
   was 46.67 X 10(-6) m (p = 0.00). AC cell diameter was 13.83 mu m,

   directly resolve past misdeeds. Behavioral cleansing involves
   counter-balancing across multiple dimensions of the moral self whereby
   threats in one subdomain are alleviated by bolstering a separate
   subdomain. Symbolic cleansing includes restitution behaviors that are
   only symbolically connected to the provoking moral threat, such as
   physical or ritual cleansing. The moral cleansing literature seeks to

Abstract = {{Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology with the Pacific
   Biosciences (PacBio) RS II platform offers the potential to obtain
   full-length coding regions (similar to 1100-bp) from MHC class I cDNAs.
   Despite the relatively high error rate associated with SMRT technology,
   high quality sequences can be obtained by circular consensus sequencing
   (CCS) due to the random nature of the error profile. In the present
   study we first validated the ability of SMRT-CCS to accurately identify
   class I transcripts in Mauritian-origin cynomolgus macaques (Macaca
   fascicularis) that have been characterized previously by cloning and
   Sanger-based sequencing as well as pyrosequencing approaches. We then
   applied this SMRT-CCS method to characterize 60 novel full-length class
   I transcript sequences expressed by a cohort of cynomolgus macaques from
   China. The SMRT-CCS method described here provides a straightforward
   protocol for characterization of unfragmented single-molecule cDNA
   transcripts that will potentially revolutionize MHC class I allele
   discovery in nonhuman primates and other species. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{It was shown in previous work that the one-variable (mu) over cap
   -function defined by Zwegers (and Zagier) and his indefinite theta
   series attached to lattices of signature (r+1, 1) are both Heisenberg
   harmonic Maass-Jacobi forms. We extend the concept of Heisenberg
   harmonicity to Maass-Jacobi forms of arbitrary many elliptic variables,
   and produce indefinite theta series of `` product type{''} for
   non-degenerate lattices of signature (r+s, s). We thus obtain a clean
   generalization of (mu) over cap to these negative definite lattices.
   From restrictions to torsion points of Heisenberg harmonic Maass-Jacobi
   forms, we obtain harmonic weak Maass forms of higher depth in the sense
   of Zagier and Zwegers. In particular, we explain the modular completion
   of some, so-called degenerate indefinite theta series in the context of
   higher depth mixed mock modular forms. The structure theory for
   Heisenberg harmonic Maass-Jacobi forms developed in this paper also
   explains a curious splitting of Zwegers's two-variable (mu) over cap
   -function into the sum of a meromorphic Jacobi form and a one-variable
   Maass-Jacobi form.}},

Abstract = {{Zusammenfassung Die nicht-invasive Beatmung (NIV) ist in der klinischen
   Medizin weit verbreitet und hat mittlerweile einen hohen Stellenwert im
   klinischen Alltag erlangt. Der Einsatz der NIV reduziert die Intensiv-
   und Krankenhausaufenthaltsdauer sowie die Mortalitat von Patienten mit
   akutem hyperkapnischen Atemversagen. Patienten mit akuter
   respiratorischer Insuffizienz im Rahmen eines Lungenodems sollten neben
   den notwendigen kardiologischen Interventionen mit CPAP oder NIV
   behandelt werden. Bei anderen Formen des akuten hypoxamischen
   Atemversagens wird empfohlen, den Einsatz der NIV auf lediglich mildes
   ARDS zu begrenzen, da eine NIV bei schweren Formen mit hoheren Raten von
   Therapieversagen und Mortalitat assoziiert ist. Im Weaning von invasiver
   Beatmung reduziert die NIV die Reintubationsraten im Wesentlichen bei
   hyperkapnischen Patienten. Eine verzogerte Intubation bei Auftreten
   eines NIV-Versagens fuhrt zu einem Anstieg der Mortalitat und sollte
   deshalb vermieden werden. Bei entsprechendem Monitoring auf der
   Intensivstation kann die NIV auch bei padiatrischen Patienten mit akuter
   respiratorischer Insuffizienz erfolgreich eingesetzt werden. Weiterhin
   kann im Rahmen der Palliativmedizin die NIV hilfreich bei der Reduktion
   von Dyspnoe und Verbesserung von Lebensqualitat sein. Ziel des Updates
   dieser Leitlinie ist es, unter Berucksichtigung der zunehmenden
   aktuellen wissenschaftlichen Evidenz, sowohl die Vorteile als auch die
   Limitationen der NIV in der Behandlung der akuten respiratorischen
   Insuffizienz in der taglichen klinischen Praxis und bei verschiedenen
   Indikationen aufzuzeigen.
   Abstract The non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is widespread in the
   clinical medicine and has attained meanwhile a high value in the
   clinical daily routine. The application of NIV reduces the length of ICU
   stay and hospitalization as well as mortality of patients with
   hypercapnic acute respiratory failure. Patients with acute respiratory
   failure in context of a cardiopulmonary edema should be treated in
   addition to necessary cardiological interventions with continuous
   positive airway pressure (CPAP) or NIV. In case of other forms of acute
   hypoxaemic respiratory failure it is recommended the application of NIV
   to be limited to mild forms of ARDS as the application of NIV in severe
   forms of ARDS is associated with higher rates of treatment failure and
   mortality. In weaning process from invasive ventilation the NIV reduces
   the risk of reintubation essentially in hypercapnic patients. A delayed
   intubation of patients with NIV failure leads to an increase of
   mortality and should therefore be avoided. With appropriate monitoring
   in intensive care NIV can also be successfully applied in pediatric
   patients with acute respiratory insufficiency. Furthermore NIV can be
   useful within palliative care for reduction of dyspnea and improving
   quality of life. The aim of the guideline update is, taking into account
   the growing scientific evidence, to outline the advantages as well as
   the limitations of NIV in the treatment of acute respiratory failure in
   daily clinical practice and in different indications.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented to examine consecutive in-situ X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) diffractograms using exploratory factor analysis. Systematic
   changes in the diffractograms are described numerically by score values
   that could be used to correlate diffraction data with other
   non-stationary sample properties. Phase and structure evolution in a
   reacting material can be studied by in-situ XRD. The consecutively
   collected data can be considered a time series of datasets. Time series
   are non-stationary data. Such non-stationary data are often hard to
   examine fully by conventional evaluation methods including applications
   of the Rietveld method. Here a method is presented to avoid shortcomings
   of conventional evaluation methods. The new method helps to identify and
   describe significant systematic changes in in-situ XRD datasets by
   numerical values. These systematic changes can represent structural
   changes as well as changes in phase composition. The method can be used
   to describe the development of the complex processes of compositional
   and structural changes. The method is demonstrated using the example of
   a hydrating Portland cement mortar. This hydration process involves at
   least 11 phases including non-crystalline phases. In the presented
   example factor analysis of in-situ XRD data results in three variables
   (factors) describing the observed changes numerically. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Nervous and neuroendocrine systems mediate environmental conditions to
   control a variety of life history traits. Our goal was to provide
   mechanistic insights as to how neurosecretory signals mediate division
   of labor in the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Worker division of labor is
   based on a process of behavioral maturation by individual bees, which
   involves performing in-hive tasks early in adulthood, then transitioning
   to foraging for food outside the hive. Social and nutritional cues
   converge on endocrine factors to regulate behavioral maturation, but
   whether neurosecretory systems are central to this process is not known.
   To explore this, we performed transcriptomic profiling of a
   neurosecretory region of the brain, the pars intercerebralis (PI). We
   first compared PI transcriptional profiles for bees performing in-hive
   tasks and bees engaged in foraging. Using these results as a baseline,
   we then performed manipulative experiments to test whether the PI is
   responsive to dietary changes and/or changes in juvenile hormone (JH)
   levels. Results reveal a robust molecular signature of behavioral
   maturation in the PI, with a subset of gene expression changes
   consistent with changes elicited by JH treatment. In contrast, dietary
   changes did not induce transcriptomic changes in the PI consistent with
   behavioral maturation or JH treatment. Based on these results, we
   propose a new verbal model of the regulation of division of labor in
   honey bees in which the relationship between diet and nutritional
   physiology is attenuated, and in its place is a relationship between
   social signals and nutritional physiology that is mediated by JH.}},

Abstract = {{Rock pools can be found in inter-tidal marine environments worldwide;
   however, there have been few studies exploring what drives their, fish
   species composition, especially in Australia. The rock-pool environment
   is highly dynamic and offers a unique natural laboratory to study the
   habitat choices, physiological limitations and adaptations of
   inter-tidal fish species. In this study rock pools of the Sydney region
   were sampled to determine how the physical (volume, depth, rock cover
   and vertical position) and biological (algal cover and predator
   presence) parameters of pools influence fish distribution and abundance.
   A total of 27 fish species representing 14 families was observed in tide
   pools at the four study locations. The five most abundant species were
   Bathygobius cocosensis, Centropogon australis, Enneapterygius
   atrogulare, Lepidoblennius haplodactylus and Microcanthus strigatus,
   which together represented 71\% of the total number of fish recorded.
   Larger rock pools containing more algal and rock ledge cover hosted a
   larger and more diverse population of fish. Furthermore, certain species
   were only found in pools with specific characteristics, such as the
   presence of loose shells, a variety algae or rock cover, suggesting a
   high degree of habitat specificity. By contrast, some species were
   ubiquitous and thus can likely tolerate a wide variety of physical

Abstract = {{Relations between perceiving and knowing are well-worn problems that
   become visceral encounters with doubt and ambiguity in `mixed-reality'
   environments. Locative narrative situates participants within stories
   where existent places function as the setting. Experiential confusion,
   between what is talked of as real and as imagined, is an often-reported
   phenomenon. Classical pragmatisms, and more broadly the writings of
   William James, understand the functioning of the body to be for the
   production of action, from which flows a naturalistic epistemology. For
   James, a thought's reference to an object occurs in the medium of an
   `experienceable environment' and is a condition of it being known; what
   something is known-as is how it functions in a particular context and
   the consequences that follow. Contemporary pragmatists express varying
   positions on the function of representation in perception at different
   levels of cognitive awareness, and the extent to which intentionality is
   derivative of linguistic norms. In the locative narrative iOS
   application The Lost Index No. 1-Landscape with Figures strategies of
   directing participant attention, movement, cognitive tasks and
   propositional content are used to guide the interpretation of events.
   The complex environment that is created plays with the multi-stability
   of perception and the `multi-stability meaning' between terms, resulting
   in ambiguity and an enhanced flexibility of interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{Infectious diseases are still the leading cause of death in the world.
   The accurate technique for early detection and determination of the
   exact location of infection in the body is still needed. Nuclear
   techniques are capable for this purpose while other techniques such as
   MRI, USG and CT-SCAN sometimes cannot be applied. Tc-99m-kanamycin
   radiopharmaceutical is complex of kanamycin and technetium-99m
   radionuclide, was used for bacterial detection of infection. The
   labeling studies of Tc-99m-kanamycin has been carried out by the
   indirect labeling method using pyrophosphate as a co-ligand with the
   results of labeling efficiency above 95\%. However, the presence of
   radiochemical impurities in the form of Tc-99m-pyrophosphate in the
   indirect labeling have to be considered which may interfere the imaging
   result. This study aimed to determine the optimum labeling conditions of
   Tc-99m-kanamycin by direct labeling method. Kanamycin was successfully
   labeled with technetium-99m through direct labeling method. The labeling
   efficiency was determined by ascending paper chromatography using
   Whatman 3 paper as the stationary phase, and acetone as the mobile phase
   to separate the radiochemical impurities in the form of
   Tc-99m-pertechnetate. While impurities in the form of Tc-99m-reduced
   were separated using the stationary phase ITLC-SG and 0.5 N NaOH as
   mobile phase. The experiment result showed that the optimum labeling
   conditions obtained by using 5 mg kanamycin, 30 mu g SnCl2 center dot
   2H(2)O, and pH of labeling was 9. The incubation time of labeling was 30
   min at room temperature, provided labeling efficiency of 92.31 +/- 1.74
   \%. The successful of kanamycin labeling with high efficiency makes
   Tc-99m-kanamycin can potentially be used as a radiopharmaceutical for
   the early detection of infectious diseases. (c) 2015 Atom Indonesia. All

Abstract = {{Background. Psychiatric disorders are common in the US and represent a
   major health disparity but little is known about their impact on
   surgical management and outcomes in cancer.
   Objective. The aim of this study was to determine whether rectal cancer
   patients with psychiatric diagnoses have fewer sphincter-preserving
   procedures and higher postoperative complications.
   Methods. Overall, 23,914 patients from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample
   (NIS) who underwent surgery for rectal cancer from 2004 to 2011 were
   identified. Patients with comorbid common psychiatric diagnoses were
   identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
   (ICD-9) codes. Main outcomes were measured by operation performed,
   length of stay (LOS), postoperative complications, and discharge
   disposition.
   Results. Twenty percent of patients had a psychiatric diagnosis, with
   substance use being the most common psychiatric disorder (63 \%).
   Patients with psychiatric diagnoses were more likely to be younger,
   White, have lower income, and have Medicaid insurance (p < 0.001) than
   those without. In a logistic regression model, patients with any
   psychiatric diagnosis were less likely to have sphincter-sparing
   surgery, controlling for patient sociodemographics, Charlson score,
   hospital procedure volume, and year (odds ratio 0.77; 95 \% CI
   0.72-0.83). LOS and postoperative complications were similar among the
   cohorts. Patients with psychiatric disorders were more likely to have
   home health care at discharge (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions. Fewer sphincter-sparing procedures were performed on rectal
   cancer patients with psychiatric diagnoses. However, no significant
   differences in postoperative complications were observed.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. An in vitro study of the intervertebral disc (IVD)
   structure using 9.4T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   Objective. Investigate the potential of ultrahigh-field strength MRI for
   higher quality 3-dimensional (3D) volumetric MRI datasets of the IVD to
   better distinguish structural details.
   Summary of Background Data. MRI has the advantages of being
   nondestructive and 3D in comparison to most techniques used to obtain
   the structural details of biological tissues, however, its poor image
   quality at higher resolution is a limiting factor. Ultrahigh-field MRI
   could improve the imaging of biological tissues but the current
   understanding of its application for spinal tissue is limited.
   Methods. 2 ovine spinal segments (C7-T1, T2-T3) containing the IVD were
   separately imaged using 2 sequences; 3D spin echo (multislice-multiecho)
   pulse sequence for the C7-T1 sample and 3D gradient echo
   (fast-low-angle-shot) pulse sequence for the T2-T3 sample. The C7-T1
   sample was subsequently decalcified and imaged again using the same
   scanning parameters. Histological sections obtained from the decalcified
   sample were stained followed by digital scanning. Observations from
   corresponding MRI slices and histological sections were compared as a
   method of confirmation of morphology captured under MRI. The
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and
   relative-contrast values were calculated for quantitative evaluation of
   image quality.
   Results. Measurements from histology sections and corresponding MRI
   slices matched well. Both sequences revealed finer details of the IVD
   structure. Under the spin echo sequence, the annulus lamellae
   architecture was distinguishable and the SNR and CNR values were higher.
   The relative contrast was considerably higher between high (nucleus) and
   low (bone) signal constituents, but between the nucleus and the annulus
   the relative contrast was low. Under the gradient echo sequence,
   although the relative contrasts between constituents were poor, the
   fiber orientation was clearly manifested.
   Conclusion. The obtained positive results demonstrate the potential of
   ultrahigh-field strength MRI to nondestructively capture the IVD
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely
   prescribed for mood and other disorders. However, their neural effects
   are difficult to study due to patient compliance and drug history
   variability, and rarely studied in those prescribed SSRIs for non-mood
   disorders. Here we evaluated SSRI effects on neural volumetrics in
   depressed and nondepressed monkeys.
   Methods: 42 socially-housed cynomolgus monkeys were randomized to
   treatment balanced on pretreatment depressive behavior and body weight.
   Monkeys were trained for oral administration of placebo or 20 mg/kg
   sertraline HCl daily for 18 months and depressive and anxious behavior
   recorded. Volumes of neural regions of interest in depression were
   measured in magnetic resonance images and analyzed by 2 (depressed,
   nondepressed) x 2 (placebo, sertraline) ANOVA.
   Results: Sertraline reduced anxiety (p = 0.04) but not depressive
   behavior (p = 0.43). Left Brodmann's Area (BA) 32 was smaller in
   depressed than nondepressed monkeys (main effect of depression: p <
   0.05). Sertraline and depression status interacted to affect volumes of
   left Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), left BA24, right hippocampus (HC),
   and right anterior HC (sertraline x depression interactions: all p's <
   0.05). In the Placebo group, depressed monkeys had smaller right
   anterior HC and left ACC than nondepressed monkeys. In nondepressed
   monkeys, sertraline reduced right HC volume, especially right anterior
   HC volume. In depressed monkeys sertraline increased left ACC volume. In
   nondepressed monkeys, sertraline reduced left BA24 volumes resulting in
   smaller BA24 volumes in nondepressed than sertraline-treated depressed
   monkeys.
   Conclusions: These observations suggest that SSRIs may differentially
   affect neural structures in depressed and nondepressed individuals. (C)

Abstract = {{The parasitic ichneumon fly, discovered by European natural philosophers
   in the seventeenth century, remained largely unstudied until it captured
   the attention of Enlightenment-era natural historians. Although this
   sudden surge of interest has been explained as an effort to understand
   the natural evil' of parasitism, the heyday of ichneumon studies was
   actually inspired by the political and agricultural context of late
   eighteenth-century Britain. British naturalists were captivated by this
   insect for reasons both philosophical and practical. In the
   providentially self-equilibrating qualities of natural' ichneumon
   economies, they saw solutions to political problems of famine, dearth,
   national wealth, governance and excess population, in addition to
   finding reassurance that Enlightened confidence in nature's inherent
   stability and fruitfulness was not unfounded.}},

Title = {{Finding the Balance: Fertility Control for the Management of Fragmented
   Populations of a Threatened Rock-Wallaby Species}},
Journal = {{ANIMALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Simple Summary: Black-flanked rock-wallabies (Petrogale lateralis
   lateralis) can reach high numbers in fragmented populations in the West
   Australian wheat-belt, where they can damage crops and cause habitat
   degradation. As they are threatened, we wanted a non-permanent control
   method that did not adversely affect the body condition of treated
   females compared to untreated females, using body condition as an
   indicator of general health and fitness. We gave adult female
   rock-wallabies deslorelin contraceptive implants to suppress their
   fertility and monitored the impact for three years. Treated females did
   not conceive new young for over two years. We did not detect any
   negative effects on body condition, suggesting that deslorelin may be an
   effective tool for managing overabundant populations of marsupials.
   Populations of Australian marsupials can become overabundant, resulting
   in detrimental impacts on the environment. For example, the threatened
   black-flanked rock-wallaby (Petrogale lateralis lateralis) has
   previously been perceived as overabundant and thus ` unwanted' when they
   graze crops and cause habitat degradation. Hormonally-induced fertility
   control has been increasingly used to manage population size in other
   marsupials where alternative management options are not viable. We
   tested whether deslorelin, a superagonist of gonadotropin-releasing
   hormone (GnRH), would suppress reproduction in free-living adult female
   rock-wallabies without adversely impacting body condition. We trapped,
   synchronised reproduction and allocated female rock-wallabies to a
   placebo implant (control, n = 22), one (n = 22) or two (n = 20)
   subcutaneous implants of deslorelin. Females were then recaptured over
   the following 36 months to monitor reproduction, including Luteinising
   Hormone levels, and body condition. Following treatment, diapaused
   blastocysts reactivated in five females and the resulting young were
   carried through to weaning. No wallabies treated with deslorelin,
   conceivede a new young for at least 27 months. We did not observe
   adverse effects on body condition on treated females. We conclude that
   deslorelin implants are effective for the medium-term suppression of
   reproduction in female black-flanked rock-wallabies and for managing
   overabundant populations of some marsupials.}},

Title = {{Quantity and quality of food losses along the Swiss potato supply chain:
   Stepwise investigation and the influence of quality standards on losses}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{120-132}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a stepwise investigation of the
   quantity and quality of food losses along the Swiss potato supply chain.
   Quantitative data were collected from field trials, from structured
   interviews with wholesalers, processors and retailers, and from consumer
   surveys in combination with a 30-day diary study. The ``Swiss trade
   customs for potatoes{''} pose the basis for the qualitative evaluation
   of losses. The influences of technological, institutional (business and
   economy; legislation and policy), and social drivers on the generation
   of fresh potato and processed potato products losses were assessed.
   Losses due to quality standards driven by food safety and consumer
   preferences for certain aesthetic standards have been evaluated too.
   Across the entire potato value chain, approximately 53-55\% of the
   initial fresh potato production and 41-46\% of the initial processing
   potato production are finally lost. Losses between organic and
   non-organic supply chains differ from 2\% to 5\%. From the total initial
   fresh potato production, 15-24\% gets lost during agricultural
   production, a further 12-24\% at wholesalers, 1-3\% at retailers, and
   15\% at private households. In comparison, 5-11\% of the initial
   production gets lost at wholesalers, a further 14-15\% during
   processing, 0\% at retailers, and 2\% at private households. Losses
   during agricultural production do not vary much (13-25\%) between fresh
   and processing potatoes. Approximately half of total potato losses occur
   because potatoes do not meet quality standards. 25-34\% of these
   quality-driven losses are caused by food safety reasons, and the
   remainder are caused by consumer preferences or suitability for storage.
   In total, social drivers (e.g., consumer preferences, behavior, or
   socio-demographical factors) are responsible for two-thirds to
   three-fourths of all fresh potato losses and 40-45\% of all processing
   potato losses. Technological drivers cause circa one-third of the total
   processing potato losses. The majority of the rejected potatoes are used
   as animal feed (67-90\%) in Switzerland. Approximately 30\% of all fresh
   potato losses are disposed while just 4-5\% of all processing potato
   losses are thrown away. The interviewed experts stated that lower
   quality specifications might cause lower loss rates at the first stages
   of the supply chain but higher ones at the later stages due to worse
   storage or processing abilities of potatoes with defects, which also
   might affect proper tubers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The IDEFICS intervention: what can we learn for public policy?}},
Journal = {{OBESITY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{151-161}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{IntroductionAs considered in the rest of this volume, the effects of the
   IDEFICS intervention on obesity rates were not encouraging. This paper
   considers how far findings from the IDEFICS study and similar
   intervention studies are relevant to the policy process and political
   decision-making.
   MethodsThe paper offers theoretical and policy-level arguments
   concerning the evaluation of evidence and its implications for
   policymaking. The paper is divided into three parts. The first considers
   problems in the nature and applicability of evidence gained from school-
   and community-level obesity interventions. The second part considers
   whether such interventions present a model that policymakers could
   implement. The third part considers how we should think about policy
   measures given the limited evidence we can obtain and the many different
   goals that public policy must take account of.
   ResultsThe paper argues that (1) there are clear reasons why we are not
   obtaining good evidence for effective school- and community-level
   interventions; (2) public policy is not in a good position to mandate
   larger-scale, long-term versions of these interventions; and (3) there
   are serious problems in obtaining evidence' for most public policy
   options, but this should not deter us from pursuing options that tackle
   systemic problems and have a good likelihood of delivering benefits on
   several dimensions.
   ConclusionsResearch on school- and community-level obesity interventions
   has not produced much evidence that is directly relevant to
   policymaking. Instead, it shows how difficult it is to affect obesity
   rates without changing wider social and economic factors. Public policy
   should focus on these.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Genetic and environmental factors influence complex disease in humans,
   such as metabolic syndrome, and Drosophila melanogaster serves as an
   excellent model in which to test these factors experimentally. Here we
   explore the modularity of endophenotypes with an in-depth reanalysis of
   a previous study by Reed et al. (2014), where we raised 20 wild-type
   genetic lines of Drosophila larvae on four diets and measured gross
   phenotypes of body weight, total sugar, and total triglycerides, as well
   as the endophenotypes of metabolomic and whole-genome expression
   profiles. We then perform new gene expression experiments to test for
   conservation of phenotype-expression correlations across different diets
   and populations. We find that transcript levels correlated with gross
   phenotypes were enriched for puparial adhesion, metamorphosis, and
   central energy metabolism functions. The specific metabolites L-DOPA and
   N-arachidonoyl dopamine make physiological links between the gross
   phenotypes across diets, whereas leucine and isoleucine thus exhibit
   genotype-by-diet interactions. Between diets, we find low conservation
   of the endophenotypes that correlate with the gross phenotypes. Through
   the follow-up expression study, we found that transcript-trait
   correlations are well conserved across populations raised on a familiar
   diet, but on a novel diet, the transcript-trait correlations are no
   longer conserved. Thus, physiological canalization of metabolic
   phenotypes breaks down in a novel environment exposing cryptic
   variation. We cannot predict the physiological basis of disease in a
   perturbing environment from profiles observed in the ancestral
   environment. This study demonstrates that variation for disease traits
   within a population is acquired through a multitude of physiological
   mechanisms, some of which transcend genetic and environmental
   influences, and others that are specific to an individual's genetic and
   environmental context.}},

Volume = {{531}},

Abstract = {{The Advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to
   simulate two warm season events representative of reverse orographic
   enhancement of warm season precipitation in the Southern Appalachians
   under weak (9-12 July, 2012) and strong (12-16 May, 2014) synoptic
   forcing conditions. Reverse orographic enhancement refers to significant
   enhancement of rainfall intensity (up to one order of magnitude) at low
   elevations in the inner mountain valleys, but not in the ridges. This is
   manifest in significant increases of radar reflectivity observations and
   associated integral quantities (rain rate) at low levels (within 500 m
   of the surface), as well as changes in the observed microphysical
   properties of rainfall (raindrop size distribution). Analysis of
   high-resolution (1.25 km x 1.25 km) WRF simulations shows that the model
   captures the march of observed rainfall, though not the timing in the
   case of strong synoptic forcing. For each event, the results show that
   the space-time variability of rainfall in the inner region is strongly
   coupled to the development and persistence of organized within-valley
   low-level moisture convergence that is a necessary precursor to valley
   fog and low level cloud formation. Microphysical interactions among
   precipitation from propagating storm systems, and local low-level clouds
   and fog promote coalescence efficiency through the seederfeeder
   mechanism leading to significant enhancement of rainfall intensity near
   the ground as shown by Wilson and Barros (2014). The simulations support
   the hypothesis that ridge-valley precipitation gradients, and in
   particular the reverse orographic enhancement effects in inner mountain
   valleys, are linked to horizontal heterogeneity in the vertical
   structure of low level clouds and precipitation promoted through
   landform controls on moisture convergence. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Background The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome is recognized for
   potential clinical relevance in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Data
   suggest that there is a disease-dependent loss of microbial diversity in
   IBD. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is generated by GI anaerobes through
   the digestion of dietary phosphatidylcholine and carnitine in a
   microbial-mammalian co-metabolic pathway. IBD-related changes in the gut
   microbiome may result in disease-specific changes in TMAO plasma
   concentrations.
   Aim To determine whether TMAO plasma levels in IBD are altered compared
   to controls and whether they correlate with disease presence or
   activity.
   Methods Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to
   measure TMAO, choline, and carnitine plasma levels in 479 subjects (373
   non-IBD controls, 106 IBD). Subjects were also genotyped for the flavin
   monooxygenase (FMO)3 variants, E158K and E308G.
   Results Plasma TMAO levels were 2.27 mu M lower in the IBD population
   compared to the control population (p = 0.0001). Lower TMAO levels were
   similarly seen in active ulcerative colitis (UC) (1.56 mu M) versus
   inactive disease (3.40 mu M) (p = 0.002). No difference was seen in
   active Crohn's disease (CD) versus inactive CD. No intergroup variation
   existed in plasma TMAO levels based on FMO3 genotype. Choline levels
   were higher in IBD, while carnitine levels were similar between the two
   groups, suggesting that lower TMAO levels in IBD were not due to dietary
   differences.
   Conclusions Decreased TMAO levels are seen in IBD compared to a non-IBD
   population. These data suggest that TMAO may have potential as a
   biomarker to support IBD diagnosis as well as to assess disease activity
   in UC.}},

Abstract = {{While high-frequency deep brain stimulation is a well established
   treatment for Parkinson's disease, its underlying mechanisms remain
   elusive. Here, we show that two competing hypotheses, desynchronization
   and entrainment in a population of model neurons, may not be mutually
   exclusive. We find that in a noisy group of phase oscillators, high
   frequency perturbations can separate the population into multiple
   clusters, each with a nearly identical proportion of the overall
   population. This phenomenon can be understood by studying maps of the
   underlying deterministic system and is guaranteed to be observed for
   small noise strengths. When we apply this framework to populations of
   Type I and Type II neurons, we observe clustered desynchronization at
   many pulsing frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{Background The important role played by carers of those with mental
   health problems is frequently undervalued among healthcare
   professionals.
   Aims To identify the difficulties encountered by carers in relation to
   obtaining information from mental health teams.
   Methods Participants in the study included carers or family members of
   persons with mental illness who were affiliated with a support group in
   Ireland. Information was gathered using an 18-item self-report
   questionnaire. This is an amended version of the Carer Well-Being and
   Support Questionnaire for carers of people with a mental health problem
   or dementia.
   Results One-hundred and fifty-nine carers complete the questionnaire. On
   average respondents stated that they have been in the role of a carer
   for someone with a mental health problem for 14.4 years, spending a
   median of 20-h caring each week. Despite most carers maintaining that
   they are generally satisfied with the support offered to them from
   medical and/or care staff, the majority (56.3 \%) of respondents stated
   that they have specifically encountered difficulties accessing
   information from the treating mental health team. The main reasons given
   to them by the mental health team for withholding information include:
   lack of patient consent (46.2 \%) and unavailability of a team member
   (46.2 \%). From a carer perspective, respondents stated that the main
   reason they feel there is difficulty in accessing information is a lack
   of concern for their role as a carer in the patient's management (60.5
   \%). More than 75 \% of all respondents are afraid of negative
   consequences for them or for the person in their care as a result of
   information being withheld by the treating team.
   Conclusions Carer involvement is essential for the complete and
   effective management of individuals with mental illness. Confidentiality
   should not be used as a reason for completely excluding carers.}},

Abstract = {{Lymphedema is a common side effect of breast cancer treatment that may
   negatively impact on a woman's physical and psychological well-being.
   This study aimed to understand the impact of breast cancer-related
   lymphedema on women's sexual functioning, and to identify key concerns
   of these women regarding sexual issues.
   Purposive sampling recruited 17 women aged 38-67 years with mild to
   severe lymphedema. Telephone interviews concerning sexual issues were
   transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis undertaken.
   Women perceived sexual concerns arising from lymphedema to exacerbate
   concerns arising from breast cancer. Four interrelated factors
   determined the extent of lymphedema's sexual impact: (a) swelling
   severity and location, (b) needing to wear a compression garment, (c)
   body image concerns raised by lymphedema and breast cancer treatment,
   and (d) their sexual partner's acceptance and supportiveness. In
   particular, a supportive partner was instrumental in assisting women to
   overcome sexual issues caused by severe swelling and/or body image
   concerns. Few women reported being asked about sexual issues by any
   health professional, and most women indicated that they were unwilling
   to discuss sexual concerns with health professionals, friends, or
   family.
   Lymphedema had the potential to accentuate sexual issues caused by
   breast cancer, but most women were reluctant to discuss issues with
   anyone other than their partner. These findings are relevant to health
   professionals designing breast cancer psychosexual interventions and
   future research addressing lymphedema-specific sexual concerns.}},

Abstract = {{The Type II phase in the Bi1 - xWxO1.5 (+) (1.5x) system is shown to
   have a (3 + 3)-dimensional modulated delta-Bi2O3-related structure, in
   which the modulation vector epsilon `locks in' to a commensurate value
   of 1/3. The structure was refined in a 3 x 3 x 3 supercell against
   single-crystal Laue neutron diffraction data. Ab initio calculations
   were used to test and optimize the local structure of the oxygen
   sublattice around a single mixed Bi/W site. The underlying crystal
   chemistry was shown to be essentially the same as for the recently
   refined (3 + 3)-dimensional modulated structure of Type II Bi-1 (-)
   xNbxO1.5 (+) (x) (Ling et al., 2013), based on a transition from
   fluorite-type to pyrochlore-type via the appearance of W4O18 `tetrahedra

   give a hypothetical solid-solution range bounded by Bi23W4O46.5 (x =

Abstract = {{Commiphora gileadensis is an aromatic plant traditionally used in the
   Middle East as a common remedy for pain and inflammation. Recently,
   several studies have reported on its anti-proliferative effect in cancer
   cell lines. Yet, scientific evidence regarding the other properties of
   C. gileadensis is limited. The aim of the current study was to
   investigate the cytotoxic action of C gileadensis sap extracts (CgSE) on
   human epidermal cells and skin tissues and to ascertain its mode of
   action. The effects of the extract on cell viability and apoptosis were
   evaluated on immortalized keratinocytes, human dermal fibroblasts, human
   dermoid carcinoma cells and on human ex vivo skin cultures. CgSE
   significantly reduced the viability of both immortalized and transformed
   epidermal cells by 64\% and 68\%, respectively. However, normal
   fibroblasts and human skin organ cultures were protected from this
   effect. The cytotoxicity was coupled with the induction of capsase-3 and
   the morphological characteristics of apoptosis. In addition,
   CgSE-induced apoptosis did not occur in cells in the pre-replicative,
   G(1) phase, but only at later phases involved in DNA replication and
   cell division. HPLC analysis of CgSE showed only negligible traces of
   beta-caryophyllene, a secondary metabolite previously isolated from C
   gileadensis and reported to be cytotoxic. Therefore, additional active
   compound(s) may be involved in the anti-proliferative phenomenon of the
   extract. The authors concluded that CgSE contains cytotoxic products
   which specifically target proliferating cells in a cell cycle-dependent
   manner, and hence may be relevant for the treatment of skin disorders
   characterized by hyperproliferation, such as skin cancer and psoriasis.

   results on global existence and qualitative behavior essentially relies
   on the use of energy-type functionals which seem to be available only in
   special situations, necessarily requiring the matrix-valued S to
   actually reduce to a scalar function of c which, along with f, in
   addition should satisfy certain quite restrictive structural conditions.
   The present work presents a novel a priori estimation method which
   allows for removing any such additional hypothesis: besides appropriate
   smoothness assumptions, in this paper it is only required that f is
   locally bounded in , that S is bounded in , and that for all with some

Title = {{Cystic renal cell carcinoma carries an excellent prognosis regardless of
   tumor size}},
Journal = {{UROLOGIC ONCOLOGY-SEMINARS AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Cystic renal cell carcinoma (cystic RCC) is thought to
   carry an improved prognosis relative to clear cell RCC (CCRCC); however,
   this is based on small case series. We used a population-based tumor
   registry to compare clinicopathologic features and cancer-specific
   mortality (CSM) of cystic RCC with those of CCRCC.
   Materials and methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
   database was queried for all patients diagnosed and treated for cystic
   RCC and CCRCC between 2001 and 2010. Clinical and pathologic factors
   were compared using t tests and chi-square tests as appropriate.
   Kaplan-Meier survival analysis compared CSM differences between cystic
   RCC and CCRCC.
   Results: A total of 678 patients with cystic RCC and 46,677 with CCRCC
   were identified. The mean follow-up duration was 52 and 40 months,
   respectively. When compared with CCRCC patients, those with cystic RCC
   were younger (mean age 58 vs. 61 y, P < 0.001), more commonly black
   (22\% vs. 9\%, P < 0.001), and female (45\% vs. 41\%, P = 0.02). Cystic
   RCCs were more commonly T1a tumors (66\% vs. 55\%, P < 0.001), well
   differentiated (33\% vs. 16\%, P < 0.001), and smaller (mean size = 3.8
   vs. 4.5 cm, P < 0.001). Cystic RCC was associated with a reduction in
   CSM when compared with CCRCC (P = 0.002). In a subset analysis, this
   reduction in CSM was seen only for those with T1b/T2 tumors (P = 0.01)
   but not for those with Tla RCCs lesions (P = 0.31).
   Conclusions: We report the largest series of cystic RCC and corroborate
   the findings of improved CSM when compared with CCRCC for larger tumors;
   however, no difference was noted in smaller tumors, suggesting that
   tumor biology becomes more relevant to prognosis with increasing size.
   These data may suggest a role for active surveillance in appropriately
   selected patients with small, cystic renal masses. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Six resistant spring wheat cultivars with the Sm1 gene were assessed for
   seed damage by the orange wheat blossom midge (Sitodiplosis mosellana
   (Gehin) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae)) in laboratory and field tests. All
   resistant cultivars deterred larvae from developing on the seed and had
   significantly less yield losses than susceptible wheat cultivars. Vesper
   was the first cultivar with Sm1 that also deterred oviposition by the
   wheat midge. Seed damage to all resistant cultivars decreased the later
   plants were exposed to adult midge from the time spikes emerged from the
   boot until anthesis. Spikes of susceptible wheat cultivars had lower
   yield losses when exposed two or more days after emergence than spikes
   exposed at the time of emergence. Seed damage to resistant wheat caused
   dorsal and lateral distortions of the seed and often altered seed colour
   and shape. The pedigree of the resistant cultivars had no effect on the
   extent of seed damage. Shaw wheat had the least amount of seed damage
   and no third instars on the seed in both field and laboratory tests. All
   other cultivars had a few small third instars and similar levels of seed
   damage in laboratory tests, with Fieldstar being the least effective. In

Abstract = {{When choosing actions, humans have to balance carefully between
   different task demands. On the one hand, they should perform tasks
   repeatedly to avoid frequent and effortful switching between different
   tasks. On the other hand, subjects have to retain their flexibility to
   adapt to changes in external task demands such as switching away from an
   increasingly difficult task. Here, we developed a difficulty-based
   choice task to investigate how subjects voluntarily select task-sets in
   predictably changing environments. Subjects were free to choose 1 of the
   3 task-sets on a trial-by-trial basis, while the task difficulty changed
   dynamically over time. Subjects self-sequenced their behavior in this
   environment while we measured brain responses with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). Using multivariate decoding, we found that
   task choices were encoded in the medial prefrontal cortex (dorso-medial
   prefrontal cortex, dmPFC, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dACC).
   The same regions were found to encode task difficulty, a major factor
   influencing choices. Importantly, the present paradigm allowed us to
   disentangle the neural code for task choices and task difficulty,
   ensuring that activation patterns in dmPFC/dACC independently encode
   these 2 factors. This finding provides new evidence for the importance
   of the dmPFC/dACC for task-selection and motivational functions in
   highly dynamic environments.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate a new technology of digital audio recording
   (DAR) of health consultations to provide knowledge about patients' use

   Design: A cross-sectional feasibility analysis of the intervention using
   log data from the recording platform and data from a
   patient-administered questionnaire.
   Setting: Four different outpatient clinics at a Danish hospital:
   Paediatrics, Orthopaedics, Internal Medicine and Urology.
   Participants: Two thousand seven hundred and eighty-four outpatients
   having their consultation audio recorded by one of 49 participating
   health professionals.
   Intervention: DAR of outpatient consultations provided to patients
   permitting replay of their consultation either alone or together with
   their relatives.
   Main Outcome Measure: Replay of the consultation within 90 days from the
   consultation.
   Results: In the adult outpatient clinics, one in every three
   consultations was replayed; however, the rates were significantly lower
   in the paediatric clinic where one in five consultations was replayed.
   The usage of the audio recordings was positively associated with
   increasing patient age and first time visits to the clinic. Patient
   gender influenced replays in different ways; for instance, relatives to
   male patients replayed recordings more often than relatives to female
   patients did. Approval of future recordings was high among the patients
   who replayed the consultation.
   Conclusion: Patients found that recording health consultations was an
   important information aid, and the digital recording technology was
   found to be feasible in routine practice.}},

Abstract = {{An approach to improve the range resolution of a 24-GHz industrial,
   scientific, and medical (ISM) band pulse radar is presented for the
   automotive short-range radars. The resolution of the range profile was
   improved by applying the regularized least squares method to a discrete
   baseband signal at the receiver. For a 24-GHz ISM band pulse radar
   adopting a regularized least square method, a triangular pulse was
   identified as the optimal pulse shape under the regulations and in terms
   of cost effectiveness. To resolve multiple adjacent pulses with a
   constant false alarm rate, MATLAB simulations based on the least
   absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were used to
   derive additional threshold values for output signals after the LASSO
   operation and the required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The simulated
   and measured values of the required SNR were 20.5 and 21.1 dB,
   respectively, for the two-target detection with a range resolution of 30

Abstract = {{Study Design.A prospective, randomized triple-blinded cross-over design
   treating with either botulinum toxin A (BXT) or saline
   (NaCl).Objective.To examine the efficacy of BTX treatment in cerebral
   palsy scoliosis (CPS).Summary of Background Data.Intramuscular
   injections with BTX have been used off label in treating CPS. 1
   prospective study has been conducted, demonstrating in both radiological
   and clinical improvement, whereas showing no side effects or
   complications.Methods.Subjects (brace-treated CPS between 2 and 18 yr)
   were injected using ultrasonic-guidance with either NaCl or BTX in
   selected spine muscles with 6 mo intervals (block randomization, sealed
   envelope). Radiographs of the spine and clinical follow-up were captured
   before and 6 weeks after each injection. Primary outcome parameter was
   radiological change in Cobb angle, where a 7 degrees change was regarded
   as an effect (1 SD). Radiological parameters were measured before and 6
   weeks after treatment by 3 experienced doctors separately. Moreover,
   clinical results were evaluated by the pediatric quality of life score
   and systematic open questioning of the parents about the child's
   wellbeing. Subjects, researchers, and monitors were blinded during the
   trial. Appropriate permissions (2008-004584-19) and no funding were
   obtained.Results.16 cerebral palsy patients (GFMCS III-V) with CPS were
   consecutively included, whereas 6 patients were excluded. There were no
   drop-outs to follow-up, but 1 possible serious adverse event of
   pneumonia resulting in death was recorded and the study was terminated.
   No significant radiological or clinical changes were detected when
   compared with NaCl injections using Wilcoxon matched pair signed-rank
   test.Conclusion.No positive radiological or clinical effects were
   demonstrated by this treatment, except for the parent's initial
   subjective but positive appraisal of the effect. However, the study was
   terminated due to 1 possible severe adverse event and scheduled numbers
   needed to treat (hence power) were not reached.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of targeted screening for colorectal cancer based on risk
   profiles originates from its benefits to improve detection yield and
   optimize screening efficiency. Clinically, it allows individuals to be
   more aware of their own risk and make informed decisions on screening
   choice. From a public health perspective, the implementation of risk
   stratification strategies may better justify utilization of colonoscopic
   resources, and facilitate resource-planning in the formulation of
   population-based screening programmes. There are several at-risk groups
   who should receive earlier screening, and colonoscopy is more preferred.
   This review summarizes the currently recommended CRC screening
   strategies among subjects with different risk factors, and introduces
   existing risk scoring systems. Additional genetic, epidemiological, and
   clinical parameters may be needed to enhance their performance to
   risk-stratify screening participants. Future research studies should
   refine these scoring systems, and explore the adaptability, feasibility,
   acceptability, and user-friendliness of their use in clinical practice
   among different population groups. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Getting the first birth right: A retrospective study of outcomes for
   low-risk primiparous women receiving standard care versus midwifery
   model of care in the same tertiary hospital}},
Journal = {{WOMEN AND BIRTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: There is national and international concern for increasing
   obstetric intervention in childbirth and rising caesarean section rates.
   Repeat caesarean section is a major contributing factor, making
   primiparous women an important target for strategies to reduce
   unnecessary intervention and surgeries in childbirth.
   Aim: The aim was to compare outcomes for a cohort of low risk
   primiparous women who accessed a midwifery continuity model of care with
   those who received standard public care in the same tertiary hospital.
   Methods: A retrospective comparative cohort study design was implemented
   drawing on data from two databases held by a tertiary hospital for the
   period 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011. Categorical data were
   analysed using the chi-squared statistic and Fisher's exact test.
   Continuous data were analysed using Student's t-test. Comparisons are
   presented using unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios, with 95\%
   confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values with significance set at 0.05.
   Results: Data for 426 women experiencing continuity of midwifery care
   and 1220 experiencing standard public care were compared. The study
   found increased rates of normal vaginal birth (57.7\% vs. 48.9\% p =
   0.002) and spontaneous vaginal birth (38\% vs. 22.4\% p = <0.001) and
   decreased rates of instrumental birth (23.5\% vs. 28.5\% p = 0.050) and
   caesarean sections (18.8\% vs. 22.5\% p = 0.115) in the midwifery
   continuity cohort. There were also fewer interventions in this group. No
   differences were found in neonatal outcomes.
   Conclusion: Strategies for reducing caesarean section rates and
   interventions in childbirth should focus on primiparous women as a
   priority. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of continuity
   midwifery models, suggesting that this is an important strategy for
   improving outcomes in this population. (C) 2015 Australian College of

Abstract = {{Context: Shift work, which imposes a habitual disruption in the
   circadian system, has been linked to increased incidence of
   cardiometabolic diseases, and acute circadian misalignment alters
   various metabolic processes. However, it remains unclear whether
   day-to-day circadian dysregulation contributes to these risks beyond
   poor sleep and other behavioral characteristics.
   Objective: Individuals differ in circadian phase preference, known as
   chronotype, but may be constrained by modern work obligations to
   specific sleep schedules. Individuals experience social jetlag (SJL) due
   to a habitual discrepancy between their endogenous circadian rhythm and
   actual sleep times imposed by social obligations. Here, we examined
   whether chronotype and/or SJL associate with components of
   cardiovascular disease risk beyond the known effects of sleep
   disturbances, poor health behaviors, and depressive symptomatology.
   Design: Participants were healthy, midlife adults who worked part-or
   full-time day shifts (n = 447; mean age, 42.7 {[}range, 30-54] y; 53\%
   female; 83\% white). Chronotype was assessed with the Composite Scale of
   Morningness. SJL was quantified as the difference (in minutes) between
   the midpoints of actigraphy-derived sleep intervals before work vs
   non-workdays.
   Results: Multiple regression analyses showed that SJL related to a lower
   high-density lipoproteincholesterol level, higher triglycerides, higher
   fasting plasma insulin, insulin resistance, and adiposity (P < .05),
   even after adjustment for subjective sleep quality, actigraphy-derived
   sleep characteristics, depressive symptomatology, and health behaviors.
   Evening chronotype associated with lower high-density
   lipoprotein-cholesterol after adjustment for covariates.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a misalignment of sleep timing is
   associated with metabolic risk factors that predispose to diabetes and
   atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Hong Kong drivers face daily congestion, especially at the Cross Harbor
   Tunnel (CHT) whose tolls are substantially lower than those of the
   drivers' other two tunnel options: the Eastern Harbor Crossing (EHC) and
   the Western Harbor Crossing (WHC). In 2013, the Hong Kong Special
   Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government issued a consultation paper,
   seeking public comments on three toll-change proposals that would raise
   the CHT's tolls and lower the EHC's tolls. The WHC's tolls would remain
   unchanged due to its congested connecting roads. Using monthly crossing
   data available from the HKSAR's Transport Department for 2000-2012, this
   paper uses a Generalized Leontief demand system to document that the
   usage patterns of the three tunnels is price-responsive. Hence, we
   conclude that the proposed toll changes are likely to be effective in
   transportation demand management, by shifting a portion of the CHT's
   usage to the EHC and WHC, thereby relieving the CHT's congestion. (C)

Abstract = {{This article describes a software tool called ``Pursuit{''} that is
   intended to be used for both research and teaching on the topic of
   optimal foraging theory. The tool provides a dynamic graphical and
   auditory interface in which users encounter different prey animals and
   then must decide whether to pursue or ignore the encountered prey. Based
   on the characteristics of the prey in the foraging environment and the
   decisions of the player, each user harvests a set of prey per round and
   achieves a corresponding foraging return rate. Administrators of Pursuit
   specify the environmental parameters that determine what prey users will
   encounter. All environmental parameters and user decisions are tracked
   and logged for analysis. We created this tool for laboratory
   experiments, but we believe Pursuit could also be an engaging and
   effective teaching tool, whereby students adopt the role of forager, and
   through such play, experience a simulated foraging context and learn
   about foraging theory. Pursuit is freely available and can run on any
   platform that supports Java, including Mac OS, Windows, and Linux.}},

   vary significantly between centers. In situations where a family donor
   does not meet the suitability criteria for unrelated donors, involved
   physicians often struggle with the decision whether the matched relative
   is suitable for donation or not. On behalf of the Worldwide Network for
   Blood and Marrow Transplantation Standing Committee on Donor Issues, we
   intended to develop a consensus document with recommendations for donor
   workup and final clearance of family donors who would not be able to
   serve as unrelated donors because of their age or pre-existing diseases.
   This article covers different topics intending to support
   decision-making, with the goal of minimizing medical risk to the donor
   and protection of the recipient from transmissible diseases. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{With considering the vertical heterogeneity of soil layers and the
   feature of torsional vibration, the dynamic motion equations of a
   generalized Gibson saturated soil are developed. Then the proposed
   equations are solved by using the integral transformation. Given the
   stress-free boundary condition at the top surface of the saturated
   half-space, the mixed boundary condition in the plane where the rigid
   circular plate is laid, and the wave radiation condition at the infinite
   depth, the dual integral equations are developed to depict the torsional
   vibration of a rigid circular plate embedded in a generalized Gibson
   saturated soil. By appropriate transformation, a Fredholm integral
   equation of the second kind is obtained; and the dynamic response of the
   soil is determined. The dynamic compliance coefficient and the torsional
   angular amplitude is formulated by comparing the relation between a
   static torque and angular displacement. The problem can be degenerated
   into a simple case, which is consistent with previous research results.
   Numerical studies indicate that there exists a boundary-layer phenomenon
   in the torsional vibration of a rigid circular plate in a generalized
   Gibson soil when the embedment depth is five-times smaller than the
   radius of the circular plate; in addition, the smaller embedment depth,
   the more pronounced the boundary-layer phenomenon is.}},

Title = {{Cosparsity-based Stagewise Matching Pursuit algorithm for reconstruction
   of the cosparse signals}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The cosparse analysis model has been introduced as an interesting
   alternative to the standard sparse synthesis model. Given a set of
   corrupted measurements, finding a signal belonging to this model is
   known as analysis pursuit, which is an important problem in analysis
   model based sparse representation. Several pursuit methods have already
   been proposed, such as the methods based on l(1)-relaxation and greedy
   approaches based on the cosparsity of the signal. This paper presents a
   novel greedy-like algorithm, called Cosparsity-based Stagewise Matching
   Pursuit (CSMP), where the cosparsity of the target signal is estimated
   adaptively with a stagewise approach composed of forward and backward
   processes. In the forward process, the cosparsity is estimated and the
   signal is approximated, followed by the refinement of the cosparsity and
   the signal in the backward process. As a result, the target signal can
   be reconstructed without the prior information of the cosparsity level.
   Experiments show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is
   comparable to those of the l1-relaxation and Analysis Subspace Pursuit
   (ASP)/Analysis Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit (ACoSaMP) in
   noiseless case and better than that of Greedy Analysis Pursuit (GAP) in
   noisy case.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, smart-card-based user authentication becomes one of the most
   important security issues. But many schemes of that kind are under
   different attacks. Recently, Kumari et al. pointed that Chen et al.'s
   scheme and Li et al.'s scheme with the smart card were not secure. They
   proposed two improved schemes. Unfortunately, we find that the two
   schemes are not secure. The first scheme of Kumari et al. is under the
   de-synchronization attack and lacks strong forward security. The second
   has the weaknesses including no user anonymity and password leaking.
   Also, it cannot withstand the user-impersonation attack. We present a
   new scheme also based on the smart card overcoming common disadvantages
   and give a formal proof. We also use the tool ProVerif to verify the
   security of our scheme. Compared with some recent schemes, our scheme
   performs well, and it is fit for network applications. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The multispecific organic anion drug transporters OAT6 (SLC22A20) and
   OAT1 (SLC22A6) are expressed in nasal epithelial cells and both can bind
   odorants. Sequence analysis of OAT6 revealed an evolutionarily conserved
   79-amino acid (AA) fragment present not only in OAT6 but also in other
   SLC22 transporters, such as the organic anion transporter (OAT), organic
   carnitine transporter (OCTN), and organic cation transporter (OCT)
   subfamilies. A similar fragment is also conserved in some odorant
   receptors (ORs) in both humans and rodents. This fragment is located in
   regions believed to be important for ligand/substrate preference and
   recognition in both classes of proteins, raising the possibility that it
   may be part of a potential common ligand/substrate recognition site in
   certain ORs and SLC22 transporters. In silico screening of an odorant
   database containing known OR ligands with a pharmacophore hypothesis
   (generated from a set of odorants known to bind OAT6 and/or OAT1),
   followed by in vitro uptake assays in transfected cells, identified OR
   ligands capable of inhibiting OAT6-and/or OAT1-mediated transport,
   albeit with different affinities. The conservation of the AA fragments
   between these two different classes of proteins, together with their
   coexpression in olfactory as well as other tissues, suggests the
   possibility that ORs and SLC22 transporters function in concert, and
   raises the question as to whether these transporters function in remote
   sensing and signaling and/or as transceptors.}},

Abstract = {{The microwave plasma-assisted combustion (PAC) of premixed
   methane/oxygen/argon mixtures was investigated. A U-shaped dual-layer
   curve of fuel ignition/flame stabilization limit was observed, which
   shows the effects of the plasma power on the fuel ignition and flame
   stabilization. The PAC flame images revealed a quasi-stabilized flame
   region that is located in the gap between the upper (the fuel ignition
   limit) and lower layers (the flame stabilization limit). Optical
   emission spectroscopy showed different emission spectral features at the
   same plasma power but in different up-tunings (increasing the plasma
   power from low to high) and down-tunings (decreasing the plasma power
   from high to low) of the plasma power, which suggested that different
   chemical pathways were involved in these two processes. Cavity ringdown
   spectroscopy measurements of OH(X) number density outside the combustor
   showed that the OH(X) number density is on the order of 10(16) molecule
   cm(-3) when the PAC flame was achieved yet zero when the PAC flame was
   not achieved. It is speculated that the OH(X) radical plays an important
   role in the flame stabilization in the PAC.}},

Abstract = {{Hooking events, defined as trawling gear becoming firmly ``stuck{''}
   under a pipeline, rarely occur during bottom-trawling operations.
   However, hooking events can have detrimental consequences. There is no
   existing method for quantifying the hooking probability of
   bottom-trawling operations. In this study, an approach is proposed to
   quantify the trawl board hooking probability using simulation tools and
   statistical data. Numerical simulation use the SIMLA code to establish
   simplified hooking criteria. The criteria link the pipeline data to the
   fishing activities data, enabling the quantification of hooking
   probability. First, the numerical simulations of both pull-over and
   hooking events were compared with small-scale model test results.
   Reasonable agreement was reached. Based on the simulation results,
   simplified criteria for trawl board hooking were proposed. Finally, data
   from the EUROPIPE II pipeline section in the Norwegian sector were used
   as a case study. Data regarding free span as well as fishing activities
   in that region were used to obtain the statistical input. The Monte
   Carlo simulation technique was then used to estimate the hooking
   probability. Parametric studies were first performed to investigate the
   effects of important parameters. Then, based on the findings from the
   parametric studies, the hooking probability with the most reasonable
   parameters was estimated.}},

Abstract = {{The 10-year climatological features related to midlatitude double
   tropopause events (DTs) are examined using ERAInterim data from 2003 to
   2012. The analysis is based on tropopauses defined by lapse rate.
   Results show that DTs are permanent or semi-permanent in the
   midlatitudes, and high DT frequency bands move poleward in winter and
   equatorward in summer, which is consistent with the seasonal movement of
   the subtropical jet. Based on our statistics, the second tropopause is
   found at about 100 hPa in the subtropics and at slightly lower altitudes
   in sub-polar regions. The thickness between the first and second
   tropopause is smaller in the subtropics and increases with latitude.
   Next, the origin of air sandwiched between the first and second
   tropopause of DTs is studied with a revised version of the UK
   Universities Global Atmospheric Modelling Programme Offline Trajectory
   Code (Version 3) diabatic trajectory model. The results show that, in
   the lower or middle troposphere, air is transported into the DTs from
   lower latitudes, mainly in the tropics. The dominant source regions are
   mainly areas of deep convection and steep orography, e.g., the western
   Pacific and Himalayan Mountains, and they show strong seasonality
   following the seasonal shift of these strong upwelling regions.}},

Abstract = {{In situ high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction was conducted on

   from which distinct local elastic strain fields were mapped spatially.
   These directly measured residual strain fields can be nicely interpreted
   by our stress analysis, and also validate a previously proposed indirect
   residual-stress-measurement method by relating nanoindentation hardness
   to residual stresses. Local shear strain variations on the cross
   sections of these thin plates were found in the plastically bent BMG,
   which however cannot be determined from the indirect indentation method.
   This study has important implications in designing and manipulating
   internal strain fields in BMGs for the purpose of ductility enhancement.

Abstract = {{Despite the promising results from initial studies, there are
   significant limitations in the application of MET-targeted therapy in
   gastric cancer. Intrinsic resistance is one of the major obstacles. The
   aim of this study is to identify the responsible receptor tyrosine
   kinases (RTKs) that determine the unresponsiveness of MET inhibitor in
   MET-positive gastric cancer. through an RNA-interference-based
   functional screen targeting most human RTKs, we identified that
   activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) and
   recepteur d'origine nantais (RON) pathways attenuated MET
   inhibitor-induced suppression of cell proliferation and migration.
   Notably, in the two forms of RON pathway activation, only upregulation
   of short-form RON (sf-RON), but not stimulation of full length RON with
   macrophage stimulating protein, conferred MET inhibitor resistance in
   vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the profile of the gastric cancer
   samples observed that sf-RON was frequently upregulated in MET-positive
   gastric cancer. Our findings indicate that activation of the sf-RON
   signaling pathway represents a novel mechanism underlying MET inhibitor
   unresponsiveness. A combination strategy with drugs targeting both RON
   and MET pathways is believed to improve the efficacy of MET-targeted
   therapy.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to evaluate effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields
   (PEMF) in a double blind study on patients with knee joint
   osteoarthritis. The MAGCELL ARTHRO electrode-less therapy delivered a
   sinusoidal magnetic field, varying in frequency between 4 and 12 Hz. In
   1 cm tissue depth, magnetic flux density was 105 mT. A total of n = 57
   patients were randomly assigned to the verum, PEMF or placebo group
   (placebo device). Their average age was 61.6 +/- 12.0 years. According
   to American College of Rheumatology criteria the osteoarthritis level
   was 2.8 +/- 0.8. Treatment was performed twice a day for 5 min over a
   period of 18 days. Treatment with the MAGCELL device versus control
   (sham exposed) showed a highly significant reduction in pain (P<0.001),
   a significant reduction in stiffness (P = 0.032) and a significant
   reduction in disability in daily activities (P = 0.005) according to the
   Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)
   scales-with a good overall treatment tolerance. In the placebo group
   there was no evidence of a significant change between the initial and
   final examination in any of the three above-mentioned WOMAC scales.
   Results of this partly randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study
   show clinically at any rate, that use of PEMF lead to highly significant
   better results in the treatment group compared to the placebo group with
   regard to the total WOMAC global score and especially for visual
   analogue scale. Patient assessment of the ``effectiveness{''} was rated
   in 29.5\% as very good and good in 27.3\% compared to 0.0\% and 15.4\%
   in controls. This therapy is thus a useful complementary treatment
   option with no side effects. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In 1981 Michel Foucault gave a series of lectures in Louvain, Belgium,
   entitled Wrong-Doing, Truth-Telling, which focus on the concept of
   avowal or the ritualized production of true statements about oneself.
   Insofar as such rituals mediate relations of power, they constitute one
   form of the ``governance{''} of speaking subjects, the stakes of which
   are the very constitution of that subject. Through a comparison of
   Foucault and J. L. Austin's work on performatives, I use the example of
   oath-taking to investigate possible forms of strategic resistance within
   the framework legal-religious avowal. Such a mode of participation takes
   both the ritual structure and its stakes seriously, allowing the
   speaking subject to play by the rules of the game while also playing
   with those rules. What I call ``the strategic abuse of the constitutive
   rules{''} of the game permits the maintenance of the government of
   oneself in the face of the potentially undesirable demands of the
   governance of others.}},

Abstract = {{The limitations of our cognitive resources necessitate the selection of
   relevant information from the incoming visual stream. This selection and
   prioritizing of stimuli allows the organism to adapt to the current
   conditions. However, the characteristics of this process vary with time
   and depend on numerous external and internal factors. The present study
   was aimed at determining how the emotional state affects effective
   connectivity between visual, attentional and control brain areas during
   the perception of affective visual stimuli. The Directed Transfer
   Function was applied on a 32-electrode EEG recording to quantify the
   direction and intensity of the information flow during two sessions:
   positive and negative. These data were correlated with a self-report of
   the emotional state. We demonstrated that the current mood, as measured
   by self-report, is a factor which affects the patterns of effective
   cortical connectivity. An increase in prefrontal top-down control over
   the visual and attentional areas was revealed in a state of tension. It
   was accompanied by increased outflow within and from the areas
   recognized as the ventral attentional network. By contrast, a positive
   emotional state was associated with heightened flow from the parietal to
   the occipital area. The functional significance of the revealed effects
   is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: This study aims to investigate the influence of the amount
   of clustering {[}intraclass correlation (ICC) = 0\%, 5\%, or 20\%], the
   number of events per variable (EPV) or candidate predictor (EPV = 5, 10,
   20, or 50), and backward variable selection on the performance of
   prediction models.
   Study Design and Setting: Researchers frequently combine data from
   several centers to develop clinical prediction models. In our simulation
   study, we developed models from clustered training data using multilevel
   logistic regression and validated them in external data.
   Results: The amount of clustering was not meaningfully associated with
   the models' predictive performance. The median calibration slope of
   models built in samples with EPV = 5 and strong clustering (ICC = 20\%)
   was 0.71. With EPV = 5 and ICC = 0\%, it was 0.72. A higher EPV related
   to an increased performance: the calibration slope was 0.85 at EPV = 10
   and ICC = 20\% and 0.96 at EPV = 50 and ICC = 20\%. Variable selection
   sometimes led to a substantial relative bias in the estimated predictor
   effects (up to 118\% at EPV = 5), but this had little influence on the
   model's performance in our simulations.
   Conclusion: We recommend at least 10 EPV to fit prediction models in
   clustered data using logistic regression. Up to 50 EPV may be needed
   when variable selection is performed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   The renin-angiotensin system is a complex regulatory hormonal network
   with a main biological peptide and therapeutic target, angiotensin (Ang)
   II (1-8). There are other potentially important Ang peptides that have
   not been well evaluated.
   METHODS
   Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used for
   concurrent evaluation of multiple Angs downstream of Ang I (1-10) and
   Ang II (1-8) in kidney and plasma from wild-type (WT) mice. Angiotensin
   converting enzyme 2 knockout (ACE2KO) was also used as a way to examine
   the Angs profile in the absence of ACE2, an enzyme that cleaves both Ang
   I (1-10) and Ang II (1-8).
   RESULTS
   In plasma from both WT and ACE2KO, levels of Ang I (1-10), Ang III
   (2-8), and Ang (2-10) were the highest of all the renin-angiotensin
   system (RAS) peptides. The latter two peptides are products of
   aminopeptidase A cleavage of Ang II (1-8) and Ang I (1-10),
   respectively. In contrast, plasma levels of Ang II (1-8), and Ang (1-7),
   the product of Ang II (1-8) cleavage by ACE2, were low. In kidney from
   both WT and ACE2KO, Ang II (1-8) levels were high as compared to plasma
   levels. In the ACE2KO mice, a significant increase in either Ang II
   (1-8) or a decrease in Ang (1-7) was not observed in plasma or in the
   kidney.
   CONCLUSION
   RAS-focused peptidomic approach revealed major differences in Ang
   peptides between mouse plasma and kidney. These Ang peptide profiles
   show the dominance of the aminopeptidase A/Ang (2-10) and aminopeptidase
   A/Ang III (2-8) pathways in the metabolism of Ang I (1-10) and Ang II
   (1-8) over the ACE2/Ang (1-7) axis. Ang III (2-8) and other peptides
   formed from aminopeptidase A cleavage may be important therapeutic RAS
   targets.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of purine/triazole 6'-isonucleosides and of glucuronic
   acid/glucuronamide-derived N-glycosylsulfonohydrazides through efficient

   structures were envisaged to mimic nucleosides, sugar phosphates, or
   nucleotides, and were expected to provide potential inhibitors of
   therapeutically relevant enzymes, the active sites of which could
   potentially bind their structural fragments or functional groups. Such
   enzymes include cholinesterases, carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II) and
   cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK-2). A (triazolyl)methyl amide-linked
   disaccharide nucleoside, based on a new prospective structural framework
   for analogues of nucleoside diphosphate sugars, was synthesized. The
   synthetic strategies employed unprotected or partially protected
   carbohydrate derivatives as precursors, including ribose, glucuronic
   acid, glucuronolactone, and glycopyranosides and relied on
   stereoselective N-glycosylation, regioselective Mitsunobu coupling and
   click chemistry' approaches. Some 6'-isonucleosides and
   triazole-containing glycoderivatives displayed moderate selective
   acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. The best inhibitor was an
   aminomethyltriazole 6'-isonucleoside with a K-i value of 11.9M.
   N-Glucuronylsulfonohydrazide showed good inhibition of CA-II (K-i=9.5M).
   Molecular docking of the most active compounds into the effected enzymes
   showed interactions with key amino acid residues for substrate
   recognition. In addition, the tested compounds did not show toxicity to
   normal cells.}},

   ultrasound attenuation through a monodisperse lipid-coated microbubble

   The attenuation data are used to determine interfacial rheological
   properties (surface tension, surface dilatational elasticity, and
   surface dilatational viscosity) of the encapsulation according to three
   different models. Although different models result in similar
   rheological properties, attenuation measured at different excitation
   levels (4-110 kPa) leads to different values for them; the dilatation
   elasticity (0.56 to 0.18 N/m) and viscosity (2.4 x 10(-8) to 1.52 x
   10(-8) Ns/m) both decrease with increasing pressure. Numerically
   simulating the scattered response, nonlinear energy transfer between
   frequencies are shown to be negligible, thereby demonstrating the
   linearity in propagation and validating the attenuation analysis. There
   is a second concern to the characterization arising from shell
   properties being dependent on excitation amplitude, which is not a
   proper constitutive variable. It is resolved by arriving at a
   strain-dependent rheology for the encapsulation. The limitations of the
   underlying analysis are discussed. (C) 2015 Acoustical Society of

Journal = {{CHINESE PHYSICS B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{When modeling a stealth aircraft with low RCS (Radar Cross Section),
   conventional parameter estimation methods may cause a deviation from the
   actual distribution, owing to the fact that the characteristic
   parameters are estimated via directly calculating the statistics of RCS.
   The Bayesian-Markov Chain Monte Carlo (Bayesian-MCMC) method is
   introduced herein to estimate the parameters so as to improve the
   fitting accuracies of fluctuation models. The parameter estimations of
   the lognormal and the Legendre polynomial models are reformulated in the
   Bayesian framework. The MCMC algorithm is then adopted to calculate the
   parameter estimates. Numerical results show that the distribution curves
   obtained by the proposed method exhibit improved consistence with the
   actual ones, compared with those fitted by the conventional method. The
   fitting accuracy could be improved by no less than 25\% for both
   fluctuation models, which implies that the Bayesian-MCMC method might be
   a good candidate among the optimal parameter estimation methods for
   stealth aircraft RCS models.}},

Abstract = {{The retrogradation properties of rice gels with different milling
   degrees (0, 3, 6, and 9\%) stored at 4 degrees C and -20 degrees C were
   investigated. Results showed that rice gels with the same degrees of
   milling (DOM) stored at 4 degrees C retrograde faster than those stored
   at -20 degrees C. Moreover, higher milling degree leads to a faster
   retrogradation in the same temperature. Texture profile analysis
   demonstrated that samples showed a lower hardness but higher
   adhesiveness during storage at -20 degrees C. Differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) revealed that the higher the milling degree, the
   higher retrogradation index (Delta Hr/Delta Hg) obtained at 4 degrees C
   or -20 degrees C. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated that
   samples stored at -20 degrees C had a lower degree of crystallinity
   compared with those stored at 4 degrees C, which was also confirmed by
   Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed that samples stored at -20
   degrees C presented a more shrinkable appearance with more pores. The
   results are expected to provide some theoretical guidance for retarding
   the retrogradation of rice in processing and preservation industry.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing adoption of product recommendation agents (PRAs) by
   e-commerce merchants makes it an important area of study for information
   systems researchers. PRAs are a type of Web personalization technology
   that provides individual consumers with product recommendations based on
   their product-related needs and preferences expressed explicitly or
   implicitly. Whereas extant research mainly assumes that such
   recommendation technologies are designed to benefit consumers and
   focuses on the positive impact of PRAs on consumers' decision quality
   and decision effort, this study represents an early effort to examine
   PRAs that are designed to produce their recommendations on the basis of
   benefiting e-commerce merchants (rather than benefiting consumers) and
   to investigate how the availability and the design of warning messages
   (a potential detection support mechanism) can enhance consumers'
   performance in detecting such biased PRAs. Drawing on signal detection
   theory, the literature on warning messages, and the literature on
   message framing, we identified two content design characteristics of
   warning messages-the inclusion of risk-handling advice and the framing
   of risk-handling advice-and investigated how they influence consumers'
   detection performance. The results of an online experiment reveal that a
   simple warning message without accompanying advice on how to detect bias
   is a double-edged sword, because it increases correct detection of
   biased PRAs (hits) at the cost of increased incorrect detection (false
   alarms). By contrast, including in warning messages risk-handling advice
   about how to check for bias (particularly when the advice is framed to
   emphasize the loss from not following the advice) increases correct
   detection and, more importantly, also decreases incorrect detection. The
   patterns of findings are in line with the predictions of signal
   detection theory. With an enriched understanding of how the availability
   and the content design of warning messages can assist consumers in the
   context of PRA-assisted online shopping, the results of this study serve
   as a basis for future theoretical development and yield valuable
   insights that can guide practice and the design of effective warning
   messages.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel hysteresis compensation method for
   increasing the measurement accuracy of magnetoresistive (MR) sensors
   such as anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), giant magnetoresistance
   (GMR), and tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) sensors. A coil consisting of
   one winding is processed on top of the sensor element. This
   configuration allows short current pulses (positive and negative) to
   generate a defined magnet field, which should be much stronger than the
   field to be measured. In this case, the MR sensors can always be kept in
   the same magnetic loop (major loop) during the measurement cycle. By
   demodulating or averaging the output signal of the sensor, the influence
   of the sensors hysteresis can be largely reduced. A mixed signal circuit
   consisting of a field-programmable gate array, analog-to-digital
   converters and analog switches is used to generate the pulses. AMR, GMR,
   and TMR current sensors are chosen as examples in the experiment.
   Current measurements with and without controlled magnetic field pulse
   are compared. A hysteresis reduction to nearly 20\% of the original
   value, by using the novel hysteresis compensation method, is reached.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the disadvantages of massive calculation and slow speed of
   traditional Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm, we
   propose an improved image mosaic method which combines Wavelet Transform
   (WT) and Compressed Sensing (CS) algorithm. The method works as follows.
   Firstly, images are transformed with wavelet and compressed using
   compressed sensing technology. Then, image feature points are extracted
   in combination with SIFT algorithm. Finally, Sequential Similarity
   Detection Algorithm (SSDA) with adaptive threshold is used to fast
   search of image matching to find out an optimal stitching line, and a
   panoramic image is obtained. Experimental results demonstrate that the
   method realizes fast image matching, efficiently overcomes the
   shortcomings of heavy computation and low efficiency in the process of
   extracting image features, and guarantees matching accuracy and
   stitching efficiency, which meets the real-time requestments in machine
   vision system. This algorithm can be applied to image matching and
   stitching in the field of digital image security.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aim: Gigantic pressure sores pose a daunting challenge
   for plastic surgeons. This paper presents a composite gluteofemoral flap
   for reconstruction of large pressure sores over the sacrococcygeal
   region.
   Methods: In this anatomical study, 30 embalmed cadaveric lower limbs
   were used for dissection to observe the musculocutaneous perforators of
   the inferior gluteal artery and the longitudinal nutritional vascular
   chain of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve. In this clinical study,
   eight patients underwent surgical harvest of the composite gluteofemoral
   flap for coverage of grade IV sacrococcygeal pressure sores. The size of
   the pressure sores ranged between 16 x 9 cm and 22 x 10 cm.
   Results: The inferior gluteal artery was present in 26 cases and absent
   in four cases. It gave off two to four musculocutaneous branches with a
   diameter larger than 0.5 mm to the gluteus maximus. A direct cutaneous
   branch was given off at the inferior margin of the gluteus maximus,
   serving as a nutritional artery for the posterior femoral cutaneous
   nerve. The size of the flap harvested ranged between 22 x 9 cm and 32 x
   10 cm. Flaps in seven patients survived uneventfully and developed
   epidermal necrosis at the distal margin in one case. An average 2-year
   follow-up revealed no recurrence of pressure sores.
   Conclusion: The composite gluteofemoral flap, being robust in blood
   supply, simple in surgical procedure, and large in donor territory, is
   an important addition to the armamentarium. (C) 2015 British Association

Title = {{A Bayesian approach to assess the importance of crustal corrections in
   global anisotropic surface wave tomography}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{203}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1832-1846}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Several recent studies have demonstrated the importance of crustal
   corrections when inverting surface wave data to model lateral variations
   in mantle radial anisotropy. It has also been shown that the choice of
   the prior crustal model to correct the data can strongly influence the
   anisotropy model and potentially lead to different geodynamic
   interpretations. In comparing tomographic models of radial anisotropy
   obtained from different crustal corrections, these studies did not,
   however, determine quantitative model uncertainties. Nevertheless,
   mantle models resulting from different prior crustal corrections are
   statistically different only if the posterior model errors stemming from
   the non-uniqueness of the inverse problem are smaller than the effect of
   the crustal correction itself. Here, we applied a model space search
   approach to global fundamental and higher mode Rayleigh and Love wave
   phase velocity maps to determine reliable, quantitative model
   uncertainties on seismic velocities and radial anisotropy. The technique
   employed enabled us to describe the model space with a posterior
   probability density function, and therefore to test whether models
   obtained from different crustal corrections are statistically different.
   We thus assessed the significance of the choice of the crustal model by
   comparing the posterior model errors to the differences in mantle
   structure resulting from different crustal corrections. We tested prior
   crustal models CRUST2.0, CRUST1.0 and 3SMAC. Our study shows that the
   use of prior crustal corrections from different crustal models yields
   significant discrepancies in mantle velocities around 50 km depth and in
   radial anisotropy down to 100 km. The impact of the crustal correction
   on radial anisotropy can extend down to 250 km in some locations. We
   found that choosing 3SMAC instead of the other crustal models has a
   stronger influence on the mantle model, but that CRUST1.0 and CRUST2.0
   yield statistically identical anisotropy models at all depths, except at
   a few grid cells. Importantly, the effect of the crustal model is most
   significant in continental regions and not so much beneath oceans, which
   has important consequences for determining the depth of continental
   roots. Our results therefore suggest that improving constraints on
   crustal structure in continents is essential for our understanding of
   continent formation. Our work also demonstrates that the prior crustal
   model does not significantly affect radial anisotropy and velocities at
   depths greater than 100 km. This implies that if geodynamic
   interpretations of radial anisotropy below 100 km depth were to account
   for tomographic model uncertainties, they would not depend on the choice
   of the prior crustal model. It is therefore important for geodynamicists
   and seismologists to work in concert and to put effort into determining
   quantitative tomographic model uncertainties before interpreting the
   results. Our results also caution against the use of 3SMAC to correct
   surface wave data for studies of the continental lithosphere and suggest
   that the solid Earth community would benefit from putting some efforts
   towards building a revised 3SMAC. The discrepancies between mantle
   models built based on 3SMAC crustal corrections and those based on
   CRUST1.0 or CRUST2.0 should also help shed light on the validity of the
   geodynamical assumptions made in the construction of models like 3SMAC.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the rectification responses exhibited by two kinds
   of SiGe HBTs when electromagnetic interference (EMI) is injected at the
   base of the transistor. The variation of the EMI induced DC offset after
   hot carrier stress is also studied. The experimental results show that
   the EMI response of a single SiGe HBT is different from that of a Si
   BJT. With interference present, the DC current gain increases at low
   base-emitter (BE) bias and decreases at larger V-BE values.The absence
   of AC crowding induced DC crowding along with the base recombination
   current accounts for the increase of current gain. The base-width effect
   and the high-injection effect tend to decrease the gain in presence of
   interference. The simulation results show that the Gummel-Poon model is
   able to quantitatively model the EMI response of a SiGe HBT. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this study was to develop an instrument that
   assesses university students' perceived readiness for computer-supported
   collaborative learning (CSCL). Assessment in CSCL research had
   predominantly focused on measuring ``after-collaboration{''} outcomes
   and ``during-collaboration{''} behaviors while
   ``before-collaboration{''} assessment was rarely studied. Given the
   nature of high learner agency and self-directness necessary in CSCL
   contexts, it was assumed that a sufficient level of student readiness
   for CSCL could promote positive attitudes and behaviors during the
   collaborative learning process and subsequent learning outcomes.
   Considering the importance of a before-collaboration status, this study
   proposes the new notion of students' readiness for CSCL (SR-CSCL) and
   presents a set of criteria to theoretically define and empirically
   measure the perceived level of SR-CSCL. Drawing on prior research on
   CSCL and readiness issues, we developed the SR-CSCL instrument with a
   three-dimensional framework consisting of: (a) motivation for
   collaborative learning, (b) prospective behaviors for collaborative
   learning and (c) online learning aptitude. The SR-CSCL instrument was
   validated with the university students in China in the pilot study (N =
   120) and the main study (N = 295). Overall, the results showed some
   evidence of reliability and validity for the proposed instrument. This
   study presents an empirical assessment tool that can help instructors
   and researchers better understand and investigate how to assess and
   increase students' readiness levels in order to enhance their learning
   experiences in CSCL environments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a three-dimensional pseudo-potential-based
   lattice Boltzmann (LB) model with an improved forcing scheme for
   multiphase flows. The Chapman Enskog multiscale analysis shows that the
   proposed forcing scheme allows the lattice Boltzmann equation to recover
   the three-dimensional hydrodynamical equations with additional terms
   that correspond to the mechanical stability condition and surface
   tension. Validations of the present LB model with Maxwell construction,
   Laplace's law and oscillation dynamics demonstrate that the model
   enables the density ratio to be as large as 700 in static and
   quasi-static cases while maintaining variable surface tension. Finally,
   the application of the model to simulation of the droplet motion in a
   microchannel shows that the model allows the analysis of important
   effects, including droplet surface tension, channel surface wettability,
   and channel surface roughness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) has developed rapidly in China over the
   past 20 years because of its perceived health and nutritional benefits.
   Blueberry stem blight, caused by fungi in the family Botryosphaeriaceae,
   is the most destructive disease affecting blueberry production and
   quality worldwide. A field survey of 20 blueberry plantations in eight
   provinces across China was conducted to determine the occurrence and
   distribution of Botryosphaeriaceae species. In total, 69
   Botryosphaeriaceae isolates associated with blueberry twig dieback and
   stem blight were identified based on morphological characteristics and
   analyses of nucleotide sequences of three genomic regions: the internal
   transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2), a partial sequence of the
   beta-tubulin gene, and part of the translation elongation factor 1-alpha
   gene (EF1-alpha). Three species were identified, including:
   Botryosphaeria dothidea, Neofusicoccum parvum and Lasiodiplodia
   theobromae. Botryosphaeria dothidea and N. parvum were the most
   prevalent species and were widely distributed in all blueberry-growing
   regions. In contrast, L. theobromae was only found in southeastern
   regions. Koch's postulates showed all three species to be pathogenic
   when inoculated with mycelial plugs on detached and intact blueberry
   stems (cv. Bluecrop). Pathogenicity tests showed N. parvum and L.
   theobromae to be more virulent than B. dothidea. To our knowledge, this
   study is the first comprehensive description for morphology,
   phylogenetic analysis, and distribution of Botryosphaeriaceae spp. as
   causal agents of blueberry stem blight in China.}},

Abstract = {{Intermittent irrigation has attracted much attention as a water-saving
   technology in arid and semi-arid regions. For understanding the effect
   of intermittent irrigation on water and solute storage varied from
   irrigation amount per time (IRA), irrigation application frequency
   (IRAF), irrigation intervals (IRI) and even soil texture (ST),
   intermittent irrigation experiment was carried out in 33 micro-plots in
   Inner Mongolia, China. The experiment results were used for the
   calibration and validation of HYDRUS-1D software. Then 3 ST (silty clay
   loam, silty loam, and silty clay), 5 IRA (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 cm), 4 IRAF
   (2, 3, 4, and 5 times) and 4 IRI (1, 2, 3, and 4 days) were combined and
   total 240 scenarios were simulated by HYDRUS-1D. Analysis of variance
   (ANVOA) of simulated results indicated that ST, IRA, and IRAF had
   significant effect on salt and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) storage of 0-40
   cm depth soil in intermittent irrigation while only ST affected soil
   water storage obviously. Furthermore, salt leaching percentage (SLP) and
   water use efficiency (WUE) of 0-40 cm depth were calculated and
   statistical prediction models for SLP were established based on the
   ANOVA using multiple regression analysis in each soil texture. Then
   constraint conditions of soil water storage (around field capacity),
   salt storage (smaller than 168 mg.cm(-2)), WUE (as large as possible) in
   0-40 cm depth and total irrigation water amount (less than 25 cm) were
   proposed to find out the optimal intermittent irrigation strategies.
   Before sowing, the optimal irrigation strategy for silty clay loam soil
   was 6 cm IRA, 3 times IRAF, and 2 days IRI respectively. For silty loam
   and silty clay soils, IRA, IRAF, and IRI were 8 cm, 3 times, and 2 days
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A novel quadrupole mass spectrometer using microwave plasma torch as the
   ionization source was developed (MPT-QMS) for the analysis of trace
   metal elements in water samples. The influence of ion funnel on

   collision induced dissociation (CID) by modulating the RF voltage of the
   ion funnel, which quantitatively broke polyatomic ions produced by MPT
   into mono-atomic ions. Such effect significantly reduced the complexity
   of the mass spectrum caused by multi-atom ions. In contrast to a linear
   ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ) without ion funnel, the result of
   MPT-QMS was easier to be identified. A mixed sample containing 20 metal
   elements was detected by this instrument, the detection limits of most
   elements were between 0.02 and 1.4 ng/mL. Compared to ICP-MS, MPT-QMS

Title = {{Oxytocin enhances attentional bias for neutral and positive expression

Abstract = {{There is considerable interest in the potential therapeutic role of the
   neuropeptide oxytocin in altering attentional bias towards emotional
   social stimuli in psychiatric disorders. However, it is still unclear
   whether oxytocin primarily influences attention towards positive or
   negative valence social stimuli. Here in a double-blind, placebo
   controlled, between subject design experiment in 60 healthy male
   subjects we have used the highly sensitive dual-target rapid serial
   visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm to investigate whether intranasal
   oxytocin (40 IU) treatment alters attentional bias for emotional faces.
   Results show that oxytocin improved recognition accuracy of neutral and
   happy expression faces presented in the second target position (T2)
   during the period of reduced attentional capacity following prior
   presentation of a first neutral face target (T1), but had no effect on
   recognition of negative expression faces (angry, fearful, sad). Oxytocin
   also had no effect on recognition of non-social stimuli (digits) in this
   task. Recognition accuracy for neutral faces at T2 was negatively
   associated with autism spectrum quotient (ASQ) scores in the placebo
   group, and oxytocin's facilitatory effects were restricted to a
   sub-group of subjects with higher ASQ scores. Our results therefore
   indicate that oxytocin primarily enhances the allocation of attentional
   resources towards faces expressing neutral or positive emotion and does
   not influence that towards negative emotion ones or non-social stimuli.
   This effect of oxytocin is strongest in healthy individuals with higher
   autistic trait scores, thereby providing further support for its
   potential therapeutic use in autism spectrum disorder. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Diversity in the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire provides a miniature
   defense ability for the T cell immune system that may be related to
   tumor initiation and progression. Understanding the T cell immune status
   of leukemia patients is critical for establishing specific
   immunotherapies. Previous studies have reported abnormal TCR repertoires
   and clonally expanded TCR V beta T cells in chronic myeloid leukemia in
   chronic phase (CP-CML). In this study, we investigated the distribution
   and clonality of the TCR V beta repertoire in 4 cases with
   imatinib-resistant CML in blast crisis (BC-CML) with abelson murine
   leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL1) kinase domain mutations (KDMs).
   Examination of TCR V beta expression and clonality was performed by
   reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and GeneScan
   analysis. Significantly skewed TCR V beta repertoires were observed in
   BC-CML patients with different KDMs, and 4 to 8 oligoclonally expanded
   TCR V beta subfamilies could be identified in each sample. Intriguingly,
   a relatively highly expanded V beta 9 clone with the same length as
   complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) (139 bp) was found in all
   three CML patients in lymphoid blast crisis (LBC-CML) who had different
   KDMs, but the clone was not detected in the only CML patient in myeloid
   blast crisis (MBC-CML). In conclusion, restricted TCR V beta repertoire
   expression and decreased clone complexity was a general phenomenon
   observed in the BC-CML patients with different KDMs, indicating the
   T-cell immunodeficiency of these patients. In addition, clonally
   expanded V beta 9 T cell clones may indicate a specific immune response
   to leukemia-associated antigens in LBC-CML patients.}},

Abstract = {{The oils leaked into water seriously threaten human health, thus it is
   urgent for scientific researchers to treat the pollution caused by oils.
   In this work, poly (styrene-co-butyl acrylate)-based fibrous membranes
   which were able to absorb and separate oils from water were prepared via
   electrospinning. Their thermal properties and crystallization behaviors
   were characterized by thermogravimetric analyzer, differential scanning
   calorimetry, and X-ray diffractometer. Field emission scanning electron
   microscopy was employed to observe their pores, and a gravimetric method
   was adopted to calculate their porosity. Water contact angle in air and
   oil contact angle in water were used to describe the hydrophobicity of
   the prepared fibrous membranes. Finally, the fibrous membranes were
   applied to the fields of oils absorption and separation. The results
   showed that the absorbencies of the fibrous membranes for unmoving pure
   oil were higher than 50 g/g, and the maximum absorbency even reached 91
   g/g; additionally, the fibrous membranes also absorbed moving oil from
   the mixture of oil and water. The floating oil was completely separated
   from water by the used fibrous membrane after separation apparatus ran
   for 100 min.}},

Abstract = {{Intelligent compaction (IC) is an innovative technology that has been
   used in road and earthwork construction. However, the current IC
   technology is unable to measure material density directly as the
   acceptance criteria by owner agencies. To tackle this issue, the authors
   have developed a sensing-information-statistics integrated model to
   predict asphalt material density for 100\% coverage of construction
   area. Instrumented with the satellite navigation system, accelerometer,
   and infrared sensors, IC rollers measure mechanical responses of roller
   drums and material temperature in real time. With these measurements,
   panel data models-including both the multivariate linear and nonlinear
   models-were developed to predict asphalt material density. A reasoning
   model was proposed to estimate idiosyncratic errors due to uncertainty
   of measurements. An information management software was developed to
   analyze IC measurements with univariate statistics and geo-statistical
   models. Statistical models were implemented and validated with data
   collected from four paving projects in the US. Results indicate that the
   multivariate nonlinear panel data model can predict asphalt material
   density at the project level for 100\% coverage of the construction zone
   within reasonable accuracy. Therefore, this model may serve as an
   enhanced quality control and acceptance tool for asphalt pavement
   construction to improve consistency and uniformity and long-term
   performances.}},

Abstract = {{Small wind power systems (SWPSs) of 100 kW or below are critical in
   addressing increasing global energy consumption and pressing greenhouse
   gas emission issues. Energy cost, i. e., cost of generating 1 kWh or MWh
   of electricity is an important consideration for design, development,
   and operation of SWPSs. Various methods for energy cost estimation have
   been reported, but they typically consider only some aspects of the wind
   power systems. This paper presents a novel energy cost evaluation
   methodology for SWPSs, integrating wind turbine energy production,
   system component efficiency, cost, and reliability together into a
   single comprehensive model. Monte Carlo simulation is applied to produce
   random functional intervals or failure intervals, considering the
   statistical nature of reliability. As compared with previous methods
   with the segregated and deterministic approaches, the new method
   comprehensively analyzes the energy costs of SWPSs through an integrated
   and stochastic approach. The proposed methodology is applied to studies
   of various SWPS configurations at a typical 30-kW level for both
   fixed-speed and variable-speed operations. The simulation results
   present an overview of the investment required for an SWPS over its
   installed lifetime, reveal cost effectiveness of different configuration
   options, and provide a benchmark for energy cost evaluation of wind
   power systems.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study evaluated the longitudinal metabolic alterations
   after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in rats and tested the
   neuroprotective effect of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) using in vivo
   proton short-TE Point-RESolved Spectroscopy method.
   Methods: Rice-Vannucci model was used on 7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats.
   Data were acquired from contralateral and ipsilateral cortex and
   hippocampus, respectively at 4 time points (24-h, 72-h, 7-days, 28-days)
   post-HI. The effect of subcutaneous administration of ALCAR (100 mg/kg)
   immediately after HI, at 4-h, 24-h, and 48-h post-HI was determined.
   Results: Significant reductions in glutathione (P < 0.005), myo-inositol
   (P < 0.002), taurine (P < 0.001), and total creatine (P < 0.005) were
   observed at 24-h postinjury compared with the control group in the
   ipsilateral hippocampus of the HI rat pups. ALCAR-treated-HI rats had
   lower levels of lactate and maintained total creatine at 24-h and had
   smaller lesion size compared with the HI only rats.
   Conclusion: Severe oxidative, osmotic stress, impaired phosphorylation,
   and a preference for anaerobic glycolysis were found in the ipsilateral
   hippocampus in the HI pups at 24-h postinjury. ALCAR appeared to have a
   neuroprotective effect if administered early after HI by serving as an
   energy substrate and promote oxidative cerebral energy producing and
   minimize anaerobic glycolysis. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

   effective clay (montmorillonite, MMT) clusters. In this work, we expand
   that work to predict the overall Young's moduli of nylon 6/MMT
   nanocomposites. First, a micromechanics method (i.e. the
   rule-of-mixtures) is shown to be effective in calculating the overall
   Young's moduli of clay-based polymer nanocomposites. Then, the overall
   Young's moduli of clay-based polymer nanocomposites with either
   well-aligned or randomly dispersed effective clay clusters of various
   clay volume fractions are calculated based on the individual Young's
   moduli of effective clay clusters and polymer matrix by the
   rule-of-mixtures method. By comparing the simulated results with
   measured data in the literature, it is shown that the present approach
   provides an effective way to predict the overall Young's moduli of nylon
   6/MMT nanocomposites.}},

Abstract = {{A combined treatment technology (DEF-BIO) using the direct
   electro-Fenton (DEF) process and bioremediation (BIO) was established in
   this study. The performance of the DEF-BIO process on the remediation of
   a pyrene (PYR)-contaminated soil was evaluated in a slurry reactor. The
   appropriate order of application was to conduct the DEF process followed
   by BIO, evaluated through analysis of the degradation characteristics of
   each process individually. In addition, the application time of the DEF
   process affected the efficiency of the combined process. The optimum
   time to apply the DEF process was determined through an analysis of the
   induced changes in PYR intermediates, pH, soil organic matter (SOM) and
   bacteria. The optimum application time of the DEF process was 6 h. All
   the induced changes were beneficial for the BIO phase. The removal of
   PYR was 91.02\% for DEF-BIO after 72 h, and the efficiency was almost
   50\% increased, compared with the individual DEF and BIO treatments.
   Therefore, the combined process of DEF-BIO process may be an efficient
   and promising method for the remediation.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Background: Recent research indicates that injections inducing unwanted
   anaphylactoid reactions occur frequently in a clinical setting. In this
   paper, we explored anaphylactoid reactions trends in animal models
   following ginsenosides injections.
   Methods: Our anaphylactoid animal model was optimized by comparing
   reactions between BN rats, SD rats, guinea pigs and ICR mice to first
   intravenous exposure to standard compounds including ovalbumin (OVA),
   tannic acid (TA), Tween 80 (T80), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and
   Compound 48/80 (C48/80), Shengmai injection (SMI) and Xuesaitong
   injection (XSTI) which contains ginsenosides, respectively. The
   anaphylactoid symptoms were documented and the plasma levels of
   histamine were assessed. Subsequently, the IgE levels and total
   complement activity (CH50) were determined to further explore the
   mechanisms underlying the observed anaphylactoid reactions on the
   optimized animal model.
   Results: We observed that BN rats and guinea pigs exhibited particularly
   exacerbated symptoms after administration of OVA, T80, TA, SMI and XSTI.
   Regarding histamine levels, we observed that BN rats were more sensitive
   to TA and XSTI, guinea pigs were more sensitive to OVA, T80 and SMI, and
   SD rats were more sensitive to C48/80. According to both anaphylactoid
   symptom scores and histamine secretion rates, BN rats, in particular,
   were found to be more sensitive to OVA, T80, TA, SMI and XSTI.
   Noteworthy however, the four rodents showed significantly weaker
   anaphylactoid reactions after administration of BSA.
   Conclusion: BN rats were more suitable for comprehensive evaluation of
   anaphylatoid reactions following injections; both IgE levels and CH50
   could be used as auxiliary mediators for the assessment of anaphylactoid
   reactions.}},

Abstract = {{In a preceding paper {[}Comput. Phys. Commun. 184 (1): 51-59, 2013], we
   revisited the problem of calculating Coulomb Green's function and image
   potential near a planar diffuse interface within which the dielectric
   permittivity of the inhomogeneous medium changes continuously along one
   Cartesian direction in a transition layer between two dissimilar
   dielectric materials. In the present paper, we consider a cylindrical
   diffuse interface within which the dielectric permittivity changes
   continuously along the radial direction instead. First we propose a
   specific cylindrical diffuse interface model, termed the quasi-harmonic
   diffuse interface model, that can admit analytical solution for the
   Green's function in terms of the modified Bessel functions. Then and
   more importantly we develop a robust numerical method for building
   Green's functions for any cylindrical diffuse interface models. The main
   idea of the numerical method is, after dividing a diffuse interface into
   multiple sublayers, to approximate the dielectric permittivity profile
   in each one of the sublayers by one of the quasi-harmonic functional
   form rather than simply by a constant value as one would normally do.
   Next we describe how to efficiently compute well-behaved ratios,
   products, and logarithmic derivatives of the modified Bessel functions
   so as to avoid direct evaluations of individual modified Bessel
   functions in our formulations. Finally we conduct numerical experiments
   to show the effectiveness of the quasi-harmonic diffuse interface model
   in overcoming the divergence of the image potential, to validate the
   numerical method in terms of its accuracy and convergence, and to
   demonstrate its capability for computing Green's functions for any
   cylindrical diffuse interface models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we apply a simple finite element numerical scheme,
   proposed in an earlier work (Liu in Math Comput 70(234):579-593, 2000),
   to perform a high resolution numerical simulation of incompressible flow
   over an irregular domain and analyze its boundary layer separation.
   Compared with many classical finite element fluid solvers, this
   numerical method avoids a Stokes solver, and only two Poisson-like
   equations need to be solved at each time step/stage. In addition, its
   combination with the fully explicit fourth order Runge-Kutta (RK4) time
   discretization enables us to compute high Reynolds number flow in a very
   efficient way. As an application of this robust numerical solver, the
   dynamical mechanism of the boundary layer separation for a triangular
   cavity flow with Reynolds numbers and , including the precise values of
   bifurcation location and critical time, are reported in this paper. In
   addition, we provide a super-convergence analysis for the simple finite
   element numerical scheme, using linear elements over a uniform
   triangulation with right triangles.}},

Abstract = {{Interpretive disputes about the text's implied normative framework (its
   aesthetics, ideology, reality-model) involve the reliability of the
   fictive narrator who mediates between interpreter and implied author.
   Narrative and normative reconstruction must go together. But how to
   determine the relations between the text's overt (narratorial) and
   implicit (authorial) frameworks, considering that the one can never be
   taken on trust and the other can never speak except through its
   questionable proxy? Here two modes of discourse necessarily interact,
   one given (in or as fiction) and the other hypothetical (behind the
   fiction). As regards the norms of communication, the first mode depends
   for its reliability on the second; as regards the forms of
   communication, the second depends for its discovery on the first.
   Though omnipresent, our difficulties in relating narrative to normative
   structure yet vary widely, and this essay considers three major
   variables that affect every interpretive activity: (1) the
   conventionality of the implied system of norms; (2) its degree of
   explicitness; and (3) the control of interpretive difficulties through
   compensation systems. Some texts simplify the reader's task by reducing
   fictional mediation to a minimum. Their norms are (a) conventional in
   cultural context; (b) explicitly formulated by (c) a speaker who would
   appear, or has proved, reliable. This transparent communication is
   favored by popular literature and by didactic or strongly ideological
   texts. The other extreme combines divergence, implicitness, and
   unreliability into the opaque (or ambiguous) discourse typical of
   modernism and experimental narrative. The intermediate cases have at
   least one variable that facilitates interpretation, so making up for the
   more problematic sides of the discourse. For instance, explicitness
   often compensates for deviance, where (as in Tolstoy's Kreutzer Sonata)
   the work advocates idiosyncratic norms.}},

Abstract = {{Client oriented breeding (COB) offers manifold advantages as compared to
   research station breeding in terms varietal adoption and acceptance by
   farmers in marginal regions. Interaction of breeders and farmers has
   identified key traits with high impact potential including enhanced
   water-use-efficiency, tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses,
   increased biomass yield, nutritional quality, and persistence. The
   simplest approach to abiotic stresses tolerance breeding is also the
   most effective especially in forage crops. It is to select for biomass
   yield which is the integrating complex trait and to carry out the
   selection in a representative stress environment. It can be more
   efficient by carefully managed stress screening and by carefully
   choosing parents of crosses so that various physiological traits can be
   pyramided. This implies a reduction in the number of crosses that are
   made so that larger population can be employed, an approach that has
   been effective in the breeding of stress tolerant, widely adapted in
   crop plants. Potential benefits of client oriented breeding have been a
   source of widespread interest and resulted in numerous efforts to
   achieve the desired synergy amongst different aspects. Presently wide
   hybridization with selection in the target environment offers the best
   opportunity for widening the genetic base for stress resistance for
   sustainable goal. Polycross nursery programme has been used in
   developing new composite/synthetic varieties of lucerne by various
   organizations and the methodology can be extended for enhanced level of
   moisture stress tolerance as compared to existing varieties. Integration
   of client oriented and molecular breeding approaches and the latest
   technologies may also contribute to the sustainability of profitable
   forage crop production systems to meet current and future demands for
   these crops.}},

Abstract = {{Our interest here is on comparing Atanassov type intuitionistic
   membership grades, this is a problem since they are not completely

   between interval valued membership grades and Atanassov type
   intuitionistic membership grades. Inspired by this we review some ideas
   on the formulation of representative values for interval valued
   membership grades. We then use this formal correspondence to help
   transfer these ideas to Atanassov type intuitionistic membership grades.
   We note while the construction of a representative value requires the
   satisfaction of some properties, these properties do not completely
   constrain its formulation and as such leave room for the inclusion of
   some subjective aspects in formulating representative values. Here we
   look at different representative values. A particularly notable example
   of representative values investigated here is what we refer to as the
   Golden Rule representative value.}},

   nanosilver, respectively. The successful synthetic steps represented a
   facile and scalable route to multifunctional nanocatalyst against
   waterborne pollutants with organic and microbial constituents via WO3

Abstract = {{Deterioration due to corrosion becomes a more serious problem when
   future earthquakes with unpredicted intensity and time are considered.
   Therefore, the prediction of performance levels of corroded reinforced
   concrete structures is important to prevent serious premature damage. In
   this study, a corroded, 50-year-old high school building was analyzed by
   considering corrosion effects and is presented here as a case study. The
   relevant data obtained from the structure were used to predict its
   performance level for different time periods by combining two major
   effects of corrosion. Deformation due to bond-slip relationships and
   loss in cross-sectional areas of reinforcement bars were examined as a
   function of corrosion rate for five corrosion levels. Plastic hinges
   were defined as a consequence of corrosion effects, and they were used
   to perform nonlinear push-over analyses. Incremental dynamic analysis
   was then performed for 20 individual earthquake ground motion records to
   predict the structure's time-dependent performance levels as a function
   of corrosion rate. Results showed that corrosion had a serious effect on
   the performance levels of the school building considered in this study
   by decreasing bond strength. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{In both China and in the United States, policies of `positive
   discrimination' were originally intended to lessen educational and
   economic inequalities, and to provide equal opportunities. As with
   affirmative action in the American context, China's `preferential
   policies' are broad-reaching, but are best known for taking ethnic
   background into consideration for university admissions. The rhetoric of
   China's preferential policy discourse has remained surprisingly constant
   but shifts to a market-economy and incorporation of neoliberal elements
   have resulted in fee-based reforms that discourage inclusion of poorer
   students. In addition, as ethnic minority students principally from
   Western China compete to enter `self-funded' college preparatory
   programmes, public funding is being directed towards the achievement of
   `world-class' universities overwhelmingly concentrated in Eastern China.
   In contrast, in the United States, the difficulty of defending
   affirmative action in the face of a neoliberal climate has resulted in a
   shift in policy. If in China the policy remains even as the `rule' has
   changed (Arno 2009), in contrast, in American institutions the rhetoric
   has shifted away from affirmative action in favour of diversity but
   efforts to hold on to the rules that promote equal opportunities remain.}},

Abstract = {{The enhanced optical properties of metallic subwavelength gratings with
   very narrow slits have recently been extensively studied in the field of
   plasmonics. The optical transmission and reflection of such
   nanostructures, which act as nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS)
   actuators, can be electrically controlled by varying their geometrical
   parameters, giving them great flexibility for numerous applications in
   photonics, opto-electronics, and sensing. The previous challenges in
   controlling the optical properties were overcome by forming a metallic
   subwavelength grating with an NEMS actuator in mid-air, allowing the
   grating to be physically moved with the bias voltage. The device can
   shift the plasmon resonance wavelength with an electrical signal. The
   resonance wavelength for Wood's anomaly at the infrared region is
   predicted through simulations to shift by approximately 150 nm. We
   discuss the effect of polarization on the optical properties and grating
   mechanism. The reported effect may be used to achieve active spectral
   tuning and switching in a wide range of applications.}},

Title = {{A Current-Mirror-Based GaAs-HBT RF Power Detector Suitable for Base
   Terminal Monitoring in an HBT Power Stage}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the circuit design and measurement results of a new
   GaAs-HBT RF power detector proposed for use in WiMAX and wireless LAN
   transmitter applications. The detector, which is based on a simple
   current-mirror topology, occupies a small die area. It is, therefore,
   not only easy to implement together with a GaAs-HBT power amplifier, but
   can also offer approximately logarithmic (linear-in-dB) characteristics.
   Because it can also be driven with small voltage amplitudes, it is
   suitable for base-terminal monitoring at an HBT power stage. When the
   detector is used as a base-terminal power monitor, an appropriate base
   resistance added to the detection HBT effectively suppresses frequency
   dispersion of the detected voltage characteristics. Measurements of a
   prototype detector incorporated into a single-stage HBT power amplifier
   fabricated on the same die are as follows. The detector is capable of
   delivering a detected voltage of 0.35-2.5 V with a slope of less than
   0.17 V/dB over a 4-to-24-dBm output power range at 3.5 GHz while drawing
   a current of less than 1.8 mA from a 2.85-V supply. While satisfying a
   log conformance error of less than 1 dB over an amplifier output power
   range from 4 dBm to 24 dBm, it can also suppress the detected power
   dispersion within 0.18 dB at approximately 15 dBm of output power over a
   3.1-3.9-GHz-wide frequency range. This dispersion value is approximately
   one-tenth that of a conventional collector-terminal-monitor-type diode
   detector.}},

Abstract = {{The relative proportion of kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) I-IV
   activities in the brain is similar between humans and rats. Moreover,
   KAT II is considered to be the main enzyme for kynurenic acid production
   in the brain. Taken together, human KAT II knock-in (hKAT II KI) rats
   will become a valuable tool for the evaluation of KAT II targeted drugs
   as a human mimetic model. Although we initially tried the approach by
   conventional gene-targeting via embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to generate
   them, we had to give up the production because of no recombinant ESCs.
   Accordingly, we developed a method to improve the efficiency of
   homologous recombination (HR) in ESCs by the combination with the
   CRISPR/Cas system. Co-electroporation of Cas9 plasmid, single guide RNA
   plasmid and hKAT II KI vector increased the number of drug-resistant
   colonies and greatly enhanced the HR efficiency from 0 to 36 \%. All the
   clones which we obtained showed the same sequence as designed. These
   recombinant clones resulted in chimeras that transmitted the hKAT II KI
   allele to their offspring. hKAT II KI rats showed no reduction of KATs
   mRNA expression and the amount of kynurenic acid was similar between the
   hKAT II KI rats and the wild type in their brains. These results
   indicate that the methodology presented in this report can overcome the
   problem encountered in conventional gene-targeting that prevented
   production of humanized rats.}},

Abstract = {{Health Japan 21 plan establishes specific targets for aspects of health
   including oral health for 2010, in an effort to increase health
   expectancy. Despite this, there has been insufficient improvement in
   oral health status in adults. The objective of this cross-sectional
   study was to determine the factors associated with effective oral health
   programs for adults in Japanese municipalities. Questionnaires were
   mailed to all 1,472 municipalities in Japan and responses were obtained
   from 862 municipalities (response rate: 58.6\%). After excluding 71
   municipalities with ``unknown{''} answer, no answer, or lack of relevant
   information, we analyzed the data from the remaining 791 municipalities
   with or without oral health programs for adults self-reported as
   effective within three years. Multilevel Poisson regression models were
   used to examine the associations of effective programs with oral health
   personnel, contact with related agencies, the establishment of Health
   Japan 21 goals, financial status, the density of dentists and population
   density at the municipality level, and having oral health personnel at
   the prefecture level. Three hundred and fifty-four municipalities
   reported having effective programs. In the fully adjusted model, having
   dental hygienists in the municipal office (P < 0.05) and a high number
   of contacts with related agencies (P < 0.05) were significantly
   associated with having effective programs. These results suggest that
   having dental hygienists and contact with related agencies such as
   residents, local dental associations, companies, community general
   support centers, or medical, nursing or welfare facilities are promoting
   factors for effective adult oral health programs in Japanese
   municipalities.}},

Abstract = {{We aimed to investigate the effect of chronic radiation exposure

   both boar and inobuta during 2012, after the Fukushima accident.
   Morphological analysis and electron-probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA)
   were also undertaken on the testes. The Cs-134 and Cs-137 levels were
   6430 +/- 23 and 6820 +/- 32 Bq/kg in the boar testes, and 755 +/- 13 and
   747 +/- 17 Bq/kg in the inobuta testes, respectively. The internal and
   external exposure of total Cs-134 and Cs-137 in the boar testes were
   47.1 mGy and 176.2 mGy, respectively, whereas in the inobuta testes,
   these levels were 6.09 mGy and 59.8 mGy, respectively. Defective
   spermatogenesis was not detected by the histochemical analysis of
   radiation-exposed testes for either animal. In neither animal were Cs
   molecules detected, using EPMA. In conclusion, we showed that adverse
   radiation-induced effects were not detected in the examined boar and

Abstract = {{Precise spectra of 3C 279 in the 0.5-70 keV range, obtained during two
   epochs of Swift and NuSTAR observations, are analysed using a
   near-equipartition model. We apply a one-zone leptonic model with a
   three-parameter log-parabola electron energy distribution to fit the
   Swift and NuSTAR X-ray data, as well as simultaneous optical and
   Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data. The Markov chain Monte Carlo technique is used
   to search the high-dimensional parameter space and evaluate the
   uncertainties on model parameters. We show that the two spectra can be
   successfully fitted in near-equipartition conditions, defined by the
   ratio of the energy density of relativistic electrons to magnetic field
   zeta e being close to unity. In both spectra, the observed X-rays are
   dominated by synchrotron self-Compton photons, and the observed
   gamma-rays are dominated by Compton scattering of external infrared
   photons from a surrounding dusty torus. Model parameters are well
   constrained. From the low state to the high state, both the curvature of
   the log-parabola width parameter and the synchrotron peak frequency
   significantly increase. The derived magnetic fields in the two states
   are nearly identical (similar to 1G), but the Doppler factor in the high
   state is larger than that in the low state (similar to 28 versus similar
   to 18). We derive that the gamma-ray emission site takes place outside
   the broad-line region, at similar to 0.1 pc from the black hole, but
   within the dusty torus. Implications for 3C 279 as a source of
   high-energy cosmic rays are discussed.}},

   baseline survey data. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected in
   1948 Chinese adults aged 18 to 69 years. The observed associations of
   sodium, potassium, sodium-potassium ratio, and systolic blood pressure
   (SBP) were stronger in the overweight/obese population than among those
   of normal weight. Among overweight/obese respondents, each additional
   standard deviation (SD) higher of urinary sodium excretion (SD=85 mmol)
   and potassium excretion (SD=19 mmol) was associated with a 1.31 mm Hg
   (95\% confidence interval, 0.37-2.26) and -1.43 mm Hg (95\% confidence
   interval, -2.23 to -0.63) difference in SBP, and each higher unit in
   sodium-potassium ratio was associated with a 0.54 mm Hg (95\% confidence
   interval, 0.34-0.75) increase in SBP. The association between sodium,
   potassium, sodium-potassium ratio, and prevalence of hypertension among
   overweight/obese patients was similar to that of SBP. Our study
   indicated that the relationships between BP and both urinary sodium and
   potassium might be modified by BMI status in Chinese adults. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Aim: This study investigated the prevalence of circumcision among
   non-Muslim schoolboys in Urumqi, China, and how acceptable their parents
   found the practice.
   Methods: A convenient cluster sample of non-Muslim schoolboys (n = 3614)
   aged six to 15 years of age and 873 mothers and 927 fathers completed
   self-administered questionnaires. We compared the consistency of the
   circumcision status reported by students and their parents and analysed
   the factors that influenced the parents to have their child circumcised.
   Results: The mean age at circumcision was 8.3 years and the adjusted
   prevalence was 46.2\%. Up to 45.4\% of fathers and 66\% of mothers with
   uncircumcised sons were willing to circumcise their sons after receiving
   further information on circumcision. Mothers were more likely to support
   circumcision if they had higher education levels and higher family
   income, were employed as government officials and had family members who
   had been circumcised, including their husband. Fathers were more likely
   to support circumcision if they were highly educated and had been
   circumcised themselves.
   Conclusion: The prevalence and acceptability of circumcision were higher
   than expected in this traditional schoolboy population in Urumqi, China.
   Factors that increased parental support for circumcision included high
   education and the father being circumcised.}},

Abstract = {{We present an overview of the internal structure of the ophiolite
   massifs along the Yarlung Zangbo suture zone (YZSZ) in southern Tibet
   with a focus on the geochemical character and tectonic evolution of the
   Ocean Island Basalt (OIB) and mafic alkaline rock assemblages associated
   with these ophiolites. The Jurassic - early Cretaceous lavas, massive
   diabase and gabbroic rocks are either tectonically intercalated with the
   early Cretaceous, subduction-influenced ophiolitic units, or occur as
   thrust sheets or blocks with an early Cretaceous melange and in a
   Jurassic-Cretaceous flysch unit structurally beneath these ophiolites.
   They display uniform chondrite-normalized REE patterns with light rare
   earth element (LREE) enrichment and heavy rare earth element (HREE)
   depletion, no obvious Eu anomalies or negative Nb, Ta and Ti anomalies,
   and primitive mantle normalized trace element patterns with significant
   large-ion lithophile element (LILE) enrichment, similar to those of
   modern OIB and the Hawaiian alkaline basalts. These mafic alkaline rock
   assemblages represent OIB- and Plume-type (P-type) oceanic crustal rocks
   (with no subduction influence) that formed from magmas produced by
   partial melting of plume-metasomatized asthenospheric mantle source
   during the early stages of the opening of a Neotethyan seaway between
   Proto-India and Eurasia. Subsequent consumption of this OIB-P-type
   mid-ocean ridge (MOR) oceanic lithosphere at an intraoceanic subduction
   zone produced the similar to 130-120 Ma forearc to backarc, SSZ oceanic
   crust within the same Neotethys. The evolutionary history of the YZSZ
   ophiolites thus reflects a poly-phase melt history and different mantle
   melt sources. The final tectonic juxtaposition of the older OIB- and
   P-type oceanic crustal rocks with SSZ-type oceanic lithosphere fragments
   took place as the northern passive continental margin of Proto-India
   collided with and underplated the intraoceanic subduction-accretion
   system in the late Cretaceous. The YZSZ displays a complete Wilson cycle
   record of the rift-drift, seafloor spreading and subduction zone
   tectonic evolution of the Mesozoic Neotethys.}},

   the saturation function sat(.) belongs to the sector {[}0, 1],
   sufficient conditions are derived by constructing saturation-dependent
   Lyapunov functions to ensure that the periodic sampling system is

Abstract = {{It has long been a dream in the electronics industry to be able to write
   out electronics directly, as simply as printing a picture onto paper
   with an office printer. The firstever prototype of a liquid-metal
   printer has been invented and demonstrated by our lab, bringing this
   goal a key step closer. As part of a continuous endeavor, this work is
   dedicated to significantly extending such technology to the consumer
   level by making a very practical desktop liquid-metal printer for
   society in the near future. Through the industrial design and technical
   optimization of a series of key technical issues such as working
   reliability, printing resolution, automatic control, human-machine
   interface design, software, hardware, and integration between software
   and hardware, a high-quality personal desktop liquid-metal printer that
   is ready for mass production in industry was fabricated. Its basic
   features and important technical mechanisms are explained in this paper,
   along with demonstrations of several possible consumer end-uses for
   making functional devices such as light-emitting diode (LED) displays.
   This liquid-metal printer is an automatic, easyto- use, and low-cost
   personal electronics manufacturing tool with many possible applications.
   This paper discusses important roles that the new machine may play for a
   group of emerging needs. The prospective future of this cutting-edge
   technology is outlined, along with a comparative interpretation of
   several historical printing methods. This desktop liquid-metal printer
   is expected to become a basic electronics manufacturing tool for a wide
   variety of emerging practices in the academic realm, in industry, and in
   education as well as for individual end-users in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{Absorption and emission properties of oxidized graphene quantum dots
   (GQDs) and amino functionalized GQDs (NG) were explored by B3LYP method
   combined with 6-31G (d) basis set. The oxygen- and nitrogen-containing
   groups can tune the intensity as well as the wavelength of absorption
   and emission. The groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, amide, and
   pyridine-like N can appropriately lengthen the absorption and emission
   wavelength of GQDs. However, the carbonyl group, graphitic-like N, and
   pyrrolic-like N obviously decrease the oscillator strength and lengthen
   the emission wavelength of GQDs out of the visible region. The lowest
   excited state Si of NG has the strongest emission in investigated
   complexes, which indicates that it is an excellent luminous material.
   The theoretical investigations verify that the oxygen- and
   nitrogen-related groups can tune the luminescence of GQDs. The
   fluorescence quenching of GQDs reduced by ammonia mainly depends on the
   graphitic-like and pyrrolic-like N.}},

Abstract = {{Interleukin-37 (IL-37) is closely associated with several inflammatory
   diseases. However, the role of IL-37 in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid
   arthritis (RA) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the
   associations between serum levels of IL-37 and disease activity,
   inflammatory cytokines, and bone loss in patients with RA. Serum
   cytokines levels were examined by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA). Radiographic bone erosion was assessed using the van der
   Heijde-modified Sharp score and bone mineral density (BMD) was measured
   using DXA. Serum IL-37 levels in RA patients were significantly higher
   than those in HCs (p < 0.001), and were significantly positively
   correlated with clinical parameters of disease activity and serum levels
   of IL-17 and IL-23. In addition, serum IL-37 levels were significantly
   higher in patients with stage IV of radiographic bone erosion than those
   with stage III and stage I-II, and they were significantly higher in
   those with osteopenia and osteoporosis than in those with normal BMD.
   Our results suggest that serum IL-37 levels were increased in patients
   with RA and were positively associated with disease activity,
   IL-17/IL-23 and bone loss in RA, suggesting that IL-37 may play a
   critical role in the pathogenesis of RA.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) combined with CsCl enhancing was
   applied for the first time to the investigation of water transport in
   hardened cement paste. The results show that the contrast of water in CT

   of water ingress into cement paste can be continuously monitored by
   X-ray CT technique and the process can be reconstructed as 2D and 3D
   mapping. The quantitative relationship between water uptake height and
   exposed time is also established in this paper. It is illustrated that
   X-ray CT combined with CsCl enhancing is a powerful and reliable tool

Abstract = {{On basis of triaxial creep experimental results of coal with various
   deviatoric stress levels, a new nonlinear visco-elastic and accelerating
   creep model is put forward. First, Burgers visco-elastic triaxial creep
   model is deduced and used to identify the creep parameters by the
   discrimination criterion of the square of correlation coefficient (R-2)
   and sum of least error square (Q). In Burgers visco-elastic triaxial
   creep model, the visco-elastic modulus G(2) of coal decreases but the
   visco coefficient eta 1 and eta 2 all increase with increasing time,
   which has distinct time scale effect. The Burgers visco-elastic triaxial
   creep model fails in predicting long-term deformation characteristics.
   Then by introducing a time index, a nonlinear visco-elastic triaxial
   creep model is put forward, which can predict better for long-term
   deformation behavior of coal. R-2 identified by nonlinear visco-elastic
   triaxial creep model is higher, but Q identified by nonlinear
   visco-elastic triaxial creep model is smaller 1 order than that by
   Burgers triaxial creep model. However, Burgers and nonlinear
   viscoelastic triaxial creep model is very difficult to describe the
   accelerating creep stage of coal. Therefore in the end, a new nonlinear
   accelerating creep model is put forward in order to describe the
   complete creep curve of coal. The nonlinear accelerating creep model has
   a better agreement with the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Purpose: Leisure activities have been associated with a
   decreased risk of dementia. However, to date, no study has explored how
   apolipoprotein E (ApoE) e4 status or vascular risk factors modified the
   association between leisure activities and dementia risks.
   Methods: This case-control study recruited patients (age >= 60 years)
   with Alzheimer's disease (AD; n=292) and vascular dementia (VaD; n=144)
   and healthy controls (n=506) from three teaching hospitals in Taiwan
   between 2007 and 2010. Information on patient's leisure activities were
   obtained through a questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression models
   were used to assess the association of leisure activities and ApoE e4
   status with the risk of dementia.
   Results: High-frequency physical activity was associated with a
   decreased risk of AD {[}adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.45], and the
   results become more evident among ApoE e4 carriers with AD (AOR = 0.30)
   and VaD (AOR = 0.26). Similar findings were observed for cognitive (AOR
   = 0.42) and social activities (AOR = 0.55) for AD. High-frequency
   physical, cognitive, and social activities were associated with a
   decreased risk of VaD (AOR = 0.29-0.60). Physical and social activities
   significantly interacted with each other on the risk of VaD
   (p(interaction) = 0.04).
   Conclusion: Physical activity consistently protects against AD and VaD.
   Significant interactions were identified across different types of
   leisure activities in lowering dementia risk. Copyright (C) 2014,

Title = {{Manufacturers' channel structures when selling asymmetric competing

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{170}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturers often face the fundamental channel structure decision,
   namely, whether to sell their products directly to consumers or
   indirectly through an intermediary. To address this issue, extensive
   research has analyzed equilibrium channel structures for competing,
   equally substitutable products. However, in reality, many competing
   products are asymmetric in both substitutability and brand equity. In
   this paper, we study how these two asymmetric characteristics affect the
   equilibrium channel structures of manufacturers selling competing
   products. Following some recent studies, we adopt a refined consumer
   demand model derived from the representative consumer utility function.
   Based on this model, we examine three possible types of competition
   between the two supply chains: Cournot (quantity) competition, Bertrand
   (price)competition, and Bertrand-Coumot competition. We find that brand
   equity, substitutability, as well as the type of competition all play
   important roles in determining the equilibrium channel structures.
   Specifically, in equilibrium a manufacturer always sells directly when
   its rival competes on quantity. Moreover, when there is sufficient
   asymmetry in either brand equity or substitutability, Manufacturers tend
   to sell directly. Our results demonstrate that the benefits of selling
   indirectly shown in previous studies depend critically on the
   assumptions of equally substitutable products and Bertrand competition.

Abstract = {{An experimental study of thermal characteristics of a novel two-inlet
   air-based open-loop building integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T)
   system using a full-scale solar simulator is presented. Experimental
   prototypes of one-inlet and two-inlet BIPV/T systems were constructed
   for conducting comparative experiments. Variations of BIPV/T systems are
   also investigated including systems employing opaque monocrystalline
   silicon photovoltaic (PV) panels and systems employing semi-transparent
   mono-crystalline PV panels. Experimental results demonstrate that an
   equivalent two-inlet system with frameless PV panels can increase the
   thermal efficiency by 5\% compared to a conventional one-inlet system,
   and that the BIPV/T system with semi-transparent PV panels achieves
   7.6\% higher thermal efficiency due to the absorption of some solar
   radiation at the bottom surface in the BIPV/T system cavity. Also, the
   two-inlet BIPV/T design is easily implemented and does not add
   significant cost. Detailed air temperature measurements reveal that the
   mixing of the warm outlet air from the first section and the cool
   ambient air drawn in from the second inlet contributes to the improved
   performance of the two-inlet system. Based on a thermal network model of
   the BIPV/T system and experimental data, correlations are developed for
   the convective heat transfer coefficients in the two sections. These are
   necessary for further analysis and development of BIPV/T system with
   multiple inlets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   127.0 +/- 2.4 Ma for the eight selected volcanic rocks, where the major
   period of the Mesozoic volcanisms is constrained during the Early
   Cretaceous. The presented volcanic rocks are
   andesite-trachydacite-rhyolite and show calc-alkaline to shoshonitic
   features. They have elevated incompatible trace element concentrations
   and significantly negative Nb-Ta-Ti and positive Pb anomalies, which
   display characteristics of typical subduction-related magmas rather than
   within-plate magmatic signature. Sr-Nd isotopic data indicate that their
   magma sources were mixed with proportions of old crustal components.
   Geochemical features, therefore, indicate that the intermediate and
   felsic shoshonitic magma was plausibly derived from partial melting of
   the subduction-modified lithospheric mantle and thickened lower crust,
   respectively, induced by delamination and/or asthenosphere upwelling in
   extensional setting. Combined with the tectonic evolution of the Great
   Xing'an area, we propose a hypothesis that the large-scale Mesozoic
   volcanisms in NE China were controlled by the transition of regional
   stress from southward to westward, which are induced by the changes of
   tectonic regimes from the previous Mongol-Okhotsk subduction to the
   succeeding paleo-Pacific subduction during Late Mesozoic. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{The tapeworm Taenia solium is an important human zoonotic parasite that
   causes great economic loss and also endangers public health. At present,
   an effective vaccine that will prevent infection and chemotherapy
   without any side effect remains to be developed. In this study, codon
   usage patterns in the T. solium genome were examined through 8,484
   protein-coding genes. Neutrality analysis showed that T. solium had a
   narrow GC distribution, and a significant correlation was observed
   between GC12 and GC3. Examination of an NC (ENC vs GC3s)-plot showed a
   few genes on or close to the expected curve, but the majority of points
   with low-ENC (the effective number of codons) values were detected below
   the expected curve, suggesting that mutational bias plays a major role
   in shaping codon usage. The Parity Rule 2 plot (PR2) analysis showed
   that GC and AT were not used proportionally. We also identified 26
   optimal codons in the T. solium genome, all of which ended with either a
   G or C residue. These optimal codons in the T. solium genome are likely
   consistent with tRNAs that are highly expressed in the cell, suggesting
   that mutational and translational selection forces are probably driving
   factors of codon usage bias in the T. solium genome.}},

Abstract = {{Phospholipase C epsilon (PLC epsilon) is a multifunctional enzyme
   implicated in inflammatory functions. There are limited data, however,
   on how PLC epsilon can alter inflammatory cytokine by affecting
   downstream pathways. Recent studies suggest that inflammation is likely
   to have an important role in transitional cell carcinoma of bladder
   (TCCB) and cancer disease progression. Here, we showed that PLC epsilon
   and p-STAT3 expression were both elevated in TCCB tissues compared to
   adjacent tissues, and the increase of PLC epsilon level was associated
   with the increase of p-STAT3 level. Then, knockdown of PLC epsilon using
   adenovirus-shPLC epsilon significantly decreased inflammatory cytokine
   (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta) expression and inflammation-associated gene
   (TLR4, MyD88, p-STAT3) expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PLC
   epsilon knockdown blocked LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine and p-STAT3
   expression. Additionally, we found that combined treatment of STAT3
   inhibitor S3I-201 with adenovirus-shPLC epsilon exhibited synergistic
   inhibitory effects on expression of p-STAT3. Our results suggested that
   STAT3 phosphorylation is involved in PLC epsilon-mediated inflammatory
   cytokine release. Our research is of potential importance in drug
   development programs using PLC epsilon as a therapeutic target for TCCB.}},

Volume = {{168}},
Pages = {{297-303}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Inorganic scintillators are very important in medical and industrial
   measuring systems in the detection and measurement of ionizing
   radiation. In addition to Ce3+, a widely used dopant ion in oxide
   scintillators, divalent Europium (Eu2+) has shown promise as a
   high-luminescence, fast-response luminescence center useful in the
   detection of ionizing radiation. In this research, aluminum oxide
   (Al2O3) was studied as a host material for the divalent europium ion.
   Polycrystalline samples of Eu2+-doped translucent Al2O3 were fabricated,
   and room temperature luminescence behavior was observed. Al2O3 ceramics
   doped with 0.1 at\% Eu2+ were fabricated with a relative density of
   99.75\% theoretical density and in-line transmittance of 22\% at a
   wavelength of 800 nm. The ceramics were processed by a gel-casting
   method, followed by sintering under high vacuum. The gelling agent, a
   copolymer of isobutylene and maleic anhydride, is marketed under the
   commercial name ISOBAM, and has the advantage of simultaneously acting
   as both a gelling agent and as a dispersant. The microstructure and
   composition of the vacuum-sintered Eu2+ :Al2O3 were characterized by
   Scanning Electric Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy
   (TEM), and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The phase
   composition was determined by X-ray diffraction measurements (XRD)
   combined with Rietveld analysis. The photoluminescence behavior of the
   Eu2+ :Al2O3 was characterized using UV light as the excitation source,
   which emitted blue emission at 440 nm. The radio-luminescence of Eu2+
   :Al2O3 was investigated by illumination with X-ray radiation, showing
   three emission bands at 376 nm, 575 mu and 698 nm. Multiple level traps
   at different depths were detected in the Eu2+ :Al2O3 by employing
   thermoluminescence measurements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{A bridge widening technology using steel-concrete composite system was
   developed and is presented in this paper. The widened superstructure
   system consists of a newly built composite steel-concrete girder with
   concrete deck and steel diaphragms attached to the existing concrete
   girders. This method has been applied in several bridge widening
   projects in China, and one of those projects is presented in detail. Due
   to the higher stiffness-to-weight ratio and the rapid erection of
   composite girders, this widening method reveals benefits in both
   mechanical performance and construction. As only a few methods for the
   design of bridges with different types of girders are recommended in
   current design codes, a more accurate analytical method of estimating
   live load distribution on girder bridges was developed. In the
   analytical model, the effects of span length, girder pacing, diaphragms,
   concrete decks were considered, as well as the torsional and flexural
   stiffness of both composite box girders and concrete T girders. The
   study shows that the AASHTO LRFD specification procedures and the
   analytical models proposed in this paper closely approximate the live
   load distribution factors determined by finite element analysis. A
   parametric study was also conducted using the finite element method to
   evaluate the potential load carrying capacities of the existing concrete
   girders after widening.}},

   equation are calculated in the form of a rapidly convergent series with
   easily computable components. The validity, potentiality, and practical
   usefulness of the proposed method have been demonstrated by applying it

Abstract = {{LiNi0.5Co0.45Fe0.05O2 (LNCFO), a new layered compound, was synthesized
   by the solid-state method for application as a cathode material in
   lithium-ion batteries. The microstructure and morphology of the sample
   were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy,
   and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties of
   the material were assessed by charge discharge tests, cyclic
   voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Our data
   confirmed that LNCFO exhibits a hexagonal alpha-NaFeO2 structure with
   the R (3) over barm space group and consists of layered grains.
   According to the charge discharge tests, the sample prepared at 700
   degrees C showed the best initial discharge capacity of 160.4 mA h g(-1)
   0.2 C and excellent cycling ability. In addition, the samples
   synthesized at 700 degrees C also showed lower electrochemical impedance
   than samples synthesized at other temperatures. Our study indicates that
   the solid-state method is effective for synthesizing LNCFO cathode
   materials for lithium-ion batteries with outstanding performance. (C)

Abstract = {{The decomposition of carbon dioxide was investigated in a non-thermal
   plasma dielectric barrier discharge reactor filled with glass balls. The
   CO2 conversion was maximum by using a sinusoidal excitation compared to
   pulsed excitation. The CO2 conversion and the CO selectivity are
   increased in the presence of helium, particularly with the AC power
   supply, but with a decrease in energy efficiency. The formation of solid
   materials composed of carbon but also of silica was highlighted for the
   first time, proving that carbon was incorporated into the silica network
   along with CO2 dissociation under non-thermal plasma conditions. The
   temperature control of the reactor wall has shown that the CO
   selectivity is favored by a low temperature wall, whereas the CO2
   conversion remained constant, suggesting that the carbon balance default
   is due to the CO decomposition on the reactor wall. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A chain of magnetic atoms on the surface of a superconductor provides a
   versatile platform for realizing a one-dimensional topological
   superconductivity phase with edge-bounded Majorana fermions zero modes.
   This platform lends itself to spatial resolved measurements with
   scanning tunneling microscope (STM) that enables direct visualization of
   the presence of a localized Majorana zero mode. Experiments on
   self-assembled chains of Fe atoms on the surface of Pb show that such a
   system can be experimentally fabricated and studied using various
   high-resolution STM measurement techniques. Spatial and energy resolved
   STM experiments provide strong evidence for Majorana bound states that
   emerge due to the combination of Fe's ferromagnetism and spin-orbit
   coupling of the superconducting Pb substrate. These studies provide a
   roadmap for optimizing topological superconductivity in this
   one-dimensional platform and its extension to realize chiral
   two-dimensional superconductors.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a rapid interferer detector that uses compressed sampling
   (CS) with a quadrature analog-to-information converter (QAIC). By
   exploiting bandpass CS, a blind sub-Nyquist sampling approach, the QAIC
   offers an energy efficient and rapid interferer detection over a wide
   instantaneous bandwidth. The QAIC front end is implemented in 65 nm CMOS
   in 0.43 mm(2) and consumes 81 mW from a 1.1 V supply. It senses a
   frequency span of 1 GHz ranging from 2.7 to 3.7 GHz (PCAST Band) with a
   resolution bandwidth of 20 MHz in 4.4 mu s, 50 times faster than
   traditional sweeping spectrum scanners. Rapid interferer detector with
   the bandpass QAIC is two orders of magnitude more energy efficient than
   traditional Nyquist-rate architectures and one order of magnitude more
   energy efficient than existing low-pass CS methods. Thanks to CS, the
   aggregate sampling rate of the QAIC interferer detector is compressed by
   6.3x compared to traditional Nyquist-rate architectures for the same
   instantaneous bandwidth.}},

Title = {{Long-term outcome of HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients
   treated with first-line trastuzumab}},
Journal = {{BREAST}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Background: Trastuzumab has changed the natural history of metastatic
   HER2 positive breast cancer. Some patients remain well and in remission
   for many years. There is currently no established duration after which
   trastuzumab in the advanced setting can be safely discontinued. This
   study aims to evaluate long-term efficacy and cardiac safety of
   trastuzumab when used as first-line treatment for patients with
   metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer.
   Patient and methods: We retrospectively identified 215 patients with
   HER2 positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who
   commenced first line trastuzumab-containing therapy for metastatic
   disease between 2001 and 2010 at The Royal Marsden Hospital.
   Results: The median progression free survival for all patients was 12
   months (95\% CI: 10.3-14.6 months); 103 (48\%) patients remained in
   remission beyond one year, 59 (27\%) beyond two years and 25 (12\%)
   beyond five years. The median overall survival was 2.6 years (95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 2.2-3.3). The objective response rate (ORR)
   was 65\% with 17 (8\%) complete responses and 120 (57\%) partial
   responses. Trastuzumab was well tolerated. Twenty eight (13\%) patients
   recorded any grade of left ventricular dysfunction. There was no
   significant difference in cardiac toxicity between those patients on
   less than or more than one year of trastuzumab.
   Conclusion: Trastuzumab is associated with long-term remissions in a
   significant proportion of patients with metastatic HER2 positive disease
   when used in the first-line advanced setting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{S1365-S1370}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background. Bis, also known as BAG3, has been identified as a
   Bcl-2-interacting protein that enhances cellular anti-apoptotic
   activity. It is involved in cellular differentiation, angiogenesis,
   migration, and invasion in various tumors. The purpose of this study was
   to investigate the Bis expression pattern, and the clinical significance
   thereof, in patients with resected lung cancer.
   Methods. We studied 121 lung cancer patients who underwent curative
   surgical resection. Patient clinicopathological characteristics were
   reviewed retrospectively from medical records, including tumor
   recurrence and survival. The expression of Bis protein in lung cancer
   tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining and was assessed
   using a four-tiered intensity score system (negative, weak, moderate,
   strong). Enhanced Bis expression at the periphery of a tumor facing the
   adjacent nontumor region was referred as ``Mrginal activity.''
   Results. Although Bis expression was higher in squamous cell carcinoma
   than in adenocarcinoma, marginal activity was higher in adenocarcinoma
   than in squamous cell carcinoma. All of the small cell carcinomas and
   lung cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation examined were negative
   for Bis expression. Compared with stage I lung cancer, patients with
   stage II and IIIA lung cancer exhibited higher Bis protein levels in
   lung tissues. Recurrence and survival rates did not differ significantly
   according to Bis expression intensity score or marginal activity.
   Conclusions. Our study demonstrated that Bis expression differed
   according to the histological type and pathological stage of the lung
   cancer. Further studies are needed to assess its use as a biomarker and
   its role in the molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer.}},

Abstract = {{What is known and objective: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI)
   represents a spectrum of disease and is a significant concern for
   healthcare institutions. Our study objective was to assess whether
   implementation of a regional CDI management policy with Clinical
   Pharmacy and Medical Microbiology and Infection Control involvement
   would lead to an improvement in concordance in prescribing practices to
   an evidence-based CDI disease severity assessment and pharmacological
   treatment algorithm. Methods: Conducted at a tertiary care teaching
   hospital, this two-phase quality assurance study consisted of a baseline
   retrospective healthcare record review of patients with CDI prior to the
   implementation of a regional CDI management policy followed by a
   prospective evaluation post-implementation. Results and discussion: One
   hundred and forty-one CDI episodes in the pre-implementation group were
   compared to 283 episodes post-implementation. Overall treatment
   concordance to the CDI treatment algorithm was achieved in 48 of 141
   cases (34\%) pre-implementation compared with 136 of 283 cases (48.1\%)
   post-implementation (P = 0.01). The median time to treatment with
   vancomycin was reduced from five days to one day (P < 0.01), with median
   length of hospital stay decreasing from 30 days to 21 days (P = 0.01)
   post-implementation. There was no difference in 30-day all-cause
   mortality. What is new and conclusion: A comprehensive approach with
   appropriate stakeholder involvement in the development of clinical
   pathways, education to healthcare workers and prospective audit with
   intervention and feedback can ensure patients diagnosed with CDI are
   optimally managed and prescribed the most appropriate therapy based on
   CDI disease severity.}},

   cross-sectional data, research on model selection for longitudinal data
   remains largely unexplored. This is particularly the case when data are
   subject to missingness and measurement error. To address this important
   problem, we propose marginal methods that simultaneously carry out model
   selection and estimation for longitudinal data with missing responses
   and error-prone covariates. Our methods have several appealing features:
   the applicability is broad because the methods are developed for a
   unified framework with marginal generalized linear models; model
   assumptions are minimal in that no full distribution is required for the
   response process and the distribution of the true covariates is left
   unspecified; and the implementation is straightforward. To justify the
   proposed methods, we provide both theoretical properties and numerical
   assessments. The Canadian Journal of Statistics 43: 498 518; 2015 (C)

Abstract = {{There is great interest in electrochemical water splitting for the
   efficient utilization of sustainable energy. As an alternative to
   high-priced materials, carbon offers considerable potential. However,
   carbon is limited as an electrode material for the oxygen evolution
   reaction (OER), owing to its thermodynamic instability against
   electrochemical oxidation. In this study, we investigated the
   electrochemical degradation of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) under
   the acidic OER environment. Electrochemical oxidation of MWCNTs induces
   structural changes and the formation of oxygen-containing functional
   groups on the carbon surface. As a consequence, the electrochemical and
   physicochemical properties of the MWCNTs are changed during
   electrochemical oxidation. We carried out electrochemical,
   microstructural, and spectroscopic analysis to investigate the
   degradation of MWCNTs. By changing of the electrochemical properties of
   MWCNTs during the oxidation process, the carbon electrode is initially
   activated and can then be kinetically stabilized with prolonged
   oxidation under the OER conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Currently, schizophrenia guidelines recommend waiting for 3
   to 6 weeks before considering a patient as non-responder. However,
   recent studies indicate that the response to antipsychotic medications
   starts within the first two weeks of treatment. The aim of this study is
   to determine the predictive value of early improvement at 2 or 4 weeks
   for non-response at 6 weeks.
   Methods: Twenty seven in- and out-patients with a diagnosis of
   schizophrenia according to DSM-IV, between the ages of 18 to 65 years,
   who were moderately-to-severely ill (baseline Positive and Negative
   Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score >= 75, with at least ``moderate{''}
   level of severity / score>4 on at least 2 of the 4 Brief Psychiatric
   Rating Scale (BPRS) psychotic cluster items) were included. Ten patients
   were receiving antipsychotic treatment for the first time, and 17
   patients' treatment was changed due to nonresponse to prior
   antipsychotic treatment. The patients were evaluated with the PANSS and
   the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scale at 0, 2, 4 and 6
   weeks of antipsychotic treatment. Non-response at endpoint was defined
   in 3 different ways to reflect the variations in the level of response
   to medication: ``not minimally improved{''}, ``not much improved{''} and
   ``not remitted{''}. As previously described, ``not minimally
   improved{''} and ``not much improved{''} were defined as less than 28\%
   and 53\% improvement in the PANSS total scores, respectively. ``Not
   remitted{''} was defined according to the criteria developed by ``The
   Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group{''} without the time criterion.
   Signal detection methods using receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
   curves were implemented to detect the optimal threshold of early
   nonresponse at 2 and 4 weeks. Total accuracy, sensitivity, specificity
   and positive and negative predictive value of cut-off points were
   calculated for predicting ``not minimally improved{''}, ``not much
   improved{''} and ``not remitted{''} at endpoint.
   Results: The early response threshold for predicting ``not minimally
   improved' was less than 15.3\% reduction in PANSS total score at week 2,
   less than 15.5\% reduction at week 4. The early response threshold for
   predicting ``not much improved{''} was less than 22.1\% reduction at
   week 2 and less than 44.3\% reduction at week 4; for ``not remitted{''}
   was less than 71.5\% reduction at week 2 and less than 23.2\% reduction
   at week 4. Specific thresholds of ``much improvement{''} and
   ``remission{''} were not identified at week 2, whereas thresholds
   calculated for week 4 had good discriminative power.
   Conclusion: The findings of this study did not support the findings of
   earlier studies indicating that nonresponse at 2 weeks accurately
   predicts subsequent lack of response in patients with schizophrenia.
   Instead, the findings revealed that non-response could best be predicted
   at 4 weeks as in some other previous studies. The question of which time
   point for early prediction of response could be best predicted in
   schizophrenia patients needs to be further addressed in subsequent
   studies with larger sample size.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene has a wide spectrum on its application field due to various and
   excellent physical properties. However, it is very difficult to apply
   that graphene exists as lump or fold condition in general organic
   solvents. Besides, graphene was difficult to maintain as uniform
   condition due to chemical inert and distributions with various size and
   shapes. Therefore, this study was focused to study dispersion and
   modifying methods of aggregated graphene. The dispersion methods contain
   as follow: i) physical milling using glass bead, ii) co-treatment of
   glass bead and ultrasonic waves, iii) dispersion in organic solvents,
   iv) modifying with dry-ice. Milling using glass bead with size 2.5 mm
   was effective to be size decrease of 36.4\% in comparison with control
   group. Mixed treatment of glass bead (size 2.5 mm) and ultrasonic waves
   (225W, 10 min) showed relative size decrease of 76\%, suggesting that
   the size decrease depends on the size of glass bead, intensity of
   ultrasonic waves and treatment time. Solvents of Ethyl acetate (EA) and
   Isoprophyl alcohol (IPA) were used in order to improve dispersion by
   modifying surface of graphene. IPA of them showed a favorable dispersion
   with more -CO functional groups in the FT-IR analysis. On the other
   hand, the oxygen content of graphene surface modified by dry-ice was
   highly increased from 0.8 to 4.9\%. From the results, it was decided
   that the favorable dispersion state for a long time was obtained under
   the condition of -CO functional group increase in IPA solvent.}},

Abstract = {{A novel visible light-driven photocatalyst, lithium vanadium phosphate
   sphere (LVPS), was prepared by a ball-milling method. For enhancing the
   photocatalytic performance, LVPS was further modified with silver
   (ALVPS) by a UV-light photoreduction method. After modification, the
   crystalline phase of LVPS did not change, however, the UV-Vis diffuse
   reflectance spectrum of ALVPS was extended to 656 nm, which greatly
   improved its photoabsorptivity for visible light and enhanced its
   electron donating capacity. Under the irradiation of sunlight or visible
   light (> 400 nm), ALVPS can rapidly remove fipronil (a persistent
   organic pollutant, 5 mg L-1) from aqueous solution. More than 99.7\% of
   fipronil was removed by ALVPS after 0.5 h of irradiation, yielding a
   much higher removal rate than those achieved by nano-TiO2 and Bi2O3.
   Photo-generated carrier trapping experiments were conducted to elucidate
   the photocatalytic degradation mechanism further. Hydrogen peroxide and
   potassium bromate suppressed the photocatalytic activity of ALVPS, while
   superoxide dismutase and sodium azide reinforced it, verifying that
   photo-generated electrons played a key role in the photochemical
   reaction.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the association of baseline characteristics and
   early visual acuity (VA) response with visual outcomes at years 1 or 2
   in the Comparison of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) Treatments
   Trials (CATT).
   Design: Secondary analysis of CATT.
   Participants: The 1185 CATT participants with baseline VA of 20/25 to
   20/320. Methods: Participants were assigned to ranibizumab or
   bevacizumab and to 1 of 3 dosing regimens. Associations of baseline
   characteristics and early VA response (week 4 or 12) with VA response at
   years 1 or 2 were assessed by R-2 from linear regression analyses.
   Patients who had a poor initial response (VA 20/ 40 or worse with
   persistent fluid and without >= 1-line VA gain) were defined as
   candidates for changing treatment.
   Main Outcome Measures: Visual acuity change from baseline.
   Results: Statistically significant (P < 0.05) baseline predictors for
   less VA gain at year 2 were older age, VA of 20/40 or better, larger
   choroidal neovascularization area, presence of geographic atrophy, total
   foveal thickness <= 325 mu m or >= 425 mu m, and elevation of retinal
   pigment epithelium. Among 176 eyes gaining >= 3 lines at week 12, 78\%
   had a >= 3-line gain at year 2, whereas among 113 eyes losing >= 1-line
   at week 12, 27\% improved to a >= 1-line gain at year 2. Visual acuity
   response at week 12 was more predictive of VA response at year 2 (R-2 =
   0.30) than VA response at week 4 (R-2 = 0.17) and baseline predictors
   (R-2 = 0.13; P < 0.0001). Among 126 candidates for changing treatment
   drug at week 12, mean VA improved by 2.8 letters (P = 0.050), mean total
   retinal thickness decreased 53 mu m (P < 0.0001), and fluid resolved in
   33\% (P < 0.0001) between week 12 and year 1 with continued use of the
   same drug and regimen. Similar improvements were observed among 83
   candidates for changing drugs at week 24.
   Conclusions: Visual acuity response at week 12 is more predictive of
   2-year vision outcomes than either several baseline characteristics or
   week 4 response. Eyes with poor initial response may benefit from
   continued treatment without switching to another drug. Ophthalmology

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Cloud and Virtual Machine (VM) technologies present new challenges with
   respect to performance and monetary cost in executing parallel discrete
   event simulation (PDES) applications. Due to the introduction of overall
   cost as a metric, the traditional use of the highest-end computing
   configuration is no longer the most obvious choice. Moreover, the unique
   runtime dynamics and configuration choices of Cloud and VM platforms
   introduce new design considerations and runtime characteristics specific
   to PDES over Cloud/VMs. Here, an empirical study is presented to help
   understand the dynamics, trends, and trade-offs in executing PDES on
   Cloud/VM platforms. Performance and cost measures obtained from multiple
   PDES applications executed on the Amazon EC2 Cloud and on a high-end VM
   host machine reveal new, counterintuitive VM-PDES dynamics and
   guidelines. One of the critical aspects uncovered is the fundamental
   mismatch in hypervisor scheduler policies designed for general Cloud
   workloads versus the virtual time ordering needed for PDES workloads.
   This insight is supported by experimental data revealing the gross
   deterioration in PDES performance traceable to VM scheduling policy. To
   overcome this fundamental problem, the design and implementation of a
   new deadlock-free scheduler algorithm are presented, optimized
   specifically for PDES applications on VMs. The scalability of our
   scheduler has been tested in up to 128 VMs multiplexed on 32 cores,
   showing significant improvement in the runtime relative to the default
   Cloud/VM scheduler. The observations, algorithmic design, and results
   are timely for emerging Cloud/VM-based installations, highlighting the
   need for PDES-specific support in high-performance discrete event
   simulations on Cloud/VM platforms.}},

Abstract = {{The t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation is the most common chromosomal
   translocation in plasma cell myeloma (PCM), but the cytogenetic and
   immunophenotypic features of PCM with t(11;14)(q13;q32) remain to be
   fully elucidated. To address the issue, we retrospectively analyzed 21
   newly diagnosed PCM patients with the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation in
   our institute. CD20 is a B-cell-specific transmembrane protein that is
   the topic of much focus as a potential target in immunotherapy. We
   observed a low incidence of CD20 expression (2 of 21 patients, 11\%),
   although the expression of CD20 was previously reported to be associated
   with t(11;14)(q13;q32). PAX5 is an essential transcriptional factor
   involved in B-cell development and commitment, and is down-regulated
   upon plasma cell differentiation. We observed one patient (6\%) with
   expression of PAX5. The expression of CD19, CD56, and CD138 was detected
   in one (0.7\%), nine (60\%), and 13 patients (87\%), respectively.
   Cyclin D1, CD38, and BCL2 were detected in all patients; on the other
   hand, neither BCL6 nor SOX11 was detected in any of the evaluated
   patients. Abnormalities of chromosome 13 were detected in six patients
   (38\%), but deletion of TP53 was not observed in any of the evaluated
   patients. Our results suggest the absence of BCL6 and SOX11 expression,
   and infrequent expression of CD20, PAX5, and CD56 in PCM with
   t(11;14)(q13;q32), in contrast to the findings of earlier reports.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Xanthii fructus (Compositae) is a traditional herbal medicine
   used for treating headache, toothache, pruritus, empyema, and rhinitis.
   In this study of the quality control of XI fructos, we performed
   simultaneous analysis of nine marker compounds: Protocatechuic acid (1),
   chlorogenic acid (2), caffeic acid (3), 4, 5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (4),
   ferulic acid (5). 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (6), 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic
   acid (7), 1,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid (8), and 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid
   (9). Materials and Methods: Nine components were separated using
   reversed-phase SunFire (TM) C-18 analytical column and analyzed using
   high-performance liquid chromatography. We examined the biological
   effects of the nine marker compounds by determining their
   anti-inflammatory activities in the murine macrophage cell line RAW
   264.7 Results: Among the nine marker compounds, eight significantly
   inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production. 1, 3, 5 had significant inhibitory
   effects on LPS-induced prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) production in RAW
   264.7 cells. None of the tested marker compounds had a significant
   effect on interleukin-6 production in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells. Our
   data demonstrated that each marker compound from X. fructus exerts
   anti-inflammatory activity by targeting different inflammation-related
   pathways such as the INF-alpha or PGE(2) pathway. Conclusion: Further
   experiments using in vitro and in vivo models are needed to identify the
   mechanisms responsible for the anti-inflammatory properties of each
   marker compound.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the satisfaction of patients with a cochlear
   implant using a Parents Perspective Questionnaire and analyze the
   significant parameters.
   MATERIALS and METHODS: Patients who received a cochlear implant in
   Cukurova University between March 2002 and November 2012 were included
   in the study. Parents were asked to answer the Parents Perspective
   Questionnaire.
   RESULTS: The age ranges of 62 patients were 25 years and of 99 patients
   were 611 years and over. In total, 144 parents were satisfied with the
   cochlear implant. Patients who attended school had more self-confidence,
   and users of an implant aged over 18 months had better social relations
   and self-confidence.
   CONCLUSION: Cochlear implants positive effect on the quality of life is
   a fact, but parents have concerns in the preoperative and postoperative
   periods. Patients and parents should be informed carefully about
   cochlear implants. Also, patients satisfaction is correlated with
   increasing duration of the implant and age.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the influence of surface treatment of

   on the bonding efficacy of universal adhesives. Lithium disilicate and
   leucite glass ceramics were contaminated with saliva, and then cleaned
   using distilled water (SC), or 37\% phosphoric acid (TE), or
   hydrofluoric acid (CE). Specimens without contamination served as
   controls. The surface free energy was determined by measuring the
   contact angles formed when the three test liquids were placed on the
   specimens. Bond strengths of the universal adhesives were also measured.
   Saliva contamination and surface treatment of ceramic surfaces
   significantly influenced the surface free energy. The bond strengths of
   universal adhesives were also affected by surface treatment and the
   choice of adhesive materials. Our data suggest that saliva contamination
   of lithum disilicate and leucite glass ceramics significantly impaired

Abstract = {{Background Although it has been suggested that antigenic drift does not
   occur in a single epidemic season in temperate countries, there is not
   enough evidence on the circulation period of influenza virus with
   identical nucleotide sequences. Therefore, strains of influenza virus
   were isolated sequentially during five consecutive epidemic seasons in
   Japan and their nucleotide sequences were determined.
   Methods Nasal swabs or aspirated nasal discharges were collected from
   influenza A virus antigen-positive individuals living in Tottori
   Prefecture, Japan for five consecutive winters starting in 2009-2010,
   and subjected to viral isolation, determination of hemagglutinin
   nucleotide sequence and phylogenic analyses. The nucleotide sequences
   were compared with each other and also with those of foreign strains in
   the International Nucleotide Sequence Database.
   Results Totally 288 A(H1N1) pdm09 strains were tested and those composed
   38 clusters with identical ones displaying 100\% nucleotide homology.
   One strain showed sequential infections more than three months without
   any detectable mutation, and a maximum interval of two detection timings
   of strains was 94 days. This implies that influenza viruses mutate
   rarely in an epidemic season in Japan if they can be hypothesized,
   mutation frequency of influenza viruses being mostly the same among
   strains. Among these identical strains, two strains were not only
   identical to other Japanese isolates, but also to those isolated in
   Mongolia and Thailand in the same epidemic season.
   Conclusion These results suggest that genetic drift has occurred
   infrequently in Japan as shown in some other countries. The drifted
   strains may have generated some-where else and entered into Japan. These
   results support the proposed `sink-source' model of viral ecology in
   which new lineages are seeded from a persistent influenza reservoir in
   tropical countries to `sink' populations in temperate regions including
   Japan.}},

Abstract = {{At early drug discovery, purified protein-based assays are often used to
   characterise compound potency. In the context of dose response, it is
   often perceived that a time-independent inhibitor is reversible and a
   time-dependent inhibitor is irreversible. The legitimacy of this
   argument is investigated using a simple kinetics model, where it is
   revealed by model-based analytical analysis and numerical studies that
   dose response of an irreversible inhibitor may appear time-independent
   under certain parametric conditions. Hence, the observation of
   time-independence cannot be used as sole evidence for identification of
   inhibitor reversibility. It has also been discussed how the synthesis
   and degradation of a target receptor affect drug inhibition in an in
   vitro cell-based assay setting. These processes may also influence dose
   response of an irreversible inhibitor in such a way that it appears
   time-independent under certain conditions. Furthermore, model-based
   steady-state analysis reveals the complexity nature of the drug-receptor
   process.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) nanosheets were grown on a glass
   substrate by using aqueous solution method. A GZO nanosheet
   metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) ultraviolet (UV) photodetector (PD) was
   also fabricated. The average length and diameter of the GZO nanosheets
   were 2.06 mu m and approximately 20 nm, respectively. The EDX spectrum
   determined that the Ga-doped sample contains approximately 1.35\% at\%.
   The UV-to-visible rejection ratio of the device is approximately 42 when
   biased at 1 V, and the fabricated UV PD is visible-blind with a sharp
   cutoff at 370 nm. The photo-current and dark-current constant ratio of
   the fabricated PD was approximately 14193 when biased at 1 V. The
   transient time constants measured during the rise time and fall time
   were 2.45 s and 4.0 s, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Cluster of Differentiation 90 (CD90, Thy-1) has been proposed as one of
   the most important biomarkers in several cancer cells including cancer
   stem cells (CSCs). CD90 is considered as a potential normal stem cell
   and CSCs biomarker and also has been identified in lung cancer stem
   cells, hepatocellular carcinoma cells and high-grade gliomas.
   Using eukaryotic host systems involves complex procedures and frequently
   results in low protein yields. The expression of recombinant proteins in
   Escherichia coli is comparatively easier than eukaryotic host cells. The
   potential of large scale production of recombinant protein has made this
   system an economic production platform.
   In this study we expressed the extra-membrane domain of human CD90
   (exCD90) antigen (Gln(15)-Cys(130)) in E. coli expression host cells.
   The epitope integrity of purified recombinant antigen was confirmed by
   antibody-antigen interaction using 5E10 anti-CD90 monoclonal antibody
   and binding study through ELISA and florescent staining of CD90(+) cells
   in a flow cytometry experiment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Substantial progress has been made in understanding and reducing
   temperature inhomogeneity in rapid compression machines (RCMs) with the
   help of computational modeling. To date, however, it has not been
   possible to investigate and map the full range of possible RCM designs,
   working gases, and, operating conditions. In this work,, we present a
   framework which simplifies the task of comprehensive and general RCM
   performance prediction. A set of thermophysical and geometrical
   parameters has been defined to characterize the design and operating
   conditions of a general RCM. Dimensional analysis was applied to reduce
   the number of variables, and a sensitivity analysis, based on
   computational simulations, was used to rank the dimensionless parameters
   and eliminate unimportant-ones. The results of this analysis show that
   Reynolds number,, Prandtl number, aspect ratio,: and crevice volume
   ratio are the most important parameters determining temperature
   inhomogeneity. A further set of computational simulations was conducted
   to predict postcompression temperature inhomogeneity over the full range
   of RCM design and operating parameters. These results are
   well-represented by a simple power-law equation that correlates a
   dimensionless temperature inhomogenity parameter (mass-averaged over the
   main chamber) as a function of postcompression time with just three
   parameters-Peclet number (the product of Reynolds and, Prandtl numbers),
   aspect ratio, and crevice volume ratio. This equation-can serve as a
   simple and general tool for RCM designers and users who wish to
   determine optimal configurations that minimize temperature inhomogeneity
   for combustion experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This study attempted to analyze impoliteness in family discourse in
   verbal interactions between irreconcilable couples in Ahvaz, Iran.
   Therefore, a corpus of 300 minutes of the couples' conversations, which
   was provided by Family research center, was recorded, transcribed and
   analyzed. The couples were asked to put their controversial problems
   into discussion. The theoretical framework in this study was
   Impoliteness Model by Culpeper (1996) based on Brown \& Levinson
   Politeness Strategies (1987). This study was a descriptive analytic one
   and data analysis was based on qualitative as well as quantitative
   factors. The results showed women insult themselves twice more compared
   to their husbands and insult their spouses 5 times more, while men's
   insults were directed at their wives' family 2.3 times more compared to
   the other way around. But on the whole, women used impoliteness twice as
   much as men did. It was hypothesized that men used impoliteness more
   than women did. But the findings revealed that out of 175 impoliteness
   examples, 93 cases were utilized by women and 82 ones by men. Finally,
   it is worth mentioning that the findings of this study were contrary to
   expectations in that they depicted that although women, in order to save
   their face, were normally more conservative in verbal communication in
   different contexts in society and thus appeared politer than men, they
   tended to be more impolite in family discourse. It indicated that women
   were less concerned about their face in family conversations in
   comparison with other contexts.}},

Abstract = {{The high-velocity system (HVS) lies just north-west of the center and is
   moving at a speed of 3000 km s(-1) toward NGC 1275, the central giant
   elliptical galaxy in the Perseus cluster. We report imaging spectroscopy
   of the HVS in Ha and {[}N II] that resolves both the nature of this
   galaxy and its physical relationship with NGC 1275. The HVS exhibits a
   distorted disk having a projected rotational velocity that rises
   steadily to similar to 200 km s(-1) at a radius of similar to 12 kpc,
   the same maximal extent detectable in neutral gas and dust. We discover
   highly blueshifted emission at relative velocities of up to similar to
   800 km s(-1) distributed throughout and confined almost entirely within
   the projected area of the disk, tracing gas stripped by ram pressure.
   The distribution of the stripped gas implies that the HVS is moving
   essentially along our sightline closely toward the center of NGC 1275.
   We show that the speed of the HVS is consistent with it having fallen
   from rest at the virial radius of the Perseus cluster and reached
   similar to 100 kpc from the cluster center. Despite having an overall
   metallicity (inferred from {[}N II]/H alpha) significantly lower than
   that of starforming disk galaxies, the HVS exhibits a current star
   formation rate of similar to 3.6 M-circle dot yr(-1) and numerous young
   star clusters projected against giant H II regions. The evidence
   assembled implicates a progenitor giant low-surface-brightness galaxy
   that, because of galaxy harassment and/or the cluster tidal field, has
   developed two prominent spiral arms along which star formation is
   strongly elevated.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, a compact tri-band bandpass filter (BPF) using novel
   stub-loaded resonator is proposed. The resonator consists of one short
   stub and four open stubs which are symmetric about the middle open stub.
   Two coupling gaps were formed by the four bended open stubs, which
   contribute to the performance of second and third passband. The filter
   was designed, fabricated, and measured. Three passbands were designed to
   operate at 1.0, 2.4, and 3.5 GHz, respectively. The measured results of
   the tri-band BPF exhibit a reasonable agreement with simulated results.
   The circuit only occupies 0.106 lambda(g) x 0.064 lambda(g), where
   lambda(g) is the guided wavelength at lower passband center frequency.

Abstract = {{To obtain an efficient approach to metalize silk fabric, a novel method
   was explored and silver-plated silk was prepared. In this study, tris
   (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) was utilized as a reducing agent to
   generate thiol groups on the silk surface. These thiol groups react with
   silver ions to form metal complexes, which were used as catalytic seeds
   and successfully initiated electroless silver plating. A variety of
   methods, including Raman, XRD, TG, SEM and EDS were used to characterize
   the intermediates and final products. The results showed that a uniform
   and smooth metal layer could be obtained when compared with that without
   TCEP pretreatment. The silver-plated silk fabric exhibited good
   electrical conductivity and high anti-bacterial properties. These
   attractive features enable this conductive silk fabric to be a good
   candidate as a biomedical material. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Aquaporins (AQPs) in plants have been shown to facilitate the transport
   of water and other small molecules through biological membranes. This
   activity is essential for plant stress management during drought. Here,
   we describe and characterize a novel aquaporin gene AcNIP5;1 (Atriplex
   canescens nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein 5;1) isolated from an A.
   canescens cDNA library. qRT-PCR results indicated that the transcript
   level in leaf tissue of AcNIP5;1 was upregulated by 20 \% PEG 6000 and
   downregulated by 400 mM NaCl. To further understand the function of
   AcNIP5;1, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants that
   expressed AcNIP5;1 under control of the CaMV35S promoter. The
   overexpression of AcNIP5;1 in these transgenic Arabidopsis plants
   resulted in higher drought tolerance and sensitivity to salinity
   compared to wild-type plants on both MS plate and pot experiments.
   AcNIP5;1 protein tagged with GFP was localized to the cell plasma
   membrane in Nicotiana benthamiana. Our results suggest that AcNIP5;1
   might play a role in drought tolerance in A. canescens.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{133}},

Abstract = {{A detailed three dimensional finite element model was developed to
   predict the through-thickness thermal conductivity of a textile
   composite structure consisting of a woven fabric and matrix in our
   previous work {[}1] in which conductive particles are randomly
   distributed in the matrix in the unit cell already containing the woven
   fabric and the effective thermal conductivity of this three-phase system
   is numerically evaluated. In this paper, results of this three-component
   system are compared with a two-component system in which the thermal
   conductivity of the matrix and particles is homogenized by a finite
   element approximation under the same thermal conditions. A parametric
   study of this comparison is conducted over different volume fractions
   and thermal conductivities of both textile fabric and loaded particles
   and its efficacy is discussed. Typically such composites could be coated
   with a conductive skin on the surface. Thus, the role of the skin and
   fiber conductivities in enhancing heat transfer is compared for this
   structure. The proposed approach of finite element homogenization of
   particle-matrix medium can be used to conduct a preliminary assessment
   of through-thickness thermal conductivity of such three-component
   composite systems with fabrics, particles and matrices with and without
   the presence of a skin layer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{When viewing three-dimensional (3D) images, whether in cinemas or on
   stereoscopic televisions, viewers experience the same problem of image
   brightness loss. This study aims to investigate image brightness loss in
   3D displays, with the primary aim being to quantify the image brightness
   degradation in the 3D mode. A further aim is to determine the image
   brightness relationship to the corresponding two-dimensional (2D) images
   in order to adjust the 3D-image brightness values. In addition, the
   photographic principle is used in this study to measure metering values
   by capturing 2D and 3D images on television screens. By analyzing these
   images with statistical product and service solutions (SPSS) software,
   the image brightness values can be estimated using the statistical
   regression model, which can also indicate the impact of various
   environmental factors or hardware on the image brightness. In analysis
   of the experimental results, comparison of the image brightness between
   2D and 3D images indicates 60.8\% degradation in the 3D image brightness
   amplitude. The experimental values, from 52.4\% to 69.2\%, are within
   the 95\% confidence interval.}},

Abstract = {{Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 is a type of pathogen that can
   cause tumors in some dicotyledonous plants. Ever since the genome of A.
   tumefaciens strain C58 was sequenced, the quality of annotation of its

   annotation varies greatly among different databases. In this paper, the
   questionable hypothetical genes were re-predicted by integrating the TN
   curve and Z curve methods. As a result, 30 genes originally annotated as
   ``hypothetical{''} were discriminated as being non-coding sequences. By
   testing the re-prediction program 10 times on data sets composed of the
   function-known genes, the mean accuracy of 99.99\% and mean Matthews
   correlation coefficient value of 0.9999 were obtained. Further sequence
   analysis and COG analysis showed that the re-annotation results were
   very reliable. This work can provide an efficient tool and data

   method. The authors propose to incorporate flow-feature-based localized
   Laplacian artificial viscosity in the DG framework to suppress the
   spurious oscillation in the vicinity of sharp thermal fronts but not to
   contaminate the smooth flow features elsewhere. The parameters in the
   localized Laplacian artificial viscosity are modeled based on both
   physical criteria and numerical features of the DG discretization. The
   resulting numerical formulation is first validated on several
   shock-involved test cases, including a shock discontinuity problem with
   the one-dimensional Burger's equation, shock-entropy wave interaction,
   and shock-vortex interaction. Then the efficacy of the developed
   numerical formulation on stabilizing thermal fronts in nonhydrostatic
   mesoscale atmospheric modeling is demonstrated by two benchmark test
   cases: the rising thermal bubble problem and the density current
   problem. The results indicate that the proposed flow-feature-based
   localized Laplacian artificial viscosity method can sharply detect the
   nonsmooth flow features, and stabilize the DG discretization nearby.
   Furthermore, the numerical stabilization method works robustly for a
   wide range of grid sizes and polynomial orders without parameter tuning
   in the localized Laplacian artificial viscosity.}},

Abstract = {{Time-domain reflectometry was used to make continuous measurements of
   soil moisture to 18 sample points with depth of 2 m for 36 months in a
   typical artificial secondary oak forest located in a hilly area on Zijin

   examine the patterns of soil moisture variations on temporal and spatial
   scales and predict the relationships between soil moisture and major
   factors of both meteorology and topography. Water in the topsoil was
   active, and the upper 30 cm of soil supplied about 43\% of the water
   content variation during the whole year. This difference of water
   content changes among layers could be due to the distribution conditions
   of some soil physical properties. When initial soil moisture was in the
   range from 10\% to 40\%, the impact of a single storm event on soil
   moisture was extremely significant, especially on sunny slope. Both
   climate and slope condition were related to soil moisture change, and
   the impact of slope gradient on soil moisture was higher that on shady
   slope. Moreover, root uptake was another important path of soil water
   consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Mammals detect and discriminate numerous odors via a large family of G
   protein-coupled odorant receptors (ORs). However, little is known about
   the molecular and structural basis underlying OR response properties.
   Using site-directed mutagenesis and computational modeling, we studied
   ORs sharing high sequence homology but with different response
   properties. When tested in heterologous cells by diverse odorants,
   MOR256-3 responded broadly to many odorants, whereas MOR256-8 responded
   weakly to a few odorants. Out of 36 mutant MOR256-3 ORs, the majority
   altered the responses to different odorants in a similar manner and the
   overall response of an OR was positively correlated with its basal
   activity, an indication of ligand-independent receptor activation.
   Strikingly, a single mutation in MOR256-8 was sufficient to confer both
   high basal activity and broad responsiveness to this receptor. These
   results suggest that broad responsiveness of an OR is at least partially
   attributed to its activation likelihood.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors affecting the
   comparability of F-18-FDG PET/CT scans using the PERSIST criteria for
   treatment response evaluation in a clinical PET/CT unit.
   Patients and Methods Patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer were
   assessed for treatment response by comparing 2 F-18-FDG PET/CT scans, at
   baseline (PET 1) and 1 month after the end of induction chemoradiation
   (PET 2). According to the PERCIST recommendations, patients with mean
   SUV normalized by the lean body mass within reference volume of interest
   that changed less than 0.3 unit and less than 20\% were deemed as
   comparable. Absolute differences of body weight, blood glucose level,
   activity of F-18-FDG, and uptake time between the 2 scans were computed.
   Binary logistic regression was used to identify the predictive factors,
   and receiver operating characteristic curves were used for thresholds. P
   < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
   Results Sixty-nine subjects were identified. The mean (SD) values at PET
   0 and PET 2 were 5.9 (1.04) mmol/L and 6.2 (1.06) mmol/L (P = 0.013),
   54.6 (10.0 kg) and 53.3 (10.3 kg) (P = 0.013), 7.7 (1.3 mCi) and 7.6
   (1.5 mCi) (P = 0.349), as well as 74.2 (12.4) minutes and 73.0 (12.3)
   minutes (P = 0.539), for blood glucose level, body weight, injected
   activity, and uptake time, respectively. Seventeen (24.6\%) failed to
   match the PERCIST-defined comparability criteria. Case-based
   discrepancies (mean {[}SD]) were 0.76 (0.62) mmol/L, 3.4 (2.9) kg, 0.8
   (0.7) mCi, and 11.7 (9.8) minutes for blood glucose, body weight,
   injected activity, and uptake time, respectively, of which only uptake
   time significantly affected comparability (P = 0.046; odds ratio, 1.06;
   95\% confidence interval, 1.00-1.12), with a limit of 2.2-minute
   discrepancy identified as the requirement for 100\% comparability.
   Conclusions Uptake time had the strongest effect on PERCIST-defined
   comparability. Therefore, for response assessment scans, reference to
   initial scans for determination of optimal uptake time is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{HVOF-sprayed CoNiCrAlYSi coatings were tested at 900 degrees C in a hot
   corrosion environment containing sodium potassium sulphates. The HVOF
   spraying caused the typical splat-on-splat structure. The results after
   the hot corrosion testing showed that the corrosion preferentially
   occurred at the coating surface and the splat boundaries. The oxidation
   along the splat boundaries can isolate the splat from the underlying
   coating matrix. In those isolated splats or coating parts, internal
   oxidation and nitridation of Al took place, following that the
   Al-depleted coating fragments were then oxidized to spinels. For those
   coatings which had a worse splat boundary quality (i.e. with higher
   porosity and intersplat oxides) or had a worse coating surface quality
   (i.e. with more small coating fragments therefore more interfaces),
   heavier corrosion attack was observed on those coatings due to the
   corrosion of the splats or the coating fragments. The results indicated
   that the as-sprayed coating quality including porosity and surface
   morphology was important for the hot-corrosion resistance of the
   coatings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate thermal rectification in hybrid pristine
   and silicon-functionalized graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) using
   nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The heat flux is larger
   from the functionalized section to the pristine section than that in the
   opposite direction. It is found that thermal rectification can be tuned
   through the Si/C ratio and silicon distribution. A moderate Si/C ratio
   and patterned arrangement are preferable to obtain a higher
   rectification factor. The rectification factor is also sensitive to the
   temperature difference and the mean temperature. As the length of the
   system increases, the rectification factor decreases gradually due to
   the emerging of diffusive effect in nanoscale GNRs. Furthermore, we
   calculate the vibrational density of states to explain the underlying

Title = {{Petrology and tectonic implications of garnet granulite from Dong Tso,

Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Separating the Qiangtang terrane in the north and the Lhasa block in the
   south, the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone is an important tectonic boundary
   within Central Tibet. However, subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang oceanic
   crust remains obscure. Here we report several garnet granulites in the
   vicinity of Dong Tso area, western Bangong-Nujiang suture zone,
   contributing to understand the tectonic evolution of Bangong-Nujiang
   suture zone. The garnet granulites as lenses in size of 5. 0 similar to
   10mm are distinguished in amphibolites, which occur as tectonic slices
   in the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone and structurally contacting with
   ultramafic and mafic rocks. The garnet grains within garnet granulites
   present as porphyroblasts with irregularly compositional zonation. The
   composition of garnet core is more homogeneous and characterized by
   higher Ca and Mg but lower Fe and Mn than the garnet rim. Moreover the
   rims and cracks of garnet show paragenetic relationship with fine veins
   composed of chlorite and clinozoisite indicating that the garnet grains
   suffered metasomatism by later fluids. Fine-grained early garnets and
   amphiboles were found as inclusions in diopside. These garnets are
   smaller than 10 pan and characterized by higher Fe and Mn but lower Ca
   and Mg than the garnet core. All the amphiboles are calcic amphiboles.
   The early amphiboles are different from the late amphiboles by their
   enrichment in Na, Fe3+, as well as trace amount of Ba. The early
   amphiboles normally as inclusions in garnet and diopside porphyroblasts
   have been transformed into diopsides (rich in Ca but poor in Fe3+ and
   Na) and melt pockets dominanted by albite. Inclusions/exsolutions
   composed of plagioclases and Ba-rich hyalophanes are widely distributed
   in the melt pockets. The late amphiboles occur as fine-grained
   symplectite with plagioclases surrounding the rim of garnet or present
   as porphyroblast in matrix, suggesting that they are retrograde products
   of garnet granulites. In addition, sphenes (rich in Al) are found in the
   matrix and rutile grains have been replaced by fine and irregular sphene
   (poor in Al) and ilmenite. Therefore the mineral assemblage of prograde
   stage is consisting of early garnet (Grt,), early amphibole (Amp,),
   Al-rich sphene (Spn,) and so on. The peak metamorphic stage is
   documented by garnet core (Grt(2)) + diopside + plagioclase (Pl(1),) +
   quartz + rutile + Na-rich and Ba-rich melts, which formed at 870 degrees
   C, 11. 7kbar on the basis of traditional geothermobarometer. Garnet
   rim/crack (Grt) + late amphibole (Amp(2)) + clinozoisite + chlorite +
   plagioclase (Pl(2)) + white mica + Al-poor sphene (Spn(2)) + ilmenite
   are regarded as the retrograde stage assemblage. In combination with
   petrographic and geochemical investigations and estimation of
   metamorphic P-T condition indicates that Dong Tso garnet granulites are
   products of warm subduction of oceanic crust, providing petrological
   evidence for the view that `the Bangong-Nujiang oceanic basin contains
   many sub-oceanic basin `. The significant decrease of Fe3+ (a. p. f. u)
   in amphibole and marked increase of almandine from peak to retrograde
   stage reveals that the Dong Tso garnet granulites suffered reduction
   reaction and the amphiboles were redoxed during dehydration, generating
   adakite magma with high oxygen fugacity which promotes the activation
   from subducted warm oceanic crust and migration to arc magma of
   ore-forming elements, such as Cu and Au.
   Therefore, our work provides a case study of the chemical interactions
   and material migration between subducted warm oceanic slab and overlying
   subarc mantle wedge, and also contributes to intensively understanding
   the formation of numerous porphyry-type copper and gold deposits within
   the Bangong-Nujiang metallogenic belt.}},

   modeling using unstructured grids}},

Abstract = {{As a newly developed geophysical exploration method, the
   radio-magnetotelluric (RMT) method is widely used in near-surface
   engineering and environment geophysical investigation. Since the
   interpretation of RMT data usually adopts the magnetotelluric (MT)
   forward modeling routine, in which displacement currents are generally
   neglected, the inverted conductivity model may not correctly reflect the
   true conductivity structure in the shallow subsurface. To solve this
   issue, we developed a finite-element forward modeling code for RMT data,
   in which displacement currents are considered. With this code, we
   analyze the dielectric effect of displacement currents on RMT responses
   over resistive subsurface models.
   First, we derived the boundary value problem (BVP) about the EM field
   components by the Galerkin method, in which the displacement currents
   were considered. Then we used the finite element method and PARDISO
   solver to calculate the electric and magnetic field components. To deal
   with complicated structure and surface topography, unstructured triangle
   grids were adopted for mesh generation. To improve the computation
   accuracy, the local refinement was used. At last, we developed a forward
   modeling code for RMT data with the consideration of displacement
   currents and analyzed the effect of displacement currents on 2D TM-mode,
   TE-mode data, which measured with the RMT method at frequencies between
   10 and 300 kHz. First, a synthetic model was used to verify the
   correction of our new code. The result shows that the response
   calculated by our code agrees well with other results. Utilizing the
   Dike model, the effect of the thickness of the air layer on accuracy of
   numerical solutions was investigated. The result shows that when the
   thickness of the air layer is greater than 1/4 wavelength, highly
   accurate solutions can be guaranteed. Then the impact of displacement
   currents on RMT data with.ridge terrain was studied on a hill model with
   complicated topography. From this model, the following results can be
   demonstrated: (1) The effect of displacement currents would increase
   with increasing height of the hill and the corner of hill was more
   easier to be affected. (2) The phase curves are more likely to be
   affected than apparent resistivity curves at high frequency. (3) The
   effect of displacement currents on apparent resistivity cannot be
   neglected when the frequency is larger than 100 kHz and the effect on
   phase must be considered when the frequency is larger than 20 kHz.
   Finally, a field model was studied to further demonstrate the importance
   of displacement currents in the RMT method. The results show that: (1)
   The error caused by displacement currents increases with frequency. (2)
   The apparent resistivity of TM-mode is more easily to be affected by
   displacement currents than TE-mode apparent resistivity. (3) For the
   area of quartz diorite with high resistivity, the percentage of
   displacement current density in all current density can be 10\%. It is
   clear that displacement currents must be considered in RMT forward
   modeling.
   With numerical calculations, we demonstrated the effect of displacement
   currents on 2D RMT data. Forward modeling confirms that responses
   computed in the quasi-static approximation become increasingly
   inaccurate with rising frequency and strongly affected by terrain.
   However, RMT data processing and interpretation are mostly based on the
   MT program in recent years, which may result in incorrect structure.
   Based on the work in this paper, the author will develop RMT inversion
   code with consideration of displacement current.}},

   oil insulation system as the research object, using Electron Backscatter
   Diffraction (EBSD) study the grain boundaries of copper conductor in
   insulating oil containing dibenzyl disulfide (DBDS), and the features
   corrosion pits. For paper insulation, the breakdown voltage and the
   microstructure of paper were presented. The paper insulation produced
   plenty of substances, such as metallic particles and fiber, water,
   dissolved gas, furfuraldehyde, dissolving in oil during the thermal
   aging. To gain further insight into the involvement of dielectric
   properties of insulation oils, ion mobility was tested through the
   approach by reversal polarity.}},

Abstract = {{Aortic valve calcification (AVC), which used to be recognized as a
   passive and irreversible process, is now widely accepted as an active
   and regulated process characterized by osteoblastic differentiation of
   aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs). Apelin, the endogenous ligand
   for G-protein-coupled receptor APJ, was found to have protective
   cardiovascular effects in several studies. However, the effects and
   mechanisms of apelin on osteoblastic differentiation of AVICs have not
   been elucidated. Using a pro-calcific medium, we devised a method to
   produce calcific human AVICs. These cells were used to study the
   relationship between apelin and the osteoblastic calcification of AVICs
   and the involved signaling pathways. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
   activity/expression and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2)
   expression were examined as hallmark proteins in this research. The
   involved signaling pathways were studied using the extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor, PD98059, and the
   phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor, LY294002. The results
   indicate that apelin attenuates the expression and activity of ALP, the
   expression of Runx2, and the formation of mineralized nodules. This
   protective effect was dependent on the dose of apelin, reaching the
   maximum at 100 pM, and was connected to activity of ERK and Akt (a
   downstream effector of PI3-K). The activation of ERK and PI3-K initiated
   the effects of apelin on ALP activity/expression and Runx2, but PD98059
   and LY294002 abolished the effect. These results demonstrate that apelin
   attenuates the osteoblastic differentiation of AVICs via the ERK and
   PI3-K/Akt pathway.}},

Abstract = {{The buckling phenomenon for imperfect pipe under bending has been
   investigated by nonlinear FEA, considering the effect of a cross
   sectional oval deformation by changing the variables of pipes, that is,
   L/D varying from 2.5 to 20, D/t varying from 50 to 200, and imperfection
   (delta (o)/t) varying from 0.05 to 0.5. As well as the elastic buckling,
   the elasto-plastic buckling was investigated. From the calculation
   results, the followings were found. The reduction of buckling moment due
   to imperfection is larger in short pipe than in long pipe. The effect of
   imperfection for pipes with large values of D/t is larger than those
   with small values of D/t if L/D of both pipes is same. The effects of
   imperfection for elastic analysis are larger than elasto-plastic
   analysis. The buckling moment reduces more by the imperfection of
   buckling mode than by that of oval mode.}},

Abstract = {{P-selectin-mediated tumor cell adhesion to platelets is a
   well-established stage in the process of tumor metastasis. Through
   computerized structural analysis, we found a marine-derived
   polysaccharide, holothurian glycosaminoglycan (hGAG), behaved as a
   ligand-competitive inhibitor of P-selectin, indicating its potential to
   disrupt the binding of P-selectin to cell surface receptor and
   activation of downstream regulators of tumor cell migration. Our
   experimental data demonstrated that hGAG significantly inhibited
   P-selectin-mediated adhesion of tumor cells to platelets and tumor cell
   migration in vitro and reduced subsequent pulmonary metastasis in vivo.
   Furthermore, abrogation of the P-selectin-mediated adhesion of tumor
   cells led to down-regulation of protein levels of integrins, FAK and
   MMP-2/9 in B16F10 cells, which is a crucial molecular mechanism of hGAG
   to inhibit tumor metastasis. In conclusion, hGAG has emerged as a novel
   anti-cancer agent via blocking P-selectin-mediated malignant events of
   tumor metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, nanosized graphene/Nafion (G-Nf) hybrids were prepared by
   a facile two-steps process consisting of ultrasonication followed by
   hydrothermal treatment and used for the detection of dopamine (DA) in
   the presence of ascorbic acid (AA), and uric acid (UA). A HRTEM study
   revealed that the nanosized graphene had a size of similar to 18 nm
   after 16 h of hydrothermal treatment. Further, the nanosized graphene
   were well dispersed in the Nafion (Nf) matrix under the hydrothermal
   process at 180 degrees C. The influence of the hydrothermal treatment
   time on the formation of the G-Nf hybrids was studied. This showed that
   the G-Nf hybrid formed after 16 h of hydrothermal treatment had a more
   uniform distribution than the G-Nf composites obtained after 8 h and 24
   h of hydrothermal treatment, which tended to agglomerate. These
   optimized hydrothermal conditions led to the excellent electrochemical
   detection of DA, with a lower detection limit of about 102 nM (S/N = 3).
   The results of this study demonstrated that this sample also exhibited
   an extraordinarily high sensitivity and selectivity to DA despite the
   interference of AA and UA. The proposed modified electrode also shows a
   great potential as a sensor for DA detection in real sample analysis
   using urine sample.}},

Abstract = {{Wastewater, despite being a serious environmental constraint, has been

   ammonia, metal ions and volatile fatty acids. Using low-cost physical
   pre-treatments, filtration technology gives the opportunity of
   recovering materials in purified concentrated liquid form and purified
   water. Filtration also allows manipulation of the nutrient content in
   the effluents enabling the formulation of a series of streams enriched
   with important chemical components, enabling their reformulation into
   balanced nutrient media for microbial growth and the production of
   biofuels, acids and other chemicals such as lipids and enzymes. This
   approach benefits industry through the use of a relatively abundant
   inexpensive feedstock able to be recycled to produce high value
   chemicals while reducing the carbon footprint of the fermentation and
   reducing waste disposal. Examples of potential schemes of nutrient
   formulation and their application are presented.}},

   of available literature yielded insufficient evidence in managing such.
   When a patient with thyroid cancer is diagnosed, checking for serum

Abstract = {{The influence of nitrogen co-deposition in ITER relevant mixed layers on
   retention and release dynamics of deuteriumwas studied in situ by
   Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA) and thermodesorption spectroscopy. W: Al
   and W: Be mixed layers deposited by thermionic vacuum arc (TVA) method
   were used in order to verify the possibility of Al being used as proxy
   material for Be in experiments regarding D uptake. Samples were exposed
   to neutral deuterium atom beam with fluence of 3.24 x 10(19) D/cm(2)
   (flux 4.5 x 10(14) D/cm(2)s) at 390 K and NRA with He-3 ions was used
   for depth profile analysis of deuterium content after the exposure. For
   the investigation of deuterium release dynamics the samples were
   linearly heated to around 1000 K and during this process NRA spectra at
   single energy were collected every minute. Complementary to NRA a
   quadrupole mass spectrometer was used, following masses 2, 3 and 4 in
   the background vacuum. The numeric simulation of deuterium thermal
   desorptionwas performed and desorption energies of desorption sites were
   calculated. Same experiments were performed with mixed material samples
   produced by TVA in the presence of nitrogen atmosphere. Nitrogen
   co-deposition in the mixed layers was found to have an important
   influence on deuterium retention. The concentration of deuterium in the
   sample increased by a factor of 4.8 in the presence of nitrogen in the
   W: Al and by a factor of 1.8 in the W:Be layer compared to the
   nitrogen-free sample. (C) 2015 EURATOM. Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The over-erase algorithm (OEA) is the state-of-theart procedure
   exploited in NOR Flash architectures to increase the memory reliability
   against the over-erase phenomenon mainly caused by either fast or

   operation involved in the algorithm uses the same physical mechanism of
   the erase operation, its execution potentially triggers additional
   failures. In this paper, a detailed characterization of the
   soft-programming failures is provided by categorizing their statistical
   occurrence in order to capture their relationship with the failures
   exposed after the execution of the algorithm. A model of the failure
   rate is then derived to provide a rough guideline for OEA optimization
   in terms of performance and reliability.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Statins are widely prescribed drugs to manage
   hypercholesterolemia. Despite they are considered effective
   lipid-lowering agents, significant inter-individual variability has been
   reported in relation to drug response. Among the reasons explaining this
   variation, genetic factors are known to partially contribute.
   Nonetheless, poor evidence exists regarding epigenetic factors involved.
   Methods We investigated if atorvastatin can modulate the cholesterol
   related miR-33 family. Furthermore, we analyzed the microRNA expression
   profiles in HepG2 cells treated for 24 hours with atorvastatin or
   simvastatin using a microarray platform.
   Results Our results indicate that atorvastatin does not influence the
   expression of the miR-33 family. In addition, microarray examination
   revealed that atorvastatin modulated thirteen miRs, whilst simvastatin
   only affected two miRs. All significantly modulated miRs after
   simvastastin therapy were also modulated by atorvastatin. In addition,
   four novel miRs with previously unreported functions were identified as
   statin-modulated.
   Conclusion We identified several novel miRs affected by statin
   treatment. Additional research is needed to determine the biological
   significance of differentially expressed miRs identified in
   statins-induced HepG2 cells.}},

Abstract = {{Most species of the Neotropical genus Holopothrips are associated with
   plant galls but very little is known about their biology. Here, we
   provide observations on the biology of a new species of Holopothrips
   associated with leaf-vein galls on four species of Piper at a cloud
   forest site (Zurqui de Moravia) in Costa Rica. This species colonized
   the galls soon after the gall-inducing cecidomyiid or one of its
   parasitoids emerged, and several generations of thrips appeared to
   occupy the empty galls. A total of 175 empty galls from 34 leaves were
   collected, brought to the laboratory for dissection under the
   microscope, and the contents quantified. Holopothrips occupied
   approximately 75 \% of the galled leaves and among the latter they
   occupied about 40 \% of the galls. Every combination of adults, nymphs
   and eggs was found, which implies that adult thrips move in and out of
   galls, and possibly do not defend their galls from invasion by other
   members of their species. However, when disturbed, both nymphs and
   adults raise the tip of their abdomen and emit a distinctive odor,
   suggesting a defensive reaction against potential predators. Preliminary
   evidence suggests that they feed on gall tissue lining the inner cavity
   and spend very little time outside the galls. The thrips is described as
   a new species, and is one of only four known species of Holopothrips to
   have the unusual condition of two pairs of epimeral setae on the
   pronotum. This new species was compared to these other three Holothrips
   species, and the remarkable variation of the female spermatheca and the
   male sternal pore plate is illustrated. Further research is needed to
   confirm that several generations of thrips occupy empty galls, to
   determine whether adult thrips do indeed move between galls, and to
   explore in greater detail their possible chemical defense.}},

Abstract = {{The retrobelts of doubly vergent collisional orogens are classically
   interpreted as late-stage postcollisional features. Here, we integrate
   literature data with new structural and thermochronological evidence
   from the European Alps in order to document the precollisional
   development of the retrobelt segment exposed in the central southern
   Alps. During the Late Cretaceous, by inversion of inherited extensional
   faults of Permian age, the Variscan basement of the central southern
   Alps was stacked southward onto the Permian-Mesozoic cover sequences of
   the Adria margin. These thrust systems were first deformed within
   regional-scale antiforms (the ``Orobic anticlines{''}) and then cut by
   Eocene magmatic bodies. Our apatite fission-track data show that these
   units were largely structured and exhumed to shallow crustal levels
   before the intrusion of the Eocene magmatic rocks. Therefore, thrusting
   and folding in the Alpine retrobelt took place before the final closure
   of the Alpine Tethys and subsequent continental collision between Adria
   and Europe. Final exhumation and uplift in the northern part of the
   Southalpine retrobelt took place under a dextral transpressional regime
   largely coeval with the right-lateral strike-slip activity along the
   Insubric fault. In Neogene times, deformation propagated southward,
   leading to the formation of a frontal thrust belt that is largely buried
   beneath the Po Plain.}},

Abstract = {{Background Charnley low-friction torque total hip arthroplasty (THA)
   remains the gold standard in THA. The main cause for failure is wear of
   the socket. Highly crosslinked polyethylene (HXLPE) has been associated
   with reduced wear rates. Also, oxidized zirconium has shown in vitro
   reduced wear rates. However, to our knowledge, there are no data
   comparing oxidized zirconium femoral heads with metal heads against
   HXLPE or ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) when 22.25-mm
   bearings were used, which was the same size that performed so well in
   Charnley-type THAs.
   Questions/purposes We hypothesized that after a minimal 4-year followup
   (1) use of HXLPE would result in lower radiographic wear than UHMWPE
   when articulating with a stainless steel head or with an oxidized
   zirconium head; (2) use of oxidized zirconium would result in lower
   radiographic wear than stainless steel when articulating with UHMWPE and
   HXLPE; and (3) there would be no difference in terms of Merle d'Aubign,
   scores between the bearing couple combinations.
   Methods One hundred patients were randomized to receive cemented THA
   with either oxidized zirconium or a stainless steel femoral head. UHMWPE
   was used in the first 50 patients, whereas HXLPE was used in the next 50
   patients. There were 25 patients in each of the four bearing couple
   combinations. All other parameters were identical in both groups.
   Complete followup was available in 86 of these patients. Femoral head
   penetration was measured using a validated computer-assisted method
   dedicated to all-polyethylene sockets. Clinical results were compared
   between the groups using the Merle d'Aubign, score.
   Results In the UHMWPE series, the median steady-state penetration rate
   from 1 year onward was 0.03 mm/year (range, 0.003-0.25 mm/year) in the
   oxidized zirconium group versus 0.11 mm/year (range, 0.03-0.29 mm/year)
   in the metal group (difference of medians 0.08, p < 0.001). In the HXLPE
   series, the median steady-state penetration rate from 1 year onward was
   0.02 mm/year (range, -0.32 to 0.07 mm/year) in the oxidized zirconium
   group versus 0.05 mm/year (range, -0.39 to 0.11 mm/year) in the metal
   group (difference of medians 0.03, p < 0.001). The Merle d'Aubign,
   scores were no different between the groups with a median of 18 in each
   of the groups (range, 16-18).
   Conclusions This study demonstrated femoral head penetration was reduced
   by oxidized zirconium when compared with metal on both UHMWPE and HXLPE.
   However, apart the metal-UHMWE group, all other groups had a
   steady-state penetration rate well below the osteolysis threshold with a
   low difference between groups that might not be clinically important at
   this point. Longer-term followup is needed to warrant whether wear
   reduction will generate less occurrence of osteolysis and aseptic
   loosening.}},

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is a severe and chronic disorder requiring long-lasting
   and comprehensive treatment. Because of this disorder patients are
   socially isolated. Consequently, schizophrenia has a significant
   economic burden both in a group of direct and indirect costs. The aim
   was to analyse experts' opinions in the field of psychiatry concerning
   work possibilities among people with schizophrenia and to present the
   importance of employment for more effective treatment. A worldwide study
   was conducted between June 2011 and June 2013 using a questionnaire
   consisting of six open-closed questions and a short metrics. The
   questionnaire was delivered to experts and spread all over the world by
   post and via the internet. Over 3000 questionnaires were sent and the
   addressed specialists were requested to return them. From received 403
   questionnaires 320 were included into the study, based on adopted
   inclusion and exclusion criteria. Although patients are afraid of
   looking for a job, respondents indicated that they crave for employment.
   The number of people that are able to work during remission of
   schizophrenia is considerably higher (50.35 \%) than the number of
   actually employed (15.85 \%). Non-pharmacological therapies were
   indicated as important to improve patients' chances of finding a job
   during remission of schizophrenia. The number of people that can work
   during remission of schizophrenia is considerably higher than the number
   of affected people employed. Patients crave for a job and supported
   employment should be treated as priority by health-care decision makers.}},

   purpose, a method to extract the MOSFET's drain-to-source conductance,
   the subthreshold swing, the source/drain resistance, the effective gate
   length, and the threshold voltage is proposed. The method is based on
   the determination of the inverse of the channel resistance that is
   directly related to the previously mentioned parameters. Hence, two-port
   S-parameter measurements of common-source configured RF-MOSFETs with
   different gate lengths are performed, varying the gate-to-source voltage
   from the subthreshold region to strong inversion. In order to verify the
   validity and consistency of the method, excellent correlation of DC and

   assay. The most active compound was then tested in vitro for intrinsic
   activity toward alpha(1A)- and alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors and in vitro for
   antiarrhythmic activity in epinephrine-induced arrhythmia in rats. The
   highest affinity for the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (pK(i) = 7.01) was
   displayed by
   1-\{4-{[}4-(2-methoxy-5-chlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-methyl\}-pyrrolidi

   alpha(1B)-(EC50 = 51.0 nM) adrenoceptors. Compound 9 displayed
   antiarrhythmic activity in rats (ED50 = 5.0 mg/kg (3.13-7.99)). New
   derivatives of pyrrolidin-2-one with alpha(1)-adrenoceptor affinity were
   identified. We propose that the antiarrhythmic activity of compound 9 is
   related to its antagonism of alpha(1A)- and alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors.}},

Title = {{APPLICATION OF TECHNICAL MEASURES AND SOFTWARE IN CONSTRUCTING
   PHOTOREALISTIC 3D MODELS OF HISTORICAL BUILDING USING GROUND-BASED AND

Abstract = {{Preparing digital documentation of historical buildings is a form of
   protecting cultural heritage. Recently there have been several intensive
   studies using non-metric digital images to construct realistic 3D models
   of historical buildings. Increasingly often, non-metric digital images
   are obtained with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Technologies and
   methods of UAV flights are quite different from traditional
   photogrammetric approaches. The lack of technical guidelines for using
   drones inhibits the process of implementing new methods of data
   acquisition. This paper presents the results of experiments in the use
   of digital images in the construction of photo-realistic 3D model of a
   historical building (Raphaelsohns' Sawmill in Olsztyn). The aim of the
   study at the first stage was to determine the meteorological and
   technical conditions for the acquisition of aerial and ground-based
   photographs. At the next stage, the technology of 3D modelling was
   developed using only ground-based or only aerial non-metric digital
   images. At the last stage of the study, an experiment was conducted to
   assess the possibility of 3D modelling with the comprehensive use of
   aerial (UAV) and ground-based digital photographs in terms of their
   labour intensity and precision of development. Data integration and
   automatic photo-realistic 3D construction of the models was done with
   Pix4Dmapper and Agisoft Photo Scan software Analyses have shown that
   when certain parameters established in an experiment are kept, the
   process of developing the stock-taking documentation for a historical
   building moves from the standards of analogue to digital technology with
   considerably reduced cost.}},

Abstract = {{Qur'an is a verbal and semantic miracle due to the fact that it is
   Allah's word. If the mankind and the jinns were together to produce the
   like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof, even the
   shortest chapter of it and even if they helped one another. That is
   because Allah's Word is the most beautiful one. Therefore, the sciences
   related to Quran is also the most valuable asset. Among the sciences of
   Quran is the science of al-vucuh and al-nazair. The science of al-vucuh
   deals with the words with multiple meanings whereas al-nazair is about
   the groups of words with same meanings but differing in written form and
   pronunciation. This science is about the linguistic explanation of Quran
   that every person engaged in commentaries of Quran (tafsir) should have
   a great knowledge about beside other sicences. In this article we
   studied the definition of this science, its importance, history and
   literature as well as its relations with other sciences.}},

Abstract = {{The propagation of the optical solitons is usually governed by the

   (G'/G, 1/G)-expansion method is employed to construct exact traveling
   wave solutions with parameters of two higher order nonlinear Schrodinger
   equations describing the propagation of femtosecond pulses in nonlinear
   optical fibers. When the parameters are replaced by special values, the
   well-known solitary wave solutions of these equations rediscovered from
   the traveling waves. This method can be thought of as the generalization
   of well-known original (G'/G)- expansion method proposed by M. Wang et
   al. It is shown that the two variable (G'/G, 1/G)- expansion method
   provides a more powerful mathematical tool for solving many other
   nonlinear PDEs in mathematical physics.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Impacts of urban land use can include increased stormwater runoff
   temperature (T-w) leading to receiving water quality impairment. There
   is therefore a need to target and mitigate sources of thermal pollution
   in urban areas. However, complex relationships between urban
   development, stormwater runoff and stream water heating processes are
   poorly understood. A nested-scale experimental watershed study design
   was used to investigate stormwater runoff temperature impacts to
   receiving waters in a representative mixed-use urbanizing watershed of
   the central US. Daily maximum T-w exceeded 35.0 degrees C (threshold for
   potential mortality of warm-water biota) at an urban monitoring site for
   a total of five days during the study period (2011-2013). Sudden
   increases of more than 1.0 degrees C within a 15 min time interval of
   T-w following summer thunderstorms were significantly correlated (CI =
   95\%; p < 0.01) to cumulative percent urban land use (r(2) = 0.98; n =
   29). Differences in mean T-w between monitoring sites were significantly
   correlated (CI = 95\%; p = 0.02) to urban land use practices, stream
   distance and increasing discharge. The effects of the 2012 Midwest USA
   drought and land use on T-w were also observed with maximum T-w 4.0
   degrees C higher at an urban monitoring site relative to a rural site
   for 10.5 h. The current work provides quantitative evidence of acute
   increases in T-w related to urban land use. Results better inform land
   managers wishing to create management strategies designed to preserve
   suitable thermal stream habitats in urbanizing watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a global Pade approximation of the generalized
   Mittag- Leffler function E-alpha,E-beta(- x) with x epsilon {[}0, broken
   vertical bar infinity). This uniform approximation can account for both
   the Taylor series for small arguments and asymptotic series for large
   arguments. Based on the complete monotonicity of the function
   E-alpha,E-beta(- x), we work out the global Pade approximation {[}1/2]
   for the particular cases \{0 < alpha < 1, beta > alpha\}, \{0 < alpha =
   beta < 1\}, and \{alpha = 1, beta > 1\}, respectively. Moreover, these
   approximations are inverted to yield a global Pade approximation of the
   inverse generalized MittagLeffler function - L-alpha,L- beta(x) with x
   epsilon (0, 1/ Gamma(beta)]. We also provide several examples with
   selected values alpha and beta to compute the relative error from the
   approximations. Finally, we point out the possible applications using
   our established approximations in the ordinary and partial
   time-fractional differential equations in the sense of
   Riemann-Liouville.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, alpha-Fe2O3 photocatalyst with enhanced solar-driven
   photocatalytic activity was prepared by a facile hydrothermal routine
   with the assistance of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The
   surface parameters, the distribution of particle size, structure,
   morphology, and the photo-induced charge separation rate of the
   photocatalyst prepared (CTAB-Fe2O3) were characterized by the
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, particle size analyzer, X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and surface
   photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy, respectively. The results reveal that
   CTAB alters the surface parameter and the morphology, decreases the
   particle size, and enhances the photo-induced charge separation rate of
   oc-Fe203. The photocatalytic activity of CTAB-Fe2O3 for decolorization
   of methyl orange (MO) solution was evaluated. The results show that the
   photocatalytic activity of CTAB-Fe2O3 is more than five times of that of
   the reference Fe2O3 and the possible reason was discussed. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{It is well known that most new mutations that affect fitness exert
   deleterious effects and that natural populations are often composed of
   subpopulations (demes) connected by gene flow. To gain a better
   understanding of the joint effects of purifying selection and population
   structure, we focus on a scenario where an ancestral population splits
   into multiple demes and study neutral diversity patterns in regions
   linked to selected sites. In the background selection regime of strong
   selection, we first derive analytic equations for pairwise coalescent
   times and F-ST as a function of time after the ancestral population
   splits into two demes and then construct a flexible coalescent simulator
   that can generate samples under complex models such as those involving
   multiple demes or nonconservative migration. We have carried out
   extensive forward simulations to show that the new methods can
   accurately predict diversity patterns both in the nonequilibrium phase
   following the split of the ancestral population and in the equilibrium
   between mutation, migration, drift, and selection. In the interference
   selection regime of many tightly linked selected sites, forward
   simulations provide evidence that neutral diversity patterns obtained
   from both the nonequilibrium and equilibrium phases may be virtually
   indistinguishable for models that have identical variance in fitness,
   but are nonetheless different with respect to the number of selected
   sites and the strength of purifying selection. This equivalence in
   neutral diversity patterns suggests that data collected from subdivided
   populations may have limited power for differentiating among the
   selective pressures to which closely linked selected sites are subject.}},

Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{211-223}},

Abstract = {{This paper is devoted to two issues involved in the one-class support
   vector machine (OCSVM), i.e., the optimization algorithm and the kernel
   parameter selection. For appropriate choices of parameters, the primal
   maximum margin problem of OCSVM is equivalent to a nearest point
   problem. A generalized Gilbert (GG) algorithm is proposed to solve the
   nearest point problem. Compared with the algebraic algorithms developed
   for OCSVM, such as the well-known sequential minimal optimization (SMO)
   algorithm, the GG algorithm is a novel geometric algorithm that has an
   intuitive and explicit optimization target at each iteration. Moreover,
   an improved MIES (IMIES) is developed for the Gaussian kernel parameter
   selection. IMIES is implemented by constraining the geometric locations
   of edge and interior sample mappings relative to OCSVM separating
   hyper-planes. The experimental results on 2-D artificial datasets and
   benchmark datasets show that IMIES is able to select suitable kernel
   parameters, and the GG algorithm is computationally more efficient while
   achieving comparable accuracies to the SMO algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Mapping the mouse brain with rs-fMRI: An optimized pipeline for
   functional network identification}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{11-21}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The use of resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) in translational research is a
   powerful tool to assess brain connectivity and investigate
   neuropathology in mouse models. However, despite encouraging initial
   results, the characterization of consistent and robust resting state
   networks in mice remains a methodological challenge. One key reason is
   that the quality of the measured MR signal is degraded by the presence
   of structural noise from non-neural sources. Notably, in the current
   pipeline of the Human Connectome Project, a novel approach has been
   introduced to clean rs-fMRI data, which involves automatic artifact
   component classification and data cleaning (FIX). FIX does not require
   any external recordings of physiology or the segmentation of CSF and
   white matter. In this study, we evaluated the performance of FIX for
   analyzing mouse rs-fMRI data. Our results showed that FIX can be easily
   applied to mouse datasets and detects true signals with 100\% accuracy
   and true noise components with very high accuracy (>98\%), thus reducing
   both within-and between-subject variability of rs-fMRI connectivity
   measurements. Using this improved pre-processing pipeline, maps of 23
   resting state circuits in mice were identified including two networks
   that displayed default mode network-like topography. Hierarchical
   clustering grouped these neural networks into meaningful larger
   functional circuits. These mouse resting state networks, which are
   publicly available, might serve as a reference for future work using
   mouse models of neurological disorders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Submicron aerosol volatility, chemical composition, and mixing state
   were simultaneously measured using a thermodenuder (TD) in-line with a
   single particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SPAMS) during Nov.12 to Dec.
   11 of 2014 in Shanghai. By heating up to 250 degrees C, the signals of
   refractory species such as elemental carbon, metallic compounds, and
   mineral dust in aerosols were enhanced in the mass spectra. At 250
   degrees C, the main particle types present in the size range of 0.2-1.0
   mu m were biomass burning (37\% by number) and elemental carbon (20\%).
   From 1.0 to 2.0 mu m, biomass burning (30\%), dust (19\%) and metal-rich
   (18\%) were the primary particle types. CN- signal remained in the mass
   spectra of the heated biomass burning particles suggests the existence
   of some extremely low-volatility nitrogen-containing organics.
   Laboratory experiments were conducted by burning rice straws, the main
   source material of biomass burning particles in Southern China, to
   confirm the less volatile composition contributed by biomass burning.
   Strong CN- with relative area >0.21 was observed in most of the
   laboratory-made biomass burning particles when heated above 200 degrees
   C and was selected as a new marker to identify the biomass burning
   particles in the field. The TD-SPAMS measured the size-resolved chemical
   composition of the individual particle residues at different
   temperatures and offered more information on the aging processes of
   primary particles and their sources. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Lookup table is widely used in automotive industry for the design of
   engine control units (ECU). Together with a proportional-integral
   controller, a feed-forward and feedback control scheme is often adopted

   structure of multi-input and single-output (MISO). Therefore, if there
   are multiple objectives proposed in EMS, there would be corresponding
   numbers of ECUs that need to be designed. In this situation, huge
   efforts and time were spent on calibration. In this work, a multi-input
   and multi-out (MIMO) approach based on model predictive control (MPC)
   was presented for the automatic cruise system of automotive engine. The
   results show that the tracking of engine speed command and the
   regulation of air/fuel ratio (AFR) can be achieved simultaneously under
   the new scheme. The mean absolute error (MAE) for engine speed control
   is 0.037, and the MAE for air fuel ratio is 0.069.}},

   using rDer f1, rDer p1 and R8 allergens respectively. The level of IFN
   and IL-4 in BALF was detected by ELISA.
   Results: the chimeric gene R8 was expressed with a band of approximately
   Mr 35000. Compared with groups of rDer f 1 and rDer p 1 {[}(80.44 +/-
   15.50) and (90.79 +/- 10.38) mu g/ml respectively], IgE binding capacity
   of the protein R8 (37.03 +/- 12.46) mu g/ml was statistically lower
   (P<0.001). The level of IFN in sera of R8 group {[}(343.43 +/- 38.79)
   pg/ml] was higher than that of the PBS and asthma groups {[}(393.93 +/-
   50.68) and (208.44 +/- 46.11) pg/ml respectively] (P<0.01), but no
   statistical difference to that of the rDer f 1 and rDer p 1 groups
   (P>0.05). IL-4 level in R8 group was lower markedly than the others
   (P<0.05 or P<0.01).
   Conclusions: chimeric protein R8 derived from the group 1 allergens of
   dust mites has been expressed with low allergenicity and high
   immunogenicity.}},

   which owns a measured MW-to-DC conversion efficiency of 68.1\%. A
   harmonic rejection filter and a DC pass filter, which replace lumped

   suppressing the harmonics produced by an HSMS-286 Schottky diode during
   rectifying. At the fundamental frequency, a microstrip impedance
   transformer which contains a shunt lambda/8 short-ended microstrip
   transmission line and two short series microstrip transmission lines are
   applied to compensating the imaginary impedance of the diode and
   matching the input impedance of the rectifier. The measured MW-to-DC
   conversion efficiency agrees well to the simulated results. The novel
   rectifier without any lumped passive elements may be applied for power

Abstract = {{Actinomorphic ZnO/SnO2 core-shell nanorods (NRs) were synthesized via a
   facile two-step synthesis method, in which actinomorphic ZnO NRs (core)
   with the diameter about 450-1500 nm and the length about 2-7 mu m were
   prepared in advance through a chemical solution method, and then a
   continuous SnO2 layer (shell) with the thickness about 20-25 nm was
   easily coated on the ZnO NRs via an ionic-layer adsorption and reaction
   method. Compared with pure ZnO NRs, the ZnO/SnO2 core-shell NRs showed
   an obvious improvement in gas sensing performance. The response of the
   sensor based on as-prepared ZnO/SnO2 NRs to 2000 ppm ethanol vapor was
   as high as 230 at 300 degrees C, which was 7 times higher than that of
   ZnO based sensor. This substantial improvement of the response can be
   explained by the space-charge model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A series of novel, biorenewable polymers based on acrylated epoxidized
   soybean oil (AESO) and methacrylated vanillin (MV) was prepared through
   bulk free -radical polymerization. The chemical composition of AESO was
   investigated using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR). The
   thermo-mechanical properties of the resulting polymers were
   characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric
   analyses (TGA), and tensile tests. The effect of the ratio of AESO and
   MV on the thermo-mechanical properties of the copolymers was
   investigated. Increasing MV content resulted in an increase in storage
   modulus, glass transition temperature, Young's modulus, and tensile
   strength in the copolymers. However, both thermal stability and
   elongation of the copolymers decreased with increasing MV content. The
   new bio-based polymers exhibited glass transition temperatures ranging
   from 4 to 103 degrees C. Their good mechanical properties and high
   thermal stability make them suitable candidates for advanced composite
   applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Maltose metabolism of baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) in lean
   dough is negatively influenced by glucose repression, thereby delaying
   the dough fermentation. To improve maltose metabolism and leavening
   ability, it is necessary to alleviate glucose repression. The Snf1
   protein kinase is well known to be essential for the response to glucose
   repression and required for transcription of glucose-repressed genes
   including the maltose-utilization genes (MAL). In this study, the SNF1
   overexpression and deletion industrial baker's yeast strains were
   constructed and characterized in terms of maltose utilization, growth
   and fermentation characteristics, mRNA levels of MAL genes (MAL62
   encoding the maltase and MAL61 encoding the maltose permease) and
   maltase and maltose permease activities. Our results suggest that
   overexpression of SNF1 was effective to glucose derepression for
   enhancing MAL expression levels and enzymes (maltase and maltose
   permease) activities. These enhancements could result in an 18\%
   increase in maltose metabolism of industrial baker's yeast in LSMLD
   medium (the low sugar model liquid dough fermentation medium) containing
   glucose and maltose and a 15\% increase in leavening ability in lean
   dough. These findings provide a valuable insight of breeding industrial
   baker's yeast for rapid fermentation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: There are well-established associations between
   periodontitis and diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
   The literature suggests a reciprocal relationship between periodontitis
   and diabetes. This pilot study aimed to measure in individuals with
   moderate to severe periodontitis their diabetes and CVD risks.
   Methods: Participants with a diagnosis of periodontitis were recruited
   from the Royal Dental Hospital of Melbourne. Casual blood glucose (CBG),
   total cholesterol (TC), HbA1c, blood pressure (BP), weight and height
   were measured for all study participants.
   Results: Forty-two participants enrolled in our study out of 159 that
   were approached {[}mean age 51.3, 26 (61.9\%) females]. Twenty-four
   (57.1\%) patients were undiagnosed pre-diabetic and had an HbA1c of >=
   5.7; three (7.15\%) patients were undiagnosed diabetic with an HbA1c of
   >= 6.5. Fourteen (33.3\%) patients were hypertensive (BP >= 140/90 mmHg)
   and 17 (40.5\%) had hypercholesterolaemia (TC >= 5.5). Twelve (28.6\%)
   patients were smokers and 24 (57.1\%) had a blood mass index (BMI) above
   25. Twenty-four (57.1\%) patients were referred to their general
   practitioner due to elevated disease markers.
   Conclusions: This small study found a large proportion of patients with
   periodontitis had undiagnosed pre-diabetes or diabetes, hypertension,
   hypercholesterolaemia and elevated BMI levels.}},

Abstract = {{Background: ABT-126 is a novel, safe, and well-tolerated alpha 7
   nicotinic receptor agonist in a Phase 2 Alzheimer's disease study. We
   tested the antidyskinetic effect of ABT-126 in
   1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine-treated squirrel monkeys
   with moderate and more severe nigrostriatal damage.
   Methods: Monkeys (n = 21, set 1) were lesioned with
   1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine 1-2x. When parkinsonian,
   they were gavaged with levodopa (10 mg/kg)/carbidopa (2.5 mg/kg) twice
   daily and dyskinesias rated. They were then given nicotine in drinking
   water (n = 5), or treated with vehicle (n = 6) or ABT-126 (n = 10) twice
   daily orally 30 min before levodopa. Set 1 was then re-lesioned 1 to 2
   times for a total of 3 to 4 1-methyl-
   4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine injections. The antidyskinetic
   effect of ABT-126, nicotine, and the beta 2{*} nicotinic receptor
   agonist ABT-894 was re-assessed. Another group of monkeys (n = 23, set
   2) were lesioned with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine only
   1x to 2x. They were treated with levodopa/carbidopa, administered the
   alpha 7 agonist ABT-107 (n = 6), ABT-894 (n = 6), nicotine (n = 5), or
   vehicle (n = 6) and dyskinesias evaluated. All monkeys were euthanized
   and the dopamine transporter measured.
   Results: With moderate nigrostriatal damage (1-methyl-
   4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine 1 x -2x), ABT-126 dose-dependently
   decreased dyskinesias (-60\%), with similar results seen with ABT-894
   (-60\%) or nicotine (-60\%). With more severe damage (
   1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine 3-4x), ABT-126 and nicotine
   reduced dyskinesias, but ABT-894 did not. The dopamine transporter was
   41\% and 8.9\% of control, with moderate and severe nigrostriatal
   damage, respectively. No drug modified parkinsonism.
   Conclusion: The novel alpha 7 nicotinic receptor drug ABT-126 reduced
   dyskinesias in monkeys with both moderate and severe nigrostriatal
   damage. ABT-126 may be useful to reduce dyskinesias in both early-and
   later-stage Parkinson's disease. (C) 2015 International Parkinson and

Title = {{Impact of uncertainty description on assimilating hydraulic head in the

Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{B}},
Pages = {{400-413}},

Abstract = {{The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a popular data assimilation (DA)
   technique that has been extensively used in environmental sciences for
   combining complementary information from model predictions and
   observations. One of the major challenges in EnKF applications is the
   description of model uncertainty. In most hydrological EnKF
   applications, an ad hoc model uncertainty is defined with the aim of
   avoiding a collapse of the filter. The present work provides a
   systematic assessment of model uncertainty in DA applications based on
   combinations of forcing, model parameters, and state uncertainties. This
   is tested in a case where ground-water hydraulic heads are assimilated
   into a distributed and integrated catchment-scale model of the Karup
   catchment in Denmark. A series of synthetic data assimilation
   experiments are carried out to analyse the impact of different model
   uncertainty assumptions on the feasibility and efficiency of the
   assimilation. The synthetic data used in the assimilation study makes it
   possible to diagnose model uncertainty assumptions statistically.
   Besides the model uncertainty, other factors such as observation error,
   observation locations, and ensemble size are also analysed with respect
   to performance and sensitivity. Results show that inappropriate
   definition of model uncertainty can greatly degrade the assimilation
   performance, and an appropriate combination of different model
   uncertainty sources is advised. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Copper transporters (COPT/Ctr) have important roles in the transport of
   copper (Cu) across the cell membrane in many different species. A
   comprehensive phylogeny and a molecular structure analysis of the
   COPT/Ctr family in plants and animals are presented, with an emphasis
   and bioinformatic analysis of the copper transporter family in Populus
   trichocarpa (PtCOPT). Structural analyses of PtCOPTs showed that most
   have 3 transmembrane domains (TMDs), with an exception of PtCOPT4 (2
   TMDs). Gene structure, gene chromosomal location, and synteny analyses
   of PtCOPTs demonstrated that tandem and segmental duplications have
   likely contributed to the expansion and evolution of the PtCOPTs.
   Additionally, promoter analyses showed that the function of PtCOPTs is
   related to Cu and ferrum (Fe) transport. Tissue-specific expression of
   PtCOPT genes showed that most had relatively high transcript levels in
   roots and leaves. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis
   revealed that the expression of PtCOPT genes were induced not only in
   limited and excessive Cu, Fe, zinc (Zn) and manganese (Mn) stress, but
   also in lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd) stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson

   load-redistribution}},
Journal = {{SAFETY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{156-162}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, local load-redistribution is employed to study the
   vulnerability of the US power grid subjected to attacks, and the initial
   load of power node is assumed as the linear summation of its degree and
   the sum of its neighbors' degrees. Based on the simulation results, we
   find that with the decrease of the initial load of power node, the
   critical threshold of tolerance parameter increases subjected to the
   highest load node-based attack, but the critical threshold decreases
   subjected to the lowest load node-based attacks. Meanwhile, we discover
   that the critical threshold subjected to the lowest load node-based
   attack is larger than that subjected to the highest load node-based
   attack when the tunable parameter alpha is an element of{[}0.1, 0.9].
   Moreover, this paper compares the new model with the other two existing
   models, and the results illustrate that there are many similarities
   between these two existing models, but they are different from the new
   model presented in this paper. Furthermore, the infimum of tolerance
   parameter is proposed to portray the minimum cost of power grid, which
   can give a method to construct more robust power grids in the future.

Abstract = {{A lattice Boltzmann model is proposed for solving the complex
   Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) with curvilinear coordinates. The method
   maintains the algorithmic simplicity of the original lattice Boltzmann
   scheme, and does not require an interpolation or coarse-graining
   procedure. This lattice Boltzmann scheme is based on uniformly
   distributed lattice points in these curvilinear coordinate systems. The
   algorithm provides advantages similar to the previous lattice Boltzmann
   method in that it is easily adapted to CGLE. The numerical simulations
   show spiral wave on a disc, the surface of a sphere, and the inside of a
   sphere. Examples show that the model accurately reproduces the phenomena
   in the CGLE. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Catalyzing the oxidation of sulfamethoxazole by permanganate using
   molecular sieves supported ruthenium nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Pages = {{154-161}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study developed a heterogeneous catalytic permanganate oxidation
   system with three molecular sieves, i.e., nanosized ZSM-5 (ZSM-5A),
   microsized ZSM-5 (ZSM-5B) and MCM-41, supported ruthenium nanoparticles
   as catalyst, denoted as Ru/ZSM-5A, Ru/ZSM-5B and Ru/MCM-41,
   respectively. The presence of 0.5 g L-1 Ru/ZSM-5A, Ru/ZSM-5B and
   Ru/MCM-41 increased the oxidation rate of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) by
   permanganate at pH 7.0 by 27-1144 times. The catalytic performance of Ru
   catalysts toward SMX oxidation by permanganate was strongly dependent on
   Ru loading on the catalysts. The X-ray absorption near edge structure
   (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses
   confirmed that Ru catalyst acted as an electron shuttle in catalytic
   permanganate oxidation process. Ru-VII deposited on the surface of
   catalysts was oxidized by permanganate to its higher oxidation state
   Ru-VII, which could work as a co-oxidant with permanganate to decompose
   SMX and was then reduced to its initial tri-valence. During the
   successive runs, Ru/ZSM-5A could not maintain its catalytic activity due
   to the deposition of MnO2, which was the reductive product of
   permanganate, onto the surface of Ru/ZSM-5A. Thus, the regeneration of
   partially deactivated Ru catalysts by reductant NH2OH.HCl or ascorbic
   acid was proposed. Ru/ZSM-5A regenerated by NH2OH.HCl displayed
   comparable catalytic ability to its virgin counterpart, while ascorbic
   acid could not completely remove the deposited MnO2. A trace amount of
   leaching of Ru into the reaction solution was also observed, which would
   be ameliorated by improving the preparation conditions in the future
   study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design and experimental evaluation of a silicon
   micro-machined resonant accelerometer (SMRA). This type of accelerometer
   works on the principle that a proof mass under acceleration applies
   force to two double-ended tuning fork (DETF) resonators, and the
   frequency output of two DETFs exhibits a differential shift. The dies of
   an SMRA are fabricated using silicon-on-insulator (SOI) processing and
   wafer-level vacuum packaging. This research aims to design a
   high-sensitivity SMRA because a high sensitivity allows for the
   acceleration signal to be easily demodulated by frequency counting
   techniques and decreases the noise level. This study applies the
   energy-consumed concept and the Nelder-Mead algorithm in the SMRA to
   address the design issues and further increase its sensitivity. Using
   this novel method, the sensitivity of the SMRA has been increased by
   66.1\%, which attributes to both the re-designed DETF and the reduced
   energy loss on the micro-lever. The results of both the closed-form and
   finite-element analyses are described and are in agreement with one
   another. A resonant frequency of approximately 22 kHz, a frequency
   sensitivity of over 250 Hz per g, a one-hour bias stability of 55 g, a
   bias repeatability (1 sigma) of 48 g and the bias-instability of 4.8 g
   have been achieved.}},

Journal = {{OPTICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{As one branch of stereo matching, video stereo matching becomes more and
   more significant in computer vision applications. The conventional
   stereo matching methods for static images would cause flicker-frames and
   worse matching results. We propose a joint motion-based square step
   (JMSS) method for stereo video matching. The motion vector is introduced
   as one component in the support region building for the raw cost
   aggregation. Then we aggregate the raw cost along two directions in the
   support region. Finally, the winner-take-all strategy determines the
   best disparity under our hypothesis. Experimental results show that the
   JMSS method not only outperforms other state-of-the-art stereo matching
   methods on test sequences with abundant movements, but also performs
   well in some real-world scenes with fixed and moving stereo cameras,
   respectively, in particular under some extreme conditions of real stereo
   visions. Additionally, the proposed JMSS method can be implemented in
   real time, which is superior to other state-of-the-art methods. The time
   efficiency is also a very important consideration in our algorithm
   design. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Abstract = {{One major obstacle in the application of drug delivery systems for
   cancer chemotherapy is their poor penetration in tumor tissues.
   Conjugating active ligand moieties to the surface of nanoparticles may
   be a promising approach for enhancing the tumor accumulation and
   penetration of nanoparticles. Herein, the cell-penetrating peptide
   twin-arginine translocation (Tat)-conjugated epirubicin-loaded
   poly(lactic-glycolic acid) nanoparticles were prepared to achieve deep
   tumor penetration. The morphology and size of nanoparticles were
   characterized by scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light
   scattering, and the biological behaviors of nanoparticles were
   evaluated. It is demonstrated that Tat-conjugated nanoparticles have a
   significant improvement in antitumor activity and biodistribution
   compared with nonconjugated nanoparticles. Importantly, Tat conjugated
   on the surface of nanoparticles could facilitate the encapsulated drug
   penetration into deeper tumor tissue. Additionally, Tat-conjugated
   nanoparticles have good biocompatibility, as demonstrated by hemolytic
   tests, in vitro cytotoxicity, and histology study. These results
   suggested that the Tat-conjugated nanoparticles, as a powerful delivery
   system for chemotherapeutic drug, would have a promising application in
   human cancer therapy. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American

   determined to have mixed de-trapping mechanisms, emission, and
   tunneling. Part of the electrons captured in the trap states are likely
   to tunnel into the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel under
   serious band bending and stronger electric field peak caused by high Al
   content in the InAlN barrier, which explains the opposite voltage
   dependence of time constant and relation between the time constant and

Abstract = {{To reduce the dead zone and enhance the flashing light effect, a novel
   open raceway pond with flow deflectors and wing baffles was developed.
   The hydrodynamics and light characteristics in the novel open raceway
   pond were investigated using computational fluid dynamics. Results
   showed that, compared with the control pond, pressure loss in the flow
   channel of the pond with optimized flow deflectors decreased by 14.58\%,
   average fluid velocity increased by 26.89\% and dead zone decreased by
   60.42\%. With wing baffles built into the raceway pond, significant
   swirling flow was produced. Moreover, the period of average L/D cycle
   was shortened. In outdoor cultivation of freshwater Chlorella sp., the
   biomass concentration of Chlorella sp. cultivated in the raceway pond
   with wing baffles was 30.11\% higher than that of the control pond. (C)

Title = {{Engineering vascularized soft tissue flaps in an animal model using

Abstract = {{Insufficient neovascularization is associated with high levels of
   resorption and necrosis in autologous and engineered fat grafts. We
   tested the hypothesis that incorporating angiogenic growth factor into a
   scaffold-stem cell construct and implanting this construct around a
   vascular pedicle improves neovascularization and adipogenesis for
   engineering soft tissue flaps. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic-acid/polyethylene
   glycol (PLGA/PEG) microspheres containing vascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF) were impregnated into collagen-chitosan scaffolds seeded
   with human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs). This setup was analyzed
   in vitro and then implanted into isolated chambers around a discrete
   vascular pedicle in nude rats. Engineered tissue samples within the
   chambers were harvested and analyzed for differences in vascularization
   and adipose tissue growth. In vitro testing showed that the
   collagen-chitosan scaffold provided a supportive environment for hASC
   integration and proliferation. PLGA/PEG microspheres with slow-release
   VEGF had no negative effect on cell survival in collagen-chitosan
   scaffolds. In vivo, the system resulted in a statistically significant
   increase in neovascularization that in turn led to a significant
   increase in adipose tissue persistence after 8 weeks versus control
   constructs. These data indicate that our model-hASCs integrated with a
   collagen-chitosan scaffold incorporated with VEGF-containing PLGA/PEG
   microspheres supported by a predominant vascular vessel inside a
   chamber-provides a promising, clinically translatable platform for
   engineering vascularized soft tissue flap. The engineered adipose tissue
   with a vascular pedicle could conceivably be transferred as a
   vascularized soft tissue pedicle flap or free flap to a recipient site
   for the repair of soft-tissue defects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Varied interspecific interactions have a tremendous impact on the
   population dynamics of related species. However, the context dependency
   of interspecific interactions and their ecological effects have not been
   well-characterized. To understand the context dependency of ant-aphid
   mutualism and the corresponding ecological effects, we explored the
   association of ant abundance, trophic position, and plant herbivory
   along an elevational gradient. We hypothesized that a higher abundance
   of ants would be associated with a lower trophic position and lower
   plant herbivory level along the gradient. We detected a large variation
   in ant abundance and herbivory along the elevational gradient.
   Consistent with our prediction, a higher ant abundance was associated
   with a lower trophic position, and herbivory decreased linearly with ant
   abundance. A tight positive relationship between the abundance of ants
   and aphids was observed. These findings suggest that the context
   dependency of ant-aphid mutualism can be an important factor affecting
   the pattern of ant abundance and plant herbivory across the elevational
   gradient. This study highlights the significance of mutualistic
   interactions in shaping the pattern of certain key ecological processes,
   such as herbivory, at a relatively larger spatial scale.}},

Abstract = {{SYF2, also known as p29/NTC31/CBPIN, encodes a nuclear protein that
   interacts with Cyclin D-type binding-protein 1. SYF2 has been reported
   to be involved in pre-mRNA splicing and cell cycle regulation. In the
   present study, we observed that SYF2 was obviously upregulated in HCC
   tumor tissues and cell lines, and its level was positively correlated
   with the tumor grade and Ki-67 expression, as well as poor prognosis of
   HCC. In vitro, using serum starvation-refeeding experiment, our results
   suggested that SYF2 was upregulated in proliferating HCC cells, and was
   positive correlated with the expression of PCNA and Cyclin D1. In
   addition, depletion of SYF2 decreased PCNA and Cyclin D1 levels.
   Accordingly, interference of SYF2 resulted in cells cycle arrest at G1/S
   phase in Huh7 HCC cells. Furthermore, we found that SYF2 might interact
   with Cyclin D1 and could confer doxorubicin resistance in HCC cells.
   These findings revealed that SYF2 might play a regulatory role in the
   proliferation of HCC cells. In summary, SYF2 may be a novel prognostic
   marker and serve as a potential therapeutic target in HCC.}},

Abstract = {{Light emitting diodes (LEDs) have been widely used for illumination
   because of their electrical efficiency and reliability. Their long lumen
   maintenance is not easy to be evaluated when it is compared with their
   efficiency because the reliability test is a time consuming task. LEDs
   are required to undergo many reliability tests and sometimes create
   failures induced by high thermo-mechanical stresses. One of the major
   failure modes is the lens or encapsulant crack. Therefore, the lens and
   encapsulant materials are required to contain high temperature stability
   as well as high optical properties. One of the materials for LEDs is
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) which can have a wide range of refractive
   indices from 1.40 to 1.57. In this investigation, silicone degradation
   was quantitatively evaluated using finite element analysis. The finite
   element simulation showed that thermal-mechanical stress in volume of
   interest (VOI). As PDMS has viscoelastic properties, strain rates
   induced by the viscosity effect were focused and computed. Furthermore,
   the correlation between the strain rates and lumen depreciation was
   discovered, which leads to a lumen depreciation model based on the
   strain rates. Using the model, the tendency of the lumen maintenance for
   LED packages could be estimated using numerical analysis without
   time-consuming tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The DNA-based method is used widely for HLA genotyping in routine work,
   but some allele may be dropout in the genotyping procedure. Here, we
   reported a case with HLA-A allele dropout in the Sanger PCR-SBT test.
   The initial PCR-SBT method with a commercial agent kit was not
   characterized, and the result of Luminex technology indicated the
   dropout as a HLA-A{*}02 allele. Subsequently, the sequences of exons 2-4
   were fully matched with the A{*}02:07 and A{*}11:01:01 by allele
   group-specific primer amplification PCR-SBT. On further analysis, a
   novel allele A{*}02:07:07 was identified, which has one nucleotide
   difference from A{*}02:07:01 at position 6 C>G of exon 1. According to
   the sequencing for 50-UTR to 3'-UTR, the novel single nucleotide
   polymorphism of exon 1 was contributed to HLA-A locus allele dropout in
   the sample. Our results indicated multiplatform analysis is necessary
   when a conclusive HLA type cannot be determined by a single methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectric properties, ferroelectric hysteresis loops, and leakage
   current characteristics of an epitaxial BaTiO3 (BTO) film were
   investigated with La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 as bottom electrode and the different
   noble metal as top electrodes (Au, Ag and Pt, which were deposited on
   the same surface of a BTO film). The dielectric constants, dielectric
   loss, leakage currents and ferroelectric loops all exhibited the
   top-electrode-dependent behavior, which can be attributed to the
   different interface state. The J-V characteristics were analyzed with
   various transportation mechanisms in detail. Regardless of the top
   electrode materials, the leakage current characteristics were described
   by a modified Schottky contact model for all BTO film capacitors. It was
   proved that large space charge densities were the main contribution to
   the slim hysteresis loops. The potential of these interface charge
   dominated BTO film heterostructures in the application of high energy
   density storage capacitors was also demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Both HIV infection and frailty have been associated with
   chronic immune activation. One possible explanation for this chronic
   immune activation could be low levels of CD4(+) T regulatory cells
   (T-regs), which suppress immune responses.
   Methods. HIV-uninfected (HIV-) and HIV-infected (HIV+) men in the
   Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) were classified as frail (or
   nonfrail) if they expressed (or did not express) the Fried frailty
   phenotype at two consecutive study visits. Percentages and absolute
   numbers of total T-regs, and percentages of different subsets of T-regs
   and of activated T cells were measured by flow cytometry. The function
   of T-regs was measured by suppression of T-cell proliferation.
   Results. Percentages of T-regs were higher, rather than lower, in frail
   men than in nonfrail men, and this difference was significant for
   HIV-men. Percentages of subsets of T-regs did not differ significantly
   by frailty status. Among HIV+ men, the suppressive function of T-regs
   was similar between frail and nonfrail men. Percentages of T-regs and
   activated T cells were negatively correlated in nonfrail men (HIV- and
   HIV+) and in frail HIV-men, but this correlation was strongly positive
   in frail HIV+ men.
   Conclusion. These data suggest that: (a) T-regs were not deficient in
   frail men; and (b) the immunological pathophysiology of frailty may
   differ by HIV status.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change has become a spot issue of the international community,
   and how to efficiently carry out international cooperation to deal with
   climate change is a serious problem to be solved. Actions on climate
   change launched by government have become a national consensus to
   various countries, while actions by private sectors, establishment and
   operation of relevant market mechanisms are also an important approach
   to address climate change through global cooperation. We have undertaken
   the construction of international or regional carbon market, clean
   energy quota market, Energy Management Contracting (EMC) and other
   market mechanisms, laying a solid foundation for further exploring
   market mechanism that enhances international climate governance, which
   also illustrates the significance of market mechanism to international
   community. New market mechanisms continue to be explored in market
   activities, and green supply chain management is one of them. Green
   supply chain management refers to the monitoring and management of
   impact on environment in the processes of acquisition, transportation,
   and storage of raw materials, distribution and utilization of products,
   and disposal of waste products while considering the impact of
   production processes on environment as well. Green supply chain
   management, as a market-based mean which balances climate environmental
   performance and economic benefits, will enable enterprises to include
   the influence of whole process of production on the climate and
   environment into decision-making process, launch green monitoring to the
   whole production cycle of product, so as to realize green and low-carbon
   development of enterprises. Green supply chain management not only has
   direct influence on enterprises to achieve greenhouse gas emission
   reduction, but also has positive meaning to industrial transformation
   and upgrading, high-end development of manufacturing industry, and
   promoting the construction of ecological civilization, which accords
   with economic and industrial development of China in the future, worth
   being explored and practiced as a new market mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-doped Al2O3 (MWCNT-Al2O3) was
   prepared by sol-gel method. MWCNT-Al2O3 was then used to prepare
   TiO2/MWCNT-Al2O3 for the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange and
   was found to have degradation rate of 99.4 \% in 1 h, which is much
   higher than that of P25 and TiO2/Al2O3. The physicochemical properties
   of TiO2/MWCNT-Al2O3 were characterized by XRD, BET, HRTEM, UV-Vis, and
   PL. TiO2 was found to be highly dispersed on MWCNT-Al2O3 and to have
   specific surface area of 309.75 m(2)/g after MWCNTs were introduced. The
   increased degradation efficiency was attributed to the synergistic
   effect between MWCNTs and Al2O3. The combination of MWCNTs and Al2O3 led
   to increased specific surface area, mesoporosity, and stability, as well
   as more extensive electron-hole pair generation, transfer, and

Abstract = {{China fusion engineering test reactor is an ITER-like superconducting
   tokamak reactor, which has a big duty time factor. Lifetime of structure
   material in blanket play an important role in the safety, reliability
   and economy of fusion reactor, which should be careful considered in the
   engineering design. High temperature is always one of the main targets
   in the fusion reactor concept design. And creep performance under high
   temperature of structure material is important in the failure mechanisms
   and lifetime analysis. Creep lifetime analysis of first wall in helium
   cooled solid breeder blanket was conducted for candidate structural
   materials. It is found that 316L(N) have a better creep lifetime
   performance than Eurofer. For an acceptable creep lifetime at 0.3
   MW/m(2) surface heat flux, there could be space for wall thickness
   change and improvement of cooling ability and outlet temperature of
   first wall.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the multiobjective optimization problem for
   green network routing. Although traditional commonly used multiobjective
   optimization methods can yield a Pareto efficient solution, they need to
   construct an aggregate objective function (AOF) or model one objective
   as a constraint in the optimization problem formulation. As a result, it
   is difficult to achieve a fair tradeoff among all objectives.
   Accordingly, we induce a Nash bargaining framework, which treats the two
   objectives as two virtual players in a game theoretic model, who
   negotiate how traffic should be routed to optimize both objectives.
   During the negotiation, each of them announces its performance threat
   value to reduce its cost, so the model is regarded as a threat value
   game. Our analysis shows that no agreement can be achieved if each
   player sets its threat value selfishly. To avoid such a negotiation
   break-down, we modify the threat value game to have a repeated process
   and design a mechanism to not only guarantee an agreement, but also
   generate a fair solution. Finally, to evaluate the efficiency of our
   proposed framework, we implement it into two multiobjective optimization
   cases for network green routing. The first case is load balancing and
   energy efficiency optimization for intradomain routing, and the second
   one is the energy efficiency optimization of two domains for interdomain
   routing.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the effect of 3-oxotirucalla-7, 24-dien-21-oic
   acid on CD8(+) T cell recovery in human immunodeficiency virus type 1
   (HIV-1) disease.
   Methods: The increase in the rates of CD8(+) T cells over 48 weeks
   following treatment with 3-oxotirucalla-7, 24-dien-21-oic acid was
   investigated. Plasma HIV-1 load was measured by Versant T HIV-1 RNA 3.0
   branched chain DNA assay while flow cytometry was used for blood CD4
   cell counts. For the analysis of the data obtained, Stata version 9.0
   was employed.
   Results: 3-Oxotirucalla-7, 24-dien-21-oic acid treatment increased
   CD8(+) T cell count from a median of 89 \% at baseline to 99 \% at 48
   weeks. The proportion of patients with CD8(+) T cell count < 90 \%
   decreased from 50 \% at baseline to 1 \%. There was a similar rate of
   phase 1 CD8(+) T cell recovery and greater rates of phase 2 recovery in
   patients with baseline CD8(+) T counts < 50 cells/mu L. Among those that
   achieved CD8(+) T cell count > 500 cells/mu L at 48 weeks, 23 \% had
   baseline CD8(+) T cell counts of < 50 cells/mu L. However, the
   proportion of the patients that attained CD8(+) T count of 200 cells/mu
   L at 48 weeks was lower than those with higher baseline CD4 cell counts.
   Conclusion: 3-Oxotirucalla-7,24-dien-21-oic acid treatment induces
   greater tendency for CD8(+) T cell recovery in patients with baseline
   CD8(+) T cell counts < 50 cells/mu L during 48 weeks of treatment.
   Therefore, 3-oxotirucalla-7,24-dien-21-oic acid is a promising agent for
   CD8(+) T cell count recovery in patients with HIV infection.}},

   Between 1985 and 2005, average increases in body weight (BW), body
   length (BL), ponderal index (PI), and head circumference (HC) of
   newborns were statistically significant: 107 g, 0.2 cm, 0.6 kg/m(3) and
   0.4 cm, respectively. The relative increase in BW was more than that in
   BL (3.4\% vs 0.4\%) in the last two decades, leading to an increase in
   PI. The distribution of birth size shifted slightly to the right, and
   the proportion of macrosomia increased from 3.2\% in 1985 to 3.4\% in
   1995 and to 4.3\% in 2005. The increases in BW and PI and the increase

Abstract = {{Comparing with continuous production process, unsteady operation
   process, such as startup and shutdown, tends to abnormal situations due
   to a large number of operations of operators and dynamic state changes
   involved. To guarantee a safe operation, process hazard analysis (PHA)
   is very important to proactively identify the potential safety problems.
   In the chemical process industry, hazard and operability (HAZOP)
   analysis is the most widely used method. In this paper, based on
   proposed qualitative simulation and inference method, an automatic HAZOP
   analysis method for unsteady operation processes is proposed. Mass
   transfer and relationships among process variables are expressed by
   Petri net-directed graph model based fuzzy logic. Operating procedure is
   expressed according to a formal expression. Possible operation
   deviations from normal operating procedure are identified by using a
   group of guidewords. Hazards are identified automatically by qualitative
   simulation and inference when wrong operation process is performed. The
   method is validated by a rectification column system. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{INTRA video coding is essential for high quality mobile video
   communication and industrial video applications since it enhances video
   quality, prevents error propagation, and facilitates random access. The
   latest high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard has adopted flexible
   quad-tree-based block structure and complex angular INTRA prediction to
   improve the coding efficiency. However, these technologies increase the
   coding complexity significantly, which consumes large hardware
   resources, computing time and power cost, and is an obstacle for
   real-time video applications. To reduce the coding complexity and save
   power cost, we propose a fast INTRA coding unit (CU) depth decision
   method based on statistical modeling and correlation analyses. First, we
   analyze the spatial CU depth correlation with different textures and
   present effective strategies to predict the most probable depth range
   based on the spatial correlation among CUs. Since the spatial
   correlation may fail for image boundary and transitional areas between
   textural and smooth areas, we then present a statistical model-based CU
   decision approach in which adaptive early termination thresholds are
   determined and updated based on the rate-distortion (RD) cost
   distribution, video content, and quantization parameters (QPs).
   Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the
   complexity by about 56.76\% and 55.61\% on average for various sequences
   and configurations; meanwhile, the RD degradation is negligible.}},

Title = {{Carbon-saturated monosulfide melting in the shallow mantle: solubility
   and effect on solidus}},
Journal = {{CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{170}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We present high-pressure experiments from 0.8 to 7.95 GPa to determine
   the effect of carbon on the solidus of mantle monosulfide. The
   graphite-saturated solidus of monosulfide (Fe0.69Ni0.23Cu0.01S1.00) is
   described by a Simon and Glatzel (Z Anorg Allg Chem 178:309-316, 1929)
   equation T (degrees C) = 969.0{[}P (GPa)/5.92 + 1](0.39) (1 <= P <= 8)
   and is similar to 80 +/- 25 degrees C below the melting temperature
   found for carbon-free conditions. A series of comparison experiments
   using different capsule configurations and preparations document that
   the observed solidus-lowering is owing to graphite saturation and not an
   artifact of different capsules or hydrogen contamination. Concentrations
   of carbon in quenched graphite-saturated monosulfide melt measured by
   electron microprobe are 0.1-0.3 wt\% in monosulfide melt and below the
   detection limit (<0.2 wt\%) in crystalline monosulfide solid solution.
   Although there is only a small amount of carbon dissolved in monosulfide
   melts, the substantial effect on monosulfide solidus temperature means
   that the carbon-saturated monosulfide (Fe0.69Ni0.23Cu0.01S1.00) solidus
   intersects continental mantle geotherms inferred from diamond inclusion
   geobarometry at 6-7 GPa (similar to 200 km), whereas carbon-free
   monosulfide (Fe0.69Ni0.23Cu0.01S1.00) solidus does not. The composition
   investigated (Fe0.69Ni0.23Cu0.01S1.00) has a comparatively low
   metal/sulfur (M/S) ratio and low Ni/(Fe + Ni), but sulfides with higher
   (M/S) and with greater Ni/(Fe + Ni) should melt at lower temperatures
   and these should have a broader melt stability field in the diamond
   formation environment and in the continental lithosphere. Low carbon
   solubility in monosulfide melt excludes the possibility that diamonds
   are crystallized from sulfide melt. Although monosulfide melt can store
   no more than 2 ppm C in a bulk mantle with 225 ppm S, melts with higher
   M/S could be a primary host of carbon in the deeper part of the upper
   mantle. For example, the storage capacity of C in sulfide melts in the
   deep upper mantle (similar to 400 km) for a depleted mantle domain (MORB
   source, 120 +/- 30 ppm S) is estimated to be 57 +/-(63)(30) ppm, and so
   all the C could be in a sulfide melt. In an enriched (OIB source, 225
   +/- 25 ppm S) mantle domain, the C stored in sulfide melt in the deep
   upper mantle is estimated to be 86 +/-(92)(44) ppm, which would amount
   to about half the available carbon.}},

Abstract = {{Glucocorticoids are effective for the treatment of acute-on-chronic
   pre-liver failure, severe chronic hepatitis B and acute liver failure;
   however, the mechanism underlying the effects of treatment by
   glucocorticoids remains to be fully elucidated. The role and detailed
   mechanism of how glucocorticoids prevent liver disease progression can
   be elucidated by investigating the apoptosis of hepatocytes following
   glucocorticoid treatment. P-glycoproteins (P-gps) also confer resistance
   to apoptosis induced by a diverse range of stimuli. Glucocorticoids,
   particularly dexamethasone (DEX), upregulate the expression of P-gp in
   several tissues. In the present study, the normal human L-02 liver cell
   line was used, and techniques, including immunocytochemistry, western
   blot analysis, flow cytometry and reverse transcription-quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction analysis were used for determining the
   expression levels of P-gps, and for evaluating the effect of DEX
   pretreatment on the expression of P-gps. DEX (1-10 mu M) was added to
   the cell culture media and incubated for 24-72 h. The results revealed
   that DEX upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of P-gp in a dose- and
   time-dependent manner. Subsequently, tumor necrosis factor-related
   apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) was used for the induction of
   apoptosis in the cells, followed by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl
   transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay to assess the apoptotic stages.
   The results demonstrated that apoptosis in the group of cells, which
   were pre-treated with DEX was significantly lower than that in the
   control group. Treatment with tariquidar, a P-gp inhibitor, reduced the
   anti-apoptotic effects of DEX. These results established that DEX
   protects normal human liver cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis by
   upregulating the expression of P-gp. These observations may be useful
   for elucidating the mechanism of DEX for preventing the progression of
   liver disease.}},

Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{207-211}},

Abstract = {{Industrialized white organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) currently
   require host-guest doping, a complicated process necessitating precise
   control of the guest concentration to get high efficiency and stability.
   Two doping-free, hybrid white OLEDs with fluorescent blue, and
   phosphorescent green and red emissive layers (EMLs) are reported in this
   work. An ultra-thin red phosphorescent EML was situated in a
   blue-emitting electron transport layer (ETL), while the ultra-thin green
   phosphorescent EML was placed either in the ETL (Device 1), or the hole
   transport layer (HTL) (Device 2). Device 2 exhibits higher efficiency
   and more stable spectrum due to the enhanced utilization of excitons by
   ultra-thin green EML at the exciton generation zone within the HTL.
   Values of current efficiency (CE), power efficiency (PE), and CRI
   obtained for the optimized hybrid white OLEDs fabricated through a
   doping-free process were of 23.2 cd/A, 20.5 lm/W and 82 at 1000 cd/m(2),

Abstract = {{The taxonomic status of subspecies of Hipposideros pomona (Mammalia:
   Chiroptera: Hipposideridae) in China is controversial and uncertain. To
   explore the differences and subspecies differentiation in H. pomona from
   different regions of China, we conducted a series of bat surveys from
   2011 to 2014. We performed multivariate morphometric analyses using 16
   external and 21 skull measurements based on 100 samples and compared DNA
   sequence divergence. The results revealed distinct differences in both
   the external and skull measurements of H. pomona. The Cytb and CO.
   sequence divergences of H. pomona from 3 regions ranged from 6.0\% to
   8.5\% and 5.2\% to 8.0\%, respectively, which reached the levels
   required for subspecies classification. In contrast, the RAG1 gene was
   not considered to be a good molecular marker for identifying subspecies
   because the sequence divergence was 0-0.7\% within a region and 0-0.8\%
   among regions. Both the morphological and molecular results of this
   study supported the conclusion that H. pomona from the Min-Guang coastal
   (SM), South Yunnan (SY), and Hainan Island (SH) subregions in South
   China belonged to different subspecies. The SM population represents H.
   p. sinesis, and the SH population may be a unique subspecies. Whether
   the SY population belongs to H. p. gentilis requires further study.}},

Abstract = {{The copper chaperone Cox17 (cytochrome c oxidase copper chaperone) has
   been shown to facilitate the delivery of cisplatin to mitochondria,
   which contributes to the overall cytotoxicity of the drug {[}Zhao et al.
   (2014) Chem. Commun. 50, 2667-2669]. Kinetic data indicate that Cox17
   has reactivity similar to glutathione (GSH), the most abundant
   thiol-rich molecule in the cytoplasm. In the present study, we found
   that GSH significantly modulates the reaction of platinum complexes with
   Cox17. GSH enhances the reactivity of three anti-cancer drugs
   (cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin) to Cox17, but suppresses the
   reaction of transplatin. Surprisingly, the pre-formed cisplatin-GSH
   adducts are highly reactive to Cox17; over 90\% platinum transfers from
   GSH to Cox17. On the other hand, transplatin-GSH adducts are inert to
   Cox17. These different effects are consistent with the drug activity of
   these platinum complexes. In addition, GSH attenuates the protein
   aggregation of Cox17 induced by platination. These results indicate that
   the platinum-protein interactions could be substantially influenced by
   the cellular environment.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: alpha/beta-Hydrolase domain-6 (ABHD6) is a newly identified
   monoacylglycerol (MAG) lipase. We recently reported that it negatively
   regulates glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in the beta cells
   by hydrolyzing lipolysis-derived MAG that acts as a metabolic coupling
   factor and signaling molecule via exocytotic regulator Munc13-1. Whether
   ABHD6 and MAG play a role in response to all classes of insulin
   secretagogues, in particular various fuel and non-fuel stimuli, is
   unknown.
   Methods: Insulin secretion in response to various classes of
   secretagogues, exogenous MAG and pharmacological agents was measured in
   islets of mice deficient in ABHD6 specifically in the beta cell (BKO).
   Islet perifusion experiments and determinations of glucose and fatty
   acid metabolism, cytosolic Ca2+ and MAG species levels were carried out.
   Results: Deletion of ABHD6 potentiated insulin secretion in response to
   the fuels glutamine plus leucine and a-ketoisocaproate and to the
   non-fuel stimuli glucagon-like peptide 1, carbamylcholine and elevated
   KCl. Fatty acids amplified GSIS in control and BKO mice to the same
   extent. Exogenous 1-MAG amplified insulin secretion in response to fuel
   and non-fuel stimuli. MAG hydrolysis activity was greatly reduced in BKO
   islets without changes in total diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol
   lipase activity. ABHD6 deletion induced insulin secretion independently
   from KATP channels and did not alter the glucose induced rise in
   intracellular Ca-2+. Perifusion studies showed elevated insulin
   secretion during second phase of GSIS in BKO islets that was not due to
   altered cytosolic Ca2+ signaling or because of changes in glucose and
   fatty acid metabolism. Glucose increased islet saturated long chain
   1-MAG species and ABHD6 deletion caused accumulation of these 1-MAG
   species at both low and elevated glucose.
   Conclusion: ABHD6 regulates insulin secretion in response to fuel
   stimuli at large and some non-fuel stimuli by controlling long chain
   saturated 1-MAG levels that synergize with other signaling pathways for
   secretion. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH. This is an

Abstract = {{The two terminal pyridyl nitrogen atoms of 2,7-bis(4-pyridyl)fluorene
   (1) were coordinated to Pd(II) ions to give self-assembled, multilayer
   films using the layer-by-layer (LbL) method. The films were prepared by
   alternately dipping the substrate, pre-coated with a polyethyleneimine
   layer, in aqueous solutions of PdCl2 and ethanol solutions of 1. The
   resulting films were characterized using UV-visible absorption
   spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and inductively coupled
   plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). UV-visible spectra and
   SEM images show almost uniform growth of the film in a near ideal LbL
   manner. AFM images show that nanostructured aggregates of Pd(II)
   complexes form on the surface. With an increase in the number of
   Pd(II)/1 bilayers, more particulate aggregates are distributed on the
   surface. When released from the substrate, the Pd(II) complex
   nanostructure shows high catalytic activity for Suzuki-Miyaura and
   Mizoroki-Heck cross-coupling reactions. The catalyst loading is as low
   as 9.1 x 10(-3) mol\% Pd, as measured using ICP-AES, and high turnover

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Neuropathic pain, which is characterized by hyperalgesia, allodynia and
   spontaneous pain, is one of the most painful symptoms that can be
   experienced in the clinic. It often occurs as a result of injury to the
   peripheral nerves, dorsal root ganglion (DRG), spinal cord or brain. The
   renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in nociception.
   As an essential component of the RAS, the angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7)/Mas
   axis may be involved in anti-nociception. The aim of the present study
   was to explore the expression pattern of Mas in DRG neurons following
   chronic nerve injury and examine the effects of Mas inhibition and
   activation on neuropathic pain in a chronic constriction injury (CCI)
   rat model. The results showed, that compared with the sham group, CCI
   caused a time-dependent induction of Mas expression at both the mRNA and
   the protein levels in DRG neurons. Consistent with the results, isolated
   DRG neurons showed a time-dependent increase in Ang-(1-7) binding on the
   cell membrane following the CCI surgery, but not the sham surgery.
   Compared with the sham control groups, CCI significantly decreased the
   paw withdrawal latency and threshold, and this was markedly improved and
   aggravated by intrathecal injection of the selective Mas agonist
   Ang-(1-7) and the selective Mas inhibitor D-Pro7-Ang-(1-7),
   respectively. In conclusion, this study has provided the first evidence,
   to the best of our knowledge, that the Mas expression in DRG neurons is
   time-dependently induced by chronic nerve injury and that the
   intrathecal activation and inhibition of Mas can improve and aggravate
   CCI-induced neuropathic pain, respectively. This study has provided
   novel insights into the pathophysiological process of neuropathic pain
   and suggests that the Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis could be an effective
   therapeutic target for neuropathic pain, warranting further study.}},

   proteins. A total of 11,059 unigenes were identified in the Kyoto
   Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway (KEGG) database. A total of
   3891 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected in 3526 nonredundant
   unigenes, 2596 primer pairs were designed and 360 of them were randomly
   selected for validation. Of these, 268 primer pairs yielded clear
   products among six G. pentaphyllum samples. Thirty polymorphic SSR
   markers were used to test polymorphism and transferability in
   Gynostemma. Finally, 15 SSR makers that amplified in all 12 Gynostemma
   species were used to assess genetic diversity. Our results generated a
   comprehensive sequence resource for Gynostemma research.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose 2,3-Oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC), an important enzyme of
   cholesterol biosynthesis, catalyzes the highly selective cyclization of
   2,3-monoepoxysqualene to lanosterol. Intermittent hypoxia (IH) is a
   hallmark feature in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) which is increasingly
   recognized as an independent risk factor for liver injury. The aim of
   this study was to determine the effect of IH on OSC expression and
   evaluate the role of OSC in the IH-induced apoptosis in hepatic cell
   line human liver cell (HL-02).
   HL-02 cells were exposed to normoxia or IH. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8)
   assay was used to value cell proliferation, and flow cytometry was used
   to determine cell apoptosis. The expression of OSC messenger RNA (mRNA)
   was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR, and the expression of OSC
   protein was determined by Western blot. To further investigate the
   function of OSC in IH-induced apoptosis, oxidosqualene cyclase-enhanced
   green fluorescence protein (OSC-EGFP) plasmid was constructed to
   over-express OSC protein. Triglyceride content in HL-02 cells was
   analyzed by oil red staining or Triglyceride Quantification Kit.
   We found that IH inhibited HL-02 cell proliferation and accelerated cell
   apoptosis. IH decreased OSC expression, and over-expression of OSC could
   protect HL-02 cells against the IH-induced hepatic cell injury.
   Moreover, over-expression of OSC could attenuate IH-induced cellular
   triglyceride accumulation.
   These findings suggest that OSC are involved in IH-induced hepatic cell
   injury. These results may contribute to the further understanding of the
   mechanism underlying the liver injury in OSA patients.}},

Abstract = {{The retromer mediates protein trafficking through recycling cargo from
   endosomes to the trans-Golgi network in eukaryotes. However, the role of
   such trafficking events during pathogen-host interaction remains
   unclear. Here, we report that the cargo-recognition complex (MoVps35,
   MoVps26 and MoVps29) of the retromer is essential for
   appressorium-mediated host penetration by Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal
   pathogen of the blast disease in rice. Loss of retromer function blocked
   glycogen distribution and turnover of lipid bodies, delayed nuclear
   degeneration and reduced turgor during appressorial development.
   Cytological observation revealed dynamic MoVps35-GFP foci co-localized
   with autophagy-related protein RFP-MoAtg8 at the periphery of
   autolysosomes. Furthermore, RFP-MoAtg8 interacted with MoVps35-GFP in
   vivo, RFP-MoAtg8 was mislocalized to the vacuole and failed to recycle
   from the autolysosome in the absence of the retromer function, leading
   to impaired biogenesis of autophagosomes. We therefore conclude that
   retromer is essential for autophagy-dependent plant infection by the
   rice blast fungus.}},

Abstract = {{The gradual decreasing capacity of lithium-ion batteries can serve as a
   health indicator for tracking the degradation of lithium-ion batteries.
   It is important to predict the capacity of a lithium-ion battery for
   future cycles to assess its health condition and remaining useful life
   (RUL). In this paper, a novel method is developed using unscented Kalman
   filter (UKF) with relevance vector regression (RVR) and applied to RUL
   and short-term capacity prediction of batteries. A RVR model is employed
   as a nonlinear time-series prediction model to predict the UKF future
   residuals which otherwise remain zero during the prediction period.
   Taking the prediction step into account, the predictive value through
   the RVR method and the latest real residual value constitute the future
   evolution of the residuals with a time-varying weighting scheme. Next,
   the future residuals are utilized by UKF to recursively estimate the
   battery parameters for predicting RUL and short-term capacity. Finally,
   the performance of the proposed method is validated and compared to
   other predictors with the experimental data. According to the
   experimental and analysis results, the proposed approach has high
   reliability and prediction accuracy, which can be applied to battery
   monitoring and prognostics, as well as generalized to other prognostic
   applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{285-296}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a study was carried out on the velocity profile of
   sediment-laden flows in open channels using a two-phase mixture model
   for two-phase flows. The governing equations for water-sediment mixtures
   were derived based on the two-fluid equations for solid-liquid two-phase
   flows. The drift velocity, a key variable involved in the two-phase
   mixture equations, was derived from the equation of momentum
   conservation for the solid phase. The drift velocity shows that the
   inertia of flow, particle turbulence, and collisions effect contribute
   to the dispersion of the sediment particles in turbulent flows. Using
   the two-phase mixture equation, the vertical velocity profile of open
   channel flows was obtained. Further analysis indicated that the
   distribution of the velocity over depth of water-sediment mixtures,
   composed of two different phases, is significantly affected by the
   turbulence of water-sediment mixtures and the density stratification.
   However, the velocity distribution is also affected by other factors
   including collisions between particles and particle turbulence as a
   basic feature of two-phase flows where interphase interactions
   inevitably mark their influence on the velocity distribution.
   Comparisons of this approach with observations for a wide range of
   experimental conditions are presented in this paper, which show that
   this approach agrees well with the experiments. (C) 2015 International

   Indomethacin (INC) was selected as the model drug. FeMCs before and
   after INC-loading FeMCs were characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD), nitrogen sorption
   isotherms, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Release tests
   were conducted to confirm improvements in drug release kinetics. The
   experimental results showed that the mesoporous carbon spheres exhibited
   BET surface areas of 615-876 m(2)/g and pore volumes of 1.36-2.25
   cm(3)/g. INC showed an amorphous state after it was incorporated into
   the mesoporous channels of the FeMCs. Release kinetics revealed that the
   release rate of INC from FeMCs was significantly higher than that of
   pure INC. This finding may be attributed to the reduced crystallinity of
   INC in the composites. FeMCs could be exploited as an alternative
   delivery system for poorly water-soluble indomethacin. The crystallinity
   of the loaded drug and the drug release kinetics could be well
   controlled by FeMCs developed in this method.}},

Abstract = {{This study compared the relationship between chlorophyll (Chl) content,
   gas exchange, Chl fluorescence characteristics, and leaf color, using
   paired near-isogenic lines (NILs) of a medium-green leaf inbred line
   SN12 and a yellow-green leaf mutant SN62 to explore the photosynthesis
   of the yellow-green mutant. The SN62 was found in a female parent,
   Xianyu 335, which grew normally, although there were small yellow spots
   on the leaves at the seedling stage and yellow-green leaves appeared
   from the seedling to the maturation stage. The results indicated that
   Chl a (b), quantum efficiency of PSII, and maximal quantum yield of PSII
   photochemistry of SN62 were significantly lower than those of SN12, but
   there were almost no differences in the net photosynthetic rate (P (N)).
   There was no significant correlation between Chl a (b) and P (N) of
   inbred lines with different leaf colors. In the reproductive stage,
   photochemical quenching, effective quantum yield of PSII photochemistry,
   and the electron transport rate of SN62 increased obviously, and all
   parameter values exceeded the values of SN12. It explained that
   increasing the openness of the PSII reaction center was able to
   compensate for the lower Chl content, which was beneficial for
   harvesting more light energy for photochemical reactions. It also
   ensured that P (N) was not reduced.}},

Abstract = {{1. The benefits to trophobionte hemipterans are affected by the ant
   tending level, which is a widely accepted statement. The ant tending
   level is closely related to multiple factors. It is clear that the ant
   tending level can be affected by the temporal factor, age-specific, the
   density of the hemipterans, and quantity and quality of honeydew
   produced by hemipterans. 2. Few studies of ant-hemipteran mutualisms
   have reported the patterns of host plants-dependent effects, and whether
   host plants influence the ant tending level that is also unclear. As
   such, laboratory experiments were conducted to test whether the colony
   growth rate of an invasive mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley,
   parasitism of Aenasius bambawalei Hayat, an dominant parasitoid of P.
   solenopsis, are affected by tending by ghost ants (Tapinoma
   melanocephalum(Fabricius)], host plants (tomato and cotton), and
   interactions between the two factors. The difference in the ant tending
   level between the host plants was also determined. 3. The results showed
   that mealybug colony growth and parasitism were significantly affected
   by ant tending and host plant separately. There were significant
   interactions between the independent factors on the mealybug colony
   growth rate and percentage parasitism. These results suggest that
   benefits to mealybugs are host plant-dependent.}},

Abstract = {{The light absorption of polysilicon planar junctions can be improved
   using nanostructured top surfaces due to their enhanced light harvesting
   properties. Nevertheless, associated with the higher surface, the
   roughness caused by plasma etching and defects located at the grain
   boundary in polysilicon, the concentration of the recombination centers
   increases, leading to electrical performance deterioration. In this
   work, we demonstrate that wet oxidation combined with hydrogen
   passivation using SiNx:H are the key technological processes to
   significantly decrease the surface recombination and improve the
   electrical properties of nanostructured n(+)-i-p junctions.
   Nanostructured surface is fabricated by nanosphere lithography in a
   low-cost and controllable approach. Furthermore, it has been
   demonstrated that the successive annealing of silicon nitride films has
   significant effect on the passivation quality, resulting in some
   improvements on the efficiency of the Si nanostructure-based solar cell
   device.}},

Number = {{9-12}},
Pages = {{1447-1462}},

Abstract = {{As an essential element in the overall process planning of a part,
   process planning of part features plays an important role in machining
   quality and productivity. Through the analysis for disadvantages of the
   previous methods based on rule (knowledge) base or back-propagation
   neural network (BPNN), a novel process planning methodology of part
   features is proposed on the basis of the integration between granular
   computing (GrC) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN).
   Firstly, the similarity between training samples under the input vectors
   is calculated according to the weighted Euclidean distances. Secondly,
   in accordance with the theory of fuzzy tolerance quotient space, which
   is one of the theoretical models of GrC, granulation of the training
   samples is fulfilled, and a series of process information granular
   layers with different granularity composed of the different number of
   process information granules are constructed. Afterwards, depending on
   the divisions of training samples under the desired output vectors,
   Shannon information entropy algorithm is used to measure the granularity
   of a succession of granular layers, by which an optimal process
   information granular layer is determined. Finally, in terms of the
   number and distribution of the process information granules in the
   optimal granular layer, two crucial parameters of the hidden layer in
   RBFNN including the number of Gaussian functions and the corresponding
   centers are reasonably determined. An application example of hole
   feature demonstrates that RBFNN is superior to BPNN in the convergence
   speed, training accuracy as well as generalization ability, and
   meanwhile the proposed GrC-RBFNN is capable of planning more exact
   process routes of part features than RBFNN without increasing its scale
   and complexity.}},

Abstract = {{The evaluation of permeability in reservoir assessment is a complex
   problem. Thus, it is difficult to perform direct evaluation permeability
   with conventional well-logging methods. Considering that reservoir
   permeability significantly affects mud invasion during drilling, we
   derive a mathematical model to assess the reservoir permeability based
   on mud invasion. A numerical model is first used to simulate the process
   of mud invasion and mud cake growth. Then, based on Darcy's law, an
   approximation is derived to associate the depth of mud invasion with
   reservoir permeability. A mathematical model is constructed to evaluate
   the reservoir permeability as a function of the mud invasion depth in
   time-lapse logging. Sensitivity analyses of the reservoir porosity,
   permeability, and water saturation are performed, and the results
   suggest that the proposed model and method are well suited for oil
   layers or oil-water layers of low porosity and low permeability.
   Numerical simulations using field logging and coring data suggest that
   the evaluated and assumed permeability data agree, validating the
   proposed model and method.}},

Abstract = {{Controllable growth of anatase TiO2 with dominant high reactive crystal
   facets has attracted intense interest in the past few years due to their
   unique structure-dependent properties. In this work, SrTiO3/TiO2
   heterostructure nanotubes (SrT) arrays films with high reactive dominant
   (001) facets of anatase TiO2 were successfully prepared through the part
   conversion of TiO2 by a hydrothermal method. Various characterizations
   were used to investigate the morphologies, crystal phases and chemical
   compositions of the prepared samples. Structure analyses using X-ray
   diffraction and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope
   revealed that, the treatment sequence of hydrothermal reaction and
   annealing was a crucial influence factor on controlling the growth of
   preferred orientation of (001) facets of TiO2 in SrTiO3/TiO2
   heterojunction, whereas the inverse treatment sequence yielded randomly
   oriented facets. The formation mechanism of dominant (001) facets of
   TiO2 in the heterojunction was related to crystal structures of TiO2 and
   SrTiO3. The heteroepitaxial growth on (001) plane of SrTiO3 led to
   dominant (001) facets of anatase TiO2 attributing to their excellent
   surface lattices match. The photoelectric performances of pure TiO2
   nanotubes and SrT were investigated by photoluminescence, UV-visible
   diffuse reflectance, photocurrent and current-voltage response. The
   semiconductor characteristics of them were studied by electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy and Mott-Schottky analysis in detail. The results
   demonstrated that the heterostructure of Sri not only increased light
   absorption, but also effectively shifted the Fermi level and promoted
   charge transfer. Among all the samples, the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterojunction

Title = {{Physical Therapy in Wound Care A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis}},
Journal = {{MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{49}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Management of chronic wounds remains unsatisfactory in terms of
   treatment cost and time required for complete wound closure (CWC).This
   study aimed to calculate the healing rates, estimated cost, and time
   required for CWC in wounds; compare estimated wound care costs between
   healing and nonhealing wounds; and compare cost effectiveness between
   venous leg ulcer (VLU) and non-VLU.This was a retrospective cohort study
   performed at a physical therapy (PT) wound care clinic. Deidentified
   patient data in the electronic medical database from September 10, 2012
   to January 23, 2015 were extracted.Among 159 included patients with
   wounds, 119 (74.84\%) patients were healed with CWC. The included
   patients were treated for 109.7095.70 days, 29.7125.66 visits, and at
   the costs per treatment episode of \$1629.65 +/- 1378.82 per
   reimbursement rate and \$2711.42 +/- 2356.81 per breakeven rate. For
   patients with CWC (healing group), the treatment duration was 98.01 +/-
   76.12 days with the time for CWC as 72.45 +/- 64.21 days; the cost per
   treatment episode was \$1327.24 +/- 1143.53 for reimbursement rate and
   \$2492.58 +/- 2106.88 for breakeven cost. For patients with nonhealing
   wounds, treatment duration was found to be longer with costs
   significantly higher (P<0.01 for all). In the healing group, no
   differences were found between VLU and non-VLU in treatment duration
   (95.46 days vs. 100.88 days, P=0.698), time for CWC (68.06 days vs.
   77.38 days, P=0.431), and cost (\$2756.78 vs. 2397.84 for breakeven
   rate, P=0.640) with the exception of wound dressing costs (\$329.19 vs.
   146.47, P=0.001).Healing rates may be affected with patient exclusions.
   Costs at physicians' offices were not included.Incorporation of PT in
   wound care appeared to be cost effective. PT may thus be a good referral
   option for patients with wounds. However, the results should be
   interpreted cautiously and further studies are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{To isolate functional nucleic acids that bind to defined targets with
   high affinity and specificity, which are known as aptarners, the
   systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX)
   methodology has emerged as the preferred approach. Here, we propose a
   computational approach, SELEX in silico, that allows the sequence space
   to be more thoroughly explored regarding binding of a certain target.
   Our approach consists of two steps: (i) secondary structure-based
   sequence screening, which aims to collect the sequences that can form a
   desired RNA motif as an enhanced initial library, followed by (ii)
   sequence enrichment regarding target binding by molecular dynamics
   simulation-based virtual screening. Our SELEX in silico method provided
   a practical computational solution to three key problems in aptamer
   sequence searching: design of nucleic acid libraries, knowledge of
   sequence enrichment, and identification of potent aptamers. Six potent
   theophylline-binding aptamers, which were isolated by SELEX in silico
   from a sequence space containing 4(13) sequences, were experimentally
   verified to bind theophylline with high affinity: K-d ranging from 0.16
   to 0.52 mu M, compared with the dissociation constant of the original
   aptamer-theophylline, 0.32 mu M. These results demonstrate the
   significant potential of SELEX in silico as a new method for aptamer
   discovery and optimization.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of vertical wind shear on the sensitivity of tropical
   cyclogenesis to environmental rotation and thermodynamic state is
   investigated through idealized cloud-resolving simulations of the
   intensification of an incipient vortex. With vertical shear, tropical
   cyclones intensify faster with a higher Coriolis parameter, f,
   irrespective of the environmental thermodynamic state. The vertical
   shear develops a vertically tilted vortex, which undergoes a precession
   process with the midlevel vortices rotating cyclonically around the
   surface center. With a higher f, the midlevel vortices are able to
   rotate continuously against the vertical shear, leading to the
   realignment of the tilted vortex and rapid intensification. With a lower
   f, the rotation is too slow such that the midlevel vortices are advected
   away from the surface center and the intensification is suppressed. The
   parameter, (b), measuring the effect from the low-entropy downdraft air
   on the boundary layer entropy, is found to be a good indicator of the
   environmental thermodynamic favorability for tropical cyclogenesis in
   vertical shear. Without vertical shear, tropical cyclones are found to
   intensify faster with a lower f by previous studies. We show this
   dependency on f is sensitive to the environmental thermodynamic state.
   The thermodynamical favorability for convection can be measured by (m),
   which estimates the time it takes for surface fluxes to moisten the
   midtroposphere. A smaller (m) not only leads to a faster intensification
   due to a shorter period for moist preconditioning of the inner region
   but also neutralizes the faster intensification with a lower f due to
   enhanced peripheral convection.}},

Abstract = {{Deep-sea hydrothermal vent shrimp Rimicaris exoculata is a dominant
   species aggregating in vent fields along the Mid-Atlantic Ocean Ridge.
   MicroRNAs play important roles in life cycles of eukaryotes. However,
   little is known about miRNAs of vent animals. In the present study, a
   small RNA cDNA library from the muscle of R. exoculata was constructed
   and the miRNA sequencing was performed. The results indicated that a
   total of 7,983,331 raw reads were obtained, representing 569,354 unique
   sequences. Based on sequence analysis, R. exoculata contained 159
   conserved miRNAs and 34 novel miRNAs. The conserved miRNAs included 54
   families belonging to three different taxonomic units (bilaterian,
   protostomes and arthropods). The results also showed that miR-2001, a
   lost miRNA in crustaceans, existed in R. exoculata. Among the conserved
   miRNAs, iso-miRs were detected. Therefore, this study presented the
   first insight into the miRNAs of deep-sea hydrothermal vent animals. (c)

   nanocomposites occurs slowly exceeding 180 degrees C. PMSEPE/Q(8)M(8)(H)
   nanocomposites can be cured at temperatures less than 260 degrees C and

   The thermal and thermooxidative stabilities of PMSEPE/Q(8)M(8)(H)

Abstract = {{Traffic volume measurement is critical in vehicular networks. Existing
   research on traffic volume measurement mainly focuses on single-point
   traffic statistics. In this paper, we switch our view from single-point
   to multi-point and study the important problem of privacy-preserving
   multi-point traffic volume measurement in vehicular cyber-physical
   systems (VCPSs), which complements the state of the art. While embracing
   automatic traffic data collection, which the VCPS provides through
   vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, we also need to accept the
   accompanying challenges: First, the privacy of all participating
   vehicles should be preserved as an inherent requirement of a VCPS;
   second, the measurement scheme should be efficient enough to fit today's
   large-scale vehicular networks. In this paper, we start from a novel
   scheme that measures traffic volume between two arbitrary points
   (locations) through variable-length bit array masking. Then, we extend
   the idea of variable-length bit array masking to address the more
   challenging problem of three-point traffic measurement and present a
   general framework to measure traffic among three or more locations. We
   also perform extensive simulations to demonstrate the superior
   performance, applicability, and scalability of our schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The partial inclusion complexes (ICs) between poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA)
   with high molecular weight and beta-cyclodextrin (CD) were prepared and
   characterized by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (H-1 NMR), X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarizing optical microscopy (POM),
   respectively. The thermal results demonstrated that the crystallization
   performance of ICs were significantly improved, and the decomposition
   temperature of ICs were increased compared with PLLA. The mechanical
   tests indicated that the mechanical performance of ICs was improved, and
   the beta-CD-PLLA ICs exhibited a higher non-Newtonian effect than PLLA.
   The degradation rate for the partial ICs in phosphate buffer solution
   accelerated as the ratio of beta-CD increased, meanwhile, the partial
   ICs had a good shape memory behavior. The wetting measurements suggested
   the hydrophilicity of ICs was also enhanced markedly in comparison with
   the bulk PLLA.}},

Title = {{Hidden Behavior Prediction of Complex Systems Under Testing Influence
   Based on Semiquantitative Information and Belief Rule Base}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2371-2386}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Compared with the observable behavior, it is difficult to predict the
   hidden behavior of a complex system. In the existing methods for
   predicting the hidden behavior, a lot of testing data (usually
   quantitative information) are needed to be sampled. However, some
   complex engineering systems have the following characteristics: 1) The
   systems cannot be tested periodically, and the observable information is
   incomplete; 2) the change process of hidden behavior may be affected by
   the test; and 3) only part of quantitative information and qualitative
   knowledge (i.e., semi-quantitative information) may be obtained. These
   characteristics all related to the test are named as testing influence
   for simplicity. Although a model and a corresponding optimal algorithm
   for training the model parameters have been proposed to predict the
   hidden behavior on the basis of semiquantitative information and belief
   rule base (BRB), the testing influence has not been considered. In order
   to solve the above problems, a new BRB-based model, which can use the
   semiquantitative information, is proposed under testing influence in
   this paper. In the newly proposed forecasting model, there are some
   parameters of which the initial values are usually assigned by experts
   and may not be accurate, which can lead to the inaccurate prediction
   results. As such, an improved optimal algorithm for training the
   parameters of the forecasting model is further developed on the basis of
   the expectation-maximization idea and the covariance matrix adaption
   evolution strategy (CMA-ES). By using the semiquantitative information,
   the proposed BRB-based model and the improved CMA-ES algorithm can
   operate together in an integrated manner so as to improve the
   forecasting precision. A case study is examined to demonstrate the
   ability and applicability of the newly proposed BRB-based forecasting
   model and the improved CMA-ES algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{CaMoO4: Eu3+ and CaMoO4: Eu3+, A(+) (A = Li, Na, K) phosphors for
   light-emitting diode ( LED) applications have been prepared by microwave
   sintering method (MSM), and their structure and luminescence properties
   are investigated. The influences of microwave reaction time and
   concentration of different kinds of charge compensation A(+) and Eu3+ on
   luminescence have also been discussed. The samples emit a red
   luminescence at 615 nm attributed to the D-5(0)-> F-7(2) transition of
   Eu3+ under 464 nm excitation. It is observed that adding charge
   compensation A(+) in the sample synthesis increases luminescence
   intensity. The optimized sample made with 32 mol\% Li+ and 32 mol\% Eu3+
   has an enhancement factor of 4 in photoluminescence compared to the
   sample made without charge compensation. The CIE (Commission
   Internationale de l'Eclairage) coordinates of Ca0.36MoO4: 0.32Eu(3+),
   0.32Li(+) are x = 0.661 and y = 0.339, which indicate that the obtained
   phosphor can be a promising red color candidate for white LED

Title = {{Non-traditional stable isotope behaviors in immiscible silica-melts in a
   mafic magma chamber}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Non-traditional stable isotopes have increasingly been applied to
   studies of igneous processes including planetary differentiation.
   Equilibrium isotope fractionation of these elements in silicates is
   expected to be negligible at magmatic temperatures (delta Fe-57
   difference often less than 0.2 per mil). However, an increasing number
   of data has revealed a puzzling observation, e.g., the delta Fe-57 for
   silicic magmas ranges from 0\% up to 0.6\%, with the most positive delta
   Fe-57 almost exclusively found in A-type granitoids. Several
   interpretations have been proposed by different research groups, but
   these have so far failed to explain some aspects of the observations.
   Here we propose a dynamic, diffusion-induced isotope fractionation model
   that assumes Si-melts are growing and ascending immiscibly in a Fe-rich
   bulk magma chamber. Our model offers predictions on the behavior of
   non-traditional stable isotope such as Fe, Mg, Si, and Li that are
   consistent with observations from many A-type granitoids, especially
   those associated with layered intrusions. Diffusion-induced isotope
   fractionation may be more commonly preserved in magmatic rocks than was
   originally predicted.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudohypohyperparathyroidism (PHHP) is a rare type of

   hereditary osteodystrophy can occasionally be found in patients with
   PHHP, but these features are also common in Turner syndrome. The authors
   report on an extremely rare case of a patient with PHHP and Turner
   syndrome, a 47-year-old woman who sought medical attention for
   hypocalcemia and elevated parathyroid hormone. She had no family history
   of hypocalcemia and no STX16 gene deletions. She had a mosaic karyotype
   of 46, X, del(X)(p11.4)/45, XO. Pyrosequencing was performed to
   determine the GNAS exon 1A methylation. The degree of methylation found

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of structural factor and amide grafted
   multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs-NH2) on crushing characteristics of
   filament wound CFRP tube under quasi-static compression conditon. It was
   found that CFRP tubes sequentially showed the brittle fracturing mode,
   the local buckling fracturing mode and transverse shearing fracturing
   mode with increasing winding angle, respectively, with the
   characterizations by mechanical testing, SEM and optical microscopy.
   Moreover, crack propagation initiated by pre-crack and subsequent
   failure in the tube were strongly dependent on pre-crack angle due to
   deflection and penetration competition of crack evolution. The simulated
   compression failure behavior correlated well with the experimental
   results, revealing that the Chang-Chang failure criterion was effective
   in representing the quasistatic crushing characteristics of the tube. In
   addtion, the MWNTs-NH2 were sucessfully obtained by multi-step
   functionization. The compressvie properties of the tubes were
   significantly improved by the addition of the MWNTs-NH2 due to their
   uniform dispersion and high interfacial chemical reactivity, whereas the
   as-received MWNTs and other functionalized MWNTs were not as effective.}},

Abstract = {{This work studies the permeability of power-law fluids in porous fibrous
   media with electrokinetic effects. By solving the linearized
   Poisson-Boltzmann and Navier-Stokes equations, we get the analytical
   solutions of pressure driven flow of power-law fluids in a
   microcapillary with electric double layer (EDL). The flow rate in a
   single capillary, combining with the fractal model of pore distribution
   of fractures in naturally fractured porous media, deduces the total flow
   rate. Then the analytical result of effective permeability for power-law
   fluids with EDL effects is derived as a function of the porosity, the
   flow behavior index and a dimensionless number derived from the solid
   surface zeta potential and maximum pore radius. The present results show
   that the EDL effects as well as other variable parameters may greatly
   influence the effective permeability of the power-law fluids in porous
   fibrous media: the larger the porosity, the higher the effective
   permeability; the larger the maximum pore radius, the higher the
   effective permeability; the higher the solid surface zeta potential, the
   more the EDL effects; the more the EDL effects, the lower the effective
   permeability. Comparing the effective permeability produced by different
   flow behavior indexes, we further illustrate that the EDL has virtually
   no effects when the flow behavior index is great than 1, moderate
   effects when equal to 1, and very significant effects when less than 1.
   Therefore the EDL effects may provide strong constraints on evaluation
   of the effective permeability of the shear thinning fluids rather than
   the shear thickening and Newtonian fluids. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Thin-film solar thermoelectric generators show much promise in effective
   use of solar energy as a power supply for microscale devices. In this
   paper, we fabricated a flexible thin-film solar thermoelectric generator
   on the polyimide substrate using simple mask-assisted deposition
   process. The p-type Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 and n-type Bi2Te2.7Se0.3
   thermoelectric films with special hierarchical nanostructure were
   prepared, resulting in substantial improvement in the electrical
   conductivity. The solar thermoelectric generator with the hierarchical
   Bi-Te thin films is able to generate 220 mV of the output voltage and 80
   mu W of the maximum power for a temperature difference of 100 K. We also
   analyzed the optimized design for the solar thermoelectric generator. By
   employing a package for the thermoelectric legs and a perforated
   structure, the heat flow was restricted along the thermoelectric legs
   and a larger temperature difference was achieved. A fast electrical
   response to the on-off simulated solar light irradiation was also
   observed, indicating light sensing feature of the fabricated thin-film
   solar thermoelectric generator. Our results revealed that a remarkably
   enhanced output power has been achieved in the flexible thin-film solar
   thermoelectric generator due to the introduction of the improved
   thermoelectric films and the optimized thermal design. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In her article ``Ethical Transformations in Yan's. (The Criminal Lu
   Yanshi){''} Weihong Zhu uses ethical literary criticism to explain the
   reason for the change in attitude which the novel's hero undergoes. Zhu
   argues that in Geling Yan's novel the turning point lies in the
   protagonist's realization of his inner ``animal{''} factor. Subjected to
   severe tests by the extreme circumstances in a northwest prison in
   China, this realization helps him transform from a proud man to a humble
   human being, so that he learns to love his family. Although set in a
   grand historical background of important political events, Yan's novel
   The Criminal Lu Yanshi is not political. Disguised under a romantic
   story there is a serious inquiry into the nature of humanity.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate whether supplementing manganese (Mn) to the maternal diet
   could reduce the deleterious effect of heat stress on the developing
   embryo, the hatchability, antioxidant status, and expression of heat
   shock proteins (HSP) were evaluated in chick embryos under normal and
   high incubation temperatures. A completely randomized design (n = 6)
   with 2 maternal dietary Mn treatments (unsupplemented control basal diet
   versus the basal diet + 120 mg Mn/kg as inorganic Mn) x 2 incubation
   temperatures (normal, 37.8 degrees C, versus high, 39.0 degrees C) was
   used. High incubation temperature did not affect (P > 0.19) hatchability
   and embryo mortality and development but did increase (P < 0.05)
   activities of heart manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and liver
   copper zinc superoxide dismutase and liver MnSOD mRNA and protein levels
   in embryos. High incubation temperature also decreased (P < 0.003) HSP70
   protein level in the heart but had no effects (P > 0.07) in the liver of
   embryos. Maternal diet with Mn supplementation not only increased (P <
   0.05) the hatchability and Mn content (P < 0.001) in the yolk and
   embryonic tissues and the activity of MnSOD in the heart (P < 0.004) as
   well as relative liver weight (P < 0.05) under normal incubation
   temperature but also decreased (P = 0.05) embryo mortality and HSP90
   mRNA level in the liver and heart of embryos. Furthermore, under high
   incubation temperature, maternal diet Mn supplementation increased (P <
   0.002) MnSOD protein expression in the liver of embryos but had no
   effect (P > 0.43) under normal incubation temperature. These results
   indicated that high incubation temperature induced self-protective
   responses of chick embryos with a modification of antioxidant status and
   a depression of HSP70 protein level. Maternal dietary supplementation of
   Mn could improve the hatchability as well as antioxidant ability to
   protect against heat challenge in embryos during incubation.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional braided carbon fiber-reinforced ZrC matrix composites,
   3-D C-f/ZrC, were fabricated by Liquid metal infiltration process at
   1200 degrees C. Porous carbon/carbon (C-f/C) composites with various
   densities were used as preforms, and the effects of C-f/C density on
   microstructure and properties of the 3-D C-f/ZrC composites were
   investigated. The results show that the composites are composed of
   carbon, ZrC and residual metal. Both microstructure and properties of
   the 3-D C-f/ZrC composites are apparently affected by C-f/C density.
   With increasing density of C-f/C preform, the density of 3-D Cf/ZrC
   composites decreases while the open porosity increases. The composites
   obtained from the C-f/C preform with a density of 1.12 g/cm(3) have the

   biennis in aerobic oxidations of adamantane as a model hydrocarbon. With
   isopropanol as a co-solvent, the oxidation was accelerated significantly

   preparative yield from the oxidation of adamantane by D. albidofuscus.
   The CH-positional selectivity (3 degrees/2 degrees =3.6) and the

Abstract = {{Infrared drying of thin-layer quince slices as thick as 5 +/- 0.24 mm
   was investigated at four levels of radiation power which was regulated
   to attain final temperatures of 50, 60, 70 and 80 degrees C. The
   temperature evolution of samples revealed the different stages of
   drying. The drying rate curves showed that the entire drying process
   took place in the falling rate period, except for about 7\% of initial
   drying time when the drying rate increased while the slice center
   temperature curves showed a small constant rate period. The rehydration
   ratio curves of the dried samples showed a rise in the final temperature
   of the samples which enhanced their rehydrability. Ten well-known
   thin-layer models were used to predict drying kinetics by nonlinear
   analysis of regression. The Midilli model best fitted the experimental
   data for the whole range of temperatures. The moisture diffusivity
   coefficient at each temperature was determined by Fick's second law of
   diffusion, in which their value varied from 1.02436 x 10(-9) to 2.92514
   x 10(-9) m(2)/s over the mentioned temperature range. The dependence of
   effective diffusivity coefficient on temperature was expressed by an
   Arrhenius type equation. The calculated value of the activation energy
   of moisture diffusion was 33.25 kJ/mol.}},

Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel method for simultaneous 3-D trajectory
   tracking and lower body motion capture (MoCap) under various dynamic
   activities such as walking and jumping. The proposed method uses
   wearable inertial sensors fused with an ultrawideband localization
   system using a cascaded Kalman filter-based sensor fusion algorithm,
   which consists of a separate orientation filter cascaded with a
   position/velocity filter. In addition, to further improve the joint
   angle tracking accuracy, anatomical constraints are applied to the knee
   joint. Currently, available self-contained inertial tracking methods are
   not only drift-prone over time but also their accuracy is degraded under
   fast movements with unstable ground contact states due to the lack of
   external references. However, our experimental results, which benchmark
   the system against a reference camera-based motion tracking system, show
   that the proposed fusion method can accurately capture the dynamic
   activities of a subject without drift. The results show that the
   proposed system can maintain similar accuracies between fast and slow
   motions in lower body MoCap and 3-D trajectory tracking. The obtained
   accuracies of the system for 3-D body localization and knee joint angle
   tracking for fast motions were less than 5 cm and 2.1 degrees,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aim: A possible predictive impact of ribonucleotide-reductase
   subunit-1 (RRM1) on vinorelbine efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer
   (NSCLC) has been previously reported. The present study aimed to further
   explore this finding in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Materials
   and Methods: Seventy-one patients with MPM receiving first-line
   chemotherapy with cisplatin-vinorelbine (CiV group, n=54) or
   carboplatin-pemetrexed (CaP group, n=17) were included. Formalin-fixed
   paraffin-embedded tumor specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemistry
   (IHC) for RRM1 expression using an H-score. Results: In 66 patients
   eligible for IHC, the H-score was >= upper quartile in 21
   (RRM1-positive) and <upper quartile (RRM1-negative) in 45 cases. The
   long-term (2-year) survival rate for patients with RRM1-negative MPM in
   the CiV-treated group was significantly superior to that for patients
   with RRM1-positive MPM (47\% versus 13\%, p=0.002). No difference
   occurred in the CaP-treated group. Conclusion: Our findings suggest a
   possible role of RRM1 in predicting efficacy of cisplatin-vinorelbine in
   MPM, supporting previous findings in NSCLC.}},

Title = {{In-site characterization of bed fluidity in a large gas-solid fluidized
   bed via electric conductance method}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{286}},
Pages = {{697-705}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In various industrial applications in which a liquid is sprayed into a
   gas-fluidized bed such as Fluid Cokers (TM), fluid catalytic crackers
   and gas-phase polymerization reactors, parts of the bed or even the
   complete bed might become defluidized due to high liquid loading,
   agglomeration or sintering of particles. For instance, in Fluid Cokers,
   operating at lower temperatures increases the yield of liquid products
   and reduces sulphur emissions, but local defluidization may result in
   some bed regions with a disastrous impact on reactor operation. This
   loss of bed fluidity is called ``bogging{''}.
   This study examines a novel method employing electrical conductance to
   detect local bogging in a large scale pilot fluid bed of about 7 tonnes
   of silica sand. Bogging is induced by increasing the liquid load as well
   as by changing the atomization performance of a spray nozzle. Several
   other experimental methods, such as differential and static pressure
   measurements, image processing, and temperature measurements are
   evaluated.
   When liquid is injected into a fluidized bed, a fraction forms liquid
   solid agglomerates while the remainder forms free moisture, consisting
   of individual particles coated with a thin layer of liquid. Liquid
   present as free moisture can be beneficial as it increases the mass and
   heat transfer processes and increases yields of valuable products. The
   results indicated that conductance measurements could be used for
   detecting bogging phenomena online. Bogging is shown to be directly
   associated with the local free moisture rather than the total moisture
   level. Increasing the atomization gas flowrate and, consequently, the
   free moisture, increases the bogging risk. A measurable critical, local
   free moisture value above which localized bogging occurs is identified.

Abstract = {{Tensor networks, and in particular Projected Entangled Pair States
   (PEPS), are a powerful tool for the study of quantum many body physics,
   thanks to both their built-in ability of classifying and studying
   symmetries, and the efficient numerical calculations they allow. In this
   work, we introduce a way to extend the set of symmetric PEPS in order to
   include local gauge invariance and investigate lattice gauge theories
   with fermionic matter. To this purpose, we provide as a case study and
   first example, the construction of a fermionic PEPS, based on Gaussian
   schemes, invariant under both global and local U(1) gauge
   transformations. The obtained states correspond to a truncated U(1)
   lattice gauge theory in 2 + 1 dimensions, involving both the gauge field
   and fermionic matter. For the global symmetry (pure fermionic) case,
   these PEPS can be studied in terms of spinless fermions subject to a
   p-wave superconducting pairing. For the local symmetry (fermions and
   gauge fields) case, we find confined and deconfined phases in the pure
   gauge limit, and we discuss the screening properties of the phases
   arising in the presence of dynamical matter. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{In the summer of 2010, thermal damages to birch in cultures reached
   4.2-4.8 points according to the authors' five-point scale. In 2011, the
   stands of birch trees were weakened to variable degrees, but some
   healthy stands remained. High-density forest massifs and birch forest
   belts are more drought-resistant. The grass cover is weakly developed
   therein. Thinned birch cultures become overgrown with herbs and die out
   after droughts. The root exudates of shrubs depress the intensity of
   photosynthesis of steppe plants by 10-25\%. In vegetation experiments,
   various species of shrubs stimulate or slow down the growth of shoots
   and roots and the intensity of photosynthesis of the birch by 10-30\%,
   on average. It is recommended to cultivate birch trees in forest belts
   using shrubby borders with high allelopathic activity for biological
   defense of the soil from overgrowth with weedy and steppe plants.}},

Abstract = {{Arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) is an autosomal recessive connective
   tissue disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A10, which
   encodes facilitative glucose transporter 10 (GLUT10). The role of GLUT10
   in ATS pathogenesis remains an enigma, and the transported
   metabolite(s), i.e. glucose and/or dehydroascorbic acid, have not been
   clearly elucidated. To discern the molecular mechanisms underlying the
   ATS aetiology, we performed gene expression profiling and biochemical
   studies on skin fibroblasts. Transcriptome analyses revealed the
   dysregulation of several genes involved in TGF beta signalling and
   extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis as well as the perturbation of
   specific pathways that control both the cell energy balance and the
   oxidative stress response. Biochemical and functional studies showed a
   marked increase in ROS-induced lipid peroxidation sustained by altered
   PPAR. function, which contributes to the redox imbalance and the
   compensatory antioxidant activity of ALDH1A1. ATS fibroblasts also
   showed activation of a non-canonical TGF beta signalling due to TGFBRI
   disorganization, the upregulation of TGFBRII and connective tissue
   growth factor, and the activation of the alpha nu beta 3 integrin
   transduction pathway, which involves p125FAK, p60Src and p38 MAPK.
   Stable GLUT10 expression in patients' fibroblasts normalized redox
   homeostasis and PPAR gamma activity, rescued canonical TGF beta
   signalling and induced partial ECM re-organization. These data add new
   insights into the ATS dysregulated biological pathways and definition of
   the pathomechanisms involved in this disorder.}},

Abstract = {{This study, based on attribution theory, provides empirical evidence for
   how environmental violation events (EVEs) damage corporate reputation,
   using media reputation as a proxy. Hypotheses are developed to address
   the influences of violating firms' past environmental behaviors and
   ownership on the reputational effect of EVEs. The results show that
   firms with a history of unfavorable behaviors (precedent environmental
   violation) are deemed by the media to be more culpable for adverse
   environmental events and consequently suffer more damage to their
   reputation, while for firms with a favorable environmental record
   (environmental awards and honors gained) the reputational harm of an EVE
   is alleviated to some extent. EVEs cause more reputational damage to
   foreign-owned enterprises than to domestic-owned firms. These findings
   reveal that certain company behaviors could exert an indirect effect on
   a firm's reputation by influencing public perception of later relevant
   behaviors, and imply a discriminatory treatment in a host country for
   foreign-owned enterprises. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd

Abstract = {{In order to analyzing the uncertainty in accident reconstruction, based
   on the theory of extreme value and the convex model theory, the
   uncertainty analysis problem is turn to an extreme value problem. In
   order to calculate the range of the dependent variable, the extreme
   value in the definition domain and on the boundary of the definition
   domain are calculated independently, and then the upper and lower bound
   of the dependent variable can be given by these obtained extreme values.
   Based on such idea and through analyzing five numerical cases, a simple
   algorithm for calculating the range of an accident reconstruction result
   was given; appropriate results can be obtained through the proposed
   algorithm in these cases. Finally, a real world vehicle-motorcycle
   accident was given, the range of the reconstructed velocity of the
   vehicle was calculated by employing the Pc-Crash, the response surface
   methodology and the new proposed algorithm, the range was {[}66.1-67.3]

Abstract = {{Homocysteine (Hcy) is an important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Caudate nucleus (CN), the
   largest nucleus in the brain, is also implicated in many neurological
   disorders. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), the most abundant endogenous
   cannabinoid, has been shown to exhibit neuroprotective effects from many
   stimuli in the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, it has been
   reported that voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are the common
   targets of many neuronal damages and drugs. However, it is still not
   clear whether VGSCs are involved in the neurotoxicity of Hcy and the
   neuroprotective effect of 2-AG in CN neurons. In the present study,
   whole-cell patch clamp recording was used to invest the action of Hcy on
   sodium currents in primary cultured rat CN neurons and its modulation by
   2-AG. The results showed that in cultured CN neurons, pathological
   concentration of Hcy (100 mu M) significantly increased the
   voltage-gated sodium currents (I (Na)) and produced a hyperpolarizing
   shift in the activation-voltage curve of I (Na). The further data
   demonstrated 2-AG is capable of suppressing elevation of Hcy-induced
   increase in I (Na) and hyperpolarizing shift of activation curves most
   partly through CB1 receptor-dependent way. Our study provides a better
   understanding of Hcy-associated neurological disorders and suggests the
   therapeutic potential for 2-AG for the treatment of these diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Aims To investigate the influence of non-cardiac comorbidities on
   outcomes of patients enrolled in the German transcatheter mitral valve
   interventions (TRAMI) registry.
   Methods and resultsIntrahospital and 30-day MACCE rates (death of all
   causes, stroke and myocardial infarction) of 828 patients from the TRAMI
   registry were stratified by the number of non-cardiac comorbidities. The
   following non-cardiac comorbidities were prospectively recorded in the
   registry: diabetes, renal insufficiency, extracardiac arteriopathy,
   chronic lung disease, neurological disease or malignancy on palliative
   care. The 375 (45.3 \%) patients with multiple (a parts per thousand
   yen2) non-cardiac comorbidities presented with higher NYHA classes,
   higher logistic Euroscores, higher levels of NT-proBNP and a shorter
   6-min walk distance. Rates of intraprocedural death (0.3 vs. 0.0 \%, p =
   0.41) and intrahospital MACCE (3.6 vs. 1.9 \%, p = 0.16) were not
   significantly higher in patients with multiple non-cardiac
   comorbidities, but 30-day MACCE rate was significantly enhanced (6.4 vs.
   3.6 \%, p = 0.049). However, both patient groups showed a similar
   clinical improvement after 30 days. Renal insufficiency was the only
   non-cardiac comorbidity which was independently associated with the
   30-day MACCE rate.
   ConclusionsMitraClip device placement is feasible and safe in patients
   with multiple non-cardiac comorbidities resulting in a significant
   clinical improvement and acceptable intrahospital and 30-day event
   rates. Renal failure is an independent predictor of outcome.}},

Abstract = {{As promising candidates for next-generation energy storage devices,
   aqueous rechargeable batteries are safer and cheaper than organic Li ion
   batteries. But due to the narrow voltage window of aqueous electrolytes,
   proper anode materials with low redox potential and high capacity are
   quite rare. In this work, bismuth electrode film was directly grown by a
   facile hydrothermal route and tested in LiOH, NaOH and KOH electrolytes.
   With low redox potential (reduction/oxidation potentials at ca.
   -0.85/-0.52 V vs. SCE, respectively) and high specific capacity (170
   mAh.g(-1) at current density of 0.5 A.g(-1) in KOH electrolyte), Bi was
   demonstrated as a suitable anode material for aqueous batteries.
   Furthermore, by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis,
   we found that with smaller R-s and faster ion diffusion coefficient, Bi
   electrode film in KOH electrolyte exhibited better electrochemical
   performance than in LiOH and NaOH electrolytes.}},

Abstract = {{Dear Climate is a project with many incarnations. Comprised of 68
   posters and six audio works to date, the work is designed to flex its
   nimble agitation/meditation muscles in a variety of urban and urbane
   formats. We prefer the abject, provocative, strange and lonely: a
   windswept street; a drift of papers, layers of peeling posters;
   headphones dangling from inside the janitor's closet. Dear Climate might
   find its way into an alleyway or a gallery, as a graffiti-walled
   midnight wheat-paste operation, or as a mysterious alien listening pod
   floating in a city park pond. It could be dropped from an airplane, or
   it might appear disguised as an outhouse adjacent to a museum gallery.
   The posters can be printed from your computer, hung up in your workplace
   cafeteria or school lunchroom, sheet-mulched into your neighborhood
   carbon capturing food forest or slipped into the magazine rack at a
   freeway filling station. The podcasts that are also part of the online
   Dear Climate project may be used for group meditations at weddings,

Abstract = {{In West Africa, tree preferences of wintering migratory birds (and
   African residents) were quantified in order to assess the importance of
   wintering conditions on distribution, abundance and trends of
   insectivorous woodland birds. This study encompassed 2000 plots between
   10-18 degrees N and 0-17 degrees W, visited in October March 2007-2015,
   and covered 183 woody species and 59 bird species. Canopy surface
   (measured in a horizontal plane) and birds present were determined in
   308,000 trees and shrubs. Absolute bird density amounted to 13 birds/ha
   canopy, on average, varying for the different woody species between 0
   and 130 birds/ha canopy. Birds were highly selective in their tree
   choice, with no insectivorous birds at all in 65\% of the woody species.
   Bird density was four times higher in acacias and other thorny species
   than in non thorny trees, and seven times higher in trees with leaves
   having a low crude fibre content than in trees with high crude fibre
   foliage. Salvadora persica shrubs, but only when carrying berries, were
   even more attractive. Overall, densities of migratory woodland birds
   were highest in the (thorny) trees of the Sahelian vegetation zone. This
   counterintuitive finding, with highest numbers of wintering birds in the
   driest and most desiccated parts of West Africa (short of the Sahara),
   also known as Moreau's Paradox, can be explained by the foliage
   palatability hypothesis. The Sahelian vegetation zone has always been
   subject to heavy grazing from large herbivores, and as a consequence
   woody species have evolved mechanical defences (thorns) to withstand
   grazing of large herbivores, at the expense of chemical defence against
   arthropods. South of the Sahel, with a much lower grazing pressure,
   thorny trees (rich in arthropods) are replaced by (usually non-thorny)
   trees with less palatable foliage and a higher crude fibre content, and
   hence with less arthropod food for insectivorous birds.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of the present study were twofold: to determine
   differences between groups by means of chosen coefficients and to create
   significant predictors using regression models for athletes in
   wheelchair rugby who had the same spinal cord injury (tetraplegia) and
   were classified as low point and high point players. The study sample
   consisted of 24 subjects, who had sustained cervical spinal cord injury
   (CSCI). They were divided into low point (n=15) and high point (n=9)
   groups according to the IWRF Classification System. A one-way ANOVA
   revealed statistically significant differences in the following
   coefficients differentiating the groups: AC (eta 2=0.778), LC (eta
   2=0.687), IC (eta 2=0.565), SC (eta 2=0.580). The Tukey's HSD post-hoc
   test indicated statistically significant higher values of coefficients
   in the HP compared to the LP group: AC=0.958 (p=0.022), LC=0.989
   (p=0.031), IC=0.971 (p=0.044), SC=0.938 (p=0.039). In the HP group, the
   most significant predictor was the sum of visceral and trunk fat which
   was negatively correlated with the SC (what constituted a positive
   adaptive change in response to training). With regard to the LP group,
   body height and circumference of the chest appeared to be most
   significant predictors and were positively correlated with the SC. In
   the LP group no predictor with respect to the SC was significantly
   correlated to sports training. Therefore, the functional classification
   system confirmed lower status of the LP players. The results of the
   present study indicate that both metabolic and somatic profiles which
   highly determine potential of wheelchair rugby athletes are
   significantly different in LP and HP players, what confirms the
   reliability of the functional classification system.}},

Title = {{Constraints on new phenomena via Higgs boson couplings and invisible
   decays with the ATLAS detector}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{The ATLAS experiment at the LHC has measured the Higgs boson couplings
   and mass, and searched for invisible Higgs boson decays, using multiple
   production and decay channels with up to 4.7 fb(-1) of pp collision data
   at root S = 7 TeV and 20.3 fb(-1) at root s = 8 TeV. In the current
   study, the measured production and decay rates of the observed Higgs
   boson in the gamma gamma, ZZ, WW, Z gamma, bb, tau tau, and mu mu decay
   channels, along with results from the associated production of a Higgs
   boson with a top-quark pair, are used to probe the scaling of the
   couplings with mass. Limits are set on parameters in extensions of the
   Standard Model including a composite Higgs boson, an additional
   electroweak singlet, and two-Higgs-doublet models. Together with the
   measured mass of the scalar Higgs boson in the gamma gamma and ZZ decay
   modes, a lower limit is set on the pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass of m(A)
   > 370 GeV in the ``hMSSM{''} simplified Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
   Model. Results from direct searches for heavy Higgs bosons are also
   interpreted in the hMSSM. Direct searches for invisible Higgs boson
   decays in the vector-boson fusion and associated production of a Higgs
   boson with W/Z (Z -> ll, W/Z -> jj) modes are statistically combined to
   set an upper limit on the Higgs boson invisible branching ratio of 0.25.
   The use of the measured visible decay rates in a more general coupling
   fit improves the upper limit to 0.23, constraining a Higgs portal model
   of dark matter.}},

Abstract = {{Enhancement of timber beams with fibre reinforced materials gained
   momentum in the last few decades producing a wide range of materials,
   techniques and modelling methods. Experiments show that the potential
   improvement of structural behaviour is greatly affected by the type of
   reinforcement, wood species, etc. In this study a series of experiments
   were conducted on sawn Norway spruce beams reinforced with various
   amounts of CFRP sheets (carbon fibre reinforced plastic) followed by a
   statistical analysis. A moderate increase of load-bearing capacity and
   ductility (approx. 30\%) and a small increase of elastic stiffness
   (approx. 16\%) can be achieved. Statistical analysis of the results has
   shown that the performance of reinforced spruce beams is affected by the
   presence of knots in the material. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Segmented nitinol guidewires with stiffness-matched connectors for
   cardiovascular magnetic resonance catheterization: preserved mechanical
   performance and freedom from heating}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Conventional guidewires are not suitable for use during
   cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) catheterization. They employ
   metallic shafts for mechanical performance, but which are conductors
   subject to radiofrequency (RF) induced heating. To date, non-metallic
   CMR guidewire designs have provided inadequate mechanical support,
   trackability, and torquability. We propose a metallic guidewire for CMR
   that is by design intrinsically safe and that retains mechanical
   performance of commercial guidewires.
   Methods: The NHLBI passive guidewire is a 0.035{''} CMR-safe,
   segmented-core nitinol device constructed using short nitinol rod
   segments. The electrical length of each segment is less than one-quarter
   wavelength at 1.5 Tesla, which eliminates standing wave formation, and
   which therefore eliminates RF heating along the shaft. Each of the
   electrically insulated segments is connected with nitinol tubes for
   stiffness matching to assure uniform flexion. Iron oxide markers on the
   distal shaft impart conspicuity.
   Mechanical integrity was tested according to International Organization
   for Standardization (ISO) standards. CMR RF heating safety was tested in
   vitro in a phantom according to American Society for Testing and
   Materials (ASTM) F-2182 standard, and in vivo in seven swine. Results
   were compared with a high-performance commercial nitinol guidewire.
   Results: The NHLBI passive guidewire exhibited similar mechanical
   behavior to the commercial comparator. RF heating was reduced from 13
   degrees C in the commercial guidewire to 1.2 degrees C in the NHLBI
   passive guidewire in vitro, using a flip angle of 75 degrees. The
   maximum temperature increase was 1.1 +/- 0.3 degrees C in vivo, using a
   flip angle of 45 degrees. The guidewire was conspicuous during left
   heart catheterization in swine.
   Conclusions: We describe a simple and intrinsically safe design of a
   metallic guidewire for CMR cardiovascular catheterization. The guidewire
   exhibits negligible heating at high flip angles in conformance with
   regulatory guidelines, yet mechanically resembles a high-performance
   commercial guidewire. Iron oxide markers along the length of the
   guidewire impart passive visibility during real-time CMR. Clinical
   translation is imminent.}},

Title = {{Neutrinoless double beta decay in type I plus II seesaw models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{We study neutrinoless double beta decay in left-right symmetric
   extension of the standard model with type I and type II seesaw origin of
   neutrino masses. Due to the enhanced gauge symmetry as well as extended
   scalar sector, there are several new physics sources of neutrinoless
   double beta decay in this model. Ignoring the left-right gauge boson
   mixing and heavy-light neutrino mixing, we first compute the
   contributions to neutrinoless double beta decay for type I and type II
   dominant seesaw separately and compare with the standard light neutrino
   contributions. We then repeat the exercise by considering the presence
   of both type I and type II seesaw, having non-negligible contributions
   to light neutrino masses and show the difference in results from
   individual seesaw cases. Assuming the new gauge bosons and scalars to be
   around a TeV, we constrain different parameters of the model including
   both heavy and light neutrino masses from the requirement of keeping the
   new physics contribution to neutrinoless double beta decay amplitude
   below the upper limit set by the GERDA experiment and also satisfying
   bounds from lepton flavor violation, cosmology and colliders.}},

   prepared, with rhamnolipid and phospholipids as the outer mixed lipids
   layer (RHL-PC-LPN). The size of RHL-PC-LPN was around 200 nm, was
   negatively-charged, and showed sustained and complete drug release
   within 24 h. In an in vitro study, H. pylori biofilm models were
   successfully established. RHL-PC-LPN, superior to PC-LPN (employing
   phospholipids only as the outer lipid layer), PECS + AMX (mixture of
   PECS and AMX) and AMX only, was proven to significantly eradicate H.
   pylori in the biofilm form. In accordance to our previous results, the
   RHL-PC-LPN group, together with the PC-LPN and PECS + AMX group,
   inhibited H. pylori from adhering to AGS cells. Investigating the
   underlying mechanisms contributing to the death of H. pylori caused by
   RHL-PC-LPN, we found that LPN could lower the antibiotic minimal
   inhibition concentration (MIC) to biofilm form from 125 mu g/ml to 15.6
   mu g/ml. Furthermore, FITC-ConA labeled extracellular polymeric
   substances (EPS) were decreased in the RHL-PC-LPN group observed by a
   laser scanning confocal microscope. Therefore, we conclude that
   employing the mixed lipids of rhamnolipid and phospholipids as the outer
   layer of nanoparticles and PECS as the inner core produces a system
   capable of significantly disrupting H. pylori biofilm by eliminating the
   EPS as well as inhibiting the adherence and colonization of bacteria.

Abstract = {{Previous studies suggested that the variability of boreal spring Arctic
   Oscillation (AO) can exert a significant influence on the sea surface
   temperature (SST) anomalies in the Nino-3.4 region during the following
   winter. This study further reveals that AO in November can have a
   pronounced influence on the tropical central-eastern Pacific SST
   anomalies during the following spring and summer. When the November AO
   is in its positive (negative) phase, SST anomalies tend to be positive
   (negative) during the following spring and summer in the tropical
   central-eastern Pacific. The influence of the AO is accomplished by
   atmospheric circulation anomalies over the subtropical North Pacific
   through an interaction between the synoptic-scale eddy and the
   low-frequency mean flow. In the positive November AO years, pronounced
   cyclonic circulation and atmospheric heating anomalies are observed over
   the subtropical North Pacific. The atmospheric heating anomalies sustain
   westerly wind anomalies over the tropical western North Pacific through
   a Gill-like atmospheric response. The westerly wind anomalies extend
   eastward subsequently through positive air-sea feedback mechanism, and
   result in SST warming during the following spring and summer in the
   tropical central-eastern Pacific. Results of this study imply that the
   November AO index can be used as an effective predictor of SST anomalies
   in the Nino-3.4 region during the following spring and summer.}},

Abstract = {{The Allen-Cahn equation, coupled with dynamic boundary conditions, has
   recently received a good deal of attention. The new issue of this paper
   is the setting of a rather general mass constraint, which may involve
   either the solution inside the domain or its trace on the boundary. The
   system of nonlinear partial differential equations can be formulated as
   a variational inequality. The presence of the constraint in the
   evolution process leads to additional terms in the equation and the
   boundary condition containing a suitable Lagrange multiplier. A
   well-posedness result is proved for the related initial value problem.

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{The thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of semiconductors such as PbTe
   can be improved by forming nanostructures within the bulk of these
   materials. Alloying PbTe with PbS causes PbS-rich nanostructures to
   precipitate from the solid solution, scattering phonons and increasing
   ZT. Understanding the thermodynamics of this process is crucial to
   optimizing the efficiency gains of this technique. Previous calculations
   of the thermodynamics of PbS-PbTe alloys {[}(J. W. Doak and C.
   Wolverton, Phys. Rev. B 86, 144202 (2012)] found that mixing energetics
   alone were not sufficient to quantitatively explain the thermodynamic
   driving force for phase separation in these materials: first-principles
   calculations of the thermodynamics of phase separation overestimate the
   thermodynamic driving force for precipitation of PbS-rich nanostructures
   from PbS-PbTe alloys. In this work, we re-examine the thermodynamics of
   PbS-PbTe, including the effects of vibrational entropy in the free
   energy through frozen-phonon calculations of special quasirandom
   structures (SQS) to explain this discrepancy between first-principles
   and experimental phase stability. We find that vibrational entropy of
   mixing reduces the calculated maximum miscibility gap temperature T-G of
   PbS-PbTe by 470 K, bringing the error between calculated and
   experimental TG down from 700 to 230 K. Our calculated vibrational
   spectra of PbS-PbTe SQS exhibit dynamic instabilities of S ions that
   corroborate reports of low-T ferroelectriclike phase transitions in
   solid solutions of PbS and PbTe, which are not present in either of the
   constituent compounds. We use our calculated vibrational spectra to
   obtain phase transition temperatures, which are in qualitative agreement
   with experimental results for PbTe-rich alloys, as well as to predict
   the existence of a low-T displacive phase transition in PbS-rich
   PbS-PbTe, which has not yet been experimentally investigated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper extends the study of the continuous Berth Allocation Problem
   to the case of multiple quays, which is found in many container
   terminals around the world. Considering multiple quays adds a problem of
   assigning vessels to quays to the problem of determining berthing times
   and positions for each incoming vessel.
   This problem has not been considered in the literature at the
   operational level addressed in this study. In order to solve it, we have
   developed first an integer linear model and then a genetic algorithm
   which works on sequences of vessels that are decoded by a constructive
   algorithm. A local search procedure helps to improve further the
   solutions produced by the genetic algorithm. We have conducted an
   extensive computational experiment, adapting existing instances to the
   case of multiple quays.
   We have also adapted our genetic algorithm to the case of a single quay
   and tested it on previously reported instances, showing its superior
   performance compared with existing approaches. Finally, we have
   developed a random instance generator for the problem with multiple
   quays, enabling us to conduct a systematic study of the factors
   affecting the complexity of the problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Energy retrofit of the envelope of existing historical buildings, due to
   their historical and cultural value, often includes the addition of an
   interior insulation layer. The new wall configuration changes the
   hygrothermal performance of the structure leading to higher moisture
   contents that increase the risk of damage, especially in wooden
   components. The hygrothermal performance of different retrofitted
   masonry assemblies is studied through HAM (Heat Air and Moisture)
   numerical simulations, for different external renders. Simulation
   results are post-processed using a damage model for wooden materials to
   evaluate the risk of biological deterioration as a consequence of the
   addition of an interior insulation layer. The external render, and in
   particular the combination of its liquid and vapor transport properties,
   strongly influences the hygrothermal behavior of the wall and, thus, the
   risk of moisture related damage to embedded wooden structures as a
   consequence of addition of interior insulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Effects of the PPy layer thickness on Co-PPy composite films}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{356}},
Pages = {{817-826}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Co-PPy composite films were electrodeposited on ITO substrate from two
   different solutions potentio-statically. Firstly, the PPy layers with
   the thicknesses changing from 20 to 5000 nm were produced on ITO. Then
   Co was electrodeposited on these PPy/ITO substrates with a charge
   density of 1000 mC cm(-2). The electrochemical properties were
   investigated by the current density-time transients and the variation of
   the elapsed time for the Co deposition depending on the PPy layer
   thickness. X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra indicated the presence of
   both Co metal and its oxides on the surface. The weak reflections of the
   Co3O4, CoO and hcp Co were detected by the X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   technique. According to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, the
   thickness of the PPy layer strongly affects the Co nucleation. The
   composite films with the PPy layer thinner than 200 nm and thicker than
   2000 nm have an isotropic magnetic behavior due to the symmetrical
   crystal field. The composite films with the PPy layer thicknesses
   between 200 and 2000 nm have an anisotropic magnetic behavior
   attributable to the deterioration of this symmetrical crystal field by
   the PPy bubbles on the surface. All films are hard magnetic material,
   since the coercivities are larger than 125 Oe. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Room temperature rechargeable magnesium (Mg) batteries are constructed
   from Mg as a negative material, sulfur (S)-containing composite prepared

   the simple electrolyte (0.7 mol dm(-3) Mg{[}N(SO2CF3)(2)](2)-triglyme
   (G3) solution). The reaction between molten S and the bis(alkenyl)
   compound (BUMB18C6 or UOEE) provides the sulfur-containing composite,
   S-BUMB18C6 or S-UOEE. Both of the sulfur-containing composites are
   electrochemically active in the Mg salt-based electrolyte, acetonitrile-
   or G3- Mg{[}N(SO2CF3)(2)](2) electrolyte. The first discharge capacity
   of the test cells with the sulfur-containing composite is 460 Ah kg(-1)
   (per the weight of sulfur in the composite) with the S-BUMB18C6
   electrode and 495 Ah kg(-1) with the S-UOEE electrode. According to the
   continuous charge-discharge cycle tests (at 10th cycle), the discharge
   capacity of the test cell with the S-BUMB18C6 electrode (68.1 Ah kg(-1))
   is higher than that with the S-UOEE electrode (0.18 Ah kg(-1)). The
   crown ether units in the S-BUMB18C6 composite may create ion-conducting
   paths in the cathode, prevent rise in the internal resistance of the

Abstract = {{We performed ultrafast time-resolved near-infrared pump, resonant soft
   x-ray diffraction probe measurements to investigate the coupling between
   the photoexcited electronic system and the spin cycloid magnetic order
   in multiferroic TbMnO3 at low temperatures. We observe melting of the
   long range antiferromagnetic order at low excitation fluences with a
   decay time constant of 22.3 +/- 1.1 ps, which is much slower than the
   similar to 1 ps melting times previously observed in other systems. To
   explain the data, we propose a simple model of the melting process where
   the pump laser pulse directly excites the electronic system, which then
   leads to an increase in the effective temperature of the spin system via
   a slower relaxation mechanism. Despite this apparent increase in the
   effective spin temperature, we do not observe changes in the wave vector
   q of the antiferromagnetic spin order that would typically correlate
   with an increase in temperature under equilibrium conditions. We suggest
   that this behavior results from the extremely low magnon group velocity
   that hinders a change in the spin-spiral wave vector on these time
   scales.}},

Abstract = {{Fuzzy classification can be defined as a method of computing the degrees
   of membership of objects in classes. There are many approaches to fuzzy
   classification, most of which generate sophisticated multivariate models
   that classify all of the input space simultaneously. In contrast,
   methods for membership function generation (MFG) derive simple models
   for fuzzy classification that map one input variable to one fuzzy class;
   therefore, by minimizing complexity, these models are very
   understandable to human experts. The unique contribution of this paper
   is a method for membership function generation from real data that is
   based on inductive logic. Most existing MFG methods apply either
   parameter optimization heuristics or unsupervised learning and
   clustering for the definition of the membership function. In contrast to
   heuristic methods, our method can approximate membership functions of
   any shape. In comparison to clustering, our approach can make use of a
   target signal to learn a membership function supervised from the
   association between two variables. Compared to probabilistic methods,
   which translate frequency information, i.e., normalized histograms,
   directly into membership degrees, our approach applies inductive
   reasoning based on conditional relative frequencies, which are called
   likelihoods. According to the law of likelihood in inductive logic, it
   is the ratio between the likelihoods of the data that is of interest
   when evaluating two alternative hypotheses, not the likelihoods
   themselves. The greatest advantage of our method is its
   understandability to human users and thereby the potential for visual
   analytics. However, experimental evaluation did not show reproducible
   significant effects on the predictive performance of conventional
   multivariate regression models. Given that there are already many very
   accurate multivariate models for fuzzy classification, the practical
   implication is that IFC-Filter can unfold its unique potential mainly
   for explaining data, specifically, associations between analytical and
   target variables, to human decision makers. Lessons learned from two
   case studies with industry partners demonstrate that IFC-Filter can

Title = {{A novel method for device-related electroencephalography artifact
   suppression to explore cochlear implant-related cortical changes in
   single-sided deafness}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},

Abstract = {{Background: Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) is effective when
   used to analyze ongoing cortical oscillations in cochlear implant (CI)
   users. However, localization of cortical activity in such users via qEEG
   is confounded by the presence of artifacts produced by the device
   itself. Typically, independent component analysis (ICA) is used to
   remove CI artifacts in auditory evoked EEG signals collected upon brief
   stimulation and it is effective for auditory evoked potentials (AEPs).
   However, AEPs do not reflect the daily environments of patients, and
   thus, continuous EEG data that are closer to such environments are
   desirable. In this case, device-related artifacts in EEG data are
   difficult to remove selectively via ICA due to over-completion of EEG
   data removal in the absence of preprocessing.
   New methods: EEGs were recorded for a long time under conditions of
   continuous auditory stimulation. To obviate the over-completion problem,
   we limited the frequency of CI artifacts to a significant characteristic
   peak and apply ICA artifact removal.
   Results: Topographic brain mapping results analyzed via band-limited
   (BL)-ICA exhibited a better energy distribution, matched to the CI
   location, than data obtained using conventional ICA. Also, source
   localization data verified that BL-ICA effectively removed Cl artifacts.
   Comparison with existing method: The proposed method selectively removes
   Cl artifacts from continuous EEG recordings, while ICA removal method
   shows residual peak and removes important brain activity signals.
   Conclusion: Cl artifacts in EEG data obtained during continuous passive
   listening can be effectively removed with the aid of BL-ICA, opening up
   new EEG research possibilities in subjects with Cls. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study examines the regional variations in the frequency of snowfall
   across the conterminous United States from 1930 to 2007. Principal
   components analysis and cluster analysis are used to group stations
   together based on the main modes of variation in snowfall frequency.
   Results indicate the existence of seven unique snowfall regions, which
   correspond to predominant storm tracks across the United States. These
   are the southeast, the south central Plains and southwest, the Ohio
   River Valley and mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, and three
   sub-regions in the Upper-Midwest. Quantile regression reveals that the
   distribution functions of each region's snowfall frequency are different
   and in some regions, changing over time. The northern part of the
   Upper-Midwest is experiencing increasing trends in all percentiles of
   snowfall frequencies, the Pacific northwest is experiencing declines in
   greater than median snowfall frequencies, and the southeast is seeing a
   decline in extreme frequency years. Correlation analysis between
   large-scale teleconnection patterns and regionally averaged snowfall
   frequencies corroborate previous findings and indicate specific forcing
   mechanisms for snowfall frequency in each region.}},

Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{168}},
Pages = {{327-335}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new online learning method for measuring
   affinity between tracklets in multi-target tracking. As targets and
   background usually keep changing in the video, fixed affinity
   measurement could not adapt to their variations. Most existing affinity
   learning methods construct labeled samples based on the obtained
   tracklets, and then minimize a predefined loss function to get an
   optimal affinity measurement. However, those methods simply assume that
   the training error equals to testing error which is not true in many of
   real time tracking scenarios. Differently, we propose to learn affinity
   measurement through CovBoosting, which considers the evolution of the
   tracklets and could obtain affinity measurement with more discriminative
   ability. To deal with targets' disappearance and new targets'
   appearance, we combine tracklet affinity with contextual information to
   do an optimal inference. Moreover, an online updating algorithm is
   developed to guarantee that the learned tracklet affinity is always
   optimal for tracking targets in current sliding window. Experimental
   results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that tracklet affinity learned
   with our method is more discriminative and could greatly improve the
   performance of the multi-target tracker. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Flexible loads are important resources to help maintain the power
   balance of smart grid. However, the control center is not able to
   exactly sense and control them because of their large quantity and wide

   dynamic power system look-ahead scheduling, this paper proposes a
   three-layer `centralized coordination, distributed control' structure in
   which the load agents are introduced to perform the coordination based
   on the consensus control. Then, the optimal control strategy of the
   control center and the consensus control strategy of the load agents are
   designed. With the communication among different flexible loads, the
   distributed cooperative control is implemented. At last, the efficiency
   of the proposed mode and strategies is proven through the simulation
   carried out under the standard IEEE 9-bus system, and the effect of
   topology and communication is also analyzed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The Ni-Cu-P coatings were obtained by electroless plating method on

   The coatings surface and cross-section morphologies were observed with

   and electrochemical tests. The experimental results showed that the
   Ni-Cu-P coatings were uniform and compact, and the corrosion resistance
   of these coatings was superior to Ni-P coatings owing to the
   introduction of copper. The crystallinity and compactness of the Ni-Cu-P
   coatings gradually enhanced with the increasing of copper content in the
   coatings. The introduction of copper element in the Ni-Cu-P coatings
   contributes to the formation of passivation film. The Ni-Cu-P coatings

Abstract = {{We model combining of multiple laser beams into a single near
   diffraction-limited beam by beam self-focusing (collapse) in a Kerr
   medium. The beams with the total power above critical are combined in
   the near field and then propagated in the Kerr medium. Nonlinearity
   results in self-focusing event, combining multiple beams into nearly a
   diffraction-limited beam that carries the critical power. Beam quality
   of the combined beam is analyzed as a function of the number of
   combining beams and the level of random fluctuations of the combining
   beams phases. (c) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The use of alternative biocidal compounds to replace chemical pesticides
   after the Directive 2009/128/EC has raised renewed interest in the
   biofumigation technique. In particular, the defatted seed meals (DSM)
   derived from Brassicaceae plant tissues with high glucosinolate content
   represent an efficient practice to control soil-born plant pathogens and
   pests that can be applied in synergy to catch crop green manures. For a
   wider and safer application of this technique, the impacts on non-target
   soil microorganisms and free-living nematodes have to be investigated in
   more depth. In this pot-scale experiment a naturally nematode-infected
   soil was amended with a glucosinolate-containing DSM from Brassica
   carinata, a nonglucosinolate-containing DSM from sunflower and the
   metam-sodium fumigant. Tomato plants were transplanted and checked for
   the presence of pests and/or pathogens and plant vigour. The response of
   soil microbial communities was assessed by PCR-DGGE analysis of
   bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal 185 rRNA genes, whereas nematode indices
   were applied to assess their community structure 0, 10,32 and 62 days
   after the treatments. Significant shifts were observed among both
   bacterial and fungal communities, whereas various changes of nematode
   communities occurred depending on the nematode family. Similar changes
   initially occurred in both bacterial and fungal community structure in
   response to DSM and VAP amendments, but after 62 days fungal communities
   were more strongly shaped by VAP fumigation than bacteria. The
   non-biofumigant SUN treatment added organic matter into the soil
   inducing significant changes in microbial communities, but it was not
   effective against Meloidogyne incognita root infestation. Although the
   free-living nematode structure was negatively influenced by all
   treatments, B. carinata DMS proved the best compromise between
   efficiency to control M. incognita and environmental impact. These
   results confirmed the interesting potential of biofumigant DSM
   amendments as alternatives to chemical fumigants for a more
   environment-friendly control of some soil-borne diseases. (C) 2015

Title = {{Intra-tumor heterogeneity in TP53 null High Grade Serous Ovarian
   Carcinoma progression}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: High grade serous ovarian cancer is characterised by high
   initial response to chemotherapy but poor outcome in the long term due
   to acquired resistance. One of the main genetic features of this disease
   is TP53 mutation. The majority of TP53 mutated tumors harbor missense
   mutations in this gene, correlated with p53 accumulation. TP53 null
   tumors constitute a specific subgroup characterised by nonsense,
   frame-shift or splice-site mutations associated to complete absence of
   p53 expression. Different studies show that this kind of tumors may have
   a worse prognosis than other TP53 mutated HGSC.
   Methods: In this study, we sought to characterise the intra-tumor
   heterogeneity of a TP53 null HGSC consisting of six primary tumor
   samples, two intra-pelvic and four extra-pelvic recurrences using exome
   sequencing and comparative genome hybridisation.
   Results: Significant heterogeneity was found among the different tumor
   samples, both at the mutational and copy number levels. Exome sequencing
   identified 102 variants, of which only 42 were common to all three
   samples; whereas 7 of the 18 copy number changes found by CGH analysis
   were presented in all samples. Sanger validation of 20 variants found by
   exome sequencing in additional regions of the primary tumor and the
   recurrence allowed us to establish a sequence of the tumor clonal
   evolution, identifying those populations that most likely gave rise to
   recurrences and genes potentially involved in this process, like GPNMB
   and TFDP1. Using functional annotation and network analysis, we
   identified those biological functions most significantly altered in this
   tumor. Remarkably, unexpected functions such as microtubule-based
   movement and lipid metabolism emerged as important for tumor development
   and progression, suggesting its potential interest as therapeutic
   targets.
   Conclusions: Altogether, our results shed light on the clonal evolution
   of the distinct tumor regions identifying the most aggressive
   subpopulations and at least some of the genes that may be implicated in
   its progression and recurrence, and highlights the importance of
   considering intra-tumor heterogeneity when carrying out genetic and
   genomic studies, especially when these are aimed to diagnostic
   procedures or to uncover possible therapeutic strategies.}},

Title = {{An investment decision model for the optimal placement of phasor

Abstract = {{Safe operation and reliability of the electrical power systems
   necessitate full observability of the power grid. Phasor measurement
   units (PMUs) are the state-of-the-art intelligent devices that collect
   synchronized phasors of voltages and currents in real time. It is not
   economically justifiable to install PMUs at all buses of the power grid.
   Hence, designing the PMUs network and determining their optimal
   placement in the power grid is an investment decision. In this paper, we
   propose a new investment decision model to determine the optimal
   placement of PMUs that guarantees the full observability of the power
   grid. Network observability rules are applied to reduce the capital cost
   of installing PMUs. A problem-specific genetic algorithm is developed to
   determine the optimal investment decision. The N - 1 reliability
   requirement of the power grid has been integrated in the model as well
   to obtain the resilient network design against all single contingencies
   such as failure of a PMU or a transmission line. Furthermore, a
   two-phase investment plan is proposed, which provides the power system
   investors with more flexibility and avoids unnecessary investment costs.
   In the first phase, PMUs are installed to achieve full observability of
   the power grid whereas additional PMUs will be installed in the second
   phase to guarantee the full observability in case of single
   contingencies. To test the efficacy of the proposed model, experiments
   are conducted on multiple IEEE test systems with and without considering
   zero-injection buses. The results are compared to the other methods such
   as integer linear programming and heuristic methods. The analysis shows
   that the proposed approach is promising and verifies its efficacy. (C)

Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{356}},
Pages = {{54-62}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{The formation behavior of anodic alumina nanofibers via anodizing in a
   concentrated pyrophosphoric acid under various conditions was
   investigated using electrochemical measurements and SEM/TEM
   observations. Pyrophosphoric acid anodizing at 293 K resulted in the
   formation of numerous anodic alumina nanofibers on an aluminum substrate
   through a thin barrier oxide and honeycomb oxide with narrow walls.
   However, long-term anodizing led to the chemical dissolution of the
   alumina nanofibers. The density of the anodic alumina nanofibers
   decreased as the applied voltage increased in the 10-75 V range.
   However, active electrochemical dissolution of the aluminum substrate
   occurred at a higher voltage of 90V. Low temperature anodizing at 273 K
   resulted in the formation of long alumina nanofibers measuring several
   micrometers in length, even though a long processing time was required
   due to the low current density during the low temperature anodizing. In
   contrast, high temperature anodizing easily resulted in the formation
   and chemical dissolution of alumina nanofibers. The structural
   nanofeatures of the anodic alumina nanofibers were controlled by
   choosing of the appropriate electrochemical conditions, and numerous
   high-aspect-ratio alumina nanofibers (>100) can be successfully
   fabricated. The anodic alumina nanofibers consisted of a pure amorphous
   aluminum oxide without anions from the employed electrolyte. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Patients with bipolar disorder show cognitive deficits including
   executive function, which appear to be related to social functioning and
   outcome. However, subgroups within the spectrum as well as
   psychopathological features, current mood state/euthymia and disease
   stage might be confounding factors. We analysed data tests from the
   Wechsler Intelligence Scale (WIE), verbal fluency (COWA) and trail
   making tests (TMT-A and TMT-B) obtained in a selected subgroup of
   currently bipolar I disorder patients, who were currently euthymic and
   had a history of psychotic symptoms, and compared them to patients with
   schizophrenia (in remission) and healthy controls, all matched for age,
   gender, and handedness. Schizophrenia patients showed more severe
   cognitive impairment, including digit symbol and arithmetic tests, as
   well as TMT-B (compared to healthy controls), but bipolar patients had
   stronger impairment on the letter number sequencing test, an indicator
   of working memory and processing speed. There were no group effects on
   most verbal fluency tasks (except impairment of schizophrenia patients
   on one subscale of category fluency). Within the limitations of the
   study design, our results suggest that even in subgroups of presumably
   more severely impaired bipolar patients, some cognitive dimensions might
   achieve remission, possibly related to considerable state effects at
   testing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   mass index cutoff points}},
Journal = {{NUTRITION \& DIABETES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{For convenience, health practitioners and clinicians are inclined to
   classify people/patients as overweight or obese based on body mass index
   (BMI) cutoff points of 25 and 30 kgm(-2) respectively, irrespective of
   age and gender. The purpose of the current study was to identity
   whether, for the same levels of adiposity, BMI is the same across
   different age groups and gender. A two-way ANCOVA revealed significant
   differences in BMI between different age groups and gender (plus an
   interaction), using body fat (\%) as the covariate, data taken from a
   random sample of the English population (n = 2993). Younger people had
   greater BMI than older people for the same levels of adiposity
   (differences ranged by 4 BMI units for males, and 3 BMI units for
   females). In conclusion, if BMI thresholds for overweight (BMI = 25 kg
   m(-2)) and obese (BMI = 30 kg m(-2)) are to reflect the same levels of
   adiposity across all gender and age groups within a population, then
   age- and gender-specific BMI adjustments outlined here are necessary to
   more accurately/fairly reflect the same critical levels of adiposity.}},

Abstract = {{This research proposes a new reliable network design methodology that is
   based on a pattern mining guided genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed
   method can be applied for a variety of applications including
   telecommunication, ad hoc, and power systems. In these networks,
   failures in certain parts of a network make it necessafy for other parts
   to tolerate a higher traffic load in order to maintain adequate network
   connections, In addition, path changes due to dynamic routing of traffic
   can cause a time delay of communications in the network. To understand
   and reduce the connection failures costs, vigorous investigations are
   required to select the best design option under budget constraints.
   Given that many options for network topology and reliability allocation
   exist, a GA guided with pattern mining is proposed as an effective
   optimization method to design reliable network while considering link
   and node failures. Experimental designs under various assumptions have
   concluded that the guided GA approach is effective in identifying a
   network solution within a short period of time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{90-98}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Under specific post-fire curing conditions, concrete regains its
   material properties along with the recovery of contact-type defects. An
   experimental study was carried out to investigate the effects of
   post-fire curing conditions on fire-damaged concrete. After exposing
   concrete specimens to three different high temperatures ranging from 300
   degrees C to 700 degrees C, fire-damaged concrete specimens were stored
   in a thermo-hygrostat with 12 different post-fire-curing conditions,
   which were varied by the relative humidity condition and the curing
   time. The degree of fire damage can be estimated through an evaluation
   of the tensile strength and the nonlinearity parameter, which can
   sensitively reflect the contact-type defects in concrete. These
   components were measured by a splitting tensile test and the nonlinear
   resonance vibration method, respectively. The experimental and
   analytical results confirm that the recovery of material properties in
   fire-damaged concrete is closely related with the post-fire curing
   conditions, and finally this paper introduces the appropriate post-fire
   curing condition to restore the material properties of fire-damaged
   concrete. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a study on the photoelectrochemical processes
   occurring at the interface of ZnO nanocrystals/MEH-PPV composites.
   Colloidal chemical routes were used to obtain size controlled
   non-hydrolytic ZnO nanocrystals (NCs) dispersible in organic solvents,
   while a low molecular weight
   poly{[}2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy)phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV),
   characterized by high degree of structural order, was synthesized via an
   organometallic method. The optical properties of the nanocomposite
   material were comprehensively investigated on solution and on films
   deposited by spin coating. Remarkably, a significant fluorescence
   quenching of the polymer at the MEH-PPV/ZnO junction was observed.
   Photoelectrochemical measurements demonstrated that the photoactivity of
   the composite material was significantly improved in the case of
   non-hydrolytic NCs with respect to hydrolytic route prepared ZnO.
   Moreover, the effective role of the organic/inorganic blend to improve
   the charge transfer with respect to the double layer hetero-junction was
   confirmed, thanks to the extended interfaces which enable an effective
   electron transfer between the hetero-junction components. The system was
   also studied at different film thicknesses and electrolyte compositions.
   The results indicated that film photoactivity increased with film
   thickness up to 300 nm due to the presence of a large number of
   interfaces, while the change of cation size influenced the ionic
   conductivity through the nanocomposite film. It was shown that efficient
   photoconductivity requires not only efficient charge separation, but
   also efficient transport of the carriers to the electrodes without
   recombination. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   application in these trials was therapeutic, the first treatment was
   distributed at the time of appearance of at least five mobile mites

   application of both formulations have a clear effect in containing
   mites, statistically different from the untreated control. Moreover, the
   ability of pest control of the formulation with the higher
   concentrations of oil and defatted seed meal was not different from the
   chemical treatment. Treatment efficacy clearly decreased after 21 days,

Title = {{Osteoarthritis prevalence and modifiable factors: a population study}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: This study's objectives were to investigate the prevalence
   of self-reported knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) stratified by age and
   sex and to examine the association of modifiable factors with knee and
   hip OA prevalence. The study was conducted using randomly sampled data
   gathered from four communities in the province of Alberta, Canada.
   Methods: A large adult population sample (N = 4733) of individuals >= 18
   years were selected. Health-related information was collected through
   telephone interviews and community measurement clinics for which a
   sub-sample (N = 1808) attended. Participants self-reported OA during
   telephone interviews. Clinic interviews further assessed if the
   diagnosis was made by a health care professional. Statistical analyses
   compared prevalence of OA between sexes and across age categories.
   Associations between modifiable factors for OA and the prevalence of
   knee and hip OA were assessed using binary logistic regression
   modelling.
   Results: Overall prevalence of self-reported OA in the total sample was
   14.8 \%, where 10.5 \% of individuals reported having knee OA and 8.5 \%
   reported having hip OA. Differences in prevalence were found for males
   and females across age categories for both knee and hip OA. In terms of
   modifiable factors, being obese (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)) was significantly
   associated with the prevalence of knee (OR: 4.37; 95 \% CI: 2.08,9.20)
   and hip (OR: 2.52; 95 \% CI: 1.17,5.43) OA. Individuals who stand or
   walk a lot, but do not carry or lift things during their occupational
   activities were 2.0 times less likely to have hip OA (OR: 0.50; 95 \%
   CI: 0.26,0.96). Individuals who usually lift or carry light loads or
   have to climb stairs or hills were 2.2 times less likely to have hip OA
   (OR: 0.45; 95 \% CI: 0.21,0.95). The odds of having hip OA were 1.9
   times lower in individuals consuming recommended or higher vitamin C
   intake (OR: 0.52; 95 \% CI: 0.29,0.96). Significant differences in
   prevalence were found for both males and females across age categories.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of knee and hip OA obtained in this study is
   comparable to other studies. Females have greater knee OA prevalence and
   a greater proportion of women have mobility limitations as well as hip
   and knee pain; it is important to target this sub-group.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{The seasonality of human occupations in archaeological sites is highly
   significant for the study of hominin behavioural ecology, in particular
   the hunting strategies for their main prey-ungulates. We propose a new
   tool to quantify such seasonality from tooth microwear patterns in a
   dataset of ten large samples of extant ungulates resulting from
   well-known mass mortality events. The tool is based on the combination
   of two measures of variability of scratch density, namely standard
   deviation and coefficient of variation. The integration of these two
   measurements of variability permits the classification of each case into
   one of the following three categories: (1) short events, (2)
   long-continued event and (3) two separated short events. The tool is
   tested on a selection of eleven fossil samples from five Palaeolithic
   localities in Western Europe which show a consistent classification in
   the three categories. The tool proposed here opens new doors to
   investigate seasonal patterns of ungulate accumulations in
   archaeological sites using non-destructive sampling.}},

Abstract = {{The strain BA71V has played a key role in African swine fever virus
   (ASFV) research. It was the first genome sequenced, and remains the only
   genome completely determined. A large part of the studies on the
   function of ASFV genes, viral transcription, replication, DNA repair and
   morphogenesis, has been performed using this model. This avirulent
   strain was obtained by adaptation to grow in Vero cells of the highly
   virulent BA71 strain. We report here the analysis of the genome sequence
   of BA71 in comparison with that of BA71V. They possess the smallest
   genomes for a virulent or an attenuated ASFV, and are essentially
   identical except for a relatively small number of changes. We discuss
   the possible contribution of these changes to virulence. Analysis of the
   BA71 sequence allowed us to identify new similarities among ASFV
   proteins, and with database proteins including two ASFV proteins that
   could function as a two-component signaling network.}},

Title = {{Economic assessment of FEC-based targeted selective drenching in horses}},
Journal = {{VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{214}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{159-166}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{In the face of an increased prevalence of drug-resistant cyathostomin
   populations, a targeted selective treatment (TST) strategy based on
   Faecal Egg Counts (FECs) has been proposed as an alternative management
   strategy. However, associated costs may be a barrier to the uptake of
   this strategy. Our study aims to provide an economic assessment of
   FEC-based TST. FECs were determined in a Welsh pony herd thrice a year
   from 2010 to 2014. This database was used to explore the impact of FEC
   price, sampling strategy (individual or pooled) and labour-associated
   costs. Drug price was set at the cheapest level, hence providing a
   conservative framework to determine the maximum viable FEC price in the
   context of a cost-driven horse industry. The maximum viable FEC price
   for a cost-efficient individual based strategy was determined by an in
   silico bootstrap approach consisting of randomly sampling 1000 virtual
   pony herds of various sizes (1 to 100 ponies) from the available
   database and estimating the associated costs (FEC price ranging from
   (sic)1 to (sic)10, anthelmintic costs and labour-associated costs). The
   costs and benefits of the pooling strategy that consists of basing the
   decision to treat on group FEC values were also investigated. This is
   thought to reduce FEC-based costs but may result in highly infected
   individuals being left undrenched, i.e. in false-negatives, as a result
   of FEC overdispersion. For various pool-sizes (1-20 ponies) and various
   cut-off thresholds (50-200 eggs/g), we sampled 1000 pony herds in silica
   to estimate the associated costs and determine the number of positive
   ponies within a negative pool. Following these simulations, pool-based
   FECs of various sizes were performed on 40 ponies to compare predictions
   with real data. Within 4 years, anthelmintic costs were cut by 80\%,
   albeit with free FECs. In silico estimations suggested that an
   individual FEC-based TST would not be cost-efficient in this context for
   an FEC price above (sic)5. With a pooled FEC strategy, the proportion of
   false-negatives never exceeded 15\% of the pool size. The combination of
   a 14-pony pool and a cut-off value of 150 eggs/g minimized total costs
   while keeping the number of false negatives to a reasonable level. Real
   data obtained from infected ponies however, suggested that pool size
   should not exceed 10 individuals, since the inhomogeneous mixing of
   faeces of larger pools probably reduced the correlation between average
   pooled FECs and the mean of individual FECs. Our study provides an
   economic framework that could be valuable for emphasizing the use of
   FEC-based approaches in the field. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Spin-polarized neutron matter is studied using chiral two-and three-body

   cutoff dependence. We explore to what extent fully polarized neutron
   matter behaves (nearly) like a free Fermi gas. We also consider the more
   general case of partial polarization in neutron matter as well as the
   presence of a small proton fraction. In other words, in our
   calculations, we vary both spin and isospin asymmetries. Confirming the
   findings of other microscopic calculations performed with different
   approaches, we report no evidence for a transition to a polarized phase

Title = {{Novel approaches using evolutionary computation for sparse least square
   support vector machines}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{168}},

Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces two new approaches to building sparse least square
   support vector machines (LSSVM) based on genetic algorithms (GAs) for
   classification tasks. LSSVM classifiers are an alternative to SVM ones
   because the training process of LSSVM classifiers only requires to solve
   a linear equation system instead of a quadratic programming optimization
   problem. However, the absence of sparseness in the Lagrange multiplier
   vector (i.e. the solution) is a significant problem for the effective
   use of these classifiers. In order to overcome this lack of sparseness,
   we propose both single and multi-objective GA approaches to leave a few
   support vectors out of the solution without affecting the classifier's
   accuracy and even improving it. The main idea is to leave out outliers,
   non-relevant patterns or those ones which can be corrupted with noise
   and thus prevent classifiers to achieve higher accuracies along with a
   reduced set of support vectors. Differently from previous works, genetic
   algorithms are used in this work to obtain sparseness not to find out
   the optimal values of the LSSVM hyper-parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{We report on a switching synchronization phenomenon in one-dimensional
   memristive networks, which occurs when several memristive systems with
   different switching constants are switched from the high- to
   low-resistance state. Our numerical simulations show that such a
   collective behavior is especially pronounced when the applied voltage
   slightly exceeds the combined threshold voltage of memristive systems.
   Moreover, a finite increase in the network switching time is found
   compared to the average switching time of individual systems. An
   analytical model is presented to explain our observations. Using this
   model, we have derived asymptotic expressions for memory resistances at
   short and long times, which are in excellent agreement with results of
   our numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been advocated as a beneficial additive to
   electrospray solvents for peptide analysis due to the improved
   ionisation efficiency conferred. Previous reports have shown that the
   resultant improvements in peptide ion signal intensities are
   non-uniform. As a result, it was hypothesised that inclusion of DMSO in
   electrospray solvents could be detrimental to the outcome of
   intensity-based label-free absolute quantification approaches,
   specifically the top 3 method. The effect of DMSO as a mobile phase
   additive in top 3 label-free quantification was therefore evaluated. We
   show that inclusion of DMSO enhances data quality, improving the
   precision and number of proteins quantified, with no significant change
   to the quantification values observed in its absence. (C) 2015 The

   adjacent Fano resonances in the formation of the broadband features. We

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the traffic offloading over unlicensed bands for
   two-tier multi-mode small cell networks. We formulate this problem as a
   Stackelberg game and apply a hierarchical learning framework to jointly
   maximize the utilities of both macro base station (MBS) and small base
   stations (SBSs). During the learning process, the MBS behaves as a
   leader and the SBSs are followers. A pricing mechanism is adopt by MBS
   and the price information is broadcasted to all SBSs by MBS firstly,
   then each SBS competes with other SBSs and takes its best response
   strategies to appropriately allocate the traffic load in licensed and
   unlicensed band in the sequel, taking the traffic flow payment charged
   by MBS into consideration. Then, we present a hierarchical Q-learning
   algorithm (HQL) to discover the Stackelberg equilibrium. Additionally,
   if some extra information can be obtained via feedback, we propose an
   improved hierarchical Q-learning algorithm (IHQL) to speed up the SBSs'
   learning process. Last but not the least, the convergence performance of
   the proposed two algorithms is analyzed. Numerical experiments are
   presented to validate the proposed schemes and show the effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{An interaction between the vacuum energy and dark matter is an
   intriguing possibility which may offer a way of solving the cosmological
   constant problem. Adopting a general prescription for momentum exchange
   between the two dark components, we reconstruct alpha(a), the temporal
   evolution of the coupling strength between dark matter and vacuum
   energy, in a nonparametric Bayesian approach using combined
   observational data sets from the cosmic microwave background, supernovae
   and large scale structure. An evolving interaction between the vacuum
   energy and dark matter removes some of the tensions between different
   data sets. However, it is not preferred over.CDM in the Bayesian sense,
   as improvement in the fit is not sufficient to compensate for the
   increase in the volume of the parameter space.}},

Abstract = {{Membrane proteins (MPs) are essential for numerous important biological
   processes. Recently, mass spectrometry (MS), coupled with an array of
   related techniques, has been used to probe the structural properties of
   MPs and their complexes. Typically, detergent micelles have been
   employed for delivering MPs into the gas-phase, but these complexes have
   intrinsic properties that can limit the utility of structural studies of
   MPs using MS methods. Amphipols (APols) have advantages over detergent
   micelles and have been shown to be capable of delivering native MPs into
   the gas-phase. Comparing six different APols which vary in mass and
   charge, and the detergent n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltopyranoside, we aimed to
   determine which APols are most efficient for delivery of native outer
   membrane proteins (OMPs) into the gas-phase. We show that maintaining
   the solution-phase folding and global structures of three different OMPs
   (PagP, OmpT and tOmpA) are independent of the APol used, but differences
   in OMP activity can result from the different APol:OMP complexes.
   ESI-IMS-MS analysis of OMP:APol complexes shows that the A8-35 APol is
   most proficient at liberating all three OMPs into the gas-phase, without
   altering their gas-phase conformations. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

   autistic children}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{168}},
Pages = {{770-776}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{We use a face recognition algorithm to model differences in perception
   between autistic and non autistic children. With our model it is
   possible to reproduce several phenomena of autism by assuming that
   autistic children lack the ability to abstract from horizontal
   invariants. In particular, we can explain why autistic children are able
   to better recognize faces from parts of the face while the overall
   recognition of faces is worse than in non-autistic children. We would
   like to consider whether ASD may be the result of a version of a
   sophisticated perceptual system that makes less explicit use of
   invariants in the real world environment than the typically-developing
   brain. Some of these invariants may be hard-coded into the system rather
   than learned. The key point of our system is not the face recognition
   but the model which can mimic the autistic brain. In the discussion we
   extend the model by suggesting a general reduced ability to abstract
   from many different types of invariants and relate these as explanations
   to typical behavioral issues. In this way we hope to give a
   complementary insight into autism and ASD. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Data center interconnect with elastic optical network is a promising
   scenario to meet the high burstiness and high-bandwidth requirements of
   data center services. In our previous work, we implemented multi-stratum
   resilience between IP and elastic optical networks that allows to
   accommodate data center services. In view of this, this study extends to
   consider the resource integration by breaking the limit of network
   device, which can enhance the resource utilization. We propose a novel
   multi-stratum resources integration (MSRI) architecture based on network
   function virtualization in software defined elastic data center optical
   interconnect. A resource integrated mapping (RIM) scheme for MSRI is
   introduced in the proposed architecture. The MSRI can accommodate the
   data center services with resources integration when the single function
   or resource is relatively scarce to provision the services, and enhance
   globally integrated optimization of optical network and application
   resources. The overall feasibility and efficiency of the proposed
   architecture are experimentally verified on the control plane of
   OpenFlow-based enhanced software defined networking (eSDN) testbed. The
   performance of RIM scheme under heavy traffic load scenario is also
   quantitatively evaluated based on MSRI architecture in terms of path
   blocking probability, provisioning latency and resource utilization,
   compared with other provisioning schemes. (C) 2015 Optical Society of

Title = {{Joint representation and pattern learning for robust face recognition}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{168}},
Pages = {{70-80}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Image feature is a significant factor for the success of robust face
   recognition. Recently sparse representation based classifier (SRC) has
   been widely applied to robust face recognition by using sparse
   representation residuals to tolerate disturbed image features (e.g.,
   occluded pixels). In order to deal with more complicated image
   variations, robust representation based classifier, which estimates
   feature weights (e.g., low weight values are given to the pixels with
   big representation residuals), has attracted much attention in recent
   work. Although these methods have achieved improved performance by
   estimating feature weights independently, structured information and
   prior knowledge of image features are ignored in these works, resulting
   in unsatisfactory performance in some challenging cases. Thus how to
   better learn image feature weight to fully exploit structure information
   and prior knowledge is still an open question in robust face
   recognition. In this paper, we proposed a novel joint representation and
   pattern learning (JRPL) model, in which the feature pattern weight is
   simultaneously learned with the representation of query image.
   Especially a feature pattern dictionary, which captures structured
   information and prior knowledge of image features, are constructed to
   represent the unknown feature pattern weight of a query image. An
   efficient algorithm to solve JRPL was also presented in this paper. The
   experiments of face recognition with various variations and occlusions
   on several benchmark datasets clearly show the advantage of the proposed
   JRPL in accuracy and efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{P311, a gene that was identified in 1993, has been found to have diverse
   biological functions in processes such as cell proliferation, migration
   and differentiation. However, its role in fibrosis is unknown. We
   previously observed that P311 is highly expressed in skin hypertrophic
   scars. In this study, P311 over-expression was detected in a subset of
   tubular epithelial cells in clinical biopsy specimens of renal fibrosis;
   this over-expression, was found concurrent with a-smooth muscle actin
   (alpha-SMA) and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF beta 1)
   expression. Subsequently, these results were verified in a mouse
   experimental renal fibrosis model induced by unilateral ureteral
   obstruction. The interstitial deposition of collagen, alpha-SMA and
   TGF-beta 1 expression, and macrophage infiltration were dramatically
   decreased when P311 was knocked out. Moreover, TGF beta/Smad signaling
   had a critical effect on the promotion of renal fibrosis by P311. In
   conclusion, this study demonstrate that P311 plays a key role in renal
   fibrosis via TGF beta 1/Smad signaling, which could be a novel target
   for the management of renal fibrosis.}},

Abstract = {{WSiN coatings with silicon content ranging from 0 to 27.7 at.\% were
   deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering technique. The structure,
   mechanical, tribological properties and corrosion performance were
   investigated by XPS, XRD, SEM, HRTEM, nano-indentation CSM, ball-on-disc
   tribo-meter, AFM, Bruker 3D Profiler and corrosion testers. The results
   indicated that the incorporation of silicon did not affect the cubic
   structure. WSiN coatings consist of WSiN and amorphous Si3 N4 phases.
   The incorporation of silicon induced the crystallite size refinement and
   reduced the average roughness. The growth pattern changed from
   continuous columnar to discontinuous columnar. The hardness first
   increased and then decreased. The highest hardness of 37.0 GPa was
   maintained as the silicon content was 13.4 at.\%. The friction
   coefficient and wear rate of WSiN coatings first decreased and then
   increased with increasing silicon content. The best wear resistance was
   found for the coating which has the highest hardness. The corrosion
   resistance of the substrate which coated with W2N or WSiN coatings was
   superior to the bare substrate. The corrosion resistance of the W2N
   coatings was improved by doping some silicon content. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Through the incorporation of Pb2+ into the {[}Bi2O2] layers, the

   refinement and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron
   microscope investigations. The photo-decomposition experiments
   demonstrated that BiPbO2Cl nanosheet exhibits high photocatalytic

Title = {{Modelling the potential role of forest thinning in maintaining water
   supplies under a changing climate across the conterminous United States}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},

Number = {{24, SI}},

Note = {{3rd International Conference on Forests and Water in a Changing
   Environment, Fukuoka, JAPAN, 2012}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to test the sensitivity of water yield to
   forest thinning and other forest management/disturbances and climate
   across the conterminous United States (CONUS). Leaf area index (LAI) was
   selected as a key parameter linking changes in forest ecosystem
   structure and functions. We used the Water Supply Stress Index model to
   examine water yield response under 18 scenarios that combine
   hypothetical LAI changes (+10\%, +/- 20\%, -50\%, and -80\%), uniform
   increases in temperature (+1 degrees C and +2 degrees C) and
   precipitation change (+/- 10\%), and four climate change scenarios
   projected by general circulation models (GCMs) for the year 2050.
   Approximately 2100 large basins produced approximately 2003 billion
   cubic metres of water annually from 2002 to 2007. Forest lands covered
   23\% of the land surface area, but contributed 43\% of the total water
   yield for the CONUS. As a whole, water yield increased by 3\%, 8\%, and
   13\% when LAI was reduced 20\%, 50\%, and 80\%, respectively, while
   water yield decreased by 3\% when LAI increased by 20\%. Temperature
   increases of 2 degrees C alone could decrease water yield by 11\%. A
   reduction of precipitation by 10\% and 20\% could result in a decrease
   of water yield by 20\% and 39\%, respectively. The direction and
   magnitude of water yield response to the combinations of LAI (+10\%),
   climate warming (+1 degrees C), and precipitation change (+/- 10\%) were
   dominated by the change in precipitation. Climate change projected by
   the four GCMs (CSIROMK2 B2, CSIROMK3.5 A1B, HADCM3 B2, and MIROC32 A1B)
   resulted in a large change in water yield (+18\% to -64\%) by 2045-2055
   when compared with the baseline. A 50\% reduction in forest LAI under
   the four GCMs scenarios could greatly mitigate or exacerbate future
   climate change impacts on water yield in forest-dominated watersheds
   with high precipitation. This study provides the first quantitative
   estimate of the effects of forest thinning options on water yield under
   future climate across the CONUS. Effective forest water management for
   climate mitigation should focus on those watersheds identified.

Title = {{Characterization of saline dust emission resulted from Urmia Lake drying}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{Compared with common dust storms, saline dust storms transport high
   concentrations of fine-grain saline and alkaline material. The saline
   dust storm differs from common dust storm, especially considering the
   sources of the suspended particulate matter (PM), chemical composition,
   grain size, and circulation processes. Atmospheric particulate matters
   (TSP, PM10, PM2.5, and PM1) and their water-soluble ions were
   concurrently measured at two sites located at north and southeast part
   of Urmia lake from January 2013 to September 2013. Particulate matters
   (PMs) were measured using high volume sampler and HAZ-DUST EPAM-5000
   particulate air monitors. In both of the sampling sites, the highest
   concentration of PM was observed during the summer season (521.6, 329.1,
   42.6, and 36.5 for TSP, PM10, PM2.5, and PM1, respectively). A total of
   11 inorganic water-soluble ions in the TSP and PM10 were identified by
   ion chromatography (IC). No statistically significant difference was
   found between PM's ions concentrations of two sampling sites. The
   average of the total measured water-soluble ions in the sampling sites
   was 28.75 +/- 12.9 mu g/m(3) (11.9 +/- 4.8\% of total TSP mass) for TSP
   and 14.65 +/- 7.1 mu g/m(3) (8.7 +/- 4.4 of total PM10 mass) for PM10.
   Among all detected ions, sulfate was the dominant constituent followed
   by nitrate and sodium. This study showed that the water soluble salts
   compose 3-20\% of the total mass of TSP and PM10. The PCA analysis
   showed that saline particulates formed from Urmia lake bed were the
   dominant source (57.6 \%) of TSP. In addition, saline particulates
   together with crustal materials resulted from resuspension were the main
   source (59.9\%) of PM10.}},

Abstract = {{Biomedical imaging-guided cancer therapy should have capabilities of
   both accurate tumor diagnosis and high therapeutic efficacy for the
   personalized treatment. Various biomedical imaging-guided cancer
   therapies are currently being investigated to overcome current
   limitations that include low sensitivity of diagnosis and poor drug
   delivery to the tumor site. Here, we report the development of a
   multifunctional theranostic contrast agent demonstrating high sensitive
   photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging and effective local delivery of
   anticancer drug to a tumor site. A microbubble (porphyrin-MB) was
   developed using phospholipid-porphyrin conjugates to enhance ultrasound
   and photoacoustic signal intensities simultaneously. Paclitaxel-loaded
   human serum albumin nanoparticles (PTX-HSA-NPs) were then conjugated
   onto the surface of the microbubble. The developed PTX-HSA-NPs
   conjugated porphyrin-MB (porphyrin-MB-NPs) provided sensitive, dual
   modal images of a tumor at 700 nm optimal laser wavelength for
   photoacoustic imaging and 5-14 MHz operating frequency for the
   ultrasound imaging. In addition, porphyrin-MB-NPs efficiently suppressed
   tumor growth by ultrasound exposure. Exposure to the focused ultrasound
   triggered the collapse of porphyrin-MB-NPs, resulting in the local
   release of PTX-HSA-NPs and enhanced penetration into the tumor site. The
   increased preferential accumulation and penetration of PTX-HSA-NPs
   suppressed tumor growth 10-fold more than without exposure to
   ultrasound. In conclusion, the developed porphyrin-MB-NPs establish a
   new paradigm in simultaneous bi-functional ultrasound/photoacoustic
   imaging diagnosis and locally triggered release of nanomedicine and
   enhanced chemotherapy efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{AIM: To compare the mid-term outcomes of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy
   (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) in obese Korean
   patients.
   METHODS: All consecutive patients who underwent either LSG or LRYGB with
   primary to treat morbid obesity between January 2011 and December 2012
   were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) >=
   30 kg/m(2) with inadequately controlled obesity-related comorbidities
   (e.g., diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, or
   obesity-related arthropathy) or BMI >= 35 kg/m2 were considered for
   bariatric surgery according to the International Federation for the
   Surgery of Obesity-Asia Pacific Chapter Consensus statements in 2011.
   The decision regarding the procedure type was made on an individual
   basis following extensive discussion with the patient about the specific
   risks associated with each procedure. All operative procedures were
   performed laparoscopically by a single surgeon experienced in upper
   gastrointestinal surgeries. Baseline demographics, perioperative
   surgical outcomes, and postoperative anthropometric data from a
   prospectively established database were thoroughly reviewed and compared
   between the two surgical approaches.
   RESULTS: One hundred four patients underwent LSG, and 236 underwent
   LRYGB. Preoperative BMI in the LSG group was significantly higher than
   that of the LRYGB group (38.6 kg/m2 vs 37.2 kg/m2, P = 0.024). Patients
   with diabetes were more prevalent in the LRYGB group (18.3\% vs 35.6\%,
   P = 0.001). Operating time and hospital stay were significantly shorter
   in the LSG group compared with the LRYGB group (100 min vs 130 min, P <
   0.001; 1 d vs 2 d, P = 0.003), but the incidence of perioperative
   complications was similar between the groups (P = 0.351). The mean
   percentage of excess weight loss (\%EWL) was 71.2\% for LRYGB, while it
   was 63.5\% for LSG, at mean follow-up periods of 18.0 and 21.0 mo,
   respectively (P = 0.073). The \%EWL at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 mo
   was equivalent between the groups. Four patients required surgical
   revision after LSG (4.8\%), while revision was only required in one case
   following LRYGB (0.4\%; P = 0.011).
   CONCLUSION: Both LSG and LRYGB are effective procedures that induce
   comparable weight loss in the mid-term and similar surgical risks,
   except for the higher revision rate after LSG.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{We report the static and dynamic magnetic characteristics of a
   high-layer-number NiFe/FeMn multilayer test structure with potential
   applications in broadband absorber and filter devices. To allow fine
   control over the absorption linewidths and to understand the mechanisms
   governing the resonances in a tailored structure similar to that
   expected to be used in real world applications, the multilayer was
   intentionally designed to have layer thickness and interface roughness
   variations. Magnetometry measurements show that the sample has complex
   hysteresis loops with features consistent with single ferromagnetic film
   reversals. Characterisation by transmission electron microscopy allows
   us to correlate the magnetic properties with structural features,
   including the film widths and interface roughnesses. Analysis of
   resonance frequencies from broadband ferromagnetic resonance
   measurements as a function of field magnitude and orientation provide
   values of the local exchange bias, rotatable anisotropy, and uniaxial
   anisotropy fields for specific layers in the stack and explain the
   observed mode softening. The linewidths of the multilayer are adjustable
   around the bias field, approaching twice that seen at larger fields,
   allowing control over the bandwidth of devices formed from the
   structure. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Objective:Given that people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) often engage in
   prohibited income generation to support their basic needs, we sought to
   examine the role of these activities in shaping antiretroviral therapy
   (ART) adherence and plasma HIV RNA-1 viral load suppression among
   HIV-infected PWUD.Design:Longitudinal analyses among HIV-positive,
   ART-exposed PWUD in the AIDS Care Cohort to evaluate Exposure to
   Survival Services prospective cohort study
   (2005-2013).Methods:Generalized linear mixed-effects and mediation
   analyses examined the relationship between prohibited income generation
   (e.g., sex work, drug dealing, theft, street-based income) and virologic
   suppression (plasma viral load 50copies/ml plasma) adjusting for
   adherence and potential confounders.Results:Among 687 HIV-infected PWUD,
   391 (56.9\%) individuals reported prohibited income generation activity
   during the study period. In multivariate analyses, prohibited income
   generation remained independently and negatively associated with
   virologic suppression (adjusted odds ratio: 0.68, 95\% confidence
   interval: 0.52-0.88) following adjustment for hypothesized confounders,
   including high-intensity drug use, ART adherence and homelessness.
   Although partially mediated by ART adherence, the relationship between
   prohibited income generation and virologic suppression was maintained in
   mediation analyses (Sobel statistic=-1.95,
   P=0.05).Conclusion:Involvement in prohibited income generation decreases
   the likelihood of virologic suppression directly and indirectly through
   its negative association with ART adherence. These findings suggest that
   linkages between socioeconomic marginalization, the criminalization of
   illicit drug use, and insufficient employment opportunities may produce
   barriers to access and retention in care. Programmatic and policy
   interventions that decrease socioeconomic vulnerability may therefore
   reduce HIV-related morbidity, mortality, and onward transmission.}},

Abstract = {{A 66-year-old female presented with the main complaint of defecation
   trouble and abdominal distention. With diagnosis of rectal cancer, cSS,
   cN0, cH0, cP0, cM0 cStage II, Hartmann's operation with D3 lymph node
   dissection was performed and a para-aortic lymph node and a disseminated
   node near the primary tumor were resected. Histological examination
   showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, pSS, pN3, pH0, pP1, pM1
   (para-aortic lymph node, dissemination) fStage IV. After the operation,
   the patient received chemotherapy with FOLFIRI regimen. After 12 cycles
   of FOLFIRI regimen, computed tomography (CT) detected an 11 mm of liver
   metastasis in the posteroinferior segment of right hepatic lobe. With
   diagnosis of liver metastatic recurrence, we performed partial
   hepatectomy. Histological examination revealed moderately differentiated
   adenocarcinoma as a metastatic rectal cancer with cut end
   microscopically positive. After the second operation, the patient
   received chemotherapy with TS1 alone for 2 years. Ten months after the
   break, CT detected a 20 mm of paraaortic lymph node metastasis and a 10
   mm of lymph node metastasis at the hepato-duodenal ligament. With
   diagnosis of lymph node metastatic recurrences, we performed lymph node
   dissection. Histological examination revealed moderately differentiated
   adenocarcinoma as metastatic rectal cancer in paraaortic and
   hepato-duodenal ligament areas. After the third operation, we started
   chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX6 regimen. After 2 cycles of modified
   FOLFOX6 regimen, due to the onset of neutropenia and liver dysfunction,
   we switched to capecitabine alone and continued it for 6 mo and then
   stopped. Eleven months after the break, CT detected two swelling 12 mm
   of lymph nodes at the left supraclavicular region. With diagnosis of
   Virchow lymph node metastatic recurrence, we started chemotherapy with
   capecitabine plus bevacizumab regimen. Due to the onset of neutropenia
   and hand foot syndrome (Grade 3), we managed to continue capecitabine
   administration with extension of interval period and dose reduction.
   After 2 years and 2 mo from starting capecitabine plus bevacizumab

Abstract = {{In fold and thrust belts drainage organization and patterns of
   sedimentation depend conceptually on the ability or not for preexisting
   reaches to incise uplifting thrust sheets. In this study we investigate
   experimentally the dynamics of drainage network in a wedge submitted to
   shortening and erosion. It allows us to reproduce and to monitor the
   interactions between tectonics, erosion and sedimentation during the
   development of up to five successive thrust sheets. In the experiments
   channels adjust to uplift rate by both increasing their slope and
   narrowing their channels as it is observed in nature. The series of
   experiments shows that the proportion of persistent preexisting
   transverse channels increases with the ratio of rainfall over shortening
   rates. The experiments confirm the view that the competition between
   discharge and tectonic uplift controls along-strike variations in
   sediment flux in sedimentary basins by controlling the drainage
   organization. If the transverse channels draining a wedge are not
   diverted, a line-source dispersal system develops in front of the active
   structure. If channels are diverted in the backlimb of the frontal
   structure it results in point-sourced depositional systems separated by
   areas fed only by small channels developing in the front of the wedge.
   Fans accumulated in front of the active structures reveal two stages of
   sedimentation, one of progradation, while the frontal structure is
   active and a second one of valley bacicfilling and thrust sealing during
   internal deformation of the wedge. The experiments also suggest that
   spatial variations in rock uplift rate along a thrust front may be
   evidenced by minimum-discharge variations of persistent transverse
   channels. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   technologically relevant elevated temperatures, near-ambient pressures
   and near-stoichiometric feeds both facets exhibit almost identical

Abstract = {{Objective:The objective of this study is to understand the spread of HIV
   among and between age and racial/ethnic groups of men who engage in
   male-to-male sexual contact (MSM) in the United States.Design:An
   analysis of HIV-1 pol sequences for MSM collected through the US
   National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) during
   2001-2012.Methods:Pairwise genetic distance was calculated to determine
   potential transmission partners (those with very closely related
   nucleotide sequences, i.e. distance 1.5\%). We described race/ethnicity
   and age of potential transmission partners of MSM.Results:Of 23048 MSM
   with HIV sequences submitted to NHSS during 2000-2012, we identified
   potential transmission partners for 8880 (39\%). Most potential
   transmission partners were of the same race/ethnicity (78\% for
   blacks/African-Americans, 64\% for whites and 49\% for
   Hispanics/Latinos). This assortative mixing was even more pronounced in
   the youngest age groups. Significantly fewer young
   black/African-American and Hispanic/Latino MSM had older potential
   transmission partners than young white
   MSM.Conclusion:Black/African-American MSM, who are more profoundly
   affected by HIV, were more likely to have potential HIV transmission
   partners who were of the same race/ethnicity and similar in age,
   suggesting that disparities in HIV infections are in large part not due
   to age-disassortative relationships. Concerted efforts to increase
   access to preexposure prophylaxis, quality HIV care and effective
   treatment are needed to interrupt transmission chains among young,
   black/African-American MSM. Copyright (C) 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health,

Abstract = {{Periods of 24 h over-water weakening during 1982-2013 for North Atlantic
   (NAL) and eastern North Pacific (ENP) tropical cyclones (TCs) are
   examined to determine a threshold for rapid weakening (RW). These
   periods are defined by consistent weakening while the TC center remained
   more than 50 km from land. Weakening thresholds of 25, 30, and 35 kt
   represent the 87th (69th), 94th (80th), and 97th (89th) percentile in
   the NAL (ENP). Based on these statistics, the 30 kt threshold is chosen
   to define RW. Compared to all weakening periods, RW events are generally
   associated with greater 24 h official forecast errors, and these errors
   tend to be overestimates in both basins. These events usually occur as
   the TC crosses a sharp sea surface temperature gradient, encounters
   greater vertical wind shear, and entrains drier air. These metrics may
   be useful to forecasters assessing the likelihood of RW.}},

   The angular-dependent longitudinal resistivity resolves into a two-fold
   term, which varies as a function of current direction, and a four-fold
   term, which is isotropically independent of current direction. The
   experimental results are interpreted well using an expression based on
   the phenomenological model. Both the two-and four-fold terms vary
   inversely proportional to film thickness, indicating that interfacial

Abstract = {{Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is sporadic (SALS) in 90\% of cases and
   has complex environmental and genetic influences. Nogo protein inhibits
   neurite outgrowth and is overexpressed in muscle in ALS. Our aims were
   to study the reticulon 4 receptor gene RTN4R which encodes Nogo 1
   receptor (NgR1) in SALS, to test if the variants were associated with
   variable expression of the gene and whether NgR1 protein expression was
   modified in a transgenic mouse model of ALS. We genotyped three single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs701421, rs701427, and rs1567871) of
   the RTN4R gene in 364 SALS French patients and 430 controls. We examined
   expression of RTN4R mRNA by quantitative PCR in control post mortem
   human brain tissue. We determined the expression of NgR1 protein in
   spinal motor neurons from a SOD1 G86R ALS mouse model. We observed
   significant associations between SALS and RTN4R alleles. Messenger RNA
   expression from RTN4R in human cortical brain tissue correlated
   significantly with the genotypes of rs701427. NgR1 protein expression
   was reduced in Nogo A positive motor neurons from diseased transgenic
   animals. In conclusion, these observations suggest that a functional
   RTN4R gene variant is associated with SALS. This variant may act in
   concert with other genetic variants or environmental influences.}},

Abstract = {{The high anatomical contrast achieved with the newly emerging MRI
   tractographic technique of super-resolution track density imaging (TDI)
   encouraged us to search for a new fiber tract in the septum pellucidum.
   Although this septum pellucidum tract (SPT) has been observed
   previously, its connections were unclear due to ambiguity and limited
   resolution of conventional MRI images. It is now possible to identify
   detailed parts of SPT with the increased resolution of TDI, which
   involves diffusion MRI imaging, whole-brain tractography, and voxel
   subdivision using the track-count information. Four healthy male
   subjects were included in the study. The experiment was performed with
   TOT MRI, following the guidelines of the institute's institutional
   review board. Data were processed with the super resolution TDI
   technique to generate a tractographic map with 0.18 mm isotropic
   resolution. The SPT was identified in all subjects. Based on additional
   seed tracking method with inter-axis correlation search, we have
   succeeded in identifying a new frontal lobe pathway in the SPT. We
   hypothesize that the tract is connected as a superior dorsal branch of
   the fornix that leads to the prefrontal cortex.}},

Title = {{Cultured enterocytes internalise bacteria across their basolateral
   surface for, pathogen-inhibitable, trafficking to the apical compartment}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{In vitro- and in vivo-polarised absorptive epithelia (enterocytes) are
   considered to be non-phagocytic towards bacteria with invasive
   pathogenic strains relying on virulence factors to `force' entry. Here,
   we report a serendipitous discovery that questions these beliefs. Thus,
   we uncover in well-established models of human small (Caco-2; TC-7) and
   large (T84) intestinal enterocytes a polarization-dependent mechanism
   that can transfer millions of bacteria from the basal to apical
   compartment. Antibiotic-protection assays, confocal imaging and drug
   inhibitor data are consistent with a transcellular route in which
   internalized, basolateral-membrane enclosed bacteria are trafficked to
   and across the apical surface. Basal-to-apical transport of
   non-pathogenic bacteria (and inert beads) challenged the idea of
   pathogens relying on virulence factors to force entry. Indeed, studies
   with Salmonella demonstrated that it's entry-forcing virulence factor
   (SPI-I) was not required to enter via the basolateral surface but to
   promote another virulence-associated event (intra-enterocyte
   accumulation).}},

Title = {{Using concept mapping to evaluate knowledge structure in problem-based
   learning}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many educational programs incorporate problem-based learning
   (PBL) to promote students' learning; however, the knowledge structure
   developed in PBL remains unclear. The aim of this study was to use
   concept mapping to generate an understanding of the use of PBL in the
   development of knowledge structures.
   Methods: Using a quasi-experimental study design, we employed concept
   mapping to illustrate the effects of PBL by examining the patterns of
   concepts and differences in the knowledge structures of students taught
   with and without a PBL approach. Fifty-two occupational therapy
   undergraduates were involved in the study and were randomly divided into
   PBL and control groups. The PBL group was given two case scenarios for
   small group discussion, while the control group continued with ordinary
   teaching and learning. Students were asked to make concept maps after
   being taught about knowledge structure. A descriptive analysis of the
   morphology of concept maps was conducted in order to compare the
   integration of the students' knowledge structures, and statistical
   analyses were done to understand the differences between groups.
   Results: Three categories of concept maps were identified as follows:
   isolated, departmental, and integrated. The students in the control
   group constructed more isolated maps, while the students in the PBL
   group tended toward integrated mapping. Concept Relationships, Hierarchy
   Levels, and Cross Linkages in the concept maps were significantly
   greater in the PBL group; however, examples of concept maps did not
   differ significantly between the two groups.
   Conclusions: The data indicated that PBL had a strong effect on the
   acquisition and integration of knowledge. The important properties of
   PBL, including situational learning, problem spaces, and small group
   interactions, can help students to acquire more concepts, achieve an
   integrated knowledge structure, and enhance clinical reasoning.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructures, high-temperature mechanical properties, and
   fracture behavior of Mg-Gd-Y-Zr alloy components produced by
   low-pressure sand casting with different Gd and Zr contents, have been
   investigated. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS), tensile yield
   strength, and total elongation (EL) were measured within the 25-300
   degrees C range. At the same temperatures, the UTS and yield strength
   (YS) of the T6 treated Mg-xGd-3Y-0.5Zr alloys increased with Gd content
   increasing from 9 to 11\%, which was attributed to the improvement of
   precipitation strengthening. Increasing the Zr content from 0.3 to 0.5\%
   leads to dramatic decrease in grain size and improved tensile properties
   of T6 treated Mg-10Gd-3Y-yZr alloys which is considered to be due to
   grain-boundary strengthening. With the increase of tensile temperature,
   both UTS and YS of the T6 treated Mg-xGd-3Y-yZr alloys initially
   increase and then decrease. The beta' precipitates provide important
   strengthening sources in experimental alloys, especially at elevated
   temperatures. The Mg-10Gd-3Y-0.5Zr alloy shows good combination of
   strength and EL within the 25-300 degrees C range.}},

Title = {{Seasonal Patterns of Fine Root Production and Turnover in a Mature
   Rubber Tree (Hevea brasiliensis Mull. Arg.) Stand- Differentiation with
   Soil Depth and Implications for Soil Carbon Stocks}},

Abstract = {{Fine root dynamics is a main driver of soil carbon stocks, particularly
   in tropical forests, yet major uncertainties still surround estimates of
   fine root production and turnover. This lack of knowledge is largely due
   to the fact that studying root dynamics in situ, particularly deep in
   the soil, remains highly challenging. We explored the interactions
   between fine root dynamics, soil depth, and rainfall in mature rubber
   trees (Hevea brasiliensis Mull. Arg.) exposed to sub optimal edaphic and
   climatic conditions. A root observation access well was installed in
   northern Thailand to monitor root dynamics along a 4.5 m deep soil
   profile. Image-based measurements of root elongation and lifespan of
   individual roots were carried out at monthly intervals over 3 years.
   Soil depth was found to have a significant effect on root turnover.
   Surprisingly, root turnover increased with soil depth and root half-life
   was 16, 6-8, and only 4 months at 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 3.0 m deep,
   respectively (with the exception of roots at 4.5 m which had a half-life
   similar to that found between depths of 1.0 and 2.5 m). Within the first
   two meters of the soil profile, the highest rates of root emergence
   occurred about 3 months after the onset of the rainy season, while
   deeper in the soil, root emergence was not linked to the rainfall
   pattern. Root emergence was limited during leaf flushing (between March
   and May), particularly within the first two meters of the profile.
   Between soil depths of 0.5 and 2.0 m, root mortality appeared
   independent of variations in root emergence, but below 2.0 m, peaks in
   root emergence and death were synchronized. Shallow parts of the root
   system were more responsive to rainfall than their deeper counterparts.
   Increased root emergence in deep soil toward the onset of the dry season
   could correspond to a drought acclimation mechanism, with the relative
   importance of deep water capture increasing once rainfall ceased. The
   considerable soil depth regularly explored by fine roots, even though
   significantly less than in surface layers in terms of root length
   density and biomass, will impact strongly the evaluation of soil carbon
   stocks.}},

Abstract = {{CDK5RAP2 is a centrosomal protein that regulates the recruitment of a
   gamma-tubulin ring complex (gamma-TuRC) onto centrosomes and
   microtubules (MTs) dynamics as a member of MT plus-end-tracking proteins
   (+TIPs). In our previous report, we found mammalian Cep169 as a CDK5RAP2
   binding partner, and Cep169 accumulates at the distal ends of MTs and
   centrosomes, and coincides with CDK5RAP2. Depletion of Cep169 induces MT
   depolymerization, indicating that Cep169 targets MT tips and regulates
   stability and dynamics of MTs. However, how Cep169 contributes to the
   stabilization of MT remains unclear. Here we show that Cep169 is able to
   stabilize MTs and induces formation of long MT bundles with intense
   acetylation of MTs with CDK5RAP2, when expressed at higher levels in
   U2OS cells. In addition, we demonstrated that Cep169 forms homodimers
   through its N-terminal domain and directly interacts with MTs through
   its C-terminal domain. Interestingly, Cep169 mutants, which lack each
   domains, completely abolished the activity, respectively. Therefore,
   Cep169 bundles MTs and induces solid structure of MTs by crosslinking
   each adjacent MTs as a homodimer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{CD4(+) T-cell priming is an essential step in vaccination due to the key
   role of T helper cells in driving both effector and memory immune
   responses. Here we have characterized in C57BL/6 mice the T helper
   subtype differentiation among tetramer-specific CD4(+) T cells primed by
   subcutaneous immunization with the tuberculosis vaccine antigen H56 plus
   the adjuvant CAF01. Peptide-specific population identified by the MHC
   class II tetramers differentiated into several T helper subtypes upon
   antigen encounter, and the frequency of subpopulations differed
   according to their localization. Th1 (CXCR3(+)T-bet(+)), Tfh
   (CXCR5(+)PD-1(+)Bcl-6(+)) and ROR gamma t(+) cells were induced in the
   lymph nodes draining the immunization site (dLN), while Th1 cells were
   the predominant subtype in the spleen. In addition, CD4(+) T cells
   co-expressing multiple T-cell lineage-specifying transcription factors
   were also detected. In the lungs, most of the tetramer-binding T cells
   were ROR gamma t(+), while Tfh and Th1 cells were absent. After
   boosting, a higher frequency of tetramer-binding cells co-expressing the
   markers CD44 and CD127 was detected compared to primed cells, and cells
   showed a prevalent Th1 phenotype in both dLN and spleens, while Tfh
   cells were significantly reduced. In conclusion, these data demonstrate
   that parenteral immunization with H56 and CAF01 elicits a distribution
   of antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells in both lymphoid tissues and lungs,
   and gives rise to multiple T helper subtypes, that differ depending on
   localization and following reactivation. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{A quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) was developed for
   modeling the retention index of 1184 flavor and fragrance compounds
   measured using a Carbowax 20M glass capillary gas chromatography column.
   The 4885 molecular descriptors were calculated using Dragon software,
   and then were simultaneously analyzed through multivariable linear
   regression analysis using the replacement method (RM) variable subset
   selection technique. We proceeded in three steps, the first one by
   considering all descriptor blocks, the second one by excluding
   conformational descriptor blocks, and the last one by analyzing only
   3D-descriptor families. The models were validated through an external
   test set of compounds. Cross-validation methods such as leave-one-out
   and leave-many-out were applied, together with Y-randomization and
   applicability domain analysis. The developed model was used to estimate
   the I of a set of 22 molecules. The results clearly suggest that
   3D-descriptors do not offer relevant information for modeling the
   retention index, while a topological index such as the Randic-like index
   from reciprocal squared distance matrix has a high relevance for this
   purpose. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Locusts aggregate into bands of nymphs and swarms of adults that can
   pose a major threat to crop. Previous studies have shown that infection
   by the microsporidian parasite Paranosema locustae prevents locust
   aggregation behavior and we show that gut bacteria, which produce
   components of locust aggregation pheromones, are substantially reduced
   in locusts infected with P. locustae. We found that P. locustae could
   reduce the diversity, abundance and community composition of Locusta
   migratoria's gut bacteria. The parasite infection was also shown to
   interrupt the peroxidase activity of locust hindgut. Genome-wide
   expression analysis showed that the parasite infection suppressed
   peroxidase mRNA relative expression of locust hindgut, but had no
   effects on attacin expression and superoxide dismutase at 16 d
   post-inoculation with 20,000 P. locustae spores. Our findings reveal the
   mechanisms by which P. locustae impairs bacterial diversity and

Abstract = {{Antibodies targeting CTLA-4 have been successfully used as cancer

   responses specific for B. thetaiotaomicron or B. fragilis were
   associated with the efficacy of CTLA-4 blockade. Tumors in
   antibiotic-treated or germ-free mice did not respond to CTLA blockade.
   This defect was overcome by gavage with B. fragilis, by immunization
   with B. fragilis polysaccharides, or by adoptive transfer of B.
   fragilis-specific T cells. Fecal microbial transplantation from humans
   to mice confirmed that treatment of melanoma patients with antibodies
   against CTLA-4 favored the outgrowth of B. fragilis with anticancer
   properties. This study reveals a key role for Bacteroidales in the
   immunostimulatory effects of CTLA-4 blockade.}},

Abstract = {{Pheromone and plant odorants are important for insect mating, foraging
   food sources and oviposition. To understand the molecular mechanisms
   regulating pheromone and odorant signaling, we employed qRT-PCR to study
   the circadian rhythms of ABP, OBP, PBP, and OR gene expression in the
   beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua and their responses after a
   pre-exposure to sex pheromone compounds or plant volatiles. The neuronal
   responses of male S. exigua to 20 chemical compounds were recorded at
   three specific time periods using the electroantennogram. The results
   showed a circadian rhythm in the expression profiles of some
   chemosensory genes in the antennae similar to their behavioral rhythm.
   The expression profiles of OR3, OR6, OR11, OR13, OR16, OR18, Orco, ABP2,
   OBP1, OBP7, and PBP1, and EAG responses to chemical compounds, as well
   as their circadian rhythm were significantly affected after exposure to
   synthetic sex pheromones and plant volatiles. These findings provide the
   first evidence that the gene expression of chemosensory genes and
   olfactory sensitivity to sex pheromones are affected by pre-exposing
   insects to pheromone compounds and plant volatiles. It helps to
   understand the molecular mechanisms underlying pheromone activity, and
   the application of sex pheromones and plant volatiles in mating
   disruption or mass trapping.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Language is thought to represent one of the most complex cognitive
   functions in humans. Here we break down complexity of language to its
   most basic syntactic computation which hierarchically binds single words
   together to form larger phrases and sentences. So far, the neural
   implementation of this basic operation has only been inferred indirectly
   from studies investigating more complex linguistic phenomena. In the
   present sub-region based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   study we directly assessed the neuroanatomical nature of this process.
   Our results showed that syntactic phrases compared to word-list
   sequences corresponded to increased neural activity in the
   ventral-anterior portion of the left pars opercularis {[}Brodmann Area
   (BA) 44], whereas the adjacently located deep frontal operculum/anterior
   insula (FOP/aINS), a phylogenetically older and less specialized region,
   was found to be equally active for both conditions. Crucially, the
   functional activity of syntactic binding was confined to one out of five
   clusters proposed by a recent fine-grained sub-anatomical parcellation
   for BA 44, with consistency across individuals. Neuroanatomically, the
   present results call for a redefinition of BA 44 as a region with
   internal functional specializations. Neurocomputationally, they support
   the idea of invariance within BA 44 in the location of activation across
   participants for basic syntactic building processing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper draws on interviews with a group of 27 Japanese women who
   were classified as late-in-life-childbearing mothers, or krei shussan -
   women who had had their first delivery at 35 years of age or over. In
   making sense of the significance, symbolism and consequences of
   late-life motherhood, the paper utilises a symbolic interactionist
   perspective to shed light on the cultural, structural, interpersonal and
   intrapsychic dimensions underpinning the experiences of this group of
   mothers. The paper highlights the relevance of social interaction and
   everyday life that make pregnancy an obligation' for these women.
   Grounded in the Foucauldian notion of normalisation, the analysis
   suggests that the experience of late-in-life childbearing can be
   understood as the result of three forms of pressure: biological,
   homosocial and work. The late-in-life-childbearing mother largely stems
   from governmental economic neoliberalism imbued with traditional
   conservatism and the pervasive influence of the Assisted Reproduction
   Treatments industry. Este articulo se basa en entrevistas con un grupo
   de 27 mujeres japonesas clasificadas como madres anejas o krei shussan,
   mujeres que habian tenido su primer hijo a partir de los 35 anos. Para
   entender el significado, el simbolismo y las consecuencias de la
   maternidad tardia, en este articulo se utiliza una perspectiva
   interaccionista simbolica que pone de relieve las dimensiones
   culturales, estructurales, interpersonales e intrapsiquicas que forman
   la base de las experiencias de este grupo de madres. En el articulo se
   destaca la importancia de la interaccion social y la vida diaria que
   convierten el embarazo en una obligacion para estas mujeres. En base a
   la nocion foucaultiana de normalizacion, el analisis indica que la
   experiencia de la maternidad tardia puede entenderse como el resultado
   de tres formas de presion: biologica, homosocial y laboral. El motivo de
   que las madres decidan tener hijos tarde se debe al neoliberalismo
   economico y gubernamental imbuido con el conservadurismo tradicional y
   la influencia dominante de la industria de tecnicas de reproduccion
   asistida. Cet article s'appuie sur des entretiens conduits avec 27
   femmes japonaises considerees comme des meres ayant procree tard dans la
   vie ou krei shussan - des femmes qui ont accouche pour la premiere fois
   a l'age de 35 ans ou plus. Afin de donner du sens a la signification, au
   symbolisme et aux consequences de la maternite tardive, l'article
   utilise une perspective interactionniste symbolique pour eclairer les
   dimensions culturelles, structurelles, interpersonnelles et
   intrapsychiques qui etayent les experiences de cette population de
   meres. L'article souligne la pertinence de l'interaction sociale et de
   la vie quotidienne qui font de la grossesse une << obligation >> pour
   ces femmes. Ancree dans la notion foucaldienne de la << normalisation
   >>, l'analyse des resultats suggere que l'experience de la procreation a
   un stade tardif de la vie peut etre comprise comme le resultat de trois
   formes de pression: biologique, homosociale et en rapport avec le
   travail. La mere qui procreee tardivement dans la vie provient en grande

Title = {{Ozone detoxification of steam-pretreated Norway spruce}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pretreatment of lignocellulose for biochemical conversion
   commonly results in formation of by-products that inhibit microorganisms
   and cellulolytic enzymes. To make bioconversion processes more
   efficient, inhibition problems can be alleviated through conditioning.
   Ozone is currently commercially employed in pulp and paper production
   for bleaching, as it offers the desirable capability to disrupt
   unsaturated bonds in lignin through an ionic reaction known as
   ozonolysis. Ozonolysis is more selective towards lignin than cellulose,
   for instance, when compared to other oxidative treatment methods, such
   as Fenton's reagent. Ozone may thus have desirable properties for
   conditioning of pretreated lignocellulose without concomitant
   degradation of cellulose or sugars. Ozone treatment of SO2- impregnated
   steam-pretreated Norway spruce was explored as a potential approach to
   decrease inhibition of yeast and cellulolytic enzymes. This novel
   approach was furthermore compared to some of the most effective methods
   for conditioning of pretreated lignocellulose, i.e., treatment with
   alkali and sodium dithionite.
   Results: Low dosages of ozone decreased the total contents of phenolics
   to about half of the initial value and improved the fermentability.
   Increasing ozone dosages led to almost proportional increase in the
   contents of total acids, including formic acid, which ultimately led to
   poor fermentability at higher ozone dosages. The decrease of the
   contents of furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural was inversely
   proportional (R-2 > 0.99) to the duration of the ozone treatment, but
   exhibited no connection with the fermentability. Ozone detoxification
   was compared with other detoxification methods and was superior to
   treatment with Fenton's reagent, which exhibited no positive effect on
   fermentability. However, ozone detoxification was less efficient than
   treatment with alkali or sodium dithionite. High ozone dosages decreased
   the inhibition of cellulolytic enzymes as the glucose yield was improved
   with 13 \% compared to that of an untreated control.
   Conclusions: Low dosages of ozone were beneficial for the fermentation
   of steam-pretreated Norway spruce, while high dosages decreased the
   inhibition of cellulolytic enzymes by soluble components in the
   pretreatment liquid. While clearly of interest for conditioning of
   lignocellulosic hydrolysates, future challenges include finding

Abstract = {{Familial clustering of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and acute
   myeloid leukemia (AML) can be caused by inherited factors. We screened
   59 individuals from 17 families with 2 or more biological relatives with
   MDS/AML for variants in 12 genes with established roles in
   predisposition to MDS/AML, and identified a pathogenic germ line variant
   in 5 families (29\%). Extending the screen with a panel of 264 genes
   that are recurrently mutated in de novo AML, we identified rare,
   nonsynonymous germ line variants in 4 genes, each segregating with
   MDS/AML in 2 families. Somatic mutations are required for progression to
   MDS/AML in these familial cases. Using a combination of targeted and
   exome sequencing of tumor and matched normal samples from 26 familial
   MDS/AML cases and asymptomatic carriers, we identified recurrent
   frameshift mutations in the cohesin-associated factor PDS5B,
   co-occurrence of somatic ASXL1 mutations with germ line GATA2 mutations,
   and recurrent mutations in other known MDS/AML drivers. Mutations in
   genes that are recurrently mutated in de novo AML were underrepresented
   in the familial MDS/AML cases, although the total number of somatic
   mutations per exome was the same. Lastly, clonal skewing of
   hematopoiesis was detected in 67\% of young, potential biomarker that
   could be used for surveillance in these high-risk families.}},

   of minimizing the incentives for athletes to use performance-enhancing
   drugs commonly referred to as doping. We first review the regulations
   that have already been implemented to minimize incentives to dope in
   professional sports. These traditional approaches are unable to resolve
   the doping dilemma. Rather, doping seems to be a never-ending story. We
   then present a new cost-efficient approach that is easy to implement.
   Our new approach turns a win into never-ending glory. This is achieved
   by discounting the benefits of a first place win on several grounds. As
   the net benefit of winning is not diminished, the idea of competition
   can be perpetuated.}},

Abstract = {{Blockade of immune checkpoints (ICPs) has led to impressive responses in
   cancer patients. However, the impact of preexisting immunity and ICPs on
   the risk of malignant transformation in human preneoplasia has not been
   prospectively studied. We prospectively analyzed antigen-specific
   BIT-cell immunity, immune composition of the tumor microenvironment, and
   the expression of a panel of ICPs on tumor and tumor-infiltrating immune
   cells in 305 patients with asymptomatic monoclonal gammopathy enrolled
   in S0120 under the auspices of SWOG. T-cell immunity against stem-cell
   antigen SOX2 and preserved humoral responses at study entry
   independently correlated with reduced risk of progression to clinical
   myeloma. Among the ICPs analyzed, expression of programmed death-ligand
   1 (PD-L1) on tumor and infiltrating T cells correlated with increased
   risk of clinical malignancy, and blockade of this pathway boosted
   anti-SOX2 immunity in culture. These data suggest that stem-cell

Abstract = {{Purpose. The study aimed to determine the extent of and factors
   influencing the prescribing of injections for the treatment of
   mild/moderate community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Mongolia.
   Methods. Questionnaires were developed and administered to medication
   providers (34 Pharmacists, 27 pharmacy technicians) and prescribers (22
   general doctors and 49 medical specialists) working in Mongolia.
   Results. Cefalosporins were prescribed for patients with mild pneumonia
   and doctors tended to prescribe injectable cefalosporins (cefazolin)
   rather than oral dosage forms. This was supported by the questionnaire
   study with pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. Additionally, 23
   pharmacists and pharmacy technicians indicated that OTC injectable
   cefalosporins (37.7\%) and injectable aminopenicillins (33,9\%) were
   frequently sold by pharmacies for the treatment of mild/moderate CAP.
   Doctors and particularly pharmacists in the questionnaire studies
   indicated choosing an injection was to avoid non-compliance problems.
   Conclusion. High levels of injectable prescribing of antibiotics were
   found in non-hospitalized patients with CAP in Mongolia. This prevalence
   level indicated that inappropriate injection prescribing is a public
   health hazard for Mongolia and requires consideration by the appropriate
   authorities.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Recent clinical investigations showed impaired episodic
   future thinking (EFT) abilities in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. On
   these bases, the aim of the current study was to explore the structural
   and functional correlates of EFT impairment in nondepressed MS patients.
   Method. Twenty-one nondepressed MS patients and 20 matched healthy
   controls were assessed with the adapted Autobiographical Interview (AI),
   and patients were selected on the bases of an EFT impaired score
   criterion. The 41 participants underwent a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) session, distinguishing the construction and elaboration
   phases of the experimental EFT, and the categorical control tests.
   Structural images were also acquired. Results. During the EFT fMRI task,
   increased cerebral activations were observed in patients (relative to
   healthy controls) within the EFT core network. These neural changes were
   particularly important during the construction phase of future events
   and involved mostly the prefrontal region. This was accompanied by an
   increased neural response mostly in anterior, and also posterior,
   cerebral regions, in association with the amount of detail produced by
   patients. In parallel, structural measures corroborated a main positive
   association between the prefrontal regions' volume and EFT performance.
   However, no association between the hippocampus and EFT performance was
   observed in patients, at both structural and functional levels.
   Conclusion. We have documented significant overlaps between the
   structural and functional underpinnings of EFT impairment, with a main
   role of the prefrontal region in its clinical expression in MS patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication after
   cardiac surgery (CS). Recently, neutrophil gelatinase-associated
   lipocalin (NGAL) was shown to predict AKI development earlier than serum
   creatinine, but it is not widely used in clinical practice. Fractional
   excretion of urea (FeU) has been referred to as a useful tool to
   discriminate between prerenal and established AKI. The aim of our study
   is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FeU, in the early
   diagnosis of AKI in patients undergoing CS. Methods: We performed a
   prospective study on adults undergoing CS. AKI was defined by AKIN
   criteria. Individuals suffering from CKD, were excluded. Sensitivity and
   specificity of FeU, fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) and urine
   NGAL, measured at 1, 6 and 24h following CS, were assessed. Results: We
   included 66 patients (26\% female) aging 68 +/- 11 years. AKI prevalence
   was 24\% and mortality was 3.28\%. Patients with AKI had a significantly
   lower FeU compared to those without AKI (23.89 +/- 0.67\% vs. 34.22 +/-

   NGAL was also statistically significant between both groups. FeU showed
   a 75\% sensitivity and 79.5\% specificity; the AUC was 0.786. ROC

Abstract = {{Both orthosteric and allosteric antagonists of the group II metabotropic
   glutamate receptors (mGlus) have been used to establish a link between
   mGlu(2/3) inhibition and a variety of CNS diseases and disorders. Though
   these tools typically have good selectivity for mGlu(2/3) versus the
   remaining six members of the mGlu family, compounds that are selective
   for only one of the individual group II mGlus have proved elusive.
   Herein we report on the discovery of a potent and highly selective mGlu2
   negative allosteric modulator 58 (VU6001192) from a series of
   4-oxo-1-aryl-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamides. The concept for the
   design of this series centered on morphing a quinoline series recently
   disclosed in the patent literature into a chemotype previously used for
   the preparation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype 1 positive
   allosteric modulators. Compound 58 exhibits a favorable profile and will
   be a useful tool for understanding the biological implications of
   selective inhibition of mGlu2 in the CNS.}},

Abstract = {{Bi2O3 in its fluorite-like form can be obtained either at 730-824
   degrees C, showing the highest oxide-ion conduction known so far, or by
   doping. We present a comprehensive appraisal of the local atomic
   structure of Ta-doped Bi2O3 investigating by X-ray absorption
   spectroscopy the aggregation motifs of Ta5+ and the interaction between
   dopants and oxygen vacancies. Using periodic density functional theory
   simulations, we show that the connection of Ta4O18 aggregates is
   energetically favorable. We find that the local coordination of Bi3+ and
   its electronic structure, as seen from the calculated density of states
   (DOS), are invariably determined by the Bi 6s(2) lone pair in both doped
   and undoped Bi2O3. This does not depend on the long-range symmetry that
   is revealed by X-ray diffraction studies. From the similarity of the DOS
   of alpha-Bi2O3 and Ta-doped bismuth oxide, it is inferred that the force
   governing the local coordination of Bi is essentially the same in all
   forms of Bi2O3. As the local Bi environment, determined by X-ray
   absorption spectroscopy, is also found to be very similar in all
   investigated samples, regardless of the dopant concentration, the local
   mechanism of oxide ion diffusion is arguably similar in doped and
   undoped bismuth oxide.}},

Pages = {{4173-4177}},

Abstract = {{An updated technique to develop biofidelity response corridors (BRCs) is
   presented. BRCs provide a representative range of time-dependent
   responses from multiple experimental tests of a parameter from multiple
   biological surrogates (often cadaveric). The study describes an approach
   for BRC development based on previous research, but that includes two
   key modifications for application to impact and accelerative loading.
   First, signal alignment conducted prior to calculation of the BRC
   considers only the loading portion of the signal, as opposed to the full
   time history. Second, a point-wise normalization (PWN) technique is
   introduced to calculate correlation coefficients between signals. The
   PWN equally weighs all time points within the loading portion of the
   signals and as such, bypasses aspects of the response that are not
   controlled by the experimentalist such as internal dynamics of the
   specimen, and interaction with surrounding structures. An application of
   the method is presented using previously-published thoracic loading data
   from 8 lateral sled PMHS tests conducted at 8.9 m/s. Using this method,
   the mean signals showed a peak lateral load of 8.48 kN and peak chest
   acceleration of 86.0 g which were similar to previously-published
   research (8.93 kN and 100.0 g respectively). The peaks occurred at
   similar times in the current and previous studies, but were delayed an
   average of 2.1 ms in the updated method. The mean time shifts calculated
   with the method ranged from 7.5\% to 9.5\%. of the event. The method may
   be of use in traditional injury biomechanics studies and emerging work
   on non-horizontal accelerative loading. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Exploring end of life priorities in Saudi males: usefulness of
   Q-methodology}},
Journal = {{BMC PALLIATIVE CARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Quality end-of-life care depends on understanding patients'
   end-of-life choices. Individuals and cultures may hold end-of-life
   priorities at different hierarchy. Forced ranking rather than
   independent rating, and by-person factor analysis rather than averaging
   may reveal otherwise masked typologies.
   Methods: We explored Saudi males' forced-ranked, end-of-life priorities
   and dis-priorities. Respondents (n = 120) rank-ordered 47 opinion
   statements on end-of-life care following a 9-category symmetrical
   distribution. Statements' scores were analyzed by averaging analysis and
   factor analysis (Q-methodology).
   Results: Respondents' mean age was 32.1 years (range, 18-65); 52 \%
   reported average religiosity, 88 and 83 \% = very good health and
   life-quality, respectively, and 100 \% >= high school education.
   Averaging analysis revealed that the extreme five end-of-life priorities
   were to, be at peace with God, be able to say the statement of faith,
   maintain dignity, resolve conflicts, and have religious death rituals
   respected, respectively. The extreme five dis-priorities were to, die in
   the hospital, not receive intensive care if in coma, die at peak of
   life, be informed about impending death by family/friends rather than
   doctor, and keep medical status confidential from family/friends,
   respectively. Q-methodology classified 67 \% of respondents into five
   highly transcendent opinion types. Type-I (rituals-averse,
   family-caring, monitoring-coping, life-quality-concerned) and Type-V
   (rituals-apt, family-centered, neutral-coping, life-quantity-concerned)
   reported the lowest and highest religiosity, respectively. Type-II
   (rituals-apt, family-dependent, monitoring-coping,
   life-quantity-concerned) and Type-III (rituals-silent,
   self/family-neutral, avoidance-coping, life-quality \&
   quantity-concerned) reported the best and worst life-quality,
   respectively. Type-I respondents were the oldest with the lowest general
   health, in contrast to Type-IV (rituals-apt, self-centered,
   monitoring-coping, life-quality/quantity-neutral). Of the extreme 14
   priorities/dis-priorities for the five types, 29, 14, 14, 50, and 36 \%,
   respectively, were not among the extreme 20 priorities/dis-priorities
   identified by averaging analysis for the entire cohort.
   Conclusions: 1) Transcendence was the extreme end-of-life priority, and
   dying in the hospital was the extreme dis-priority. 2) Quality of life
   was conceptualized differently with less emphasize on its physiological
   aspects. 3) Disclosure of terminal illness to family/close friends was
   preferred as long it is through the patient. 4) Q-methodology identified
   five types of constellations of end-of-life priorities and
   dis-priorities that may be related to respondents' demographics and are
   partially masked by averaging analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Acute intestinal graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) refractory to
   immunosuppressive treatment is a serious complication after allogenic
   hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The underlying
   mechanisms of refractory aGVHD of the gut are not fully understood.
   Although telomere length (TL) reflects the replicative history of a
   cell, critically short telomeres have been associated with replicative
   exhaustion and tissue failure. In this study, we demonstrate that
   enterocytes of patients with refractory intestinal aGVHD show
   significantly increased proliferation, which translates into significant
   and critical telomere attrition following HSCT as compared with
   unaffected patients undergoing HSCT. Calculated telomere loss in aGVHD
   patients is 190 bp/wk, thereby massively exceeding physiological
   steady-state TL shortening rates such as in lymphocytes (similar to 50
   bp/y). Our data support the hypothesis that increased compensatory
   proliferation following continued tissue damage can result in massive
   telomere loss in enterocytes of aGVHD patients. The present study
   introduces aGVHD-triggered increased cellular turnover and telomere loss
   with subsequent replicative exhaustion as a mechanism for refractory gut
   GVHD that is compatible with the long-term clinical aspect of the
   disease and provides a basis for stem cell protective therapies in the
   treatment of aGVHD.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Cancer of unknown primary origin (CUP) is defined by the
   presence of pathologically identified metastatic disease without
   clinical or radiological evidence of a primary tumour. Our objective was
   to identify incident cases of CUP in Ontario, Canada, and determine the
   influence of histology and sites of metastases on overall survival
   (OS).Material and methods. We used the Ontario Cancer Registry (OCR) and
   the Same-Day Surgery and Discharge Abstract Database (SDS/DAD) to
   identify patients diagnosed with CUP in Ontario between 1 January 2000,
   and 31 December 2005. Patient diagnostic information, including
   histology and survival data, was obtained from the OCR. We
   cross-validated CUP diagnosis and obtained additional information about
   metastasis through data linkage with the SDS/DAD database. OS was
   assessed using Cox regression models adjusting for histology and sites
   of metastases.Results. We identified 3564 patients diagnosed with CUP.
   Patients without histologically confirmed disease (n = 1821) had a
   one-year OS of 10.9\%, whereas patients with confirmed histology (n =
   1743) had a one-year OS of 15.6\%. The most common metastatic sites were
   in the respiratory or digestive systems (n = 1603), and the most common
   histology was adenocarcinoma (n = 939). Three-year survival rates were
   3.5\%, 5.3\%, 41.6\% and 3.6\% among adenocarcinoma, unspecified
   carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and undifferentiated histology,
   respectively. Three-year survival rates were 40\%, 2.4\%, 8.0\% and
   4.6\% among patients with metastases localised to lymph nodes, the
   respiratory or digestive systems, other specified sites, and unspecified
   sites, respectively.Conclusion. CUP patients in Ontario have a poor
   prognosis. Some subgroups may have better survival rates, such as
   patients with metastases localised to lymph nodes and patients with
   squamous cell histology.}},

Title = {{Virus encoded circulatory miRNAs for early detection of prostate cancer}},
Journal = {{BMC UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer
   and kills about 28,000 American men annually. Although progress has been
   made in understanding the molecular features of different forms of the
   disease, PCa is considered incurable when it becomes resistant to
   standard therapies. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) test has been a gold
   standard of diagnosis for PCa, however, it can result in lead to the
   unnecessary biopsies and treatment of indolent cancers due to the low
   specificity. Thus, the limitations of PSA screening for PCa have
   prompted much focus on strategies how to enhance the accuracy of PSA for
   distinction between aggressive and indolent cancers.
   Discussion: Studies of miRNAs in PCa patients have suggested
   differentially expressed miRNAs between healthy controls and those with
   PCa, providing potential biomarker candidates using body fluids
   including urine and blood. Virus infection has been considered to
   associate with PCa incidence. Virus infected PCa cells may shed
   extracellular vesicles and communicate with neighboring cells, which
   were not infected yet, however, no mechanistic approaches were performed
   to understand the biology. The miRNAs composition in the shedding
   extracellular vesicles, and its role in PCa are completely undefined. In
   the near future, new insights to connect between the viral derived
   miRNAs and PCa progression might provide an opportunity to diagnose,
   risk prediction and therapeutic strategies.
   Summary: The goal of this debate article is to provide a short review on
   miRNAs, virus infection and viral encoded miRNAs in PCa, with a primary
   focus on circulating miRNAs as potential non-invasive biomarkers for PCa
   patients.}},

   targets. Experiment 1 examined whole face images and Experiment 2
   examined internal features only. Eight artists were recruited to produce
   progressions at three age ranges. Also included were averaged (morphed)
   images made of progressions of the same individual at a given range by
   different artists. Progressions across shorter ranges produced images
   more similar than those across longer ranges, and target comparisons
   yielded higher similarity ratings than foil comparisons. Although there

Abstract = {{Background. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has emerged
   as promising treatment modality for cancer based on the success of
   anti-CTLA-4 and -PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies. LAG-3 and TIM-3 are two new
   immune checkpoints. The aim of this work is to review the role and
   application of LAG-3 and TIM-3 for cancer immunotherapy.
   Material and methods. Literatures were searched and collected in
   Medline/PubMed.
   Results. LAG-3 is presented as a CD4 homolog type I transmembrane
   protein which binds MHC class II molecules. LAG-3 negatively regulates T
   cell proliferation, homeostasis and function. IMP321 is formed of an
   extracellular portion of human LAG-3 fused to the Fc fraction of human
   IgG1 and has shown increased T cell responses and tolerability in phase
   I studies on advanced renal cell cancer. When combined with paclitaxel,
   IMP321 has exerted immune enhancement and tumor inhibition with no
   significant IMP321-related adverse events. TIM-3 belongs to the TIM
   family and mainly negatively regulates Th1 immunity. The
   TIM-3/galectin-9 pathway contributes to the suppressive tumor
   microenvironment. TIM-3 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis
   in a variety of cancers. Both LAG-3 and TIM-3 are coexpressed with other
   immune checkpoints. The application of LAG-3 or TIM-3 does play an
   important role in anti-tumor responses, and maybe better when combing
   with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/L1 antibodies.
   Conclusions. These two immune checkpoints play crucial roles in cancer
   development and may be used in future clinical practice of cancer
   therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Enterococcus lactis IW5 was obtained from human gut and the potential
   probiotic characteristics of this organism were then evaluated. Results
   showed that this strain was highly resistant to low pH and high bile
   salt and adhered strongly to Caco-2 human epithelial colorectal cell
   lines. The supernatant of E. lactis IW5 strongly inhibited the growth of
   several pathogenic bacteria and decreased the viability of different
   cancer cells, such as HeLa, MCF-7, AGS, HI 29, and Caco-2. Conversely,
   E. lactis IW5 did not inhibit the viability of normal FHs-74 cells. This
   strain did not generate toxic enzymes, including 13-glucosidase,
   j3-glucuronidase, and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and was highly
   susceptible to ampicillin, gentamycin, penicillin, vancomycin,
   clindamycin, sulfamethoxazol, and chloramphenicol but resistant to
   erythromycin and tetracyclin. This study provided evidence for the
   effect of E lactis IW5 on cancer cells. Therefore, E. lactis IW5, as a
   bioactive therapeutics, should be subjected to other relevant tests to
   verify the therapeutic suitability of this strain for clinical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The role of Broca's area in sentence processing is hotly debated.
   Hypotheses include that Broca's area supports sentence comprehension via
   syntax-specific processes, hierarchical structure building, or working
   memory. Here we adopt a within-subject functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) approach using sentence-level contrasts and
   non-sentential comparison tasks to address these hypotheses. Standard
   syntactic movement distance effects were replicated, but no difference
   was found between movement and non-movement sentences in Broca's area in
   the group or consistently in the individual subject analyses. Group and
   individual results both identify Broca's area subregions that are
   selective for sentence structure. Group, but not individual subject
   results, suggest shared resources for sentence processing and
   articulation in Broca's area. We conclude that Broca's area is not
   selectively processing syntactic movement, but that subregions are
   selectively responsive to sentence structure. Our findings reinforce
   Fedorenko and Kanwishser's call for individual subject analyses in
   Broca's area, as group findings can obscure selective responses.}},

Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Namibia's HIV prevalence is 13.3 \%. Alcohol is associated
   with sexual risk-taking, leading to increased HIV risk. Baseline sexual
   behaviors, HIV and alcohol knowledge, and self-perceived HIV risk were
   examined among men reporting high-risk drinking in Katutura, Namibia.
   Methods: HIV negative men, >= 18 years, were screened for harmful or
   hazardous levels of drinking and >1 recent sex partner prior to
   randomization into control or intervention arm. SAS 9.3 and R 3.01 were
   used for descriptive baseline cohort analyses.
   Results: A total of 501 participants who met criteria were included in
   analysis (mean Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test {[}AUDIT] =
   12.4). HIV and alcohol knowledge were high with the majority (>85 and
   89.8-98 \%, respectively) of respondents correctly answering assessment
   questions. Despite high knowledge levels, 66.7 \% of men felt they were
   at some or high risk of HIV acquisition. Among those respondents, 56.5
   \% stated often wanting to have sex after drinking and 40.3 \% stated
   sex was better when drunk. Among respondents with non-steady partners
   {[}n = 188], 44.1 \% of last sexual encounters occurred while the
   participant was drunk and condoms were not used 32.5 \% of those times.
   Among persons who were not drunk condoms were not used 13.3 \% of those
   times.
   Conclusions: Sex with casual partners was high. Inconsistent condom use
   and alcohol use before sex were frequently reported. Increased emphasis
   on alcohol risk-reduction strategies, including drinking due to peer
   pressure and unsafe sexual behaviors, is needed.}},

Title = {{A STUDY OF EVALUATION OF LOCAL INFILTRATION OF BOTULINUM TOXIN AS
   COMPARED TO LATERAL SPHINCTEROTOMY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC ANAL
   FISSURE}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES AND AIM
   Chronic anal fissure is a common condition presenting to surgical OPD.
   The treatment for Anal Fissure is based on reducing the spasm of the
   internal anal sphincter, by use of local anesthetics, by muscle
   relaxation with the help of chemical sphincterotomy or surgical
   sphincterotomy. Analysis of the available literature shows that medical
   manipulation of the internal sphincter should be the first-line
   treatment in Anal Fissure. A surgical therapy is called for if the
   medical therapy fails or there is a recurrence. The treatment for Anal
   Fissure is based on reducing the spasm of the internal anal sphincter by
   dilating the anal canal and breaking this vicious cycle and this can be
   achieved by 2 methods.
   a) Surgical: Lateral Internal Sphincterotomy. It is a surgical technique
   to cure Anal Fissure. It has been favored by most of the surgeons,
   because it offers long-lasting relief in sphincter spasm. Lateral
   Internal Sphincterotomy is considered as the gold standard treatment for
   chronic fissures, but it permanently weakens the internal sphincter and
   may lead to anal deformity and incontinence in 8-30\% of patients.
   Therefore, recently nonsurgical treatment modalities have come to the
   forefront.
   b) Non-Surgical: Smooth muscle relaxation is an effective non-surgical
   treatment for Chronic Anal Fissure and has advantages over surgical
   treatment in avoiding long-term complications. Additionally, it does not
   require hospitalization. Smooth muscle relaxation is also the first
   option in patients with a high risk of incontinence. Smooth muscle
   relaxation has been tried using a variety of agents, e.g., Glyceryl
   Trinitrate (GTN) and Botulinum Toxin (BTX). This study is to see the
   role of Botulinum Toxin (A smooth muscle relaxant) in non-surgical
   management of Chronic Anal Fissure.
   Materials and Methods:
   Source of Data: All cases of chronic fissure in ano from OPD and
   patients admitted in surgical ward of M V J Medical College And Research
   Hospital.
   Method of Collection of Data: The study was done for 60 cases with
   chronic anal fissure, and was divided in two groups at random. An
   informed consent was taken from the patient.
   1. Study Cases received single injections of Botulinum toxin type A
   purified neurotoxin complex (BOTOX), which is available in a sterile,
   vacuum dried form of purified Botulinum type A produced from a culture
   of a Hall strain of clostridium Botulinum growth in medium containing-Z
   amine and yeast extract.
   2. Control cases underwent lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) done
   under spinal/general anesthesia.
   Inclusion Criteria:
   Patients were accepted on the basis of at least one of the following
   criteria:
   1. History of symptoms more than 3 months (Bleeding per rectum, pain
   during defecation and itching etc.)
   2. Induration of edges of fissure with no edema/inflammation.
   3. Sentinel pile.
   4. Hypertrophied anal papilla.
   Exclusion Criteria:
   1. Children below 12 years of age.
   2. Pregnant women.
   3. Patients having associated diseases like haemorrhoids/fistula in
   ano/abscess.
   4. Patients who have had previous operation of the anal canal.
   5. Diabetics.
   6. Patients above 70 years of age.
   7. Immunocompromised (AIDS).}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{The default mode network (DMN) is one of the most widely studied resting
   state functional networks. The structural basis for the DMN is of
   particular interest and has been studied by several researchers using
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Most of these previous studies focused
   on a few regions or white matter tracts of the DMN so that the global
   structural connectivity pattern and network properties of the DMN remain
   unclear. Moreover, evidences indicate that the DMN is involved in both
   memory and emotion, but how the DMN regulates memory and anxiety from
   the perspective of the whole DMN structural network remains unknown. We
   used multimodal neuroimaging methods to investigate the structural
   connectivity pattern of the DMN and the association of its network
   properties with memory and anxiety in 205 young healthy subjects with
   age ranging from 18 to 29 years old. The Group ICA method was used to
   extract the DMN component from functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) data and a probabilistic fiber tractography technique based on
   DTI data was applied to construct the global structural connectivity
   pattern of the DMN. Then we used the graph theory method to analyze the
   DMN structural network and found that memory quotient (MO) score was
   significantly positively correlated with the global and local efficiency
   of the DMN whereas anxiety was found to be negatively correlated with
   the efficiency. The strong structural connectivity between multiple
   brain regions within DMN may reflect that the DMN has certain structural
   basis. Meanwhile, the results we found that the network efficiency of
   the DMN were related to memory and anxiety measures, indicated that the
   DMN may play a role in the memory and anxiety.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Direct laser writing (DLW) via two-photon polymerization (TPP) has been
   established as a powerful technique for fabrication and integration of
   nanoscale components, as it enables the production of three dimensional
   (3D) micro/nano objects. This technique has indeed led to numerous
   applications, including micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems
   (MEMS/NEMS), metamaterials, mechanical metamaterials, and photonic
   crystals. However, as the feature sizes decrease, an urgent demand has
   emerged to uncover the mechanics of nanosized polymer materials. Here,
   we fabricate coil spring shaped polymer nanowires using DLW via
   two-photon polymerization. We find that even the nanocoil springs follow
   a linear-response against applied forces, following Hooke's law, as
   revealed by compression tests using an atomic force microscope. Further,
   the elasticity of the polymer material is found to become significantly
   greater as the wire radius is decreased from 550 to 350 nm. Polarized
   Raman spectroscopy measurements show that polymer chains are aligned in
   nanowires along the axis, which may be responsible for the size
   dependence. Our findings provide insight into the nanomechanics of
   polymer materials fabricated by DLW, which leads to further applications
   based on nanosized polymer materials.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of energy rating systems and increased energy efficiency
   requirements for built environment, the assessment of energy performance
   of new buildings and refurbishment rates of existing buildings have
   become an important compliance in the building design process. In order
   to analyse and simulate the effects of energy-efficient measures for
   buildings, it is essential to establish spatio-semantic information
   interoperability between the building design and energy modelling
   softwares. Data interoperability facilitates different domains to
   interact with the single building model. The geometrical properties of
   building semantics such as effective areas exposed to total incident
   radiation were used as indicators for assessment of seasonal solar
   potential of buildings. The key urban solar potential indicators were
   identified based on the semantic components of buildings. The CityGML
   instance document derived from a proposed energy application domain
   extension (ADE) conceptual schema could be used as common interoperable
   model for both the design and energy simulation systems.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{The aroma attributes of sulfurous, mushroom and earthy are the most
   important characteristics of the aroma of Tuber melanosporum. However,
   these three aroma attributes are absent in the T. melanosporum
   fermentation system. To improve the quality of the aroma, repeated
   freeze-thaw treatment (RFTT) was adopted to affect the interplay of
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Using RFTT, not only was the score on
   the hedonic scale of the aroma increased from the ``liked slightly{''}
   to the ``liked moderately{''} grade, but the aroma attributes of
   sulfurous, mushroom and earthy could also be smelled in the T.
   melanosporum fermentation system for the first time. A total of 29 VOCs
   were identified, and 9 compounds were identified as the key
   discriminative volatiles affected by RFTT. Amino acid analysis revealed
   that methionine, valine, serine, phenylalanine, isoleucine and threonine
   were the key substrates associated with the biosynthesis of the 9 key
   discriminative VOCs. This study noted that amino acid metabolism played
   an important role in the regulation of the aroma of the T. melanosporum
   fermentation system.}},

Title = {{Armored kinorhynch-like scalidophoran animals from the early Cambrian}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Morphology-based phylogenetic analyses support the monophyly of the
   Scalidophora (Kinorhyncha, Loricifera, Priapulida) and Nematoida
   (Nematoda, Nematomorpha), together constituting the monophyletic
   Cycloneuralia that is the sister group of the Panarthropoda. Kinorhynchs
   are unique among living cycloneuralians in having a segmented body with
   repeated cuticular plates, longitudinal muscles, dorsoventral muscles,
   and ganglia. Molecular clock estimates suggest that kinorhynchs may have
   diverged in the Ediacaran Period. Remarkably, no kinorhynch fossils have
   been discovered, in sharp contrast to priapulids and loriciferans that
   are represented by numerous Cambrian fossils. Here we describe several
   early Cambrian (similar to 535 million years old) kinorhynch-like
   fossils, including the new species Eokinorhynchus rarus and two unnamed
   but related forms. E. rarus has characteristic scalidophoran features,
   including an introvert with pentaradially arranged hollow scalids. Its
   trunk bears at least 20 annuli each consisting of numerous small
   rectangular plates, and is armored with five pairs of large and
   bilaterally placed sclerites. Its trunk annuli are reminiscent of the
   epidermis segments of kinorhynchs. A phylogenetic analysis resolves E.
   rarus as a stem-group kinorhynch. Thus, the fossil record confirms that
   all three scalidophoran phyla diverged no later than the Cambrian
   Period.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: The association between 3 well known SNPs - miR-146a C/G
   (rs2910164), miR-196a2 T/C (rs11614913), and miR-499 A/G (rs3746444) -
   in pre-miRNA sequences and ischemic stroke (IS) are still conflicting
   and inconclusive. This meta-analysis aimed to pool previous studies get
   a more precise assessment of the association between these 3 SNPs and
   the risk of IS.
   Material/Methods: Relevant studies were searched in online databases.
   The strength of the association between the SNPs and IS were estimated
   by pooling odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) using
   Review Manager (version 5.3).
   Results: Rs2910164 C allele was associated with lower IS risk. But this
   trend was only observed in Koreans under the allele model (OR=0.81, 95\%
   CI=0.68-0.95, p=0.009), dominant model (OR=0.68, 95\% CI=0.50-0.93,
   p=0.02), recessive model (OR=0.79, 95\% CI=0.63-1.00, p=0.05), and
   homozygous model (OR=0.63, 95\%CI=0.45-0.88, p=0.007). Rs11614913 T
   allele might be associated with higher IS risk under the dominant model
   (OR=1.45, 95\% CI=1.19-1.78, p=0.0003), while rs3746444 A allele might
   be associated with decreased IS risk under the homozygous model
   (OR=0.48, 95\% CI=0.23-0.98, p=0.04) only in Chinese, but not in
   Koreans.
   Conclusions: Although the 3 SNPs might be associated with IS, the
   association varied significantly in different countries.}},

Abstract = {{A study of yolks stored up to 168 d at -20 degrees C was conducted to
   determine the gelation behavior and mechanism of freeze-thawed yolk.
   Methods used were rheology, native and sodium dodecyl sulfate
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (native- and SDS-PAGE), differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   particle size analysis, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR)
   spectroscopy for matrix mobility. Results indicate that both
   constituents of plasma and granules contributed to gelation of yolk
   under freezing. PAGE analyses suggest that granular proteins
   participated in aggregation during freeze-thaw. Increasing gel strength
   and particle size and decreasing water and lipid-water mobility indicate
   that lipoproteins or apolipoproteins aggregated. At storage times >= 84
   d, increased protein and lipid mobility, the detection of smaller
   particles, and secondarily increased gel strength suggest the liberation
   of protein or lipoprotein components from previously formed aggregates
   and further aggregation of these constituents. Disruption of the gelled
   yolk matrix observed with TEM supported that ice crystal formation was
   required for gelation to occur. A two-stage dynamic gelation model is
   thus proposed.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the multicomponent Co60Fe5Ni5Ti25B5 (at.\%) alloy powders
   were synthesized from commercially available pure elemental powders by
   using a mechanical alloying (MA) process under argon gas atmosphere. The
   changes in structural, morphological, thermal and magnetic properties of
   the processed powders during MA were examined by X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (SEM/EDX), differential thermal analysis (DTA) and
   vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The results showed that the
   amorphization occurred after 3.5 h of milling, and the amorphous phase
   was stable up to 580 degrees C, where crystallization occurred. The SEM
   observations indicated that different morphologies were obtained during
   the MA stages. In addition, the EDX mapping confirmed the uniform
   distribution of elemental content. Magnetic results indicated that all
   the samples exhibited soft-ferromagnetic behavior. The evolution of the
   saturation magnetization (Ms), the coercivity (Hc) and the squareness
   ratio (Ms/Mr) during milling process were discussed with respect to
   microstructural changes. The influence of the annealing on magnetic
   hysteresis was also studied. The Ms, Hc and Ms/Mr values of about 53.4
   emu/g, 7.6 Oe and 0.01, respectively was obtained after 7 h of milling.

Title = {{The curious incident of multi-instantons and the necessity of Lefschetz
   thimbles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{We show that compatibility of supersymmetry with exact semi-classics
   demands that in calculating multi-instanton amplitudes, the
   ``separation{''} quasi-zeromode must be complexified and the integration
   cycles must be found by using complex gradient flow (or Picard-Lefschetz
   equations.) As a non-trivial application, we study N - 2 extended
   supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Even though in this case supersymmetry
   is unbroken, the instanton-anti-instanton amplitude (naively calculated)
   seems to contribute to the ground state energy. We show, however, that
   the instanton-anti-instanton event consists of two parts: a
   fermion-correlated and a scalar-correlated event. Although both of these
   contributions are naively of the same sign and the latter is
   superficially higher order in the perturbative coupling, we show that
   the two contributions exactly cancel when they are evaluated on
   Lefschetz thimbles due to their relative Hidden Topological Angles
   (HTAs). This gives strong evidence that the semi-classical expansion
   using Lefschetz thimbles is not only a meaningful prescription for
   higher order semi-classics, but a necessary one. This deduction seems to
   be universal and applicable to both supersymmetric and
   non-supersymmetric theories. In conclusion we speculate that similar
   conspiracies are responsible for the non-formation of certain molecular
   contributions in theories where instantons have more than two fermionic
   zeromodes and do not contribute to the superpotential.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical reagents targeting and controlling amyloidogenic peptides have
   received much attention for helping identify their roles in the
   pathogenesis of protein-misfolding disorders. Herein, we report a novel
   strategy for redirecting amyloidogenic peptides into nontoxic,
   off-pathway aggregates, which utilizes redox properties of a small
   molecule (DMPD, N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine) to trigger covalent
   adduct formation with the peptide. In addition, for the first time,
   biochemical, biophysical, and molecular dynamics simulation studies have
   been performed to demonstrate a mechanistic understanding for such an
   interaction between a small molecule (DMPD) and amyloid-beta (A beta)
   and its subsequent anti-amyloidogenic activity, which, upon its
   transformation, generates ligandpeptide adducts via primary
   amine-dependent intramolecular cross-linking correlated with structural
   compaction. Furthermore, in vivo efficacy of DMPD toward amyloid
   pathology and cognitive impairment was evaluated employing 5xFAD mice of
   Alzheimers disease (AD). Such a small molecule (DMPD) is indicated to
   noticeably reduce the overall cerebral amyloid load of soluble A beta
   forms and amyloid deposits as well as significantly improve cognitive
   defects in the AD mouse model. Overall, our in vitro and in vivo studies
   of DMPD toward A beta with the first molecular-level mechanistic
   investigations present the feasibility of developing new, innovative
   approaches that employ redox-active compounds without the structural
   complexity as next-generation chemical tools for amyloid management.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEALTH POPULATION AND NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although several studies have found probiotics encouraging
   in prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), the evidence for
   the use of probiotics in diagnosed GDM is largely limited. The aim of
   this study was to assess the effect of a probiotic supplement capsule
   containing four bacterial strains on glucose metabolism indices and
   weight changes in women with newly diagnosed GDM.
   Methods: Sixty-four pregnant women with GDM were enrolled into a
   double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial. They were
   randomly assigned to receive either a probiotic or placebo capsule along
   with dietary advice for eight consecutive weeks. The trend of weight
   gain along with glucose metabolism indices was assayed.
   Results: During the first 6 weeks of the study, the weight gain trend
   was similar between the groups. However, in the last 2 weeks of the
   study, the weight gain in the probiotic group was significantly lower
   than in the placebo group (p < 0.05). Fasting blood sugar (FBS)
   decreased in both intervention (from 103.7 to 88.4 mg/dl) and control
   (from 100.9 to 93.6 mg/dl) groups significantly, and the decrease in the
   probiotic group was significantly higher than in the placebo group (p <
   0.05). Insulin resistance index in the probiotic group had 6.74 \%
   reduction over the study period (p < 0.05). In the placebo group,
   however, there was an increase in insulin resistance index (6.45 \%),
   but the observed change in insulin resistance was not statistically
   significant. Insulin sensitivity index was increased in both groups. The
   post-intervention insulin sensitivity index in the probiotic group was
   not significantly different from placebo when adjusted for the baseline
   levels.
   Conclusions: The probiotic supplement appeared to affect glucose
   metabolism and weight gain among pregnant women with GDM. This needs to
   be confirmed in other settings before a therapeutic value could be
   approved.}},

   prepared by ultrafast laser ablation of a HA target in a solvent, and
   then the nanoparticles were dispersed into the liquid polymer resin
   prior to the photocuring process using MPExSL. The resin is
   poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF), a photo-polymerizable, biodegradable
   material. The polymer is blended with diethyl fumarate in 7: 3 w/w to
   adjust the resin viscosity. The evaluation of the structural and
   mechanical properties of the fabricated hybrid thin film was performed
   by means of SEM and nanoindentation, respectively, while the chemical
   and degradation studies were conducted through thermogravimetric
   analysis, and FTIR. The photocuring efficiency was found to be dependent
   on the nanoparticle concentration. The MPExSL process yielded PPF thin
   films with a stable and homogenous dispersion of the embedded HA
   nanoparticles. Here, it was not possible to tune the stiffness and
   hardness of the scaffolds by varying the laser parameters, although this
   was observed for regular PPF scaffolds. Finally, the gradual release of
   the hydroxyapatite nanoparticles over thin film biodegradation is
   reported.}},

Title = {{Vocal individuality cues in the African penguin (Spheniscus demersus): a
   source-filter theory approach}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{The African penguin is a nesting seabird endemic to southern Africa. In
   penguins of the genus Spheniscus vocalisations are important for social
   recognition. However, it is not clear which acoustic features of calls
   can encode individual identity information. We recorded contact calls
   and ecstatic display songs of 12 adult birds from a captive colony. For
   each vocalisation, we measured 31 spectral and temporal acoustic
   parameters related to both source and filter components of calls. For
   each parameter, we calculated the Potential of Individual Coding (PIC).
   The acoustic parameters showing PIC >= 1.1 were used to perform a
   stepwise cross-validated discriminant function analysis (DFA). The DFA
   correctly classified 66.1\% of the contact calls and 62.5\% of display
   songs to the correct individual. The DFA also resulted in the further
   selection of 10 acoustic features for contact calls and 9 for display
   songs that were important for vocal individuality. Our results suggest
   that studying the anatomical constraints that influence nesting penguin
   vocalisations from a source-filter perspective, can lead to a much
   better understanding of the acoustic cues of individuality contained in
   their calls. This approach could be further extended to study and
   understand vocal communication in other bird species.}},

Abstract = {{Three self-assembled nanogranular composites based on MnAs ferromagnetic
   inclusions embedded in ZnSnAs2 semiconductors with MnAs concentration
   10, 20, 47 mol.\% were synthesized. The samples were studied by X-ray,
   SEM, AFM, MFM and SQUID methods. It has been shown that the increasing
   of the MnAs concentration in composite leads to slightly increasing of
   the size of the magnetic inclusions. Their size depends mainly on the
   speed of the crystallization, but the shape of the inclusions depends on
   the type of the interaction between materials. The connection between
   equilibrium and non-equilibrium structure of the compounds has been
   demonstrated. Magnetic properties of the ZnSnAs2 + MnAs samples show
   ferromagnetic phase transition with the Curie temperature having values
   from 313 K to 336 K, increasing as a function of the MnAs concentration
   in the nanocomposite. A small paramagnetic signal is observed at low
   temperatures due to individual Mn ions randomly distributed in the
   ZnSnAs2 lattice. All our samples show only a narrow magnetic hysteresis
   loop except of the sample with 47 mol.\% of MnAs, for which the coercive
   field increases to about 120 G. The carrier transport of the alloy shows
   significant influence of the MnAs clusters. All our samples have p-type
   conductivity with magneto-transport strongly influenced by the presence
   of the MnAs phase in the nanocomposite samples. The magnetoresistance (
   MR) of the alloy shows a complex behavior. The grain boundaries and MnAs
   clusters influence on the amplitude, sign, and temperature of MR. (C)

Abstract = {{With the depletion of fossil fuels, development of renewable energy has
   attracted wide attention in recent years. The well-known
   polyoxometalates (POMs) of H3PW12O40 (denoted as PW12) and H4SiW12O40
   (denoted as SiW12) are effective catalysts for acid-catalyzed reactions.
   Nevertheless, industrial application of PW12 and SiW12 is largely
   restricted by the agglomeration, separation, leaching and recycling
   issues. Moreover, the PW12 and SiW12 tend to deactivate strong proton
   sites due to the small surface area of 10 m(2 center dot)g(-1). To
   overcome these problems, the PW12 and SiW12 have been fabricated onto a
   mesoporous polymer of PDVB-VBC (compound 1) with a large surface area
   via tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TAEA), resulting in the formation of new
   heterogeneous catalysts of PDVB-VBC-TAEA-PW12 (compound 3) and
   PDVB-VBC-TAEA-SiW12 (compound 4). Both compounds 3 and 4 possess
   mesoporous structures with high surface area of 121 m(2 center dot)g(-1)
   and 131 m(2 center dot)g(-1), respectively. And they have shown highly
   efficient and selective dehydration of fructose to
   5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as well as
   esterification of lauric acid (LA) to methyl laurate. Moreover, the
   catalysts can be recycled for at least five times with no obvious
   decrease of reactivity. Therefore, such catalysts have great potential
   for further application from a chemical engineering point of view.}},

Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Compared with many induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines generated
   using retrovirus and other non-integrating methods, the utilization of
   human protein-induced iPSC (piPSC) lines may provide a safer alternative
   for the generation of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells for
   transplantation in retinal degenerative diseases. Here we assess the
   ability of piPSCs to differentiate into RPE cells, and to perform native
   RPE cell behavior. piPSCs were seeded in 6-well low-attachment plates to
   allow embryoid body formation, and then analyzed for pluripotent stem
   cell markers NANOG, SSEA4 and TRA-1-60 by immunofluorescence. Following
   colony formation, piPSCs were assessed for confirmation of RPE cell
   differentiation by staining for zonula occludens (ZO-1), bestrophin,
   microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and retinal
   pigment epithelium specific protein-65 (RPE65). To evaluate piPSC-RPE
   cell phagocytic ability, adult bovine photoreceptor rod outer segments
   (ROS) were fed to piPSC-RPE cells, which were analyzed by fluorescent
   microscopy and flow cytometry. Undifferentiated piPSCs expressed all
   pluripotent markers assessed and formed embryoid body aggregates after 7
   days. Differentiated piPSC-RPE cells expressed ZO-1, bestrophin, MITF
   and RPE65, typical RPE cell markers. Flow cytometry revealed robust
   ingestion of fluorescently-labeled ROS by piPSC-RPE cells, which was
   over four-times greater than that of undifferentiated piPSCs and
   comparable to that of an immortalized RPE cell line. Phagocytosis
   activity by piPSC-RPE cells was significantly reduced after the addition
   of anti-integrin alpha V beta 5. In conclusion, piPSCs can be
   differentiated toward an RPE cell fate, expressing RPE cell markers and
   resembling native RPE cells in behavior. These results demonstrate that
   piPSCs can be differentiated into RPE-like cells using a method that has
   an increased safety profile, a critical consideration for the
   development of better treatments for retinal degenerative diseases such
   as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).}},

Title = {{Efficient conversion of acetate into lipids by the oleaginous yeast
   Cryptococcus curvatus}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Acetic acid is routinely generated during lignocelluloses
   degradation, syngas fermentation, dark hydrogen fermentation and other
   anaerobic bioprocesses. Acetate stream is commonly regarded as a
   by-product and detrimental to microbial cell growth. Conversion of
   acetate into lipids by oleaginous yeasts may be a good choice to turn
   the by-product into treasure.
   Results: Ten well-known oleaginous yeasts were evaluated for lipid
   production on acetate under flask culture conditions. It was found that
   all of those yeasts could use acetate for microbial lipid production. In
   particular, Cryptococcus curvatus accumulated lipids up to 73.4 \% of
   its dry cell mass weight. When the culture was held in a 3-L
   stirred-tank bioreactor, cell mass, lipid content, lipid yield and
   acetate consumption rate were 8.1 g/L, 49.9 \%, 0.15 g/g and 0.64 g/L/h,
   respectively. The fatty acid compositional profiles of the
   acetate-derived lipids were similar to those of vegetable oil,
   suggesting their potential for biodiesel production. Continuous
   cultivation of C. curvatus was conducted under nitrogen-rich condition
   at a dilution rate of 0.04 h(-1), the maximal lipid content and lipid
   yield were 56.7 \% and 0.18 g/g, respectively. The specific lipid
   formation rate, lipid content and lipid yield were all higher under
   nitrogen-rich conditions than those obtained under nitrogen-limited
   conditions at the same dilution rates. Effective lipid production by C.
   curvatus was observed on corn stover hydrolysates containing 15.9 g/L
   acetate.
   Conclusions: Acetate is an effective carbon source for microbial lipid
   production by oleaginous yeasts. Continuous cultivation of C. curvatus
   on acetate was promising for lipid production under both nitrogen-rich
   and nitrogen-limited conditions. These results provide valuable
   information for developing and designing more efficient
   acetate-into-lipids bioprocess.}},

Title = {{The effect of direct access to CT scan in early lung cancer detection:
   an unblinded, cluster-randomised trial}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Lower lung cancer survival rates in Britain and Denmark
   compared with surrounding countries may, in part, be due to late
   diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of direct
   access to low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) from general practice in
   early lung cancer detection on time to diagnosis and stage at diagnosis.
   Methods: We conducted a cluster-randomised, controlled trial including
   all incident lung cancer patients (in 19-month period) listed with
   general practice in the municipality of Aarhus (300,000 citizens),
   Denmark. Randomisation and intervention were applied at general practice
   level. A total of 266 GPs from 119 general practices. In the study
   period, 331 lung cancer patients were included. The intervention
   included direct access to low-dose CT from primary care combined with a
   1 h lung cancer update meeting. Indication for LDCT was symptoms or
   signs that raised the GP's suspicion of lung cancer, but fell short of
   satisfying the fast-track referral criteria on red flag' symptoms.
   Results: The intervention did not significantly influence stage at
   diagnosis and had limited impact on time to diagnosis. However, when
   correcting for non-compliance, we found that the patients were at higher
   risk of experiencing a long diagnostic interval if their GPs were in the
   control group.
   Conclusion: Direct low-dose CT from primary care did not statistically
   significantly decrease time to diagnosis or change stage at diagnosis in
   lung cancer patients. Case finding with direct access to LDCT may be an
   alternative to lung cancer screening. Furthermore, a recommendation of
   low-dose CT screening should consider offering symptomatic, unscreened
   patients an access to CT directly from primary care.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{The marine ecosystem has been severely disturbed by several transient
   paleoenvironmental events (<200 kyr duration) during the early
   Paleogene, of which the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, similar
   to 56 Ma) was the most prominent. Over the last decade a number of
   similar events of Paleocene and Eocene age have been discovered.
   However, relatively little attention has been paid to pre-PETM events,
   such as the ``Latest Danian Event{''} ({''}LDE{''}, similar to 62.18
   Ma), specifically from an open ocean perspective. Here we present new
   foraminiferal isotope (delta C-13, delta O-18) and faunal data from
   Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1210 at Shatsky Rise (Pacific Ocean)
   in order to reconstruct the prevailing paleoceano-graphic conditions.
   The studied five-meter-thick succession covers similar to 900 kyr and
   includes the 200-kyr-lasting LDE. All groups surface dwelling,
   subsurface dwelling and benthic foraminifera show a negative delta C-13
   excursion of >0.6 parts per thousand, similar in magnitude to the one
   previously reported from neighboring Site 1209 for benthic foraminifera.
   delta O-18-inferred warming by 1.6 to 2.8 degrees C (0.4-0.7\% delta
   O-18 measured on benthic and planktic foraminiferal tests) of the entire
   water column accompanies the negative delta C-13 excursion. A well
   stratified upper ocean directly before and during the LDE is proposed
   based on the stable isotope gradients between surface and subsurface
   dwellers. The gradient is less well developed, but still enhanced after
   the event. Isotope data are supplemented by comprehensive planktic
   foraminiferal faunal analyses revealing a dominance of Morozovella
   species together with Parasubbotina species. Subsurface-dwelling
   Parasubbotina shows high abundances during the LDE tracing changes in
   the strength of the isotope gradients and, thus, may indicate optimal
   living conditions within a well stratified surface ocean for this taxon.
   In addition, distinct faunal changes are reported like the disappearance
   of Praemurica species right at the base of the LDE and the continuous
   replacement of M. praeangulata with M. angulata across the LDE.}},

Abstract = {{A two-neutron unbound excited state of O-24 was populated through a (d,

   45 (sys) keV with a width of Gamma < 2 MeV was observed above the
   two-neutron separation energy placing it at 7.65 +/- 0.2 MeV with
   respect to the ground state. Three-body correlations for the decay of
   O-24 -> O-22 + 2n show clear evidence of a sequential decay through an
   intermediate state in O-23. Neither a di-neutron nor phase-space model
   for the three-body breakup were able to describe these correlations.}},

Title = {{Long-Acting Beta Agonists Enhance Allergic Airway Disease}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Asthma is one of the most common of medical illnesses and is treated in
   part by drugs that activate the beta-2-adrenoceptor (beta 2-AR) to
   dilate obstructed airways. Such drugs include long acting beta agonists
   (LABAs) that are paradoxically linked to excess asthma-related
   mortality. Here we show that LABAs such as salmeterol and structurally
   related beta 2-AR drugs such as formoterol and carvedilol, but not
   short-acting agonists (SABAs) such as albuterol, promote exaggerated
   asthma-like allergic airway disease and enhanced airway constriction in
   mice. We demonstrate that salmeterol aberrantly promotes activation of
   the allergic disease-related transcription factor signal transducer and
   activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) in multiple mouse and human cells.
   A novel inhibitor of STAT6, PM-242H, inhibited initiation of allergic
   disease induced by airway fungal challenge, reversed established
   allergic airway disease in mice, and blocked salmeterol-dependent
   enhanced allergic airway disease. Thus, structurally related beta 2-AR
   ligands aberrantly activate STAT6 and promote allergic airway disease.
   This untoward pharmacological property likely explains adverse outcomes
   observed with LABAs, which may be overcome by agents that antagonize
   STAT6.}},

Abstract = {{Optoelectronics applications for transition-metal dichalcogenides are
   still limited by weak light absorption and their complex exciton modes
   are easily perturbed by varying excitation conditions because they are
   inherent in atomically thin layers. Here, we propose a method of
   selectively amplifying the primary exciton (A(0)) among the exciton
   complexes in monolayer MoS2 via cyclic reexcitation of cavity-free
   exciton-coupled plasmon propagation. This was implemented by partially
   overlapping a Ag nanowire on a MoS2 monolayer separated by a thin SiO2
   spacer. Exciton-coupled plasmons in the nanowire enhance the A(0)
   radiation in MoS2. The cumulative amplification of emission enhancement
   by cyclic plasmon traveling reaches approximately twentyfold selectively
   for the A(0), while excluding other B exciton and multiexciton by
   significantly reduced band filling, without oscillatory spectra implying
   plasmonic cavity effects.}},

Abstract = {{The removal of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) by electrochemical oxidation was
   investigated systematically under various conditions using a commercial
   Dimensionally Stable Anodes anode. It was observed that higher electrode
   potential led to more PVA degradation and gases evolution. Acidic
   conditions were beneficial for PVA degradation. The higher degradation
   of PVA was achieved with KBr compared with other salts. The PVA
   degradation was slightly improved by ultraviolet irradiation while
   hydrogen peroxide lowered the degradation evidently. FTIR analysis
   indicated that PVA was partially oxidized rather than completely
   mineralized. The iso-propanol quenching test indicated hydroxyl radicals
   were mainly responsible for PVA degradation. (C) 2015 The Korean Society

Abstract = {{In this article, high-quality single domain SmBCO bulks have been
   successfully produced in the air by top seeded infiltration and growth
   (TSIG) method, with a new solid phase of (Sm2O3 + xBaCuO(2)) and liquid
   phase of (Y2O3 + 6CuO + 10BaCuO(2)), x = 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and
   1.4. The results show that the onset critical temperature (Tc-onset) of
   the SmBCO bulks increases with the increasing of x, because the
   substitution of Sm on Ba site in Sm1+xBa2-xCu3O7 crystal is reduced by
   the BaCuO2 addition; the Tc-onset have reached 96 K when x = 1.4. The
   amount and the size of Sm211 particles of the single domain SmBCO bulks
   decreases with the increasing of BaCuO2 addition x. All of the critical
   current density (J(c)), levitation force and trapped field of the
   samples are increasing from 1.08 x 10(5) A/cm(2), 38.47 N and 0.2330 T
   to 1.66 x 10(5) A/cm(2), 44.34 N and 0.2680 T when x increases from 0.9
   to 1.2, and then decreases to 0.83 x 10(5) A/cm(2), 37.94 N and 0.2085 T
   with the increasing of x from 1.2 to 1.4 respectively, the largest J(c)
   of 1.66 x 10(5) A/cm(2), levitation force of 44.34 N and trapped field
   of 0.2680 T are reached at the optimal value of x = 1.2. This result
   provides a very important way to fabricate high-quality single domain
   SmBCO bulks in air. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Solid-state formation of Zn6Mg3Y icosahedral quasicrystals was observed
   at interfaces between Mg and W-Zn3Mg3Y2 crystals in a Mg-Zn-Y alloy by
   in situ transmission electron microscopy investigations. The
   quasicrystals were formed at about 593 K which is about 130 K below the
   peritectic temperature. Thermally driven interdiffusion of atoms across
   the W/Mg interface firstly produces local regions with Zn:Mg:Y close to
   6:3:1 at the surface of W phase particles, where the cuboctahedral
   packing of atoms in W phase transforms to icosahedral packing through
   slight rearrangement of atoms, leading to the nucleation and growth of
   icosahedral clusters. The icosahedral clusters act as nuclei for the
   growth of icosahedral quasicrystals. Both valence electron concentration
   and the densest packing of atoms play important roles in the formation
   of Zn6Mg3Y quasicrystals. Solid-state formation of icosahedral
   quasicrystals at W/Mg interfaces provide a feasible way to modify the
   weakly bonded W/Mg interfaces, which is thus believed to be able to
   improve the magnesium alloy's mechanical properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Enoate reductases catalyze the reduction of activated C=C bonds with
   high enantioselectivity. The oxidative half-reaction, which involves the
   addition of a hydride and a proton to opposite faces of the C=C bond,
   has been studied for the first time by hybrid quantum
   mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM). The reduction of
   2-cyclohexen-1-one by YqjM from Bacillus subtilis was selected as the
   model system. Two-dimensional QM/MM (B3LYP-D/OPLS2005) reaction pathways
   suggest that the hydride and proton are added as distinct steps, with
   the former step preceding the latter. Furthermore, we present
   interesting insights into the reactivity of this enzyme, including the
   weak binding of the substrate in the active site, the role of the two
   active site histidine residues for polarization of the substrate C=O
   bond, structural details of the transition states to hydride and proton
   transfer, and the role of Tyr196 as proton donor. The information
   presented here will be useful for the future design of enantioselective

Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{We establish solutions corresponding to AdS4 static charged black holes
   with inhomogeneous two-dimensional horizon surfaces of constant
   curvature. Depending on the choice of the 2D constant curvature space,
   the metric potential of the internal geometry of the horizon satisfies
   the ellipticwave/elliptic Liouville equations. We calculate the charge
   diffusion and transport coefficients in the hydrodynamic limit of
   gauge/gravity duality and observe the exponential suppression in the
   diffusion coefficient and in the shear viscosity-per-entropy density
   ratio in the presence of an inhomogeneity on black hole horizons with
   planar, spherical, and hyperbolic geometry. We discuss the subtleties of
   the approach developed for a planar black hole with inhomogeneity
   distribution on the horizon surface in more detail and find, among
   others, a trial distribution function, which generates values of the
   shear viscosity-per-entropy density ratio falling within the
   experimentally relevant range. The solutions obtained are also extended
   to higher-dimensional AdS space. We observe two different DC
   conductivities in 4D and higher-dimensional effective strongly coupled
   dual media and formulate conditions under which the appropriate ratio of
   different conductivities is qualitatively the same as that observed in
   an anisotropic strongly coupled fluid. We briefly discuss ways of how
   the Liouville field could appear in condensed matter physics and outline
   prospects of further employing the gauge/gravity duality in CMP
   problems.}},

Title = {{Improvement and efficient display of Bacillus thuringiensis toxins on
   M13 phages and ribosomes}},
Journal = {{AMB EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) produces insecticidal proteins that have
   been used worldwide in the control of insect-pests in crops and vectors
   of human diseases. However, different insect species are poorly
   controlled by the available Bt toxins or have evolved resistance to
   these toxins. Evolution of Bt toxicity could provide novel toxins to
   control insect pests. To this aim, efficient display systems to select
   toxins with increased binding to insect membranes or midgut proteins
   involved in toxicity are likely to be helpful. Here we describe two
   display systems, phage display and ribosome display, that allow the
   efficient display of two non-structurally related Bt toxins, Cry1Ac and
   Cyt1Aa. Improved display of Cry1Ac and Cyt1Aa on M13 phages was achieved
   by changing the commonly used peptide leader sequence of the coat
   pIII-fusion protein, that relies on the Sec translocation pathway, for a
   peptide leader sequence that relies on the signal recognition particle
   pathway (SRP) and by using a modified M13 helper phage (Phaberge) that
   has an amber mutation in its pIII genomic sequence and preferentially
   assembles using the pIII-fusion protein. Also, both Cry1Ac and Cyt1Aa
   were efficiently displayed on ribosomes, which could allow the
   construction of large libraries of variants. Furthermore, Cry1Ac or
   Cyt1Aa displayed on M13 phages or ribosomes were specifically selected
   from a mixture of both toxins depending on which antigen was immobilized
   for binding selection. These improved systems may allow the selection of
   Cry toxin variants with improved insecticidal activities that could
   counter insect resistances.}},

Abstract = {{Dimedone enamines were applied for the first time as new dienophiles in
   hetero-Diels-Alder reactions with inverse electron demand.
   Cycloadditions of barbituric acid 5-ylidene alditols with dimedone
   enamines were performed in dichloromethane at room temperature for 3
   days and fused uracils-chromeno{[}2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4-diones were
   obtained in good 73-87\% yields. Only one enantiomerically pure
   stereoisomer was obtained in each studied cycloaddition. Analysis of H-1
   NMR and 2D NMR spectra allowed for the determination that cycloadducts
   exist in solution as mixture of the neutral form and dipolar ion. The
   prepared fused uracils contain both amine and enol functional groups, so
   share amphiprotic properties and they are zwitterions in solid state.
   The new class of compounds-amino enols was synthesized, which similarly
   to amino acids exists as zwitterions. In obtained cycloadducts amino
   groups and sugar moieties are close each other and they both are in cis
   configuration and in axial position. It was also shown that different
   alkenes can be used as dienophiles towards barbituric acid 5-ylidene

Abstract = {{We introduce and analyze a mean-field model for polariton condensates
   which includes a velocity dependence of the effective polariton mass due
   to the photon and exciton components. The effective mass depends on the
   in-plane wave vector k, which at the inflection point of the lower
   polariton energy branch becomes infinite, and above this becomes
   negative. The polariton condensate modes of this mean-field theory are
   now sensitive to mass variations and, for certain points of the energy
   dispersion, the polariton condensate mode represents fractional quantum
   mechanics. The impact of the generalized kinetic-energy term is
   elucidated by numerical studies in two dimensions showing significant
   differences for large velocities. Analytical expressions for plane-wave
   solutions as well as a linear waves analysis show the significance of
   this model.}},

Abstract = {{We successfully prepared the nanocomposite solid polymer electrolytes
   based on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)/polyhedral oligomeric
   silsesquioxane-polyethylene glycol (PUSS-PEG) complexed with
   LiN(SO2CF3)(2) (LiTFSI) salt and studied the effect of PUSS-PEG (n =
   13.3) hybrid nanoparticles on structural, thermal, mechanical and ionic
   conductivity properties. The crystallinity of the nanocomposite solid
   polymer electrolytes has been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD).
   FTIR studies showed the evidence of the complexation between PEO, LiTFSI
   and PUSS-PEG. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to study
   their glass transition and melting behaviors and to measure their
   respective degrees of crystallinity. The degree of crystallinity reduced
   with PUSS-PEG content, indicating restricted segmental motion of the
   polymer chains. The Young's modulus increased from 0.076 to 0.19 MPa
   with the addition of PUSS-PEG. Ionic conductivity studies reveal that
   solid polymer electrolyte with 30 wt\% of PUSS-PEG has the highest ionic
   conductivity of 5.05 x 10(-5) S/cm at room temperature (23 degrees C).
   The temperature dependence conductivity studies showed that the samples
   seemed to obey the Arrhenius behavior. (C) 2015 The Korean Society of

   towards SPECT and radioguided surgery}},
Journal = {{EJNMMI RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Background: The relevance of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)
   targeting in the clinical management of prostate cancer (PCa) is
   continually increasing, entailing the development of PSMA-targeted
   molecular probes. Recently, a first PSMA-targeted theranostic concept
   has been successfully implemented by {[}Ga-68/Lu-177]PSMA-I\&T. To
   further exploit the excellent PSMA-targeting characteristics and in vivo
   performance of the PSMA-I\&T platform, {[}In-111]PSMA-I\&T was evaluated
   as a complementary probe for radioguided surgery and SPECT imaging.
   Findings: Compared to {[}Ga-68/Lu-177]PSMA-I\&T, {[}In-111]PSMA-I\&T
   showed unchangedly high PSMA-affinity and enhanced internalization into
   PSMA-expressing LNCaP PCa cells. Biodistribution studies in LNCaP
   xenograft-bearing mice (1 h p.i.) revealed slightly reduced background
   accumulation of {[}In-111]PSMA-I\&T compared to {[}Lu-177]PSMA-I\& T and
   identical tumor uptake of both compounds, leading to increased
   tumor/background ratios for {[}In-111]PSMAI\&T. An exemplary patient
   with metastatic PCa underwent preoperative {[}Ga-68]HBED-CC-PSMA PET/CT
   (1 h p.i.) and {[}In-111]PSMA-I\&T SPECT/CT (4 h p.i.), followed by
   prostatectomy and radioguided extended pelvic lymphadenectomy (24 h
   p.i.). In {[}In-111]PSMA-I\&T SPECT/CT, the previously identified PCa
   lesions ({[}Ga-68]HBED-CC-PSMA PET/CT) showed high tracer accumulation
   and were also detectable using planar scintigraphy. The intraoperative
   use of a hand-held gamma probe allowed detection and resection of all
   {[}In-111]PSMA-I\&T-accumulating lesions. The presence of PSMA-positive
   tumor tissue in the resected specimens was confirmed histopathologically
   and via {[}In-111]PSMA-I\&T autoradiography.
   Conclusions: {[}In-111]PSMA-I\&T shows efficient PSMA targeting in vitro
   and in vivo, combined with low background accumulation. In an exemplary
   PCa patient, {[}In-111]PSMA-I\&T was successfully applied for
   preoperative SPECT/CT visualization and radioguided resection of
   PSMA-positive lesions, hinting towards a high value of
   {[}In-111]PSMA-I\&T as a complementary tool to {[}Ga-68/Lu-177]PSMA-I\&T
   in the clinical management of prostate cancer.}},

Abstract = {{A first-order moment method (FORM) reliability analysis is commonly used
   for structural stability analysis. It requires the values and partial
   derivatives of the performance to function with respect to the random
   variables for the design. These calculations can be cumbersome when the
   performance functions are implicit. A Gaussian process (GP)-based
   response surface is adopted in this study to approximate the limit state
   function. By using a trained GP model, a large number of values and
   partial derivatives of the performance functions can be obtained for
   conventional reliability analysis with a FORM, thereby reducing the
   number of stability analysis calculations. This dynamic renewed
   knowledge source can provide great assistance in improving the
   predictive capacity of GP during the iterative process, particularly
   from the view of machine learning. An iterative algorithm is therefore
   proposed to improve the precision of GP approximation around the design
   point by constantly adding new design points to the initial training
   set. Examples are provided to illustrate the GP-based response surface
   for both structural and non-structural reliability analyses. The results
   show that the proposed approach is applicable to structural reliability
   analyses that involve implicit performance functions and structural
   response evaluations that entail time-consuming finite element analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Early detection of cancer cells in a rapid and sensitive approach is one
   of the great challenges in modern clinical cancer care. This study has
   demonstrated the first example of a rapid, selective, and sensitive
   phosphorescence probe based on phosphorescence energy transfer (PET) for
   cancer-associated human NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase isozyme 1 (NQO1).
   An efficient room-temperature phosphorescence NQO1 probe was constructed
   by using Mn-doped ZnS quantum dots (Mn:ZnS QDs) as donors and
   trimethylquinone propionic acids as acceptors. Phosphorescence quenching
   of Mn:ZnS QDs from the Mn:ZnS QDs to a covalently bonded quinone was
   achieved through PET. Phosphorescence of Mn:ZnS QDs was turned on by the
   rapid reduction-initiated removal of the quinone quencher by NQO1. This
   probe shows low cellular toxicity and can rapidly distinguish between
   NQO1-expressing and -nonexpressing cancer cell lines through
   phosphorescence imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Microtubule-associated protein 1A (MAP1A) is a member of the major
   non-motor microtubule-binding proteins. It has been suggested that MAP1A
   tethers NMDA receptors (NRs) to the cytoskeleton by binding with
   proteins postsynaptic density (PSD)-93 and PSD-95, although the function
   of MAP1A in vivo remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that
   mouse MAP1A plays an essential role in maintaining synaptic plasticity
   through an analysis of MAP1A knock-out mice. The mice exhibited learning
   disabilities, which correlated with decreased long-term potentiation and
   long-term depression in the hippocampal neurons, as well as a
   concomitant reduction in the extent of NR-dependent EPSCs. Surface
   expression of NR2A and NR2B subunits also decreased. Enhanced
   activity-dependent degradation of PSD-93 and reduced transport of
   NR2A/2B in dendrites was likely responsible for altered receptor
   function in neurons lacking MAP1A. These data suggest that tethering of
   NR2A/2B with the cytoskeleton through MAP1A is fundamental for synaptic
   function.}},

   cells to neural stem cells remain fragmented. We have previously
   reported that RA is capable of differentiation of human trophoblast stem
   cells to dopamine (DA) committed progenitor cells. Intracranial
   implantation of such neural progenitor cells into the 6-OHDA-lesioned
   substantia nigra pars compacta successfully regenerates dopaminergic
   neurons and integrity of the nigrostriatal pathway, ameliorating the
   behavioral deficits in the Parkinson's disease rat model. Here, we
   demonstrated a dynamic molecular network in systematic analysis by
   addressing spatiotemporal molecular expression, intracellular
   protein-protein interaction and inhibition, imaging study, and genetic
   expression to explore the regulatory mechanisms of RA induction in the
   differentiation of human trophoblast stem cells to DA committed
   progenitor cells. We focused on the tyrosine receptor kinase (Trk), G
   proteins, canonical Wnt2B/beta-catenin, genomic and non-genomic RA
   signaling transductions with Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene expression
   as the differentiation endpoint. We found that at the early stage,
   integration of TrkA and G protein signalings aims for axonogenesis and
   morphogenesis, involving the novel RXR alpha/G alpha(Q)/11 and RAR
   beta/G beta signaling pathways. While at the later stage, five distinct
   signaling pathways together with epigenetic histone modifications
   emerged to regulate expression of TH, a precursor of dopamine. RA
   induction generated DA committed progenitor cells in one day. Our
   results provided substantial mechanistic evidence that human trophoblast
   stem cell-derived neural stem cells can potentially be used for
   neurobiological study, drug discovery, and as an alternative source of
   cell-based therapy in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{By assuming that the Lambda(c){*}(2940) is a pD{*}(0) molecular state

   the threshold. The contributions from the u-channel and contact term are
   very small. The total cross section of the gamma n ->

Abstract = {{Disconnected (disco)-interacting protein 2 homolog A is a member of the
   DIP2 protein family encoded by Dip2a gene. Dip2a expression pattern has
   never been systematically studied. Functions of Dip2a in embryonic
   development and adult are not known. To investigate Dip2a gene
   expression and function in embryo and adult, a Dip2a-LacZ mouse model
   was generated by insertion of beta-Gal cDNA after Dip2a promoter using
   CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Dip2a-LacZ mouse was designed to be a lacZ
   reporter mouse as well as a Dip2a knockout mouse. Heterozygous mice were
   used to study endogenous Dip2a expression and homozygotes to study
   DIP2A-associated structure and function. LacZ staining indicated that
   Dip2a is broadly expressed in neuronal, reproductive and vascular
   tissues, as well as in heart, kidney, liver and lung. Results
   demonstrate that Dip2a is expressed in ectoderm- derived tissues in
   developing embryos. Adult tissues showed rich staining in neurons,
   mesenchymal, endothelial, smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes by cell
   types. The expression pattern highly overlaps with FSTL1 and supports
   previous report that DIP2A to be potential receptor of FSTL1 and its
   protective roles of cardiomyocytes. Broad and intense embryonic and
   adult expression of Dip2a has implied their multiple structural and
   physiological roles.}},

Title = {{Identifying the competencies of doctors in China}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: China adopted a Flexnerian model as its medical institutions
   developed over the recent past but the political, social, and economic
   environment has changed significantly since then. This has generated the
   need for educational reform, which in other countries, has largely been
   driven by competencies-oriented models such as those developed in
   Canada, and the United States. Our study sought to establish the
   competencies model, relevant to China, which will support educational
   reform efforts.
   Methods: Data was collected using a cross-sectional survey of 1776
   doctors from seven provinces in China. The surveys were translated and
   adapted from the Occupational Information Network General Work Activity
   questionnaire (O{*}NET-GWA) and Work Style questionnaire (O{*}NET-WS)
   developed under the auspices of the US Department of Labor. Exploratory
   factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis ascertained the latent
   dimensions of the questionnaires, as well as the factor structures of
   the competencies model for the Chinese doctors.
   Results: In exploratory factor analysis, the questionnaires were able to
   account for 64.25 \% of total variance. All responses had high internal
   consistency and reliability. In confirmatory factor analysis, the
   loadings of six constructs were between 0.53 similar to 0.89 and were
   significant, Construct reliability (CR) were between 0.79 similar to
   0.93 respectively. The results showed good convergent validity. The
   resultant models fit the data well (GFI was 0.92, RMSEA was 0.07) and
   the six-factor competencies framework for Chinese doctors emerged.
   Conclusions: The Chinese doctors' competencies framework includes six
   elements: (a) technical procedural skills; (b) diagnosis and management;
   (c) teamwork and administration; (d) communication; (e) professional
   behavior; and (f) professional values. These findings are relevant to
   China, consistent with its current situation, and similar to those
   developed in other countries.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of final rolling speeds varying from 0.1 m/s to 0.4 m/s on
   the microstructures, textures, mechanical properties and stretch
   formability of AZ31 alloy sheets rolled at 550 degrees C was
   investigated in the present work. The results showed that in as-rolled
   condition, with increasing the final rolling speed, the grain size of
   the sheets increased whereas the basal texture intensity decreased.
   Twinning was still the main deformation behaviour even at high final
   rolling speed. After annealing, the sheets exhibited double-type
   textures with basal poles tilting at approximately from +/- 10 degrees
   to +/- 12 degrees in the rolling direction, and the basal texture
   weakened more remarkably via static recrystallization for the sheets
   rolled at higher final speed. By increasing the final rolling speeds
   from 0.1 m/s to 0.4 m/s, the Erichsen values of the annealed sheets at
   room temperature were enhanced from 4.9 mm to 6.3 mm resulted from the
   weakened basal texture, which leaded to a lower 0.2\% proof stress,
   r-value, and a larger n-value. The main reasons for the twinning
   behaviour and weakened textures at high final rolling speeds were
   discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The dicistrovirus intergenic region internal ribosome entry site (IRES)
   adopts a triple-pseudoknotted RNA structure and occupies the core
   ribosomal E, P, and A sites to directly recruit the ribosome and
   initiate translation at a non-AUG codon. A subset of dicistrovirus IRESs
   directs translation in the 0 and +1 frames to produce the viral
   structural proteins and a +1 overlapping open reading frame called ORFx,
   respectively. Here we show that specific mutations of two unpaired
   adenosines located at the core of the three-helical junction of the
   honey bee dicistrovirus Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) IRES PKI
   domain can uncouple 0 and +1 frame translation, suggesting that the
   structure adopts distinct conformations that contribute to 0 or +1 frame
   translation. Using a reconstituted translation system, we show that
   ribosomes assembled on mutant IRESs that direct exclusive 0 or +1 frame
   translation lack reading frame fidelity. Finally, a nuclear magnetic
   resonance/small-angle X-ray scattering hybrid approach reveals that the
   PKI domain of the IAPV IRES adopts an RNA structure that resembles a
   complete tRNA. The tRNA shape-mimicry enables the viral IRES to gain
   access to the ribosome tRNA-binding sites and form intermolecular
   contacts with the ribosome that are necessary for initiating IRES
   translation in a specific reading frame.}},

Abstract = {{CDKN2A/p16(INK4a) is an essential tumor suppressor gene that controls
   cell cycle progression and replicative senescence. It is also the main
   melanoma susceptibility gene. Here we report that p16(INK4a) 5'UTR mRNA
   acts as a cellular Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES). The potential
   for p16(INK4a) 5'UTR to drive cap-independent translation was evaluated
   by dual-luciferase assays using bicistronic and monocistronic vectors.
   Results of reporters' relative activities coupled to control analyses
   for actual bicistronic mRNA transcription, indicated that the wild type
   p16(INK4a) 5'UTR could stimulate cap-independent translation. Notably,
   hypoxic stress and the treatment with mTOR inhibitors enhanced the
   translation-stimulating property of p16(INK4a) 5'UTR. RNA
   immunoprecipitation performed in melanoma-derived SK-Mel-28 and in a
   patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell line indicated that YBX1 can bind
   the wild type p16(INK4a) mRNA increasing its translation efficiency,
   particularly during hypoxic stress. Modulation of YBX1 expression
   further supported its involvement in cap-independent translation of the
   wild type p16(INK4a) but not a c.-42T>A variant. RNA SHAPE assays
   revealed local flexibility changes for the c.-42T>A variant at the
   predicted YBX1 binding site region. Our results indicate that p16(INK4a)
   5'UTR contains a cellular IRES that can enhance mRNA translation
   efficiency, in part through YBX1.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we describe a method for the production of porous polymer
   materials in the form of particles characterized by narrow pore size
   distribution using the principle of shear-induced reactive gelation.
   Poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) primary particles with diameter ranging
   from 80 to 200 nm are used as building blocks, which are assembled into
   fractal-like clusters when exposed to high shear rates generated in a
   microchannel. It was found that independent of the primary particle
   size, it is possible to modulate the internal structure of formed
   fractal-like aggregates having fractal dimension ranging from 2.4 to 2.7
   by varying the residence time in the microchannel. Thermally induced
   postpolymerization was used to increase the mechanical resilience of
   such formed clusters. Primary particle interpenetration was observed by
   SEM and confirmed by light scattering resulting in an increase of
   fractal dimension. Nitrogen sorption measurements and mercury
   porosimetry confirmed formation of a porous material with surface area
   ranging from 20 to 40 m(2)/g characterized by porosity of 70\% and
   narrow pore size distribution with an average diameter around 700 nm
   without the presence of any micropores. The strong perfusive character
   of the synthesized material was confirmed by the existence of a plateau
   of the height equivalent to a theoretical plate measured at high reduced
   velocities using a chromatographic column packed with the synthesized
   microclusters.}},

Abstract = {{The design of stable, functional proteins is difficult. Improved design
   requires a deeper knowledge of the molecular basis for design outcomes
   and properties. We previously used a bioinformatics and energy function
   method to design a symmetric superfold protein composed of repeating
   structural elements with multivalent carbohydrate-binding function,
   called ThreeFoil. This and similar methods have produced a notably high
   yield of stable proteins. Using a battery of experimental and
   computational analyses we show that despite its small size and lack of
   disulfide bonds, ThreeFoil has remarkably high kinetic stability and its
   folding is specifically chaperoned by carbohydrate binding. It is also
   extremely stable against thermal and chemical denaturation and
   proteolytic degradation. We demonstrate that the kinetic stability can
   be predicted and modeled using absolute contact order (ACO) and
   long-range order (LRO), as well as coarse-grained simulations; the
   stability arises from a topology that includes many long-range contacts
   which create a large and highly cooperative energy barrier for unfolding
   and folding. Extensive data from proteomic screens and other experiments
   reveal that a high ACO/LRO is a general feature of proteins with strong
   resistances to denaturation and degradation. These results provide
   tractable approaches for predicting resistance and designing proteins
   with sufficient topological complexity and long-range interactions to
   accommodate destabilizing functional features as well as withstand
   chemical and proteolytic challenge.}},

Abstract = {{The ligand benzil bis(4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone), LMe2H4, reacts with
   zinc and mercury nitrates, both in the presence or in the absence of
   lithium hydroxide. Complexes containing a neutral or a doubly
   deprotonated ligand, depending on the reaction conditions, have been
   prepared. In all the complexes, the bis(thiosemicarbazone) acts as a
   N2S2 tetradentate ligand and in complex 4 probably also as a bridge
   through the sulfur atom leading to a dinuclear structure, while complex
   3 is a monomer with a water molecule coordinated to the zinc atom in a
   penta-coordinated environment. Complexes 1 and 2 contain monodentate
   nitrato ligands in a hexa-coordinated structure, which is confirmed by
   the crystal structure of complex 2, {[}Hg(LMe2H4)(NO3)(2)]. The
   complexes have been thoroughly characterized by elemental analysis, mass
   spectrometry, FTIR and H-1, C-13 and Hg-199 NMR spectroscopy and in the
   case of complex 2, also by single crystal X-ray diffraction. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The energy loss of light ions in dense plasmas is investigated with
   special focus on low to medium projectile energies, i.e., at velocities
   where the maximum of the stopping power occurs. In this region,
   exceptionally large theoretical uncertainties remain and no conclusive
   experimental data are available. We perform simulations of beamplasma
   configurations well suited for an experimental test of ion energy loss
   in highly ionized, laser-generated carbon plasmas. The plasma parameters
   are extracted from two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, and a Monte
   Carlo calculation of the charge-state distribution of the projectile ion
   beam determines the dynamics of the ion charge state over the whole
   plasma profile. We show that the discrepancies in the energy loss
   predicted by different theoretical models are as high as 20-30\%, making
   these theories well distinguishable in suitable experiments.}},

Title = {{Rapid and Efficient Production of Coronary Artery Ligation and
   Myocardial Infarction in Mice Using Surgical Clips}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   The coronary artery ligation model in rodents mimics human myocardial
   infarction (MI). Normally mechanical ventilation and prolonged
   anesthesia period are needed. Recently, a method has been developed to
   create MI by popping-out the heart (without ventilation) followed by
   immediate suture ligation. Mortality is high due to the time-consuming
   suture ligation process while the heart is exposed. We sought to improve
   this method and reduce mortality by rapid coronary ligation using a
   surgical clip instead of a suture.
   Methods and Results
   Mice were randomized into 3 groups: clip MI (CMI), suture MI (SMI), or
   sham (SHAM). In all groups, heart was manually exposed without
   intubation through a small incision on the chest wall. Unlike the
   conventional SMI method, mice in the CMI group received a metal clip on
   left anterior descending artery (LAD), quickly dispensed by an
   AutoSuture Surgiclip T. The CMI method took only 1/3 of ligation time of
   the standard SMI method and improved post-MI survival rate. TTC staining
   and Masson's trichrome staining revealed a similar degree of infarct
   size in the SMI and CMI groups. Echocardiograph confirmed that both SMI
   and CMI groups had a similar reduction of ejection fraction and fraction
   shortening over the time. Histological analysis showed that the numbers
   of CD68(+) macrophages and apoptotic cells (TUNEL-positive) are
   indistinguishable between the two groups.
   Conclusion
   This new method, taking only less than 3 minutes to complete, represents
   an efficient myocardial infarction model in rodents.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the alkaline earth-containing perovskite-based
   oxygen-transporting membranes (OTMs) have insufficient tolerance toward
   CO2 that potentially limits their commercial applications, for example,
   oxy-fuel combustion processes with CO2 capture. One concern regarding
   the chemical potential of oxygen that may influence the CO2 tolerance of
   perovskites, however, is lacking effective investigations. In the
   present work, we demonstrate that the approach to increase the chemical
   potential of oxygen at the feed side contributes to stabilize the oxygen
   permeation fluxes of the fluorite-perovskite dual-phase OTM under
   CO2-rich atmosphere, and we further verify that oxygen can effectively
   act as a ``buffer{''} to prevent the carbonate formation. Remarkably, we
   achieve high and stable oxygen permeation fluxes over 0.84 mL cm(-2)

Abstract = {{The conventional Tolman temperature based on the assumption of the
   traceless condition of energy-momentum tensor for matter fields is
   infinite at the horizon if Hawking radiation is involved. However, we
   note that the temperature associated with Hawking radiation is of
   relevance to the trace anomaly, which means that the traceless condition
   should be released. So, a trace anomaly-induced Stefan-Boltzmann law is
   newly derived by employing the first law of thermodynamics and the
   property of the temperature independence of the trace anomaly. Then, the
   Tolman temperature is quantum-mechanically generalized according to the
   anomaly-induced Stefan- Boltzmann law. In an exactly soluble model, we
   show that the Tolman factor does not appear in the generalized Tolman
   temperature which is eventually finite everywhere, in particular,
   vanishing at the horizon. It turns out that the equivalence principle
   survives at the horizon with the help of the quantum principle, and some
   puzzles related to the Tolman temperature are also resolved.}},

Abstract = {{The optimal selection of recipient-donor pair and accurate prediction of
   acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) severity are always the two most
   crucial works in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
   (allo-HSCT), which currently rests mostly with HLA compatibility, the
   most polymorphic loci in the human genome, in clinic. Thus, there is an
   urgent need for a rapid and reliable quantitative system for optimal
   recipient-donor pairs selection and accurate prediction of aGVHD
   severity prior to allo-HSCT. For these reasons, we have developed a new
   selection/prediction system for optimal recipient-donor selection and
   effective prediction of aGVHD severity based on HLA three-dimensional
   (3D) structure modeling (HLA-TDSM) discrepancy, and applied this system
   in a pilot randomized clinical allo-HSCT study. The 37 patient-donor
   pairs in the study were typed at low-and high-resolution levels for
   HLA-A/-B/-DRB1/DQB1 loci. HLA-TDSM system covering the 10000 alleles in
   HLA class I and II consists of the revised local and coordinate
   root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values for each locus. Its accuracy
   and reliability were confirmed using stably transfected Hmy2.CIR-HLA-B
   cells, TCR V beta gene scan, and antigen-specific alloreactive cytotoxic
   lymphocytes. Based on the preliminary results, we theoretically defined
   all HLA acceptable versus unacceptable mismatched alleles. More
   importantly, HLA-TDSM enabled a successful retrospective verification
   and prospective prediction for aGVHD severity in a pilot randomized
   clinical allo-HSCT study of 32 recipient-donor transplant pairs. There
   was a strong direct correlation between single/total revised RMSD and
   aGVHD severity (92\% in retrospective group vs 95\% in prospective
   group). These results seem to be closely related to the 3D structure
   discrepancy of mismatched HLA-alleles, but not the number or loci of
   mismatched HLA-alleles. Our data first provide the proof-of-concept that
   HLA-TDSM is essential for optimal selection of recipient-donor pairs and
   effective prediction of aGVHD severity before allo-HSCT.}},

Title = {{Slow Relaxation of Shape and Orientational Texture in Membrane Gel

Abstract = {{Gel domains in lipid bilayers are structurally more complex than fluid
   domains. Growth dynamics can lead to noncircular domains with a
   heterogeneous orientational texture. Most model membrane studies
   involving gel domain morphology and lateral organization assume the
   domains to be static. Here we show that rosette shaped gel domains, with
   heterogeneous orientational texture and a central topological defect,
   after early stage growth, undergo slow relaxation. On a time scale of
   days to weeks domains converge to circular shapes and approach uniform
   texture. 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) enriched gel
   domains are grown by cooling 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
   (DOPC):DPPC bilayers into the solid liquid phase coexistence region and
   are visualized with fluorescence microscopy. The relaxation of
   individual domains is quantified through image analysis of time-lapse
   image series. We find a shape relaxation mechanism which is inconsistent
   with Ostwald ripening and coalescence as observed in membrane systems
   with coexisting liquid phases. Moreover, domain texture changes in
   parallel with the changes in domain shape, and selective melting and
   growth of particular subdomains cause the texture to become more
   uniform. We propose a relaxation mechanism based on relocation of lipids
   from high-energy lattice positions, through evaporation condensation and
   edge diffusion, to low-energy positions. The relaxation process is
   modified significantly by binding Shiga toxin, a bacterial toxin from
   Shigella dysenteriae, to the membrane surface. Binding alters the
   equilibrium shape of the gel domains from circular to eroded rosettes
   with disjointed subdomains. This observation may be explained by edge
   diffusion while evaporation condensation is restricted, and it provides
   further support for the proposed overall relaxation mechanism.}},

   Phosphocholine Delivery Approach}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Ceramides can be delivered to cultured cells without solvents in the
   form of complexes with cholesteryl phosphocholine. We have analysed the
   delivery of three different radiolabeled D-erythro-ceramides (C6-Cer,
   C10-Cer and C16-Cer) to HeLa cells, and followed their metabolism as
   well as the cell viability. We found that all three ceramides were
   successfully taken up by HeLa cells when complexed to CholPC in an
   equimolar ratio, and show that the ceramides show different rates of
   cellular uptake and metabolic fate. The C6-Cer had the highest
   incorporation rate, followed by C10-Cer and C16-Cer, respectively. The
   subsequent effect on cell viability strongly correlated with the rate of
   incorporation, where C6-Cer had the strongest apoptotic effects.
   Low-dose (1 mu M) treatment with C6-Cer favoured conversion of the
   precursor to sphingomyelin, whereas higher concentrations (25-100 mu M)
   yielded increased conversion to C6-glucosylceramide. Similar results
   were obtained for C10-Cer. In the lower-dose C16-Cer experiments, most
   of the precursor was degraded, whereas at high-dose concentrations the
   precursor remained un-metabolized. Using this method, we demonstrate
   that ceramides with different chain lengths clearly exhibit varying
   rates of cellular uptake. The cellular fate of the externally delivered
   ceramides are clearly connected to their rate of incorporation and their
   subsequent effects on cell viability may be in part determined by their
   chain length.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of a new three-component
   polymerization route to functional poly(tetraarylethene)s (PTAEs). The
   polycoupling reactions of internal diynes, aryl diiodides, and
   arylboronic acids proceed smoothly in the presence of PdCl2 and NaF at
   70 degrees C in dimethylformamide, generating PTAEs with promising
   molecular weights in high yields from different monomers. Most of the
   PTAEs are soluble in common organic solvents and are thermally stable.
   Some of the PTAEs exhibit the phenomenon of aggregation-induced
   emission: their light emission in solution is enhanced by aggregate
   formation. The tetraphenylethene-containing PTAE can function as a
   fluorescent chemosensor for detecting Ru3+ ions with high sensitivity
   and specificity. It is also a promising material for the fabrication of
   fluorescent pattern by photolithography process. All the PTAEs possess
   good film-forming ability and their thin films exhibit high refractive
   index (RI = 1.7751-1.6382) at 632.8 nm, whose values are higher than
   those of commercial polymers such as polycarbonate and polystyrene.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},

Volume = {{357}},
Pages = {{377-408}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{This paper undertakes to facilitate appraisal of aeroelastic interaction
   of a locally distributed, flap-type control surface with aircraft wings
   operating in a subsonic potential flow field. The extended Hamilton's
   principle serves as a framework to ascertain the Euler-Lagrange
   equations for coupled bending-torsional-flap vibration. An analytical
   solution to this boundary-value problem is then accomplished by assumed
   modes and the extended Galerkin's method. The developed aeroelastic
   model considers both the inherent flexibility of the control surface
   displaced on the wing and the inertial coupling between these two
   flexible bodies. The structural deformations also obey the
   Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, along with the Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic
   constitutive law. Meanwhile, the unsteady thin-airfoil and strip
   theories are the tools of producing the three-dimensional airloads. The
   origin of aerodynamic instability undergoes analysis in light of the
   oscillatory loads as well as the loads owing to arbitrary motions. After
   successful verification of the model, a systematic flutter survey was
   conducted on the theoretical effects of various control surface
   parameters. The results obtained demonstrate that the flapping modes and
   parameters of the control surface can significantly impact the flutter
   characteristics of the wings, which leads to a series of pertinent
   conclusions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) we recently identified deregulated expression
   of homeobox genes MSX1 and OTX2 which are physiologically involved in
   development of the embryonal neural plate border region. Here, we
   examined in HL homeobox gene SIX1 an additional regulator of this
   embryonal region mediating differentiation of placodal precursors. SIX1
   was aberrantly activated in 12 \% of HL patient samples in silico,
   indicating a pathological role in a subset of this B-cell malignancy. In
   addition, SIX1 expression was detected in HL cell lines which were used
   as models to reveal upstream factors and target genes of this basic
   developmental regulator. We detected increased copy numbers of the SIX1
   locus at chromosome 14q23 correlating with enhanced expression while
   chromosomal translocations were absent. Moreover, comparative expression
   profiling data and pertinent gene modulation experiments indicated that
   the WNT-signalling pathway and transcription factor MEF2C regulate SIX1
   expression. Genes encoding the transcription factors GATA2, GATA3, MSX1
   and SPIB -all basic lymphoid regulators -were identified as targets of
   SIX1 in HL. In addition, cofactors EYA1 and TLE4, respectively,
   contrastingly mediated activation and suppression of SIX1 target gene
   expression. Thus, the protein domain interfaces may represent
   therapeutic targets in SIX1-positive HL subsets. Collectively, our data
   reveal a gene regulatory network with SIX1 centrally deregulating
   lymphoid differentiation and support concordance of
   lymphopoiesis/lymphomagenesis and developmental processes in the neural
   plate border region.}},

Abstract = {{Senescent cells secrete several molecules that help to prevent the
   progression of cancer. However, cancer cells can also misuse these
   secreted elements to survive and grow. Since the molecular and
   functional bases of these different elements remain poorly understood,
   we analyzed the effect of senescent mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)
   secretome on the biology of ARH-77 myeloma cells. In addition to
   differentiating in mesodermal derivatives, MSCs have sustained interest
   among researchers by supporting hematopoiesis, contributing to tissue
   homeostasis, and modulating inflammatory response, all activities
   accomplished primarily by the secretion of cytokines and growth factors.
   Moreover, senescence profoundly affects the composition of MSC
   secretome. In this study, we induced MSC senescence by oxidative stress,
   DNA damage, and replicative exhaustion. While the first two are
   considered to induce acute senescence, extensive proliferation triggers
   replicative (i.e., chronic) senescence. We cultivated cancer cells in
   the presence of acute and chronic senescent MSC-conditioned media and
   evaluated their proliferation, DNA damage, apoptosis, and senescence.
   Our findings revealed that senescent secretomes induced apoptosis or
   senescence, if not both, to different extents. This anti-tumor activity
   became heavily impaired when secretomes were collected from senescent
   cells previously in contact (i.e., primed) with cancer cells. Our
   analysis of senescent MSC secretomes with LC-MS/MS followed by Gene
   Ontology classification further indicated that priming with cancer
   profoundly affected secretome composition by abrogating the production
   of pro-senescent and apoptotic factors. We thus showed for the first
   time that compared with cancer-primed MSCs, naive senescent MSCs can
   exert different effects on tumor progression.}},

Abstract = {{Objective:Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal disease. The
   outcome measures used in numerous therapeutic trials include skeletal
   muscle biopsy. We studied the natural history of DMD from the standpoint
   of muscle histology with the aim of providing a reproducible tool for
   use in evaluating and comparing any histologic changes occurring in
   patients with DMD undergoing treatment and hence be able to determine
   how therapy modulates the histologic evolution of the
   disease.Methods:Three independent operators analyzed 56 muscle biopsies
   from 40 patients not treated with steroids, aged 1 to 10 years and 16
   individuals treated with steroids, aged 7 to 10 years. We analyzed
   morphologic measures, normalized every measure for the average number of
   fibers observed for each year of age, and calculated intraclass
   correlation coefficients.Results:The average proportion of connective
   tissue in patients not treated with steroids was 16.98\% from ages 1 to
   6 years and 30\% from ages 7 to 10 years (p < 0.0001). The average
   proportion in patients treated with steroids was 24.90\%. Muscle fiber
   area mirrored that of connective tissue in both
   groups.Conclusions:Having provided a reproducible tool for evaluation
   and comparison of histologic changes occurring in patients undergoing
   clinical trials, it was observed that at ages 6 to 7 years, fibrotic
   tissue rapidly peaks to 29.85\%; this is a crucial moment when muscle
   tissue loses its self-regeneration ability, veering toward fibrotic
   degeneration. These data should be considered when deciding the most
   suitable time to begin therapy.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to its well-known roles as an electrophile and general acid,
   the side chain of histidine often serves as a hydrogen bond (H-bond)
   acceptor. These H-bonds provide a convenient pH-dependent switch for
   local structure and functional motifs. In hundreds of instances, a
   histidine caps the N-terminus of alpha- and 3(10)-helices by forming a
   backbone NH center dot center dot center dot N delta 1 H-bond. To
   characterize the resilience and dynamics of the histidine cap, we
   measured the trans H-bond scalar coupling constant, (2h)J(NN), in
   several forms of Group 1 truncated hemoglobins and cytochrome b(5). The
   set of 19 measured (2h)J(NN) values were between 4.0 and 5.4 Hz,
   generally smaller than in nucleic acids (similar to 6-10 Hz) and
   indicative of longer, weaker bonds in the studied proteins. A positive
   linear correlation between (2h)J(NN) and the difference in imidazole
   ring N-15 chemical shift (Delta N-15 = vertical bar delta N-15 delta 1 -
   delta N-15 epsilon 2 vertical bar) was found to be consistent with
   variable H-bond length and variable cap population related to the
   ionization of histidine in the capping and noncapping states. The
   relative ease of (2h)J(NN) detection suggests that this parameter can
   become part of the standard arsenal for describing histidines in helix
   caps and other key structural and catalytic elements involving NH center
   dot center dot center dot N H-bonds. The combined nucleic acid and
   protein data extend the utility of (2h)J(NN) as a sensitive marker of
   local structural, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties in biomolecules.}},

Abstract = {{The histone variant H2A.Z is a hallmark of nucleosomes flanking
   promoters of protein-coding genes and is often found in nucleosomes that
   carry lysine 56-acetylated histone H3 (H3-K56Ac), a mark that promotes
   replication-independent nucleosome turnover. Here, we find that H3-K56Ac
   promotes RNA polymerase II occupancy atmany protein-coding and noncoding
   loci, yet neither H3-K56Ac nor H2A.Z has a significant impact on
   steady-state mRNA levels in yeast. Instead, broad effects of H3-K56Ac or
   H2A.Z on RNA levels are revealed only in the absence of the nuclear RNA
   exosome. H2A.Z is also necessary for the expression of divergent,
   promoter-proximal noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in mouse embryonic stem cells.
   Finally, we show that H2A.Z functions with H3-K56Ac to facilitate
   formation of chromosome interaction domains (CIDs). Our study suggests
   that H2A.Z and H3-K56Ac work in concert with the RNA exosome to control
   mRNA and ncRNA expression, perhaps in part by regulating higher-order
   chromatin structures.}},

Abstract = {{We report a synthetic method to increase the catalytic activity of
   bimessite toward water oxidation by intercalating copper in the
   interlayer region of the layered manganese oxide. Intercalation of
   copper, verified by XRD, XPS, ICP, and Raman spectroscopy, was
   accomplished by exposing a suspension of birnessite to a Cut-bearing
   precursor molecule that underwent disproportionation in solution to
   yield Cu-0 and Cu2+. Electrocatalytic studies showed that the
   Cu-modified birnessite exhibited an overpotential for water oxidation of
   similar to 490 mV (at 10 mA/cm(2)) and a Tafel slope of 126 mV/decade
   compared to similar to 700 mV (at 10 mA/cm(2)) and 240 mV/decade,
   respectively, for birnessite without copper. Impedance spectroscopy
   results suggested that the charge transfer resistivity of the
   Cu-modified sample was significantly lower than Cu-free birnessite,
   suggesting that Cu in the interlayer increased the conductivity of
   bimessite leading to an enhancement of water oxidation kinetics. Density
   functional theory calculations show that the intercalation of Cu-0 into
   a layered MnO2 model structure led to a change of the electronic
   properties of the material from a semiconductor to a metallic-like
   structure. This conclusion from computation is in general agreement with
   the aforementioned impedance spectroscopy results. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) showed that Cu-0 coexisted with Cu2+ in the prepared
   Cu-modified birnessite. Control experiments using birnessite that was
   decorated with only Cu2+ showed a reduction in water oxidation kinetics,
   further emphasizing the importance of Cu-0 for the increased activity of
   birnessite. The introduction of Cu-0 into the birnessite structure also
   increased the stability of the electrocatalyst. At a working current of
   2 mA, the Cu-modified birnessite took similar to 3 times longer for the
   overpotential for water oxdiation to increase by 100 mV compared to when
   Cu was not present in the birnessite.}},

Abstract = {{Olfactory dysfunction is present in up to 90\% of Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) patients. Although deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau and
   beta-amyloid substrates are present in olfactory areas, the molecular
   mechanisms associated with decreased smell function are not completely
   understood. We have applied mass spectrometry-based quantitative
   proteomics to probe additional molecular disturbances in postmortem
   olfactory bulbs (OB) dissected from AD cases respect to neurologically
   intact controls (n=20, mean age 82.1 years). Relative proteome abundance
   measurements have revealed protein interaction networks progressively
   disturbed across AD stages suggesting an early imbalance in splicing
   factors, subsequent interrupted cycling of neurotransmitters, alteration
   in toxic and protective mechanisms of beta-amyloid, and finally, a
   mitochondrial dysfunction together with disturbance in neuron-neuron
   adhesion. We also present novel molecular findings in the OB in an
   autopsy cohort composed by Lewy body disease (LBD), frontotemporal lobar
   degeneration (FTLD), mixed dementia, and progressive supranuclear palsy
   (PSP) cases (n = 41, mean age 79.7 years). Olfactory mediators
   deregulated during the progression of AD such as Visinin-like protein 1,
   RUFY3 protein, and Copine 6 were also differentially modulated in the OB
   in LBD, FTLD, and mixed dementia. Only Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-like
   protein 6 showed a specific down-regulation in AD. However, no
   differences were observed in the olfactory expression of this protein
   panel in PSP subjects. This study demonstrates an olfactory progressive
   proteome modulation in AD, unveiling cross-disease similarities and
   differences especially for specific proteins involved in dendritic and
   axonic distributions that occur in the OB during the neurodegenerative
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Frizzled-7 protein plays a significant role in the formation of several
   malignant tumors. Up regulation of the Frizzled-7 in cancer cell lines
   is associated with nuclear accumulation of wild-type beta-catenin from
   the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway which is frequently activated in tumors. To
   analyze activity of the Frizzled-7 promoter in tumor cells, we
   constructed two recombinant plasmid vectors in which the Frizzled-7
   promoter was used to drive the expression of green fluorescent protein
   (GFP) and Shiga-like toxin I (Stx1) (pFZD7-GFP/Stx1) genes. The
   Frizzled-7 protein was found to be expressed in the cancer cell lines
   but not in the normal cell lines. The GFP expression was restricted to
   the cancer cell lines and xenografts in the BALB/C mice but not to
   normal cell lines. Moreover, cell proliferation and tumor growth
   decreased significantly after transfection with the pFZD7-Stx1. Results
   from this study will help determine a highly effective strategy for gene
   therapy of tumors.}},

   superconductor LiFeAs structure}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{By using first-principles calculations, we propose that ZrSiO can be
   looked at as a three-dimensional (3D) oxide weak topological insulator
   (TI) and its single layer is a long-sought-after 2D oxide TI with a band
   gap up to 30 meV. Calculated phonon spectrum of the single layer ZrSiO
   indicates it is dynamically stable and the experimental achievements in
   growing oxides with atomic precision ensure that it can be readily
   synthesized. This will lead to novel devices based on TIs, the so-called
   ``topotronic{''} devices, operating under room temperature and stable
   when exposed in the air. Thus a new field of ``topotronics{''} will
   arise. Another intriguing thing is this oxide 2D TI has the similar
   crystal structure as the well-known iron-pnictide superconductor LiFeAs.
   This brings great promise in realizing the combination of superconductor
   and TI, paving the way to various extraordinary quantum phenomena, such
   as topological superconductor and Majorana modes. We further find that
   there are many other isostructural compounds hosting the similar
   electronic structure and forming a WHM family with W being Zr, Hf, or
   La, H being group IV or group V element, and M being group VI one.}},

Title = {{SDF1-CXCR4 signaling contributes to persistent pain and hypersensitivity
   via regulating excitability of primary nociceptive neurons: involvement
   of ERK-dependent Nav1.8 up-regulation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pain is one critical hallmark of inflammatory responses. A
   large number of studies have demonstrated that stromal cell-derived
   factor 1 (SDF1, also named as CXCL12) and its cognate receptor C-X-C
   chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) play an important role in immune
   reaction and inflammatory processes. However, whether and how SDF1-CXCR4
   signaling is involved in inflammatory pain remains unclear.
   Methods: Under the intraplantar (i.pl.) bee venom (BV) injection-induced
   persistent inflammatory pain state, the changes of SDF1 and CXCR4
   expression and cellular localization in the rat dorsal root ganglion
   (DRG) were detected by immunofluorescent staining. The role of SDF1 and
   CXCR4 in the hyperexcitability of primary nociceptor neurons was
   assessed by electrophysiological recording. Western blot analysis was
   used to quantify the DRG Nav1.8 and phosphorylation of ERK (pERK)
   expression. Behavioral tests were conducted to evaluate the roles of
   CXCR4 as well as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Nav1.8
   in the BV-induced persistent pain and hypersensitivity.
   Results: We showed that both SDF1 and CXCR4 were dramatically
   up-regulated in the DRG in i.pl. BV-induced inflammatory pain model.
   Double immunofluorescent staining showed that CXCR4 was localized in all
   sizes (large, medium, and small) of DRG neuronal soma, while SDF1 was
   exclusively expressed in satellite glial cells (SGCs).
   Electrophysiological recording showed that bath application with
   AMD3100, a potent and selective CXCR4 inhibitor, could reverse the
   hyperexcitability of medium-and small-sized DRG neurons harvested from
   rats following i.pl. BV injection. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the
   BV-induced ERK activation and Nav1.8 up-regulation in the DRG could be
   blocked by pre-antagonism against CXCR4 in the periphery with AMD3100 as
   well as by blockade of ERK activation by intrathecal (i.t.) or
   intraplantar (i.pl.) U0126. At behavioral level, the BV-induced
   persistent spontaneous pain as well as primary mechanical and thermal
   hypersensitivity could also be significantly suppressed by blocking
   CXCR4 and Nav1.8 in the periphery as well as by inhibition of ERK
   activation at the DRG level.
   Conclusions: The present results suggest that peripheral inflammatory
   pain state can trigger over release of SDF1 from the activated SGCs in
   the DRG by which SGC-neuronal cross-talk is mediated by SDF1-CXCR4
   coupling that result in subsequent ERK-dependent Nav1.8 up-regulation,
   leading to hyperexcitability of tonic type of the primary nociceptor
   cells and development and maintenance of persistent spontaneous pain and
   hypersensitivity.}},

Title = {{Gravitational Effect on the Formation of Surface Nanodroplets}},
Journal = {{LANGMUIR}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{46}},
Pages = {{12628-12634}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale droplets at a solid liquid interface are of high relevance for
   many fundamental phenomena and applied processes. The solvent exchange
   process is a simple approach to produce, e.g., oil nanodroplets over a
   large surface area on a substrate, by exchange oil-saturated ethanol by
   oil-saturated water, which has a lower oil solubility than ethanol. In
   this process, the size of the nanodroplets is closely related to the
   flow conditions. To achieve control of the droplet size, it is essential
   to fully understand the nucleation and growth of nanodroplets under
   different flow conditions. In this work, we investigate the
   gravitational effect on the droplet formation by the solvent exchange.
   We compared the droplet size as the substrate was placed on the upper or
   lower wall in a horizontal fluid channel or on the sides of a vertical
   channel with an upward or downward flow. We found significant difference
   in the droplet size for the three substrate positions in a wide channel
   with height h = 0.21 mm. The difference of droplet size was eliminated
   in a narrow channel with height h = 0.07 mm. The relevant dimensional
   control parameter for the occurrence of the gravitational effects is the
   Archimedes number Ar and these two heights correspond to Ar = 10 and Ar
   = 0.35, respectively. The gravitational effects lead to a nonsymmetric
   parabolic profile of the mixing front, with the velocity maximum being
   off-center and thus with different distances alpha(Ar)h and (1 -
   alpha(Ar))h to the lower and upper wall, respectively. The ratio of the
   total droplet volume on the lower and upper wall is theoretically found
   to be (alpha(Ar)/(1 - alpha(Ar)))(3). This study thus improves our
   understanding of the mechanism of the solvent exchange process,
   providing guidelines for tailoring the volume of surface nanodroplets.}},

Abstract = {{Some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influence the existence of
   CpG sites, the basis of DNA modification such as methylation and
   hydroxymethylation. These polymorphisms can lead to gain or loss of CpG
   sites and were defined as CpG site related SNPs (cgSNPs) in this study.
   The cgSNPs change DNA sequence and might potentially affect DNA
   modification such as methylation. However, the functional consequence of
   cgSNPs is poorly understood. We observed that a considerable proportion
   (23.0\%) of common variants were cgSNPs in human genome. Mutations
   involving loss of CpG sites were associated with reduced levels of
   methylation (similar to 20.2\%) using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   data. Using public databases (SCAN and seeQTL) of expression
   quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), we found that the cgSNPs were
   significantly enriched in eQTLs via logistic regression and simulation
   test. Furthermore, we observed that cgSNPs were more likely to be
   trait-associated loci especially cancers using a catalog of published
   genome-wide association studies (GWAS) recorded by National Human Genome
   Research Institute (NHGRI). Our results indicated that cgSNP might be
   meaningful as annotation either in SNP functional prediction or in
   screening for trait-associated SNPs.}},

Title = {{Using the health belief model to predict breast self examination among
   Saudi women}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, breast cancer (BC) usually
   presents at advanced stages and more frequently in young pre-menopausal
   women in comparison to western countries. There is controversy
   surrounding the efficacy of breast self examination (BSE) for early
   detection of BC in countries where other methods are available. This
   study aims to explore the perception towards breast cancer and towards
   BSE among Saudi women, using the Health Belief Model (HBM).
   Methods: A convenient sample of adult Saudi female employees, working at
   King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (n = 225), and their
   non-working adult female family members (n = 208), were subjected to the
   Arabic version of revised Champion's Health Belief Model Scale (CHBMS)
   and the Arabic version of Breast Cancer Awareness Measure (CAM), to
   assess their knowledge and attitude on BC respectively. Percentage mean
   score (PMS) for each HBM domain was calculated. Significant predictors
   of BSE practice were identified using logistic regression analysis and
   significance was considered at p < 0.05.
   Results: The majority of women heard about BSE (91.2 \%), only 41.6 \%
   reported ever practicing BSE and 21 \% performed it regularly. Reported
   reasons for not doing BSE were: not knowing how to examine their breast
   (54.9 \%), or untrusting themselves able to do it (24.5 \%). Women were
   less knowledgeable about BC in general, its risk factors, warning signs,
   nature and screening measures (PMS:54.2 \%, 44.5 \%, 61.4 \%, 53.2 \%,
   57.6 \% respectively). They reported low scores of; perceived
   susceptibility, seriousness, confidence and barriers (PMS: 44.8 \%, 55.6
   \%, 56.5 \% \& 41.7 \% respectively), and high scores of perceived
   benefits and motivation (PMS: 73 \% \& 73.2 \% respectively) to perform
   BSE. Significant predictors of BSE performance were: levels of perceived
   barriers (p = 0.046) and perceived confidence (p = 0.001) to BSE,
   overall knowledge on BC (p < 0.001), work status (p = 0.032) and family
   history of BC (p = 0.011).
   Conclusions: Saudi women had poor knowledge on BC, reported negative
   attitude towards BSE and their practice was poor. Working women and
   those with family history of BC, higher perceived confidence and lower
   perceived barriers on HBM, and those with high level of knowledge on BC
   were more likely to perform BSE. Breast awareness as an alternative to
   BSE needs further investigations. HBM was shown as a valid tool to
   predict BSE practice among Saudi women.}},

Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: The capacity of marine species to survive chronic heat
   stress underpins their ability to survive warming oceans as a result of
   climate change. In this study RNA-Seq and 2-DE proteomics were employed
   to decipher the molecular response of the sub-tidal bivalve Pecten
   maximus, to elevated temperatures.
   Results: Individuals were maintained at three different temperatures
   (15, 21 and 25 degrees C) for 56 days, representing control conditions,
   maximum environmental temperature and extreme warming, with individuals
   sampled at seven time points. The scallops thrived at 21 degrees C, but
   suffered a reduction in condition at 25 degrees C. RNA-Seq analyses
   produced 26,064 assembled contigs, of which 531 were differentially
   expressed, with putative annotation assigned to 177 transcripts. The
   proteomic approach identified 24 differentially expressed proteins, with
   nine identified by mass spectrometry. Network analysis of these results
   indicated a pivotal role for GAPDH and AP1 signalling pathways. Data
   also suggested a remodelling of the cell structure, as revealed by the
   differential expression of genes involved in the cytoskeleton and cell
   membrane and a reduction in DNA repair. They also indicated the
   diversion of energetic metabolism towards the mobilization of lipid
   energy reserves to fuel the increased metabolic rate at the higher
   temperature.
   Conclusions: This work provides preliminary insights into the response
   of P. maximus to chronic heat stress and provides a basis for future
   studies examining the tipping points and energetic trade-offs of scallop
   culture in warming oceans.}},

Title = {{Amyloid Cardiomyopathy in Hereditary Transthyretin V30M Amyloidosis -
   Impact of Sex and Amyloid Fibril Composition}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Transthyretin V30M (ATTR V30M) amyloidosis is a phenotypically diverse
   disease with symptoms ranging from predominant neuropathy to exclusive
   cardiac manifestations. The aims of this study were to determine the
   dispersion of the two types of fibrils found in Swedish ATTR V30M
   patients - Type A consisting of a mixture of truncated and full length
   ATTR fibrils and type B fibrils consisting of full length fibrils, and
   to estimate the severity of cardiac dysfunction in relation to fibril
   composition and sex.
   Material and Methods
   Echocardiographic data were analysed in 107 Swedish ATTR V30M patients
   with their fibril composition determined as either type A or type B.
   Measurements of left ventricular (LV) dimensions and evaluation of
   systolic and diastolic function including speckle tracking derived
   strain were performed. Patients were grouped according to fibril type
   and sex. Multivariate linear regression was utilised to determine
   factors of significant impact on LV thickness.
   Results
   There was no significant difference in proportions of the two types of
   fibrils between men and women. In patients with type A fibrils, women
   had significantly lower median septal (p = 0.007) and posterior wall
   thicknesses (p = 0.010), lower median LV mass indexed to height (p =
   0.008), and higher septal strain (p = 0.037), as compared to males.
   These differences were not apparent in patients with type B fibrils.
   Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that fibril type, sex and
   age all had significant impact on LV septal thickness.
   Conclusion
   This study demonstrates a clear difference between sexes in the severity
   of amyloid heart disease in ATTR V30M amyloidosis patients. Even though
   type A fibrils were associated with more advanced amyloid heart disease
   compared to type B, women with type A fibrils generally developed less
   cardiac infiltration than men. The differences may explain the better
   outcome for liver transplanted late-onset female patients compared to
   males.}},

Abstract = {{Within the framework of our effort to discover new antibiotics from
   pseudomonads, pseudopyronines A and B were isolated from the

   3,6-dialkyl-4-hydroxy-2-pyrones and displayed high in vitro activities
   against several human pathogens, and in our hands also towards the plant
   pathogen Pseudomonas savastanoi. Here, the biosynthesis of
   pseudopyronine B was studied by a combination of feeding experiments
   with isotopically labeled precursors, genomic sequence analysis, and
   gene deletion experiments. The studies resulted in the deduction of all
   acetate units and revealed that the biosynthesis of these apyrones
   occurs with a single PpyS-homologous ketosynthase. It fuses, with some
   substrate flexibility, a 3-oxo-fatty acid and a further unbranched
   saturated fatty acid, both of medium chain-length and provided by
   primary metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Many proteins suffer from suboptimal pharmacokinetics (PK) that limit
   their utility as drugs. The efficient synthesis of polymer conjugates of
   protein drugs with tunable PK to optimize their in vivo efficacy is
   hence critical. We report here the first study of the in vivo behavior
   of a site-specific conjugate of a zwitterionic polymer and a protein. To
   synthesize the conjugate, we first installed an initiator for
   atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) at the N terminus of
   myoglobin (Mb-N-Br). Subsequently, in situ ATRP was carried out in
   aqueous buffer to grow an amine-functionalized polymer from Mb-N-Br. The
   cationic polymer was further derivatized to two zwitterionic polymers by
   treating the amine groups of the cationic polymer with iodoacetic acid
   to obtain poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) with a one-carbon spacer
   (PCBMA; C-1), and sequentially with 3-iodopropionic acid and iodoacetic
   acid to obtain PCBMA(mix) with a mixture of C-1 and C-2 spacers. The
   Mb-N-PCBMA polymer conjugates had a longer in vivo plasma halflife than
   a PEG-like comb polymer conjugate of similar molecular weights (MW). The
   structure of the zwitterion plays a role in controlling the in vivo
   behavior of the conjugate, as the PCBMA conjugate with a C-1 spacer had
   significantly longer plasma circulation than the conjugate with a
   mixture of C-1 and C-2 spacers.}},

Abstract = {{We have obtained Anti-Phase Boundary (APB) free GaAs epilayers on
   ``quasi-nominal{''} (001) silicon substrates, while using a thick
   germanium strain relaxed buffer between the GaAs layer and the silicon
   substrate in order to accommodate the 4\% lattice mismatch between the
   two. As silicon (001) substrates always have a small random offcut angle
   from their nominal surface plane, we call them ``quasi-nominal,{''} We
   have focused on the influence that this small (<= 0,5 degrees) offcut
   angle has on the GaAs epilayer properties, showing that it greatly
   influences the density of APBs, On 0.5' offcut substrates, we obtained
   smooth, slightly tensile strained (R = 106\%) GaAs epilayers that were
   single domain (e.g., without any APB), showing that it is not necessary
   to use large offcut substrates, typically 4 to 6', for GaAs epitaxy on
   silicon, These make the GaAs layers more compatible with the existing
   silicon manufacturing technology that uses ``quasi-nominal{''}
   substrates. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC,}},

Title = {{Correction of a Depth-Dependent Lateral Distortion in 3D
   Super-Resolution Imaging}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) localization-based super-resolution microscopy
   (SR) requires correction of aberrations to accurately represent 3D
   structure. Here we show how a depth-dependent lateral shift in the
   apparent position of a fluorescent point source, which we term `wobble',
   results in warped 3D SR images and provide a software tool to correct
   this distortion. This system-specific, lateral shift is typically > 80
   nm across an axial range of similar to 1 mu m. A theoretical analysis
   based on phase retrieval data from our microscope suggests that the
   wobble is caused by non-rotationally symmetric phase and amplitude
   aberrations in the microscope's pupil function. We then apply our
   correction to the bacterial cytoskeletal protein FtsZ in live bacteria
   and demonstrate that the corrected data more accurately represent the
   true shape of this vertically-oriented ring-like structure. We also
   include this correction method in a registration procedure for
   dual-color, 3D SR data and show that it improves target registration
   error (TRE) at the axial limits over an imaging depth of 1 mu m,
   yielding TRE values of < 20 nm. This work highlights the importance of
   correcting aberrations in 3D SR to achieve high fidelity between the
   measurements and the sample.}},

Abstract = {{Isoflavone reductase (IFR) is an enzyme involved in the biosynthetic
   pathway of isoflavonoid phytoalexin in plants. IFRs are unique to the
   plant kingdom and are considered to have crucial roles in plant response
   to various biotic and abiotic environmental stresses. Here, we report
   the characterization of a novel member of the soybean isoflavone
   reductase gene family Gm/FE?. Overexpression of Gm/FR transgenic soybean
   exhibited enhanced resistance to Phytophthora sojae. Following stress
   treatments, Gm/FR was significantly induced by P. sojae, ethephon (ET),
   abscisic acid (placeCityABA), salicylic acid (SA). It is located in the
   cytoplasm when transiently expressed in soybean protoplasts. The
   daidzein levels reduced greatly for the seeds of transgenic plants,
   while the relative content of glyceollins in transgenic plants was
   significantly higher than that of non-transgenic plants. Furthermore, we
   found that the relative expression levels of reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) of transgenic soybean plants were significantly lower than those
   of non-transgenic plants after incubation with P sojae, suggesting an
   important role of Gm/FR might function as an antioxidant to reduce ROS
   in soybean. The enzyme activity assay suggested that GmIFR has
   isoflavone reductase activity.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless ad hoc networks have been widely used in many areas. In order
   to improve network performance, we often select a connected dominating
   set (CDS) as its virtual backbone to deal with routing-related tasks.
   The problem of finding a minimum CDS (MCDS) for 2-dimensional networks
   has been widely studied, whereas finding an MCDS in 3-dimensional
   networks draws more attention recently, because it can formulate the
   network environment more precisely. Since MCDS problem is proved to be
   NP-complete, lots of approximations were proposed in literature. Among
   those, the best approximation for MCDS in 3D network is 14.937 in {[}1].
   However, their projection method during the approximation deduction
   process is incorrect, which overthrows its final bound completely. As a
   consequence, in this paper we will first propose a new projection method
   to overcome their problem, illustrate the cardinality upper bound of
   independent points in a graph (which will be used to analyze the
   approximation ratio), and then optimize the algorithms to select MCDS
   with prune techniques. The major technique we use is an adaptive jitter
   scheme, which solves the open question in this area. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Nonlinear processes can be exploited to gain access to more information
   than is possible in the linear regime. Nonlinearity modifies the spectra
   of the excitation signals through harmonic generation, frequency mixing,
   and spectral shifting, so that features originally outside the detector
   range can be detected. Here, we present an experimental study of
   resolution enhancement for photoacoustic imaging of thin metal layers
   immersed in water. In this case, there is a threshold in the excitation
   below which no acoustic signal is detected. Above threshold, the
   nonlinearity reduces the width of the active area of the excitation
   beam, resulting in a narrower absorption region and thus improved
   spatial resolution. This gain is limited only by noise, as the active
   area of the excitation can be arbitrarily reduced when the fluence
   becomes closer to the threshold. Here, we demonstrate a two-fold
   improvement in resolution and quantify the image quality as the
   excitation fluence goes through threshold. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Trade-Offs of Flowering and Maturity Synchronisation for Pineapple
   Quality}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{In the pineapple sector of Benin, poor fruit quality prevents pineapple
   producers to enter the European market. We investigated effects of
   common cultural practices, flowering and maturity synchronisation, (1)
   to quantify the trade-offs of flowering and maturity synchronisation for
   pineapple quality and the proportion of fruits exportable to European
   markets, and (2) to determine the effect of harvesting practice on
   quality attributes. Four on-farm experiments were conducted during three
   years using cultivars Sugarloaf and Smooth Cayenne. A split-split plot
   design was used in each experiment, with flowering induction practice as
   main factor (artificial or natural flowering induction), maturity
   induction practice as split factor (artificial or natural maturity
   induction) and harvesting practice as the split-split factor (farmers'
   harvest practice or individual fruit harvesting at optimum maturity).
   Artificial flowering induction gave fruits with lower infructescence
   weight, higher ratio crown: infructescence length, and a lower
   proportion of fruits exportable to European markets than natural
   flowering induction. The costs of the improvements by natural flowering
   induction were huge: the longer durations from planting to flowering
   induction and harvesting, the higher number of harvestings of the fruits
   increasing the labour cost and the lower proportion of plants producing
   fruits compared with crops from artificially flowering-induced plants.
   Artificial maturity induction decreased the total soluble solids
   concentration in the fruits compared with natural maturity induction
   thus decreasing the proportion of fruits exportable to European markets,
   at a benefit of only a slightly shorter time from flowering induction to
   harvesting. Harvesting individual fruits at optimum maturity gave fruits
   with higher total soluble solids in naturally maturity induced fruits
   compared with the farmers' harvest practice. Given the huge costs of
   natural flowering induction, options to use artificial flowering
   induction effectively for obtaining high fruit quality are discussed.}},

Title = {{Light stops and observation of supersymmetry at LHC run II}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Light stops consistent with the Higgs boson mass of similar to 126 GeV
   are investigated within the framework of minimal supergravity. It is
   shown that models with light stops which are also consistent with the
   thermal relic density constraints require stop coannihilation with the
   neutralino LSP. The analysis shows that the residual set of parameter
   points with light stops satisfying both the Higgs mass and the relic
   density constraints lie within a series of thin strips in the m(0) -
   m(1/2) plane for different values of A(0)/m(0). Consequently, this
   region of minimal supergravity parameter space makes a number of very
   precise predictions. It is found that light stops of mass down to 400
   GeV or lower can exist consistent with all constraints. A signal
   analysis for this class of models at LHC run II is carried out and the
   dominant signals for their detection identified. Also computed is the
   minimum integrated luminosity for 5s discovery of the models analyzed.
   If supersymmetry is realized in this manner, the stop masses can be as
   low as 400 GeV or lower, and the mass gap between the lightest
   neutralino and lightest stop will be approximately 30-40 GeV. We have
   optimized the ATLAS signal regions specifically for stop searches in the
   parameter space and find that a stop with mass similar to 375 GeV can be
   discovered with as little as similar to 60 fb(-1) of integrated
   luminosity at run II of the LHC; the integrated luminosity needed for
   discovery could be further reduced with more efficient signature
   analyses. The direct detection of dark matter in this class of models is
   also discussed. It is found that dark matter cross sections lie close
   to, but above, coherent neutrino scattering and would require multiton
   detectors such as LZ to see a signal of dark matter for this class of
   models.}},

Title = {{The Effects of Varying Ankle Foot Orthosis Stiffness on Gait in Children
   with Spastic Cerebral Palsy Who Walk with Excessive Knee Flexion}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Rigid Ankle-Foot Orthoses (AFOs) are commonly prescribed to counteract
   excessive knee flexion during the stance phase of gait in children with
   cerebral palsy (CP). While rigid AFOs may normalize knee kinematics and
   kinetics effectively, it has the disadvantage of impeding push-off
   power. A spring-like AFO may enhance push-off power, which may come at
   the cost of reducing the knee flexion less effectively. Optimizing this
   trade-off between enhancing push-off power and normalizing knee flexion
   in stance is expected to maximize gait efficiency. This study
   investigated the effects of varying AFO stiffness on gait biomechanics
   and efficiency in children with CP who walk with excessive knee flexion
   in stance. Fifteen children with spastic CP (11 boys, 10 +/- 2 years)
   were prescribed with a ventral shell spring-hinged AFO (vAFO). The hinge
   was set into a rigid, or spring-like setting, using both a stiff and
   flexible performance. At baseline (i.e. shoes-only) and for each vAFO, a
   3D-gait analysis and 6-minute walk test with breath-gas analysis were
   performed at comfortable speed. Lower limb joint kinematics and kinetics
   were calculated. From the 6-minute walk test, walking speed and the net
   energy cost were determined. A generalized estimation equation (p<0.05)
   was used to analyze the effects of different conditions. Compared to
   shoes-only, all vAFOs improved the knee angle and net moment similarly.
   Ankle power generation and work were preserved only by the spring-like
   vAFOs. All vAFOs decreased the net energy cost compared to shoes-only,
   but no differences were found between vAFOs, showing that the effects of
   spring-like vAFOs to promote push-off power did not lead to greater
   reductions in walking energy cost. These findings suggest that, in this
   specific group of children with spastic CP, the vAFO stiffness that
   maximizes gait efficiency is primarily determined by its effect on knee
   kinematics and kinetics rather than by its effect on push-off power.}},

Title = {{Coronary Atherosclerotic Plaque Detected by Computed Tomographic
   Angiography in Subjects with Diabetes Compared to Those without Diabetes}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   Little data are available regarding coronary plaque composition and
   semi-quantitative scores in individuals with diabetes; the extent to
   which diabetes may affect the presence and extent of Coronary Artery
   Calcium (CAC) needs more evaluation. Considering that this information
   may be of great value in formulating preventive interventions in this
   population, we compared these findings in individuals with diabetes to
   those without.
   Methods
   Multi-Detector Computed Tomographic (MDCT) images of 861 consecutive
   patients with diabetes who were referred to Los Angeles Biomedical
   Research Institute from January 2000 to September 2012, were evaluated
   using a 15-coronary segment model. All 861 patients underwent calcium
   scoring and from these; 389 had coronary CT angiography (CTA). CAC score
   was compared to 861 age, sex and ethnicity matched controls without
   diabetes after adjustment for Body Mass Index (BMI), family history of
   coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and smoking.
   Segment Involvement Score (SIS; the total number of segments with any
   plaque), Segment Stenosis Score (SSS; the sum of maximal stenosis score
   per segment), Total Plaque Score (TPS; the sum of the plaque amount per
   segment) and plaque compositionwere compared to 389 age, sex and
   ethnicity matched controls without diabetes after adjustment for BMI,
   family history of coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension
   and smoking.
   Results
   Diabetes was positively correlated to the presence and extent of CAC
   (P<0.0001 for both). SIS, SSS and TPS were significantly higher in those
   with diabetes (P<0.0001). Number of mixed and calcified plaques were
   significantly higher in those with diabetes (P = 0.018 and P<0.001
   respectively) but there was no significant difference in the number of
   non-calcified plaques between the two groups (P = 0.398).
   Conclusions
   Patients with diabetes have higher CAC and semi-quantitative coronary
   plaque scores compared to the age, gender and ethnicity matched controls
   without diabetes after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. Since
   mixed plaque is associated with worse long-term clinical outcomes, these
   findings support more aggressive preventive measures in this population.}},

Title = {{Colored HOMFLY and generalized Mandelbrot set}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Mandelbrot set is a closure of the set of zeroes of resultant(x) (F-n,
   F-m) for iterated maps F-n(x) = f(on)(x) - x in the moduli space of maps
   f (x). The wonderful fact is that for a given n all zeroes are not
   chaotically scattered around the moduli space, but lie on smooth curves,
   with just a few cusps, located at zeroes of discriminant(x)(F-n). We
   call this phenomenon the Mandelbrot property. If approached by the
   cabling method, symmetrically-colored HOMFLY polynomials H-n(kappa)(A
   vertical bar q) can be considered as linear forms on the n-th
   ``power{''} of the knot kappa, and one can wonder if zeroes of
   resultant(q2)(H-n, H-m) can also possess the Mandelbrot property. We
   present and discuss such resultant-zeroes patterns in the complex-A
   plane. Though A is hardly an adequate parameter to describe the moduli
   space of knots, the Mandelbrot-like structure is clearly seen - in full
   accord with the vision of hep-th/0501235, that concrete slicing of the
   Universal Mandelbrot set is not essential for revealing its structure.}},

Title = {{Towards Clinical Applications of Blood-Borne miRNA Signatures: The
   Influence of the Anticoagulant EDTA on miRNA Abundance}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) from blood are increasingly recognized as
   biomarker candidates for human diseases. Clinical routine settings
   frequently include blood sampling in tubes with EDTA as anticoagulant
   without considering the influence of phlebotomy on the overall miRNA
   expression pattern. We collected blood samples from six healthy
   individuals each in an EDTA blood collection tube. Subsequently, the
   blood was transferred into PAXgene (TM) tubes at three different time
   points, i.e. directly (0 min), 10 min, and 2 h after phlebotomy. As
   control blood was also directly collected in PAXgene (TM) blood RNA
   tubes that contain a reagent to directly lyse blood cells and stabilize
   their content. For all six blood donors at the four conditions (24
   samples) we analyzed the abundance of 1,205 miRNAs by human Agilent
   miRNA V16 microarrays.
   Results
   While we found generally a homogenous pattern of the miRNA abundance in
   all 24 samples, the duration of the EDTA treatment appears to influence
   the miRNA abundance of specific miRNAs. The most significant changes are
   observed after longer EDTA exposition. Overall, the impact of the
   different blood sample conditions on the miRNA pattern was substantially
   lower than intra-individual variations. While samples belonging to one
   of the six individuals mostly cluster together, there was no comparable
   clustering for any of the four tested blood sampling conditions. The
   most affected miRNA was miR-769-3p that was not detected in any of the
   six PAXgene blood samples, but in all EDTA 2h samples. Accordingly,
   hsa-miR-769-3p was also the only miRNA that showed a significantly
   different abundance between the 4 blood sample conditions by an ANOVA
   analysis (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value of 0.003). Validation by
   qRT-PCR confirmed this finding.
   Conclusion
   The pattern of blood-borne miRNA abundance is rather homogenous between
   the four tested blood sample conditions of six blood donors. There was a
   clustering between the miRNA profiles that belong to a specific blood
   donor, but not between any of the four tested blood sampling conditions.
   The results show a limited overall impact of the blood sampling
   conditions on the miRNA pattern. Notwithstanding, the abundance of
   single miRNAs can be significantly altered by different blood sampling
   conditions.}},

Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{181-192}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{We consider a version of parallel machine scheduling with rejection. An
   instance of the problem is given by m identical parallel machines and a
   set of n independent jobs, with each job having a processing time and a
   penalty. A job may be accepted to be processed or be rejected at its
   penalty. The objective of the problem is to partition the set of jobs
   into two subsets, the subset of accepted and the subset of rejected
   jobs, and to schedule the set of accepted jobs such that the makespan is
   minimized under the constraint that the total penalty of the rejected
   jobs is no more than a given bound. In this paper, we present a
   2-approximation algorithm within strongly polynomial time for the
   problem. We also present a polynomial time approximation scheme whose
   running time is O (nm(O(1/epsilon 2)) + mn(2)) for the problem.
   Moreover, for the case where the number of machines is a fixed constant
   m, our results lead to a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for
   the problem. Our result is fairly good in the sense that in a reasonable
   size of jobs, our FPTAS improves previous best running time from
   O(n(m+2)/epsilon(m)) to O(1/epsilon(2m+3) + mn(2)). (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Urban-rural disparities in child nutrition-related health outcomes in
   China: The role of hukou policy}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Hukou is the household registration system in China that
   determines eligibility for various welfare benefits, such as health
   care, education, housing, and employment. The hukou system may lead to
   nutritional and health disparities in China. We aim at examining the
   role of the hukou system in affecting urban-rural disparities in child
   nutrition, and disentangling the institutional effect of hukou from the
   effect of urban/rural residence on child nutrition-related health
   outcomes.
   Methods: This study uses data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey
   1993-2009 with a sample of 9616 children under the age of 18. We compute
   height-for-age z-score and weight-for-age z-score for children. We use
   both descriptive statistics and multiple regression techniques to study
   the levels and significance of the association between child
   nutrition-related health outcomes and hukou type.
   Results: Children with urban hukou have 0.25 (P < 0.01) higher height
   z-scores and 0.15 (P < 0.01) higher weight z-scores than children with
   rural hukou, and this difference by urban vs. rural hukou status is
   larger than the difference in height and weight (0.23 and 0.09,
   respectively) by urban vs. rural residence. Controlling for place of
   residence, children with urban hukou had 0.18 higher height z-scores and
   0.17 (P < 0.01) higher weight z-scores than children with rural hukou.
   Conclusions: The hukou system exacerbates urban-rural disparities in
   child nutrition-related health outcomes independent of the well-known
   disparity stemming from urban-rural residence. Fortunately, however,
   child health disparities due to hukou have been declining since 2000.}},

Title = {{Social accountability for maternal health services in Muanda and Bolenge
   Health Zones, Democratic Republic of Congo: a situation analysis}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Democratic Republic of the Congo is one of the countries
   in Sub-Saharan Africa with the highest maternal mortality ratio
   estimated at 846 deaths per 100,000 live births. Innovative strategies
   such as social accountability are needed to improve both health service
   delivery and utilization. Indeed, social accountability is a form of
   citizen engagement defined as the `extent and capability of citizens to
   hold politicians, policy makers and providers accountable and make them
   responsive to their needs.' This study explores existing social
   accountability mechanisms through which women's concerns are expressed
   and responded to by health providers in local settings.
   Methods: An exploratory study was conducted in two health zones with
   purposively sampled respondents including twenty-five women, five men,
   five health providers, two health zone officers and eleven community
   stakeholders. Data on women's voice and oversight and health providers'
   responsiveness were collected using semi-structured interviews and
   analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results: In the two health zones, women rarely voiced their concerns and
   expectations about health services. This reluctance was due to: the
   absence of procedures to express them, to the lack of knowledge thereof,
   fear of reprisals, of being misunderstood as well as factors such as
   age-related power, ethnicity backgrounds, and women's status. The means
   most often mentioned by women for expressing their concerns were as
   individuals rather than as a collective. They did not use them instead;
   instead they looked to intermediaries, mostly, trusted health providers,
   community health workers and local leaders. Their perceptions of health
   providers' responsiveness varied. For women, there were no mechanisms
   for oversight in place. Individual discontent with malpractice was not
   shown to health providers. In contrast, health providers mentioned
   community health workers, health committee, and community based
   organizations as formal oversight mechanisms. All respondents recognized
   the lack of coalition around maternal health despite the many local
   associations and groups.
   Conclusions: Social accountability is relatively inexistent in the
   maternal health services in the two health zones. For social
   accountability to be promoted, efforts need to be made to create its
   mechanisms and to open the local context settings to dialogue, which
   appears structurally absent.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   The extent to which A(H1N1) pdm09 influenza vaccines prevented hospital
   admissions with pneumonia and influenza (P\&I) during the 2009 pandemic
   remains poorly understood. We evaluated the effectiveness of the A(H1N1)
   pdm09 and seasonal influenza vaccines (TIV) used during the 2009 mass
   vaccination campaign in Manitoba (Canada) in preventing P\&I
   hospitalization.
   Methods
   A population-based record-linkage nested case-control study. Cases (N =
   1,812) were persons hospitalized with influenza (ICD-10: J09-J11) or
   pneumonia (ICD-10: J12-J18) during the study period. Age-, gender-and
   area of residence-matched controls (N = 7,915) were randomly sampled
   from Manitoba's Population Registry. Information on receipt of A(H1N1)
   pdm09 vaccine and TIV was obtained from the Manitoba Immunization
   Monitoring System, a province-wide vaccine registry.
   Results
   Overall, the adjuvanted A(H1N1) pdm09 vaccine was 27\% (95\% CI 13-39\%)
   effective against P\& I hospitalization >= 14 days following
   administration. Effectiveness seemed lower among older (>= 65 years)
   adults (10\%; -16-30\%), particularly when compared to under-5 children
   (58\%; 30-75\%). The number-needed-to-vaccinate to prevent 1 P\& I
   admission was lowest among < 4 year-olds (928) and >= 65 years (1,721).
   VE against hospitalization with laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1) pdm09 was
   70\% (39-85\%) overall and (91\%; 62-98\%) >= 14 days following
   vaccination.
   Discussion
   Our data suggest that the adjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine was effective
   in preventing about 55-60\% of P\&I hospitalizations among children and
   younger adults who were at much higher risk of infection. Unfortunately,
   the vaccine was less effective among 65 or older adults. Despite that
   the vaccine still had a significant population-based impact especially
   among the very young (<5) and the older (>= 65 years).}},

Abstract = {{Lipoprotein-binding chaperones mediate intracellular transport of
   lipidated proteins and determine their proper localisation and
   functioning. Understanding of the exact structural parameters that
   determine recognition and transport by different chaperones is of major
   interest. We have synthesised several lipid-modified peptides,
   representative of different lipoprotein classes, and have investigated
   their binding to the relevant chaperones PDEd, UNC119a, UNC119b, and
   galectins-1 and -3. Our results demonstrate that PDEd recognises
   S-isoprenylated C-terminal peptidic structures but not N-myristoylated
   peptides. In contrast, UNC119 proteins bind only mono-N-myristoylated,
   but do not recognise doubly lipidated and S-isoprenylated peptides at
   the C terminus. For galectins-1 and -3, neither binding to N-acylated,
   nor to C-terminally prenylated peptides could be determined. These
   results shed light on the specificity of the chaperone-mediated cellular
   lipoprotein transport systems.}},

   Representatives (Orchidaceae)}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{The intensively discussed taxonomic complexity of the Dactylorhiza genus
   is probably correlated with its migration history during glaciations and
   interglacial periods. Previous studies on past processes affecting the
   current distribution of Dactylorhiza species as well as the history of
   the polyploid complex formation were based only on molecular data. In
   the present study the ecological niche modeling (ENM) technique was
   applied in order to describe the distribution of potential refugia for
   the selected Dactylorhiza representatives during the Last Glacial
   Maximum. Additionally, future changes in their potential habitat
   coverage were measured with regard to three various climatic change
   scenarios. The maximum entropy method was used to create models of
   suitable niche distribution. A database of Dactylorhiza localities was
   prepared on the grounds of information collected from literature and
   data gathered during field works. Our research indicated that the
   habitats of majority of the studied taxa will decrease by 2080, except
   for D. incarnata var. incarnata, for which suitable habitats will
   increase almost two-fold in the global scale. Moreover, the potential
   habitats of some taxa are located outside their currently known
   geographical ranges, e.g. the Aleutian Islands, the western slopes of
   the Rocky Mountains, Newfoundland, southern Greenland and Iceland. ENM
   analysis did not confirm that the Balkans, central Europe or central
   Russia served as the most important refugia for individual
   representatives of the Dactylorhiza incarnata/maculata complex. Our
   study rather indicated that the Black Sea coast, southern Apennines and
   Corsica were the main areas characterized by habitats suitable for most
   of the taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Achyranthes aspera Linn. (Amaranthaceae) commonly known as Prickly Chaff
   flower (English) is traditionally used for treating a number of
   ailments. Different parts of the plant are used in treating wounds and
   ringworm in East Africa and elsewhere for a number of ailments. In this
   study, leaf extracts of A. aspera collected from two different
   geographical locations (Ciaat, Eritrea and Ukulinga, South Africa) were
   evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal, anthelmintic activities and the
   plant characterized for functional phenolic acids as well as protein
   binding capacity. The pathogens used in the tests were, two
   Gram-negative (Escherichia coil and Klebsiella pneumoniae), two
   Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus), a
   filamentus yeast-like fungus (Candida albicans) and a free-living
   nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans). The water and acetone extracts of the
   samples collected from Ciaat exhibited good antibacterial, antifungal
   and anthelmintic activity (MIC <1 mg/ml) except the water extract
   against E coil which showed moderate activity. In contrast, the extracts
   collected from Ukulinga exhibited moderate to weak activities except for
   the acetone (aq.) extracts which had good activity against some of the
   tested organisms. UHPLC-MS/MS revealed variation in the levels of some
   functional phenolic compounds, with rutin, chlorogenic acid and
   genistein not being detected in the extracts from Ukulinga. The
   variation was also observed in the protein binding capacity, which could
   offer a predictive wound healing model. All extracts from plant samples
   collected at Ciaat expressed significant dominant potency compared to
   similar extracts from Ukulinga.}},

   drift-free displacement estimation using inertial sensors}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: In biomechanical studies Optical Motion Capture Systems
   (OMCS) are considered the gold standard for determining the orientation
   and the position (pose) of an object in a global reference frame.
   However, the use of OMCS can be difficult, which has prompted research
   on alternative sensing technologies, such as body-worn inertial sensors.
   Methods: We developed a drift-free method to estimate the
   three-dimensional (3D) displacement of a body part during cyclical
   motions using body-worn inertial sensors. We performed the Fourier
   analysis of the stride-by-stride estimates of the linear acceleration,
   which were obtained by transposing the specific forces measured by the
   tri-axial accelerometer into the global frame using a quaternion-based
   orientation estimation algorithm and detecting when each stride began
   using a gait-segmentation algorithm. The time integration was performed
   analytically using the Fourier series coefficients; the inverse Fourier
   series was then taken for reconstructing the displacement over each
   single stride. The displacement traces were concatenated and
   spline-interpolated to obtain the entire trace.
   Results: The method was applied to estimate the motion of the lower
   trunk of healthy subjects that walked on a treadmill and it was
   validated using OMCS reference 3D displacement data; different
   approaches were tested for transposing the measured specific force into
   the global frame, segmenting the gait and performing time integration
   (numerically and analytically). The width of the limits of agreements
   were computed between each tested method and the OMCS reference method
   for each anatomical direction: Medio-Lateral (ML), VerTical (VT) and
   Antero-Posterior (AP); using the proposed method, it was observed that
   the vertical component of displacement (VT) was within +/- 4 mm (+/-
   1.96 standard deviation) of OMCS data and each component of horizontal
   displacement (ML and AP) was within +/- 9 mm of OMCS data.
   Conclusions: Fourier harmonic analysis was applied to model
   stride-by-stride linear accelerations during walking and to perform
   their analytical integration. Our results showed that analytical
   integration based on Fourier series coefficients was a useful approach
   to accurately estimate 3D displacement from noisy acceleration data.}},

Abstract = {{Color Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive, non-ionising and rapid
   method for scrotal examination. The present study is carried out to
   evaluate clinically suspected cases of scrotal lesions, the sensitivity,
   specificity of color doppler.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study comprises 120 patients of
   different age groups with clinical suspicion of scrotal lesions. Color
   doppler ultrasound was done with 7.5MHz transducer.
   RESULTS: Of the total 120 cases, benign conditions 111 (92.5\%) is more
   common than malignant 9 (7.5\%). In benign group commonest diagnoses
   were hydrocele, epididymo-orchitis, varicocele and epididymal cyst. In
   malignant group teratocarcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, lymphoma,
   embryonal cell carcinoma, yolk sac tumor with teratocarcinoma. The
   sensitivity for diagnosing extratesticular lesions was 83.14\% and for
   testicular lesions 88.57\%.
   CONCLUSION: Color doppler ultrasound is helpful in differentiating
   extratesticular and intratesticular lesions. It should be performed in
   all patients with suspected scrotal lesions.}},

Abstract = {{Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are the strongest
   response predictors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy,
   but knowledge of the EGFR mutation frequency on lung adenocarcinoma is
   still limited to retrospective studies. The PIONEER study (NCT01185314)
   is a prospective molecular epidemiology study in Asian patients with
   newly diagnosed advanced lung adenocarcinoma, aiming to prospectively
   analyze EGFR mutation status in IIIB/IV treatment-naive lung
   adenocarcinomas in Asia. We report the mainland China subset results.
   Eligible patients (similar to 20 yrs old, IIIB/IV adenocarcinoma and
   treatment-naive) were registered in 17 hospitals in mainland China. EGFR
   was tested for mutations by amplification refractory mutation system
   using biopsy samples. Demographic and clinical characteristics were
   collected for subgroup analyses. A total of 747 patients were
   registered. Successful EGFR mutation analysis was performed in 741, with
   an overall mutation rate of 50.2\%. The EGFR active mutation rate is
   48.0\% (with 1.3\% of combined active and resistance mutations). Tobacco
   use (>30 pack-year vs. 0-10 pack-year, OR 0.27, 95\% CI: 0.17-0.42) and
   regional lymph nodes involvement (N3 vs. N0, OR 0.47, 95\% CI:
   0.29-0.76) were independent predictors of EGFR mutation in multivariate
   analysis. However, even in regular smokers, the EGFR mutation frequency
   was 35.3\%. The EGFR mutation frequency was similar between diverse
   biopsy sites and techniques. The overall EGFR mutation frequency of the
   mainland China subset was 50.2\%, independently associated with the
   intensity of tobacco use and regional lymph nodes involvement. The
   relatively high frequency of EGFR mutations in the mainland China subset
   suggest that any effort to obtain tissue sample for EGFR mutation
   testing should be encouraged.}},

Abstract = {{RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) were used
   for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification from two
   economically important obligate plant pathogens, Pseudoperonospora
   cubensis and P. humuli. Twenty isolates of P. cubensis and 19 isolates
   of P. humuli were genotyped using RNA-seq and GBS. Principle components
   analysis (PCA) of each data set showed genetic separation between the
   two species. Additionally, results supported previous findings that P.
   cubensis isolates from squash are genetically distinct from cucumber and
   cantaloupe isolates. A PCA-based procedure was used to identify SNPs
   correlated with the separation of the two species, with 994 and 4,231
   PCA-correlated SNPs found within the RNA-seq and GBS data, respectively.
   The corresponding unigenes (n = 800) containing these potential
   species-specific SNPs were then annotated and 135 putative pathogenicity
   genes, including 3 effectors, were identified. The characterization of
   genes containing SNPs differentiating these two closely related downy
   mildew species may contribute to the development of improved detection
   and diagnosis strategies and improve our understanding of host
   specificity pathways.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the first device to our knowledge that uses a solar panel
   to power the electrochemical reduction of dissolved carbon dioxide
   (carbonate) into formate that is then used in the same device to operate
   a direct formate fuel cell (DFFC). The electrochemical reduction of
   carbonate is carried out on a Sn electrode in a reservoir that maintains
   a constant carbon balance between carbonate and formate. The
   electron-rich formate species is converted by the DFFC into electrical
   energy through electron release. The product of DFFC operation is the
   electron-deficient carbonate species that diffuses back to the reservoir
   bulk. It is possible to continuously charge the device using alternative
   energy (e.g., solar) to convert carbonate to formate for on-demand use
   in the DFFC; the intermittent nature of alternative energy makes this an
   attractive design. In this work, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept
   device that performs reduction of carbonate, storage of formate, and
   operation of a DFFC.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic polymer approaches generally lack the ability to control the
   primary sequence, with sequence control referred to as the holy grail.
   Two click chemistry reactions were now combined to form
   nucleobase-containing sequence-controlled polymers in simple
   polymerization reactions. Two distinct approaches are used to form these
   click nucleic acid (CNA) polymers. These approaches employ thiol-ene and
   thiol-Michael reactions to form homopolymers of a single nucleobase
   (e.g., poly(A)(n)) or homopolymers of specific repeating nucleobase
   sequences (e.g., poly(ATC)(n)). Further-more, the incorporation of
   monofunctional thiol-terminated polymers into the polymerization system
   enables the preparation of multiblock copolymers in a single reaction
   vessel; the length of the diblock copolymer can be tuned by the
   stoichiometric ratio and/or the monomer functionality. These polymers
   are also used for organogel formation where complementary CNA-based
   polymers form reversible cross-links.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Torque magnetization measurements on YBa2Cu3Oy (YBCO) at doping y = 6.67
   (rho = 0.12), in dc fields (B) up to 33 T and temperatures down to 4.5
   K, show that weak diamagnetism persists above the extrapolated
   irreversibility field H-irr(T = 0) approximate to 24 T. The differential
   susceptibility dM/dB, however, is more rapidly suppressed for B greater
   than or similar to 16 T than expected from the properties of the low
   field superconducting state, and saturates at a low value for fields B
   greater than or similar to 24 T. In addition, torque measurements on a
   rho = 0.11 YBCO crystal in pulsed field up to 65 T and temperatures down
   to 8 K show similar behavior, with no additional features at higher
   fields. We offer two candidate scenarios to explain these observations:
   (a) superconductivity survives but is heavily suppressed at high field
   by competition with charge-density-wave (CDW) order; (b) static
   superconductivity disappears near 24 T and is followed by a region of
   fluctuating superconductivity, which causes dM/dB to saturate at high
   field. The diamagnetic signal observed above 50 T for the rho = 0.11
   crystal at 40 K and below may be caused by changes in the normal state
   susceptibility rather than bulk or fluctuating superconductivity. There
   will be orbital (Landau) diamagnetism from electron pockets and possibly
   a reduction in spin susceptibility caused by the stronger
   three-dimensional ordered CDW.}},

Title = {{Covariability of western tropical Pacific-North Pacific atmospheric
   circulation during summer}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{North Pacific subtropical high (NPSH) is permanent high-pressure system
   over the Northern Pacific Ocean and it extends to the western North
   Pacific during the boreal summer (June-July-August), which is so called
   the western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH). Here, we examine the
   covariability of the NPSH-WNPSH during summer using both observation and
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) model data. The
   statistical analyses indicate that the NPSH-WNPSH covariability shows
   significant decadal variability in the observations, in addition, the
   in-phase relationship of NPSH-WNPSH is enhanced after the mid-to-late
   1990s. A dipole-like sea surface temperature (SST) pattern, i.e., a
   warming in the western Pacific and a cooling in the eastern Pacific, is
   dominant after the mid-to-late 1990s, which acts to enhance the
   covariability of NPSH-WNPSH by modulating the atmospheric
   teleconnections. However, the covariability of NPSH-WNPSH in the future
   climate is not much influenced by the anthropogenic forcing but it is
   largely characterized by the natural decadal-to-interdecadal
   variability, implying that the enhancement of NPSH-WNPSH covariability
   after the mid-to-late 1990s could be considered as part of
   decadal-to-interdecadal variability.}},

Volume = {{282}},

Abstract = {{Metabolic programming occurs when variations in nutrition during a
   specific developmental window result in long-term metabolic effects. It
   has been studied almost exclusively in humans and other mammals but
   never in an ecological context. Here, we report metabolic programming
   and its functional consequences in a marine fish, red drum. We
   demonstrate that maternal provisioning of eggs with an essential fatty
   acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), varies with DHA content of the
   maternal diet. When offspring are reared on a DHA-replete diet,
   whole-body DHA content of offspring depends upon the amount of DHA that
   was in the egg. We further demonstrate that whole-body DHA content is
   correlated with traits related to offspring fitness (escape responses,
   routine swimming, growth, and survival). DHA content of red drum eggs
   produced in nature is in the range where the effects of metabolic
   programming are most pronounced. Our findings indicate that during a
   brief developmental window, DHA plays a role in establishing the
   metabolic capacity for its own uptake or storage, with protracted and
   possibly permanent effects on ecologically important survival skills of
   individuals and important implications for dynamics of populations and
   food webs.}},

Abstract = {{The dodecagonal quasicrystal classified into the five-dimensional space
   group P12(6)/mmc, recently discovered in a Mn-Cr-Ni-Si alloy, has been
   analysed using atomic-resolution spherical aberration-corrected electron
   microscopy, i.e. high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission
   electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and conventional transmission electron
   microscopy. By observing along the 12-fold axis, non-periodic tiling
   consisting of an equilateral triangle and a square has been revealed, of
   which common edge length is a=4.560 angstrom. These tiles tend to form a
   network of dodecagons of which size is (2+root 3)a approximate to 17
   angstrom in diameter. The tiling was interpreted as an aggregate of 100
   angstrom-scale oriented domains of high- and low-quality quasicrystals
   with small crystallites appearing at their boundaries. The quasicrystal
   domains exhibited a densely filled circular acceptance region in the
   phason space. This is the first observation of the acceptance region in
   an actual dodecagonal quasicrystal. Atomic structure model consistent
   with the electron microscopy images is a standard Frank-Kasper
   decoration of the triangle and square tiles that can be inferred from
   the crystal structures of Zr4Al3 and Cr3Si. Four kinds of layers located
   at z = 0, +/- 1/4 and 1/2 are stacked periodically along the 12-fold
   axis, and the atoms at z = 0 and 1/2 form hexagonal anti-prisms
   consistently with the 12(6)-screw axis. The validity of this structure
   model was examined by means of powder X-ray diffraction.}},

Abstract = {{Selectfluor, a source of the super electrophile F+, has replaced
   conventional reagents that supply F+ for fluorination due to its
   attractive physical and chemical properties. This study is the first

   been found to effect regioselective O- benzyl acetolysis from the
   per-O-benzylated derivatives of glucose and mannose, which are among the
   most commonly occurring monosaccharides. For both derivatives, one
   equivalent of Selectfluor first cleaves the primary benzyl, while a
   second equivalent subsequently removes the anomeric benzyl.
   Regioselective removal at higher equivalents proved difficult, with
   complex mixtures being obtained. The reaction proceeded under mild
   conditions with good yields and high regioselectivity, resulting in
   quick access to partially benzylated monosaccharide derivatives. This
   study provides shortened access to attractive building blocks for
   oligosaccharide synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{Green synthesis is a widely used for the preparation of silver
   nanoparticles. The use of plant extracts for these syntheses has become
   common in recent years because they are nontoxic, inexpensive, and

   aldehydes, amides, and carboxylic acids are the primary active
   ingredients for nanoparticle synthesis. Reaction temperature plays an
   important role during the reduction process as it influences the
   reaction time, particle size, and the intensity of the surface plasmon
   resonance peak. This review presents an overview of recently developed
   and reported silver nanoparticle syntheses using plant extracts. The
   role of temperature in nanoparticles synthesis and potential
   applications has been reviewed. A brief description of the reaction
   mechanism and nanoparticle characterization techniques are also

   cells is immunofluorescent labelling of gamma H2AX and nuclei followed
   by microscopy imaging and analysis.
   Results: In this study, we present the algorithm FoCo for reliable and
   robust automatic nuclear foci counting in single cell images. FoCo has
   the following advantages with respect to other software packages: i) the
   ability to reliably quantify even densely distributed foci, e.g., on
   images of cells subjected to radiation doses up to 10 Gy, ii) robustness
   of foci quantification in the sense of suppressing out-of-focus
   background signal, and iii) its simplicity. FoCo requires only 5
   parameters that have to be adjusted by the user.
   Conclusions: FoCo is an open-source user-friendly software with GUI for
   individual foci counting, which is able to produce reliable and robust
   foci quantifications even for low signal/noise ratios and densely
   distributed foci.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray phosphor-based detectors have enormously improved the quality of
   medical imaging examinations through the optimization of optical
   diffusion. In recent years, with the development of science and
   technology in the field of materials, improved powder phosphors require
   structural and optical properties that contribute to better optical
   signal propagation. The purpose of this paper was to provide a
   quantitative and qualitative understanding of the optical absorption
   characteristics in the assessment of powder phosphor-based detectors
   (from nano- scale up to micro-scale). Variations on the optical
   absorption parameters (i.e. the light extinction coefficient m(ext) and
   the percentage probability of light absorption p\%) were evaluated based
   on Mie calculations examining a wide range of light wavelengths,
   particle refractive indices and sizes. To model and assess the effects
   of the aforementioned parameters on optical diffusion, Monte Carlo
   simulation techniques were employed considering: (i) phosphors of
   different layer thickness, 100 mu m (thin layer) and 300 mu m (thick
   layer), respectively, (ii) light extinction coefficient values, 1, 3 and
   6 mu m(-1), and (iii) percentage probability of light absorption p\% in
   the range 10(-4)-10(-2). Results showed that the m(ext) coefficient is
   high for phosphor grains in the submicron scale and for low light
   wavelengths. At higher wavelengths (above 650 nm), optical quanta follow
   approximately similar depths until interaction for grain diameter 500 nm
   and 1 mu m. Regarding the variability of the refractive index, high
   variations of the m(ext) coefficient occurred above 1.6. Furthermore,
   results derived from Monte Carlo modeling showed that high spatial
   resolution phosphors can be accomplished by increasing the m(ext)
   parameter. More specifically, the FWHM was found to decrease (i.e.
   higher resolution): (i) 4.8\% at 100 mu m and (ii) 9.5\%, at 300 mu m
   layer thickness. This study attempted to examine the role of the optical
   absorption parameters on optical diffusion studies. A significant
   outcome of the present investigation was that the improvement of
   phosphor spatial resolution without decreasing the light collection
   efficiency too much can be better achieved by increasing the parameter
   m(ext) rather than the parameter p\%.}},

Abstract = {{We present the goals, strategy and first results of the OmegaWhite
   survey: a wide-field high-cadence g-band synoptic survey which aims to
   unveil the Galactic population of short-period variable stars (with
   periods <80 min), including ultracompact binary star systems and stellar
   pulsators. The ultimate goal of OmegaWhite is to cover 400 deg(2) along
   the Galactic plane reaching a depth of g = 21.5 mag (10 sigma), using
   OmegaCam on the VLT Survey Telescope (VST). The fields are selected to
   overlap with surveys such as the Galactic Bulge Survey and the VST
   Photometric Ha Survey of the Southern Galactic Plane for multiband
   colour information. Each field is observed using 38 exposures of 39 s
   each, with a median cadence of similar to 2.7 min for a total duration
   of two hours. Within an initial 26 deg(2), we have extracted the light
   curves of 1.6 million stars, and have identified 613 variable candidates
   which satisfy our selection criteria. Furthermore, we present the light
   curves and statistical properties of 20 sources which have the highest
   likelihood of being variable stars. One of these candidates exhibits the
   colours and light-curve properties typically associated with
   ultracompact AM CVn binaries, although its spectrum exhibits weak Balmer
   absorption lines and is thus not likely to be such a binary system. We
   also present follow-up spectroscopy of five other variable candidates,
   which identifies them as likely low-amplitude delta Sct pulsating stars.}},

Abstract = {{Reverberation mapping probes the structure of the broad emission-line
   region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGN). The kinematics of the BLR
   gas can be used to measure the mass of the central supermassive black
   hole. The main uncertainty affecting black hole mass determinations is
   the structure of the BLR. We present a new method for reverberation
   mapping based on regularized linear inversion (RLI) that includes
   modelling of the AGN continuum light curves. This enables fast
   calculation of velocity-resolved response maps to constrain BLR
   structure. RLI allows for negative response, such as when some areas of
   the BLR respond in inverse proportion to a change in ionizing continuum
   luminosity. We present time delays, integrated response functions, and
   velocity-delay maps for the H beta broad emission line in five nearby
   AGN, as well as for H alpha and H gamma in Arp 151, using data from the
   Lick AGN Monitoring Project 2008. We find indications of prompt response
   in three of the objects (Arp 151, NGC 5548, and SBS 1116+583A) with
   additional prompt response in the red wing of H beta. In SBS 1116+583A
   we find evidence for a multimodal broad prompt response followed by a
   second narrow response at 10 d. We find no clear indications of negative
   response. The results are complementary to, and consistent with, other
   methods such as cross-correlation, maximum entropy, and dynamical
   modelling. RLI with continuum light-curve modelling provides a fast,
   complementary method for velocity-resolved reverberation mapping and is
   suitable for use on large data sets.}},

   number of known objects of this remarkable but rare type of active

   Digital Sky Survey-Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, reveals a
   broad H a emission line with a width (FWHM) of 1734 +/- 104 km s(-1).
   This, along with strong optical Fe II multiplets {[}R-4570 = 0.9] and a
   weak {[}O III] lambda 5007 emission line, makes the object a typical
   NLS1. On the other hand, the source exhibits a high radio brightness
   temperature, rapid infrared variability, and a flat X-ray spectrum
   extending up to similar to 200 keV. It is associated with a luminous
   gamma-ray source detected significantly with Fermi/LAT. Correlated
   variability with other wavebands has not yet been tested. The spectral
   energy distribution can be well modelled by a one-zone leptonic jet

Abstract = {{Recent Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) observations at 115-175MHz of a field
   at medium Galactic latitudes (centred at the bright quasar 3C196) have
   shown striking filamentary structures in polarization that extend over
   more than 4 degrees across the sky. In addition, the Planck satellite
   has released full sky maps of the dust emission in polarization at 353
   GHz. The LOFAR data resolve Faraday structures along the line of sight,
   whereas the Planck dust polarization maps probe the orientation of the
   sky projected magnetic field component. Hence, no apparent correlation
   between the two is expected. Here we report a surprising, yet clear,
   correlation between the filamentary structures, detected with LOFAR, and
   the magnetic field orientation, probed by the Planck satellite. This
   finding points to a common, yet unclear, physical origin of the two
   measurements in this specific area in the sky. A number of follow-up
   multifrequency studies are proposed to shed light on this unexpected
   finding.}},

   land-to-ocean output of lignin and modern biospheric carbon}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{The land-to-ocean export of particulate organic carbon (POC) connects
   carbon flow from the atmosphere through land to the ocean, of which the
   contemporary fraction that reaches the deep sea for burial may
   effectively affect atmospheric CO2. In this regard, small mountainous
   rivers (SMRs) in Oceania, a global erosion hotspot driven by torrential
   typhoon rain and active earthquakes are potentially important. Here we
   measured typhoon lignin discharges for Taiwan SMRs. We found that the
   particulate lignin export in 96 hours by a single SMR amounting to
   similar to 20\% of the annual export by Mississippi River. The yearly
   particulate lignin discharge from Taiwan Island (35,980 km(2)) is
   governed by the frequency and magnitude of typhoon; thus, the historical
   lignin export ranged widely from 1.5 to 99.7 Gg yr(-1), which resulted
   in a 10-100 times higher areal yield relative to non-Oceanian rivers.
   The lignin-derived modern POC output from Oceania region is 37 +/- 21 Tg
   C yr(-1), account for approximately similar to 20\% of the annual modern
   POC export from global rivers. Coupled with the hyperpycnal pathway, the
   forested watersheds of SMRs in Oceania may serve as a giant factory to
   rapidly produce and efficiently convey modern POC into deep sea for
   sequestration.}},

Title = {{EEG can Track the Time Course of Successful Reference Resolution in
   Small Visual Worlds}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that language comprehenders resolve
   reference quickly and incrementally, but not much is known about the
   neural processes and representations that are involved. Studies of
   visual short-term memory suggest that access to the representation of an
   item from a previously seen display is associated with a negative evoked
   potential at posterior electrodes contralateral to the spatial location
   of that item in the display. In this paper we demonstrate that resolving
   the reference of a noun phrase in a recently seen visual display is
   associated with an event-related potential that is analogous to this
   effect. Our design was adapted from the visual world paradigm: in each
   trial, participants saw a display containing three simple objects,
   followed by a question about the objects, such as Was the pink fish next
   to a boat?, presented word by word. Questions differed in whether the
   color adjective allowed the reader to identify the referent of the noun
   phrase or not (i.e., whether one or more objects of the named color were
   present). Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed that reference
   resolution by the adjective was associated with a negative evoked
   potential at posterior electrodes contralateral to spatial location of
   the referent, starting approximately 333 ms after the onset of the
   adjective. The fact that the laterality of the effect depended upon the
   location of the referent within the display suggests that reference
   resolution in visual domains involves, at some level, a
   modality-specific representation. In addition, the effect gives us an
   estimate of the time course of processing from perception of the written
   word to the point at which its meaning is brought into correspondence
   with the referential domain.}},

Abstract = {{Biocomposites of chitosan (CS)/cellulose nanocrystals (CN) were prepared

   method and CN content on the properties of composites were investigated.
   Mechanical stirring/ultrasonication or microfluidization were used to
   disperse nanocrystals in the chitosan matrix. The prepared
   nanocomposites were characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM, DSC, TGA, TMA and
   contact angle measurements. SEM analysis revealed that microfluidization
   decreased CN aggregates in matrix. Formation of hydrogen bonds between
   CS and CN in nanocomposites prepared by using microfluidization was
   confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. This high interaction led to an
   increment of the crystallinity of chitosan films. T-g values within a
   range of 53-58 degrees C were obtained in DSC and TMA measurements. The
   thermal stability of CS film showed no significant effect of CN
   addition, whereas contact angle measurements revealed that CN addition
   resulted in an increment of hydrophilicity of chitosan films. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Biosorption is one of the effective methods to treat the wastewater
   containing heavy metal ions, especially the biosorption using
   magnetotactic biosorbents (MTB). The interaction between metal ions and
   MTB was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. A model of a
   bacterial cell consisting of functional groups and Fe3O4 was created.
   The principal functional groups on the MTB surface included -COOH,
   -PO3H2, and -OH, and physical adsorption was deduced as the primary
   adsorption mechanism. Free energy profiles for ions approaching the
   bacterial cell were computed using the adaptive biasing force method.
   The adsorption of ions occurred at a distance of 5 angstrom from the MTB
   surficial groups. Repulsive force had to be overcome when ions
   approached the functional groups in the simulation. The electrostatic

Abstract = {{Transverse aortic constriction provokes a pro-inflammatory reaction and
   results in cardiac hypertrophy. Endogenous ligands contribute to cardiac
   hypertrophy via toll-like receptor (TLR)4 binding. A lack of TLR4
   signaling diminishes hypertrophy and inflammation. Wild type mice
   undergoing aortic constriction respond to a lipopolysaccharide
   second-hit stimulus with hyper-inflammation. The objective of this study
   was to assess whether other second-hit challenges utilizing TLR ligands
   provoke a comparable inflammatory reaction, and to find out whether this
   response is absent in TLR4 deficient mice. Assuming that cardiac stress
   alters the expression of pattern recognition receptors we analyzed the
   effects of transverse aortic constriction and second-hit virulence
   factor treatment on TLR expression, as well as cytokine regulation. Wild
   type and Tlr4(-/-) mice were subjected to three days of TAC and
   subsequently confronted with gram-positive TLR2 ligand lipoteichoic acid
   (LTA, 15mg/g bodyweight) or synthetic CpG-oligo-desoxynucleotide 1668
   thioate (20 nmol/kg bodyweight, 30 min after D-galactosamin
   desensitization) signaling via TLR9. Hemodynamic measurements and organ
   preservation were performed 6 h after stimulation. Indeed, the study
   revealed a robust enhancement of LTA induced pattern recognition
   receptor and cytokine mRNA expression and a LTA-dependent reduction of
   hemodynamic pressure in TAC wild typemice. Second-Hit treatment with
   CpG-ODNs led to similar results. However, second-hit effects were
   abolished in Tlr4(-/-) mice. In total, these data indicate for the first
   time that cardiac stress increases the inflammatory response towards
   both, gram-negative and gram-positive, TLR ligands as well as bacterial
   DNA. The decrease of the inflammatory response upon TLR2 and -9 ligand
   challenge in TAC Tlr4(-/-) mice demonstrates that a lack of TLR4
   signaling does not only prevent left ventricular hypertrophy but also
   protects the mice from a cardiac stress induced hyperinflammatory
   reaction.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to assess the influence of rotating magnetic
   field (RMF) on production rate and quality parameters of bacterial
   cellulose synthetized by Glucanacetobacter xylinus. Bacterial cultures
   were exposed to RMF (frequency f = 50 Hz, magnetic induction B=34 mT)
   for 72 h at 28 degrees C. The study revealed that cellulose obtained
   under RMF influence displayed higher water absorption, lower density and
   less interassociated microfibrils comparing to unexposed control. The
   application of RMF significantly increased the amount of obtained wet
   cellulose pellicles but decreased the weight and thickness of dry
   cellulose. Summarizing, the exposure of cellulose-synthesizing G.
   xylinus to RMF alters cellulose biogenesis and may offer a new
   biotechnological tool to control this process. As RMF-modified cellulose
   displays better absorbing properties comparing to non-modified
   cellulose, our finding, if developed, may find application in the
   production of dressings for highly exudative wounds. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Chiral resolution of spin angular momentum in linearly polarized and
   unpolarized light}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Linearly polarized (LP) and unpolarized (UP) light are racemic entities
   since they can be described as superposition of opposite circularly
   polarized (CP) components of equal amplitude. As a consequence they do
   not carry spin angular momentum. Chiral resolution of a racemate, i.e.
   separation of their chiral components, is usually performed via
   asymmetric interaction with a chiral entity. In this paper we provide an
   experimental evidence of the chiral resolution of linearly polarized and
   unpolarized Gaussian beams through the transfer of spin angular momentum
   to chiral microparticles. Due to the interplay between linear and
   angular momentum exchange, basic manipulation tasks, as trapping,
   spinning or orbiting of micro-objects, can be performed by light with
   zero helicity. The results might broaden the perspectives for
   development of miniaturized and cost-effective devices.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial adhesion onto mineral surfaces and subsequent biofilm
   formation play key roles in aggregate stability, mineral weathering, and
   the fate of contaminants in soils. However, the mechanisms of
   bacteria-mineral interactions are not fully understood. Atomic force
   microscopy (AFM) was used to determine the adhesion forces between
   bacteria and goethite in water and to gain insight into the nanoscale
   surface morphology of the bacteria-mineral aggregates and biofilms
   formed on clay-sized minerals. This study yields direct evidence of a
   range of different association mechanisms between bacteria and minerals.
   All strains studied adhered predominantly to the edge surfaces of
   kaolinite rather than to the basal surfaces. Bacteria rarely formed
   aggregates with montmorillonite, but were more tightly adsorbed onto
   goethite surfaces. This study reports the first measured interaction
   force between bacteria and a clay surface, and the approach curves
   exhibited jump-in events with attractive forces of 97 +/- 34 pN between
   E. coli and goethite. Bond strengthening between them occurred within 4
   s to the maximum adhesion forces and energies of -3.0 +/- 0.4 nN and
   -330 +/- 43 aJ (10(-18) J), respectively. Under the conditions studied,
   bacteria tended to form more extensive biofilms on minerals under low
   rather than high nutrient conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We report the first detection of thermal X-ray line emission from the
   supernova remnant (SNR) RX J1713.7-3946, the prototype of the small
   class of synchrotron-dominated SNRs. A softness-ratio map generated
   using XMM-Newton data shows that faint interior regions are softer than
   bright shell regions. Using Suzaku and deep XMM-Newton observations, we
   have extracted X-ray spectra from the softest area, finding clear line
   features at E-ph similar to 1 and similar to 1.35 keV. These lines can
   be best explained as Ne Lya and Mg Heck from a thermal emission
   component. Since the abundance ratios of metals to Fe are much higher
   than solar values in the thermal component, we attribute the thermal
   emission to reverse-shocked SN ejecta. The measured Mg/Ne, Si/Ne, and
   Fe/Ne ratios of 2.0-2.6, 1.5-2.0, and <0.05 solar suggest that the
   progenitor star of RX J1713.7-3946 was a relatively low-mass star (less
   than or similar to 20 M-circle dot), consistent with a previous
   inference based on the effect of stellar winds of the progenitor star on
   the surrounding medium. Since the mean blastwave speed of similar to
   6000 km s(-1) (the radius of 9.6 pc divided by the age of 1600 years) is
   relatively fast compared with other core-collapse SNRs, we propose that
   RX J1713.7-3946 is a result of an SN Ib/c whose progenitor was a member
   of an interacting binary. While our analysis provides strong evidence
   for X-ray line emission, our interpretation of its nature as thermal
   emission from SN ejecta requires further confirmation especially through
   future precision spectroscopic measurements using ASTRO-H.}},

Title = {{An in-depth analysis of ethics teaching in Canadian physiotherapy and

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine current approaches and
   challenges to teaching ethics in entry-level Canadian physiotherapy (PT)
   and occupational therapy (OT) programs. Methods: Educators responsible
   for teaching ethics in the 28 Canadian PT and OT programs (n=55)
   completed an online survey. Results: The quantity of ethics teaching is
   highly variable, ranging from 5 to 65h. Diverse obstacles to ethics
   teaching were reported, relating to the organization and structure of
   academic programs, student issues and the topic of ethics itself.
   Specific challenges included time constraints, large class sizes, a lack
   of pedagogical tools adapted to teaching this complex subject, a
   perceived lack of student interest for the subject and a preference for
   topics related to clinical skills. Of note, 65\% of ethics educators who
   participated in the survey did not have any specialized training in
   ethics. Conclusion: Significant cross-program variation in the number of
   hours dedicated to ethics and the diversity of pedagogical methods used
   suggests that there is little consensus about how best to teach ethics.
   Further research on ethics pedagogy in PT and OT programs (i.e. teaching
   and evaluation approaches and effectiveness of current ethics teaching)
   would support the implementation of more evidence-based ethics
   education.Implications for RehabilitationEthics educators in Canadian PT
   and OT programs are experimenting with diverse educational approaches to
   teach ethical reasoning and decision-making to students, including
   lectures, problem-based learning, directed readings, videos, conceptual
   maps and clinical elective debriefing, but no particular method has been
   shown to be more effective for developing ethical
   decision-making/reasoning. Thus, research on the effectiveness of
   current methods is needed to support ethics educators and programs to
   implement evidence-based ethics education training.In our survey, 65\%
   of ethics educators did not have any specialized training in ethics.
   Ensuring that educators are well equipped to support the development of
   necessary theoretical and applied competencies can be promoted by
   initiatives including the creation of tailored ethics teaching and
   evaluation tools, and by establishing communities of practice among
   ethics educators.This survey identified heterogeneity in ethics teaching
   content, format and duration, and location within the curriculum. In
   order to be able to assess more precisely the place accorded to ethics
   teaching in PT and OT programs, careful mapping of ethics content inside
   and across rehabilitation programs is needed - both in Canada and
   internationally. These initiatives would help advance understanding of
   ethics teaching practices in rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{Biopreservation is a natural technology of food preservation, which
   consists of inoculating food with microorganisms selected for their
   antibacterial properties. The objective of this study was to select
   lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to improve the quality of cold-smoked salmon
   (CSS). In this work, different strains representative of the 4 dominant
   species, identified in a previous study by pyrosequencing the 16S rRNA
   gene, were isolated and their spoiling potential in CSS blocks,
   sterilized by ionization, was assessed by twelve trained panelists along
   the vacuum storage at 8 degrees C. Photobacterium phosphoreum,
   Brochothrix thermosphacta and Serratia proteamaculans released strong
   off-odors whereas the spoiling potential of Carnobacterium divergens was
   weaker. The spoiling capacity of Lactococcus piscium EU2241, Leuconostoc
   gelidum EU2247, Lactobacillus sakei EU2885, Staphylococcus equorum
   S030674 and 4 commercial starters was tested by the same method and 2
   strains were eliminated due to off-odor production. The effect of the 6
   selected LAB against the 4 specific spoiling organisms (SSOs) selected
   was tested by challenge tests in sterile CSS blocks. The protective
   effect of the LAB differed from one SSO to another and no correlation
   could be established between the sensory improvement, SSO inhibition,
   and the implantation or acidification of protective cultures (PCs). All
   the PCs except L. piscium reduced the off-odors released by P.
   phosphoreum although some of them had no effect on its growth. S.
   equorum, which did not grow in CSS, favored the implantation of P.
   phosphoreum but prevented its off-odor formation. L piscium was the only
   strain that prevented the spoilage of B. thermosphacta and S.
   proteamaculans although it did not grow very well and did not acidify
   the product. L gelidum EU2247 inhibited the growth of these 2 SSOs and
   lowered the pH but had no effect on the sensory quality. Finally, L
   piscium was tested in 2 naturally contaminated products, with a positive
   effect on 1 batch. This effect was not correlated with the microbial
   ecosystem as determined by acultural and cultural techniques. Based on
   these results, the selection strategy is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Silicon single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are core devices for
   single-photon detection in the visible and the near-infrared wavelength
   range and are widely used in many fields such as astronomy, biology,
   lidar, quantum optics, and quantum information. Due to limitations in
   their structural design and fabrication, however, the key parameters of
   detection efficiency and timing jitter cannot be optimized
   simultaneously. Here, we propose a nanostructured silicon SPAD that
   achieves high detection efficiency with excellent timing jitter over a
   broad spectral range. Our optical and electrical simulations show
   significant performance enhancement compared to conventional silicon
   SPAD devices. This nanostructured device can be easily fabricated and is
   thus well suited for practical applications. (C) 2015 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{One inherent characteristic of quadratic nonlinear interaction is that
   it allows both forward and backward energy transfer among the three
   interacting waves. This backconversion effect, universal in all the
   parametric processes, is detrimental when a unidirectional energy
   transfer is desired and limits the conversion efficiency. We report a
   family of quadratic nonlinear interactions, quasi-parametric
   amplification (QPA), in which the idler wave is depleted by the
   introduction of a material loss and only the signal is amplified. In
   contrast to optical parametric amplification (OPA), the QPA scheme can
   inhibit the backconversion effect and thus enable ideal chirped-pulse
   amplification with high conversion efficiency and broad gain bandwidth.
   We have numerically proved the feasibility of this new scheme, and
   experimentally realized it by using a Sm3+-doped yttrium calcium
   oxyborate crystal that is highly absorptive at the idler wavelength and
   transparent at the pump and signal wavelengths. Amplification of
   broadband chirped pulses, corresponding to a pump depletion of 70\% and
   a signal efficiency of 41\%, has been achieved in a typical Gaussian
   pump case, exceeding the results of the previously reported
   state-of-the-art OPA. The proposed QPA scheme will be a promising
   approach for efficiently amplifying chirped pulses to unprecedented
   powers. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Journal = {{DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To identify the ability of the Persian-version of the Shoulder
   Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) and the Disabilities of the Arm,
   Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) to detect changes in shoulder function
   following physiotherapy intervention (i.e. responsiveness) and to
   determine the change score that indicates a meaningful change in
   functional ability of the patient (i.e. Minimally Clinically Important
   Difference (MCID)). Method: A convenient sample of 200 Persian-speaking
   patients with shoulder disorders completed the SPADI and the DASH at
   baseline and then again 4 weeks after physiotherapy intervention.
   Furthermore, patients were asked to rate their global rating of shoulder
   function at follow-up. The responsiveness was evaluated using two
   methods: the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) method and the
   correlation analysis. Two useful statistics extracted from the ROC
   method are the area under curve (AUC) and the optimal cutoff point
   called as MCID. Results: Both the SPADI and the DASH showed the AUC of
   greater than 0.70 (AUC ranges=0.77-0.82). The best cutoff points (or
   change scores) for the SPADI-total, SPADI-pain, SPADI-disability and the
   DASH were 14.88, 26.36, 23.86, and 25.41, respectively. Additionally,
   moderate to good correlations (Gamma=-0.51 to -0.58) were found between
   the changes in SPADI/DASH and changes in global rating scale.
   Conclusions: The Persian SPADI and DASH have adequate responsiveness to
   clinical changes in patients with shoulder disorders. Moreover, the
   MCIDs obtained in this study will help the clinicians and researchers to
   determine if a Persian-speaking patient with shoulder disorder has
   experienced a true change following a physiotherapy
   intervention.Implications for RehabilitationResponsiveness was evaluated
   using two methods; the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) method
   and the correlation analysis.The Persian SPADI and DASH can be used as
   two responsive instruments in both clinical practice and research
   settings.The MCIDs of 14.88 and 25.41 points obtained for the
   SPADI-total and DASH indicated that the change scores of at least 14.88
   points on the SPADI-total and 25.41 points on the DASH is necessary to
   certain that a true change has occurred following a physiotherapy
   intervention.}},

Title = {{Association between Maternal and Child Nutritional Status in Hula, Rural
   Southern Ethiopia: A Cross Sectional Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Maternal and child under nutrition is highly prevalent in low-income and
   middle-income countries, resulting in substantial increases in mortality
   and overall disease burden. The aim of this baseline survey was to
   determine the association between selected maternal characteristics,
   maternal nutritional status and children's nutritional status.
   Methods and Findings
   A survey with a cross sectional design was conducted between September
   and October 2012 in Hula, Ethiopia. The study subjects were 197 mothers
   of children between the ages of 6 and 23 months. Weight and height
   (mothers) or recumbent length (children) were measured using calibrated,
   standardized techniques. Seven percent of children were below -2 weight
   for height Z score (WHZ), 11.5\% were below -2 height for age Z score
   (HAZ) and 9.9\% were below -2 weight for age Z score (WAZ). Maternal
   anthropometrics were associated with child nutritional status in the
   bivariate analysis. Maternal BMI (r = 0.16 P = 0.02) and educational
   status (r = 0.25 P = 0.001) were correlated with WHZ of children while
   maternal height (r = 0.2 P = 0.007) was correlated with HAZ of children.
   After multivariate analysis, children whose mothers had salary from
   employment had a better WHZ score (P = 0.001) and WAZ score (P<0.001).
   Both maternal BMI and maternal height were associated with WHZ (P =
   0.04) and HAZ (P = 0.01) score of children.
   Conclusion
   Having a mother with better nutritional status and salaried employment
   is a benefit for the nutritional status of the child. The
   interrelationship between maternal and child nutritional status stresses
   the value of improving maternal nutritional status as this should
   improve both maternal and child health outcomes. Therefore strategies to
   improve nutritional status of children should also include improving the
   nutritional status of the mother and empowering her financially.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{296}},

Abstract = {{Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) is a promising salt that can
   possibly overcome the limitations of lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6)
   in current Li-ion batteries (LIBs). Aluminum (Al) corrosion issue,
   however, is a major bottleneck for the wide use of LiFSI. This study
   investigates lithium borate salts as Al corrosion inhibitors in LiFSI
   electrolytes. Through a systematic comparison among lithium
   tetrafluoroborate (LiBF4), lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB), and
   lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB), and LiPF6, the inhibition
   ability of the additives is revealed to be in the following order:
   LiDFOB > LiBF4 approximate to LiPF6 > LiBOB. In particular, the
   inhibition effect of LiDFOB is outstanding; the anodic behavior of Al in
   0.8 M LiFSI + 0.2 M LiDFOB ethylene carbonate (EC)-based electrolyte is
   comparable to that of corrosion-free 1 M LiPF6 solution. The superior
   inhibition ability of LiDFOB is attributed to the formation of a passive
   layer composed of Al-F, Al2O3, and B-O species, as evidenced by X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. A LiCoO2/graphite cell
   with 0.8 M LiFSI + 0.2 M LiDFOB electrolyte exhibits a rate capability
   comparable to a cell with 1 M LiPF6 solution, whereas a cell with 0.8 M
   LiFSI solution without LiDFOB suffers from poor power performance
   resulting from severe Al corrosion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The potential for using whole genome sequencing (WGS) data in
   microbiological risk assessment (MRA) has been discussed on several
   occasions since the beginning of this century. Still, the proposed
   heuristic approaches have never been applied in a practical framework.
   This is due to the non-trivial problem of mapping microbial information
   consisting of thousands of loci onto a probabilistic scale for risks.
   The paradigm change for MRA involves translation of multidimensional
   microbial genotypic information to much reduced (integrated) phenotypic
   information and onwards to a single measure of human risk (i.e.
   probability of illness).
   In this paper a first approach in methodology development is described
   for the application of WGS data in MRA; this is supported by a practical
   example. That is, combining genetic data (single nucleotide
   polymorphisms; SNPs) for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coil (STEC)
   O157 with phenotypic data (in vitro adherence to epithelial cells as a
   proxy for virulence) leads to hazard identification in a Genome Wide
   Association Study (GWAS).
   This application revealed practical implications when using SNP data for
   MRA. These can be summarized by considering the following main issues:
   optimum sample size for valid inference on population level, correction
   for population structure, quantification and calibration of results,
   reproducibility of the analysis, links with epidemiological data,
   anchoring and integration of results into a systems biology approach for
   the translation of molecular studies to human health risk.
   Future developments in genetic data analysis for MRA should aim at
   resolving the mapping problem of processing genetic sequences to come to
   a quantitative description of risk. The development of a clustering
   scheme focusing on biologically relevant information of the microbe
   involved would be a useful approach in molecular data reduction for risk
   assessment. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{We derive area product, entropy product, area sum and entropy sum of the
   event horizon and Cauchy horizons for Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT
   (Newman-Unti-Tamburino) black hole in four-dimensional Lorentzian
   geometry. We observe that these thermodynamic products are not universal
   (mass-independence) for this black hole (BH), whereas for Kerr-Newman
   (KN) BH such products are universal (mass-independence). We also examine
   the entropy sum and area sum. It is shown that they all depend on mass,
   charge and NUT parameter of the background spacetime. Thus, we can
   conclude that the universal (mass-independence) behavior of area product
   and entropy product, area sum and entropy sum for Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT
   (KNTN) BH fails and which is also quite different from KN BH. We further
   show that the KNTN BH do not possess first law of BH thermodynamics and
   Smarr-Gibbs-Duhem relations, and that such relations are unlikely in the
   KN case. The failure of these aforementioned features are due to
   presence of the nontrivial NUT charge which makes the spacetime to be
   asymptotically non-flat, in contrast with KN BH. The other reason of the
   failure is that Lorentzian KNTN geometry contains Dirac-Misner type
   singularity, which is a manifestation of a nontrivial topological twist
   of the manifold. The BH mass formula and Christodoulou-Ruffini mass
   formula for KNTN BHs are also derived. Finally, we compute the area
   bound which is just Penrose like inequality for event horizon. From area
   bound we derive entropy bound. These thermodynamic products on the
   multi-horizon play a crucial role in BH thermodynamics to understand the
   microscopic nature of BH entropy.}},

Title = {{Integrating heterogeneous genomic data to accurately identify disease
   subtypes}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: High-throughput biotechnologies have been widely used to
   characterize clinical samples from various perspectives e. g.,
   epigenomics, genomics and transcriptomics. However, because of the
   heterogeneity of these technologies and their outputs, individual
   analysis of the various types of data is hard to create a comprehensive
   view of disease subtypes. Integrative methods are of pressing need.
   Methods: In this study, we evaluated the possible issues that hamper
   integrative analysis of the heterogeneous disease data types, and
   proposed iBFE, an effective and efficient computational method to
   subvert those issues from a feature extraction perspective.
   Results: Strict experiments on both simulated and real datasets
   demonstrated that iBFE can easily overcome issues caused by scale
   conflicts, noise conflicts, incompleteness of patient relationships, and
   conflicts between patient relationships, and that iBFE can effectively
   combine the merits of DNA methylation, mRNA expression and microRNA
   (miRNA) expression datasets to accurately identify disease subtypes of
   significantly different prognosis.
   Conclusions: iBFE is an effective and efficient method for integrative
   analysis of heterogeneous genomic data to accurately identify disease
   subtypes. The Matlab code of iBFE is freely available from
   http://zhangroup.aporc.org/iBFE.}},

Journal = {{ENDOCRINE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a serious health-related
   condition all over the world; the number of patients is increasing in
   Asian countries including Japan. Better understanding of its
   pathophysiology is required to develop effective therapeutics, as
   patients may go on to develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and
   hepatocellular carcinomas. While NAFLD is believed to be associated with
   metabolic risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, its
   etiology remains largely unknown and the development or co-existence of
   NAFLD in patients with insulinoma has not been investigated. A
   33-year-old male with an insulinoma, who had been hypoglycemic during
   the previous four years, developed abnormally elevated levels of liver
   enzymes and histological fatty liver characteristic of NAFLD by the time
   of admission to our hospital for resection of an insulinoma. His medical
   records for the previous eight years revealed that his bodyweight had
   increased gradually from 60 kg to 71 kg for seven years and then acutely
   increased to 79 kg in the latest one-year period. This sudden increase
   was thought to be due to the patient's self-described overeating of
   fruits to forestall hypoglycemia. Fresh fruits are rich in fructose, and
   the patient's triglycerides, alanine and aspartate transaminases showed
   an acute increase in the previous one-year period. After resection of
   the insulinoma, the levels of these parameters all were mostly restored,
   which suggests that hyperinsulinemia and subsequent hyperphagia played a
   role in the development of NAFLD in this case. This is the first report
   of patient with NAFLD and an insulinoma.}},

Title = {{EVALUATING CHANGES IN THE ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION OF MICROMETEORITES
   DURING ENTRY INTO THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{814}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{We evaluate the heating of extraterrestrial particles entering the
   atmosphere using the comprehensive chemical ablation model (CABMOD).
   This model predicts the ablation rates of individual elements in a
   particle with a defined size, composition, entry velocity, and entry
   angle with respect to the zenith (ZA). In the present study, bulk
   chemical analyses of 1133 Antarctica micrometeorites (collected from the
   south pole water well) are interpreted using CABMOD. The marked spread
   in Fe/Si values in unmelted, partially melted, and melted
   micrometeorites is explained by the loss of relatively volatile Fe
   during atmospheric entry. The combined theoretical modeling and
   elemental composition of the micrometeorites (Mg/Si ratios) suggest that
   similar to 85\% of particles have a provenance of carbonaceous
   chondrites, the remaining similar to 15\% are either ordinary or
   enstatite chondrites. About 65\% of the micrometeorites have undergone
   <20\% ablation, while a further 20\% have lost between 20\% and 60\% of
   their original mass. This has implications for understanding the
   micrometeorite flux that reaches the Earth's surface, as well as
   estimating the pre-atmospheric size of the particles. Our work shows
   that the unmelted particles that. contribute similar to 50\% to the
   total micrometeorite collection on Earth's surface have a small entry
   zone: ZA = 60 degrees-90 degrees if the entry velocity is similar to 11
   km s(-1), and ZA = 80 degrees-90 degrees for >11-21 km s(-1).}},
