Title = {{The Effect of Gender Interactions on Students' Physical Examination
   Ratings in Objective Structured Clinical Examination Stations}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1772-1776}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Previous studies have reached a variety of conclusions regarding the
   effect of gender on performance in objective structured clinical
   examinations (OSCEs). Most measured the effect on students' overall OSCE
   score. The authors of this study evaluated the effect of gender on the
   scores of specific physical examination OSCE stations, both
   ``gender-sensitive{''} and ``gender-neutral.{''}
   Method
   In 2008, the authors collected scores for 138 second-year medical
   students at the University of Calgary who underwent a seven-station
   OSCE. Two stations-precordial and respiratory exams-were considered
   gender-sensitive. Multiple linear regression was used to explore the
   effect of students', standardized patients' (SPs'), and raters' genders
   on the students' scores.
   Results
   All 138 students (69 female) completed the OSCE and were included in the
   analyses. The mean scores (SD) for the two stations involving
   examination of the chest were higher for female than for male students
   (83.2\% {[}15.5] versus 78.3\% {[}15.8], respectively, d = 0.3, P =
   .009). There was a significant interaction between student and SP gender
   (P = .02). In the stratified analysis, female students were rated
   significantly higher than male students at stations with female SPs
   (85.4\% {[}15.5] versus 76.6\% {[}16.5], d = 0.6, P = .004) but not at
   stations with male SPs (80.2\% {[}15.0] versus 80.0\% {[}15.0], P =
   1.0).
   Conclusion
   These results suggest student and SP genders interact to affect OSCE
   scores at stations that require examination of the chest. Further
   investigations are warranted to ensure that the OSCE is an equal
   experience for all students.}},

Title = {{Optimization of a dual-energy contrast-enhanced technique for a
   photon-counting digital breast tomosynthesis system: II. An experimental
   validation}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{5908-5913}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Previously, the authors developed a dual-energy (DE)
   acquisition technique for a photon-counting digital breast tomosynthesis
   (DBT) imaging system. Low-energy (LE) and high-energy (HE) images are
   acquired in a single scan by covering alternate slits of a multislit
   prepatient collimator with Sn and Cu, respectively. A theoretical model
   was used to optimize the technique. In this article, an experimental
   validation of this technique is presented.
   Methods: Experiments were performed on a prototype DBT system. LE and HE
   projection images were acquired sequentially; either a Sn or a Cu filter
   was positioned in the filter holder at the exit window of the x-ray
   tube. Sn filters from 0.113 to 0.242 mm thick and Cu filters from 0.103
   to 0.267 mm were used. The images were acquired with a W target at 49
   kV. Tomographic images, hereafter referred to as DBT images, were
   reconstructed using a shift-and-add algorithm. DE-DBT images were
   obtained by weighted logarithmic subtraction of the LE and HE images.
   Weighting factors w(t) that optimally cancel breast tissues with two
   different glandularities were assessed for 20-80 mm thick phantoms with
   0\%, 50\%, and 100\% glandularity. The mean and standard deviation in
   the per-pixel signal intensity (SI) were calculated in the DBT images.
   These data were used to calculate signal-difference-to-noise ratios
   (SDNRs) between iodine enhanced and nonenhanced polymethyl methacrylate
   backgrounds. To illustrate the feasibility of the technique, DE-DBT
   images of a structured phantom containing iodine disks were assessed.
   The experimental results were compared against the values obtained from
   a theoretical model of the imaging system.
   Results: The average difference between theoretical and experimental
   w(t) was found to range from 8\% to 21\%. Experimental w(t) values
   increase with phantom thickness and Cu thickness, depend somewhat on Sn
   thickness, and vary more as a function of breast composition in thick
   breasts than in thin breasts. Theoretical and experimental mean and
   standard deviation in the per-pixel SI differ by -7\% to 10\% and by
   -3\% to 4\%. Theoretical and experimental SDNR values differ, on
   average, by 1.5\%. Iodine concentrations can be predicted from SDNR; the
   relationship can be accurately fit to a quadratic. In the images of the
   structured phantom, iodine concentrations of 1 mg/cm(2) and larger are
   discernable.
   Conclusions: The strong agreement between experimental and theoretical
   results in this article indicates that the authors' computer model is
   accurate. (C) 2010 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Abstract = {{Aim.
   To compare the survival rates of Class II Atraumatic Restorative
   Treatment (ART) restorations placed in primary molars using cotton rolls
   or rubber dam as isolation methods.
   Methods.
   A total of 232 children, 6-7 years old, both genders, were selected
   having one primary molar with proximal dentine lesion. The children were
   randomly assigned into two groups: control group with Class II ART
   restoration made using cotton rolls and experimental group using rubber
   dam. The restorations were evaluated by eight calibrated evaluators
   (Kappa > 0.8) after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.
   Results.
   A total of 48 (20.7\%) children were considered dropout, after 24
   months. The cumulative survival rate after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months was
   61.4\%, 39.0\%, 29.1\% and 18.0\%, respectively for the control group,
   and 64.1\%, 55.1\%, 40.1\% and 32.1\%, respectively for the rubber dam
   group. The log rank test for censored data showed no statistical
   significant difference between the groups (P = 0.07). The univariate Cox
   Regression showed no statistical significant difference after adjusting
   for independent variables (P > 0.05).
   Conclusion.
   Both groups had similar survival rates, and after 2 years, the use of
   rubber dam does not increase the success of Class II ART restorations
   significantly.}},

Abstract = {{We present a general framework for carrying out perturbation analysis in
   Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS) of arbitrary structure. In particular,
   Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) is used to provide unbiased
   gradient estimates of performance in with respect to various
   controllable parameters. These can be combined with standard
   gradient-based algorithms for optimization purposes and implemented on
   line with little or no distributional information regarding the
   stochastic processes involved. We generalize an earlier concept of
   ``nduced events{''} for this framework to include system features such
   as delays in control signals or modeling multiple user classes sharing a
   resource. We apply this generalized IPA to two SHS with different
   characteristics. First, we develop a gradient estimator for the
   performance of a linear switched system with control signal delays and a
   safety constraint and show that it is independent of the random delay's
   distributional characteristics. Second, we derive closed-form unbiased
   IPA estimators for a Stochastic Flow Model (SFM) of systems executing
   tasks subject to either hard or soft real-time constraints. These
   estimators are incorporated in a gradient-based algorithm to optimize
   performance by controlling a task admission threshold parameter
   Simulation results are included to illustrate this optimization
   approach.}},

Title = {{Native type IV collagen induces cell migration through a CD9 and

Abstract = {{CD9 is a member of the tetraspanin family and is widely expressed in the
   plasma membrane of several cell types as well as malignant cells. CD9
   associates with a number of transmembrane proteins, which facilitates
   biological processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, migration and
   proliferation. DDR1 is activated by native type IV collagen and
   overexpressed in human breast cancer. Type IV collagen is the main
   component of basement membranes, and may interact with cell surface
   biomolecules, promoting adhesion and motility. However, the role of DDR1
   and type IV collagen in the regulation of CD9-cell surface levels and
   migration in breast cancer cells has not been studied in detail. We
   demonstrate here that native type IV collagen induces a transient
   increase of CD9-cell surface levels through a DDR1-dependent pathway in
   MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, as revealed by flow cytometry and
   Western blotting using specific antibodies that recognize CD9. In
   contrast, type IV collagen does not induce any increase of CD9-cell
   surface levels in the mammary non-tumorigenic epithelial cells MCF10A
   and MCF12A. Transient increase of CD9-cell surface levels is coupled
   with clathrin-mediated endocytosis and it is dependent of DDR1
   expression. In addition, type IV collagen induces cell migration through
   a DDR1 and CD9-dependent pathway. In summary, our data demonstrate, for
   the first time, that native type IV collagen induces a transient
   increase of CD9-cell surface levels and cell migration through a DDR1
   and CD9-dependent pathway in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry
   (GC-C-IRMS) is the preferred method of confirming the administration of
   exogenous testosterone by athletes. This relies on synthetic
   testosterone preparations being depleted in C-13 compared to natural
   testosterone. There is concern, however, about the existence of
   synthetic testosterone products that are unexpectedly C-13-enriched and
   which may allow athletes to circumvent the current GC-C-IRMS test.
   Further to the reported studies of legitimate pharmaceutical-grade
   testosterone products, a detailed analysis of seized materials from
   border-level seizures was required to obtain intelligence concerning
   trends in `black market' testosterone manufacture and distribution. The
   sample set collected for this study between 2006 and 2009 inclusive
   provided a delta C-13 range (n=266) of -22.9 parts per thousand to -32.6
   parts per thousand with mean and median values of -28.4 parts per
   thousand and -28.6 parts per thousand, respectively. Within this
   distribution there were 24 samples (9\%) confirmed to have delta C-13
   values in the range reported for endogenous urinary steroid metabolites
   (>= -25.8 parts per thousand). The benefit of delta C-13 profiling for
   testosterone preparations was demonstrated by the ability to identify
   specific seized products that can be target tested for future
   intelligence purposes.
   In addition, the potential of stable hydrogen isotope ratio (H-2/H-1;
   delta H-2) discrimination to complement delta C-13 analysis was
   investigated. Methodologies for the determination of delta H-2 values by
   gas chromatography-thermal conversion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry
   (GC-TC-IRMS) were developed to provide a delta H-2 range (n=173) of -177
   parts per thousand to -268 parts per thousand with mean and median
   values of -231 parts per thousand and -234 parts per thousand,
   respectively. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Two commercial portable spectrometers were compared for orange quality
   non-destructive predictions by developing partial least squares
   calibration models, reflectance mode spectra acquisition being used in
   both. One of them was a Vis/NIR spectrometer in which the radiation
   reflected by the fruit is collected and conducted by optic fiber to the
   three detectors (350-2500 nm) of the instrument. The other is an
   AOTF-NIR with a reflectance post-dispersive optical configuration and
   InGaAs (1100-2300 nm) detector. Four orange varieties were included in
   calibrations. The parameters studied were soluble solids content,
   acidity, titratable acidity, maturity index, flesh firmness, juice
   volume, fruit weight, rind weight, juice volume to fruit weight ratio,
   fruit colour index and juice colour index. The results indicate good
   performance of the predictive models, particularly for the direct NIR
   prediction of soluble solids content, and maturity index, the prediction
   of this last parameter being notable for its relevance and novelty. The
   RPD ratios for these parameters were in the range from 1.67 to 2.21 with

Title = {{Analytical Performance Prediction for Iterative Reconstruction
   Techniques in Electron Tomography of Biological Structures}},

Abstract = {{The problem of the three-dimensional reconstruction of structures from
   projection data occurs in a wide range of areas. Algebraic
   reconstruction techniques (ART) are iterative procedures for recovering
   the structure of three-dimensional objects from projection images. ART
   was dismissed during the seventies due to the high demands on computing
   resources. In the following years, computer algorithms for image
   reconstruction with fast convergence were designed, implemented,
   evaluated, and, finally, optimized. Nevertheless, the reported
   experimental data exceed computing potential for a single CPU as well as
   I/O capability. Interesting recent research aims at acquiring experience
   with parallelization strategies and at demonstrating the effectiveness
   of the massively parallel processing approach in biological
   environments. This makes the investigation of performance prediction for
   high-performance parallel computing of paramount importance. A
   performance prediction model for iterative reconstruction techniques
   (IRT) would provide additional knowledge of the parallel computer
   algorithm and predict its behavior under specific conditions or hardware
   configurations. Also, a goal of performance analysis is to find the set
   of parameter values that produces the best overall performance. Not only
   the end-users of these systems have a vested interest in predicting
   performance but also the computer designers and the professional
   engineers. This article addresses the derivation and evaluation of an
   analytical performance prediction model for a parallelization of IRT
   (block iterative version of the component averaging, BICAV) and
   emphasizes the essential role of parallel computers in image
   reconstruction. The techniques' behavior is analyzed through specifics
   steps to create an analytical formulation of the problem. BPTomo is a
   parallel distributed application for tomographic reconstruction that
   uses IRT. The analytical performance prediction model is validated by
   comparison of the estimated times for representative datasets against
   BPTomo computation times measured on two PC clusters. The analytical
   model is shown to be quite accurate. The percentage deviation between
   estimated and measured times is less than 12\%.}},

Abstract = {{Theory predicts that parents should invest less in dependent offspring
   with lower reproductive value, such as those with a high risk of
   predation. Moreover, high predation risk can favor reduced parental
   activity when such activity attracts nest predators. Yet, the ability of
   parents to assess ambient nest-predation risk and respond adaptively
   remains unclear, especially where nest-predator assemblages are diverse
   and potentially difficult to assess. We tested whether variation in
   parental investment by a multi-brooded songbird (Brewer's Sparrow,
   Spizella breweri) in an environment (sagebrush steppe) with diverse
   predators was predicted by ambient nest-predation risk or direct
   experience with nest predation. Variation among eight sites in ambient
   nest-predation risk, assayed by daily probabilities of nest predation,
   was largely uncorrelated across four years. In this system risk may
   therefore be unpredictable, and aspects of parental investment (clutch
   size, egg mass, incubation rhythms, nestling-feeding rates) were not
   related to ambient risk. Moreover, investment at first nests that were
   successful did not differ from that at nests that were depredated,
   suggesting parents could not assess and respond to territory-level
   nest-predation risk. However, parents whose nests were depredated
   reduced clutch sizes and activity at nests attempted later in the season
   by increasing the length of incubation shifts (on-bouts) and recesses
   (off-bouts) and decreasing trips to feed nestlings. In this
   unpredictable environment parent birds may therefore lack sufficient
   cues of ambient risk on which to base their investment decisions and
   instead rely on direct experience with nest predation to inform at least
   some of their decisions.}},

Abstract = {{P>The knowledge of the gravitational potential coefficients J(2) and
   J(4) of a hydrostatic Earth model is necessary to deal with
   non-hydrostatic properties of our planet. They are indeed fundamental
   parameters when modelling the 3-D density structure or the rotational
   behaviour of our planet. The most widely used values computed by
   Nakiboglu need to be updated for two reasons. First, we have noted a
   mistake in one of his formulae. Secondly, the value of the inertia ratio
   I/MR2 chosen at the time of prem is not any more the best estimate. Both
   corrections slightly but significantly reduce the hydrostatic J(2)
   value: the dynamical flattening of the Earth is even further from
   hydrostaticity than previously thought. The difference between the polar
   and equatorial radii appears to be 113 +/- 1 m (instead of 98 m) larger
   than the hydrostatic value. Moreover, uncertainties upon the hydrostatic
   parameters are estimated.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Neurological soft signs (NSS) are hypothesized as candidate
   endophenotypes for schizophrenia, but their prevalence and relations
   with clinical and demographic data are unknown. The authors undertook a
   quantification (meta-analysis) of the published literature on NSS in
   patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. A systematic search
   was conducted for published articles reporting NSS and related data
   using standard measures in schizophrenia and healthy comparison groups.
   Method: A systematic search was conducted for published articles
   reporting data on the prevalence of NSS in schizophrenia using standard
   clinical rating scales and healthy comparison groups. Meta-analyses were
   performed using the Comprehensive Meta-analysis software package. Effect
   sizes (Cohen d) indexing the difference between schizophrenic patients
   and the healthy controls were calculated on the basis of reported
   statistics. Potential moderator variables evaluated included age of
   patient samples, level of education, sample sex proportions, medication
   doses, and negative and positive symptoms. Results: A total of 33
   articles met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. A large and
   reliable group difference (Cohen d) indicated that, on average, a
   majority of patients (73\%) perform outside the range of healthy
   subjects on aggregate NSS measures. Cognitive performance and positive
   and negative symptoms share 2\%-10\% of their variance with NSS.
   Conclusions: NSS occur in a majority of the schizophrenia patient
   population and are largely distinct from symptomatic and cognitive
   features of the illness.}},

Abstract = {{The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was developed by the US Department of
   Agriculture with the goal of quantifying adherence to the Dietary
   Guidelines for Americans. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
   impact of the HEI-2005 score and each of its components on endometrial
   cancer risk in a population-based case-control study in New Jersey. A
   total of 424 cases and 398 controls completed a Food Frequency
   Questionnaire, which was used to derive the HEI-2005 score. Odds ratios
   (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using
   unconditional logistic regression while adjusting for potential
   covariates, which included all major endometrial cancer risk factors.
   The adjusted OR for women in the highest quartile when compared to the
   lowest quartile was 0.83 (95\% CI: 0.52-1.34). For the meat and beans
   component comprising meat, eggs, poultry, fish, and beans, the OR was
   0.70 (95\% CI: 0.45-1.11; p for trend: 0.07), with little evidence of an
   association with any of the individual foods. There was no indication of
   an association for any of the other components of the HEI or of effect
   modification by body mass index. This study suggested limited value for
   the HEI-2005 in predicting endometrial cancer risk.}},

Abstract = {{Interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of hybrid composites made from glass
   fiber and multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) modified epoxy is
   compared with unmodified epoxy/glass fiber composites (control). By
   combining the techniques of high speed mechanical stirring and
   ultrasonic agitation, 0.5\% MWCNT by weight was dispersed in epoxy to
   prepare a suspension. Composites were manufactured by both injection
   double vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (IDVARTM) and the flow
   flooding chamber (FFC) methods. Compression shear tests were conducted
   on the manufactured samples to determine ILSS. The effect of processing
   history and batch-to-batch variability of materials - glass fiber
   preform, resin and carbon nanotubes - on ILSS of samples made by both
   techniques was investigated. Statistical analysis of the measured ILSS
   values for hybrid composites and their comparison with the control
   specimens clearly show that hybrid composites made by the FFC process
   resulted in (i) significant ILSS enhancement relative to the control and
   to IDVARTM specimens and (ii) better repeatability than the IDVARTM
   process. A description of both IDVARTM and FFC processes and their role
   in dispersing the nanotubes between the fabric layers was discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{We sought to determine the diagnostic value of a D-dimer test for
   myocardial infarction (MI). The prospective cohort study was carried in
   the ED of a university hospital. All included patients were tested for
   D-dimer and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) on ED admission and additional
   cTnI 6 h later. AMI was retrospectively confirmed by employing the
   ESC-ACC-AHA-WHF 2007 universal definition. The discriminative value of
   D-dimer test was assessed by ROC curve analysis. Multivariate analysis
   was used to identify independent risk factors associated with D-dimer
   elevation other than MI. A total of 178 patients were included in this
   study. Median D-dimer levels were significantly higher in MI patients. A
   D-dimer value greater than 200 ng/ml was significantly associated with
   MI. When used alone, the test has a high sensitivity of 91.8\% but a low
   specificity of 23.9\%. Combined use of cTnI and D-dimer tests raised the
   sensitivity to 98.4\% and helped early triage a subgroup of low risk
   patients. However, the test had the downside of 58\% false positives.
   High false positives could be partly explained by the high prevalence of
   underlying hypercoagulable comorbidities. Diabetes mellitus with chronic
   renal insufficiency was identified as the strongest risk factor
   associated with D-dimer elevation in patients without MI. D-dimer test
   alone has a low diagnostic value for MI. Co-existing hypercoagulable
   conditions may confound the results. Combining cTnI and D-dimer tests
   enables early identification a low risk group of patients for MI at the
   cost of high false positives.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an improved particle swarm optimization is presented to
   search for the optimal PID controller gains for a class of nonlinear
   systems The proposed algorithm is to modify the velocity formula of the
   general PSO systems in order for improving the searching efficiency. In
   the improved PSO-based nonlinear PID control system design, three PID
   control gains, i e, the proportional gain K-p integral gain K-t, and
   derivative gain K-d are required to form a parameter vector which is
   called a particle It is the basic component of PSO systems and many such
   particles further constitute a population To derive the optimal PID
   gains for nonlinear systems, two principle equations, the modified
   velocity updating and position updating equations, are employed to move
   the positions of all particles in the population In the meanwhile, an
   objective function defined for PID controller optimization problems may
   be minimized To validate the control performance of the proposed method,
   a typical nonlinear system control, the inverted pendulum tracking
   control, is illustrated The results testify that the improved PSO
   algorithm can perform well in the nonlinear MD control system design.

Abstract = {{This paper describes a project undertaken to establish a self-explaining
   roads (SER) design programme on existing streets in an urban area. The
   methodology focussed on developing a process to identify functional road
   categories and designs based on endemic road characteristics taken from
   functional exemplars in the study area. The study area was divided into
   two sections, one to receive SER treatments designed to maximise visual
   differences between road categories, and a matched control area to
   remain untreated for purposes of comparison. The SER design for local
   roads included increased landscaping and community islands to limit
   forward visibility, and removal of road markings to create a visually
   distinct road environment. In comparison, roads categorised as
   collectors received increased delineation, addition of cycle lanes, and
   improved amenity for pedestrians. Speed data collected 3 months after
   implementation showed a significant reduction in vehicle speeds on local
   roads and increased homogeneity of speeds on both local and collector
   roads. The objective speed data, combined with residents' speed choice
   ratings, indicated that the project was successful in creating two
   discriminably different road categories. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Objective: Many different types of bias have been described. Some biases
   may tend to coexist or be associated with specific research settings,
   fields, and types of studies. We aimed to map systematically the
   terminology of bias across biomedical research.
   Study Design and Setting: We used advanced text-mining and clustering
   techniques to evaluate 17,265,924 items from PubMed (1958-2008). We
   considered 235 bias terms and 103 other terms that appear commonly in
   articles dealing with bias.
   Results: Forty bias terms were used in the title or abstract of more
   than 100 articles each. Pseudo-inclusion clustering identified 252
   clusters of terms. The clusters were organized into macroscopic maps
   that cover a continuum of research fields. The resulting maps highlight
   which types of biases tend to co-occur and may need to be considered
   together and what biases are commonly encountered and discussed in
   specific fields. Most of the common bias terms have had continuous use
   over time since their introduction, and some (in particular confounding,
   selection bias, response bias, and publication bias) show increased
   usage through time.
   Conclusion: This systematic mapping offers a dynamic classification of
   biases in biomedical investigation and related fields and can offer
   insights for the multifaceted aspects of bias. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{This paper describes a validation process in compliance with the NF/EN
   ISO/IEC 17025 standard for the determination of the macrominerals

   with flame atomic absorption spectrometry after closed-vessel microwave
   digestion. The French Standards Commission (Agence Francaise de
   Normalisation) standards NF V03-110, NF EN V03-115, and XP T-90-210 were
   used to evaluate this method. The method was validated in the context of
   an analysis of the 1322 food samples of the second French Total Diet
   Study (TDS). Several performance criteria (linearity, LOQ, specificity,
   trueness, precision under repeatability conditions, and intermediate
   precision reproducibility) were evaluated. Furthermore, the method was
   monitored by several internal quality controls. The LOQ values obtained
   (25, 5, 8.3, and 8.3 mg/kg for Ca, Mg, Na, and K, respectively) were in
   compliance with the needs of the TDS. The method provided accurate
   results as demonstrated by a repeatability CV (CVr) of <7\% and a
   reproducibility CV (CVR) of <12\% for all the elements. Therefore, the
   results indicated that this method could be used in the laboratory for
   the routine determination of these four elements in foodstuffs with
   acceptable analytical performance.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The purpose of this study was to compare the patterns of
   failure focusing on the distribution of local-regional recurrence among
   patients treated postoperatively with conventional radiotherapy (AT) and
   intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for head and neck cancer.
   Methods. The records of 130 patients treated by surgery and
   postoperative radiation therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the head
   and neck were reviewed. Seventy-eight patients (60\%) were treated using
   conventional RI and 52 patients (40\%) were treated using IMRT.
   Results. The 3-year estimates of local-regional control were 70\% and
   73\% among patients treated by conventional RI and IMRT, respectively (p
   = .33). Among the local-regional recurrences in the IMRT group, 9 were
   in-field recurrences occurring within the physician-designated clinical
   target volume (CTV), and 4 were marginal recurrences involving the
   contralateral neck adjacent to the spared parotid gland (3 patients) and
   the retropharyngeal/retrostyloid lymph node region (1 patient).
   Conclusion. Our study showed that conventional RI and IMRT result in
   similar rates of local-regional control. The implications for CTV design
   are discussed herein. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 32:

Abstract = {{In this study, electron-irradiation-induced phase transformations
   between alumina polymorphs were investigated by high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy. It was found that the
   electron-irradiation-induced alpha --> kappa' phase transformation

   that the knock-on collision between incident electrons and Al3+ cations
   is responsible for the occurrence of electron-irradiation-induced phase
   transformation from alpha-alumina to kappa'-alumina. (C) 2010 Acta

Abstract = {{Background: The main aim of this study was to examine the symptomatology
   of major depression in Alzheimer disease (AD) and its relationship with
   plasma homocysteine level. Methods: Eighty-three patients with AD were
   enrolled for clinical assessments and examination of fasting plasma
   homocysteine. Diagnosis of major depression was made, and the severity
   of the depression was assessed. Results: The moderate dementia patients
   presented with more common behavioral disturbances related to major
   depression than mild dementia patients. Major depression in patients
   with moderate AD was associated with higher plasma homocysteine levels.
   Furthermore, a high plasma homocysteine level was positively associated
   with behavioral disturbance among study participants with major
   depression. Conclusion: More behavioral disturbance associated with
   major depression occurred as the dementia progressed. Patients with a
   higher level of plasma homocysteine presented with a higher behavioral
   disturbance symptomatology. This finding may account for the
   relationship between elevated homocysteine levels and depression only in
   patients with moderate AD. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2010; 18: 1045-1048)}},

Abstract = {{We present photometric and structural parameters for 100 ACS Virgo
   Cluster Survey (ACSVCS) galaxies based on homogeneous, multi-wavelength
   (ugriz), wide-field SDSS (DR5) imaging. These early-type galaxies, which
   trace out the red sequence in the Virgo Cluster, span a factor of nearly
   similar to 10(3) in g-band luminosity. We describe an automated pipeline
   that generates background-subtracted mosaic images, masks field sources
   and measures mean shapes, total magnitudes, effective radii, and
   effective surface brightnesses using a model-independent approach. A
   parametric analysis of the surface brightness profiles is also carried
   out to obtain Sersic-based structural parameters and mean galaxy colors.
   We compare the galaxy parameters to those in the literature, including
   those from the ACSVCS, finding good agreement in most cases, although
   the sizes of the brightest, and most extended, galaxies are found to be
   most uncertain and model dependent. Our photometry provides an external
   measurement of the random errors on total magnitudes from the widely
   used Virgo Cluster Catalog, which we estimate to be sigma(B-T)
   approximate to 0.13 mag for the brightest galaxies, rising to
   approximate to 0.3 mag for galaxies at the faint end of our sample (B-T
   approximate to 16). The distribution of axial ratios of low-mass
   ({''}dwarf{''}) galaxies bears a strong resemblance to the one observed
   for the higher-mass ({''}giant{''}) galaxies. The global structural
   parameters for the full galaxy sample-profile shape, effective radius,
   and mean surface brightness-are found to vary smoothly and
   systematically as a function of luminosity, with unmistakable evidence
   for changes in structural homology along the red sequence. As noted in
   previous studies, the ugriz galaxy colors show a nonlinear but smooth
   variation over a similar to 7 mag range in absolute magnitude, with an
   enhanced scatter for the faintest systems that is likely the signature
   of their more diverse star formation histories.}},

Abstract = {{We show model-independently that the negative like-sign charge asymmetry
   (-A(sl)(b)) is less than 3.16 x 10(-3) when the constraints from the B-q
   - (B) over bar (q) mixings and the time-dependent CP asymmetries (CPAs)
   for Bq -> J/Psi M-q with M-q = K, phi and q = d, s are taken into
   account. Although the result is smaller than the measured value by the
   DO Collaboration at Fermilab, there is still plenty of room to have new
   physics, which is sensitive to new CP violating effects, as the standard
   model (SM) prediction is (2.3(-0.5)(+0.6)) x 10(-4). To illustrate the
   potential large broken vertical bar A(sl)(b)broken vertical bar, we show
   the influence of new SU(2) L singlet exotic quarks in the vector-like
   quark model, where the Z-mediated flavor changing neutral currents
   (FCNCs) are generated at tree level. In particular, we demonstrate that
   (a) the like-sign charge asymmetry could be enhanced by a factor of two
   in magnitude; (b) the CPA of sin 2 beta(J/Psi phi)(s) s could reach to
   -15\%; (c) the CPA of sin 2 beta(phi KS) could be higher than sin 2 beta
   J/Psi(KS) when vertical bar A(sl)(b)vertical bar is larger than the SM
   prediction; and (d) the branching ratio for B-s -> mu(+)mu(-) could be
   as large as 0.6 x 10(-8).}},

Abstract = {{Micro fabrication of polymers is becoming increasingly important and is
   considered a low-cost alternative to silicon- or glass-based MEMS
   technologies. However, very little work has been done to study the
   influence of polymer resin on the replication accuracy of the micro
   features in micro injection molding. In this study, micro injection
   molding was applied to a micro-featured fluidic platform used for
   DNA/RNA testing. LIGA-like processes were used to prepare a
   silicon-based SU-8 photoresist, followed by electroforming to make a
   Ni-Co-based stamp. The micro features in the stamp consisted of a
   micro-channel array 50 mu m in pitch size. COC, PC, PMMA and PS were
   used as the injection molding materials. The effect of various polymer
   resins and molding conditions on the replication accuracy of the micro
   features was investigated. The width and depth of the micro-channels
   within the molded devices were measured and analyzed. For the
   micro-injection-molded devices, the accuracy of the width and depth of
   the micro-channels increased with increasing mold temperature, melt
   temperature, injection velocity and packing pressure within the regular
   processing window. The molded parts showed excellent replication
   accuracy for the COC polymer resin due to its low viscosity and low,
   isotropic shrinkage. The PS resin also achieved acceptable micro-channel
   replication accuracy under specific molding conditions. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The study described the psychometric properties of the Pediatric
   Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) when used in Taiwanese
   normally developing children and illustrated the ethnic differences in
   determining capacity and independence in daily function between
   Taiwanese and American children. The Chinese version of the PEDI
   (PEDI-C) was administered to Taiwanese parents of 494 normally
   developing children and 110 children with developmental disabilities
   (DD). The scores of Taiwanese population were compared with the American
   counterparts using independent samples t-test. The PEDI-C had
   demonstrated good psychometric properties when used in Chinese-speaking
   population. The results revealed that internal consistency and
   inter-rater reliability was high. The unidimensionality of each domain
   was supported by Mokken analysis. The standardized factor scores of the
   PEDI-C differentiated children with DD from normally developing
   children. Group differences existed in various areas of daily function
   between Taiwanese and American children. Taiwanese children were less
   capable and needed more assistance in self-care and social function of

Abstract = {{Given a protein-forming system, i.e., a system consisting of certain
   number of different proteins, can it form a biologically meaningful
   pathway? This is a fundamental problem in systems biology and
   proteomics. During the past decade, a vast amount of information on
   different organisms, at both the genetic and metabolic levels, has been
   accumulated and systematically stored in various specific databases,
   such as KEGG, ENZYME, BRENDA, EcoCyc and MetaCyc. These data have made
   it feasible to address such an essential problem. In this paper, we have
   analyzed known regulatory pathways in humans by extracting different
   (biological and graphic) features from each of the 17,069 protein-formed
   systems, of which 169 are positive pathways, i.e., known regulatory
   pathways taken from KEGG; while 16,900 were negative, i.e., not formed
   as a biologically meaningful pathway. Each of these protein-forming
   systems was represented by 352 features, of which 88 are graph features
   and 264 biological features. To analyze these features, the ``Minimum
   Redundancy Maximum Relevance{''} and the ``Incremental Feature
   Selection{''} techniques were utilized to select a set of 22 optimal
   features to query whether a protein-forming system is able to form a
   biologically meaningful pathway or not. It was found through
   cross-validation that the overall success rate thus obtained in
   identifying the positive pathways was 79.88\%. It is anticipated that,
   this novel approach and encouraging result, although preliminary yet,
   may stimulate extensive investigations into this important topic.}},

   the SLM was proposed in this paper. The proposed parameter estimation
   strategy was based on the combination of the component based and the
   measurement based load modeling method. During parameter estimation,
   only the parameters playing very important roles in the dynamics of the
   load were estimated, while the other parameters playing limited roles
   were set as the default values which were obtained by the component
   based method. The efficiency of the proposed strategy was evaluated by
   the load modeling based on the field measurements. The SLM was compared
   with the composite load model (CLM) both in parameter estimation and

Abstract = {{Following myocardial infarction, the prognosis for females is better
   than males. Estrogen is thought to be protective, but clinical trials
   with hormone replacement failed to show protection. Here, we sought to
   identify novel mechanisms that might explain this sex-based difference.
   By diverging from the traditional focus on sex hormones, we employed a
   conceptually novel approach to this question by using a non-biased
   approach to measure global changes in gene expression following
   infarction. We hypothesized that specific gene programs are initiated in
   the heart following infarction that might account for this sex-based
   difference. We induced small, medium, and large infarcts in male and
   female mice and measured changes in gene expression by microarray
   following infarction. Regardless of infarct size, survival was better in
   females, while mortality occurred 3-10 days following infarction in
   males. Two days following infarction, males developed significant
   ventricular dilation, the best predictor of mortality in humans. Three
   days following infarction, we measured gene expression by microarray,
   comparing male versus female and sham versus surgery/infarction. In
   general, our results indicate a higher relative level of gene induction
   in females versus males and identified programs for angiogenesis,
   extracellular matrix remodeling, and immune response. This pattern of
   gene expression was linked to less pathologic remodeling in female
   hearts, including increased capillary density and decreased fibrosis. In
   summary, our results suggest an association between improved survival
   and less pathologic remodeling and the relative induction of gene
   expression in females following myocardial infarction. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Concurrent application of insect repellent picaridin or DEET with
   sunscreens has become prevalent due to concerns on West Nile virus and
   skin cancer. The objectives of this study were to characterize the
   percutaneous permeation of picaridin and sunscreen oxybenzone from
   commercially available preparations and to compare the differences in
   permeability between picaridin and DEET in association with oxybenzone.
   In vitro diffusion studies were carried out to measure transdermal
   permeation of picaridin and oxybenzone from four different products,
   using various application concentrations and sequences. Results were
   then compared to those of repellent DEET and sunscreen oxybenzone under
   identical conditions. Transdermal permeation of picaridin across human
   epidermis was significantly lower than that of DEET, both alone and in
   combination with oxybenzone. Concurrent use resulted in either no
   changes or suppression of transdermal permeation of picaridin and
   oxybenzone. This finding was different from concurrent use of DEET and
   oxybenzone in which a synergistic permeation enhancement was observed.
   In addition, permeation of picandin, DEET and oxybenzone across human
   epidermis was dependent on application concentration, use sequence, and
   preparation type. It was concluded from this comparative study that
   picaridin would be a better candidate for concurrent use with sunscreen
   preparations in terms of minimizing percutaneous permeation of the
   chemicals.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the profile of pelvic crush fractures in earthquake
   victims on digital radiography (DR) and multidetector computed

   One hundred and sixty-seven consecutive survivors of the 2008 Sichuan
   earthquake with pelvic crush fractures classified into types according
   to the Tile classification system, entered our study. One hundred and
   thirty-nine, and 28 patients underwent DR and MDCT scans, respectively.
   Data were reviewed retrospectively focusing on anatomical sites,
   numbers, and classification of pelvic ring fractures.
   Pelvic fractures occurred in the pubis in 88 patients (52.7\%), in other
   pelvic bones in 32 (19.16\%), and in both the pubis and other pelvic
   bones in 47 (28.14\%). Pubic fractures were more common than fractures
   of other pelvic bones, and involvement of bilateral pubis was more
   common than that of the left or right pubis (all p < 0.05). As for the
   numbers of pelvic bones involved, multiple fractures occurred in 48.52\%
   patients (81 out of 167) composed predominantly of fractures of two
   bones in 58.02\% (47 out of 81), and were seen more often in bilateral
   pubis than in any other pelvic bones (p < 0.05). Regarding

Abstract = {{Two sets of lateral vibration equations for a spinning axially loaded
   twisted Timoshenko beam have been studied. The compressed axial load is
   assumed to be normal to the shear force and tangential to the axis of

   problem of a real gyroscopic system is formulated and utilized to
   investigate the free vibration and buckling stability of various twisted
   Timoshenko beams. Some typical results are compared with numerical
   results in the published literature to validate the accuracy of the
   presented analysis. The influence of thickness-to-width ratio, twist
   angle, spinning speed and axial load on the natural frequency and
   buckling load of Timoshenko beams has been investigated and discussed.
   Comparisons between the results of the two sets of system equations are
   also made to justify the effect of the axial load for various Timoshenko

Title = {{Knowledge, attitudes, perceived vulnerability of Chinese nurses and
   their preferences for caring for HIV-positive individuals: a
   cross-sectional survey}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{21-22}},
Pages = {{3227-3234}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Aims.
   The study was to assess HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes and perceived
   vulnerability with potential factors.
   Background.
   HIV/AIDS is a public health catastrophe in China. Nurses are expected to
   care for nurture, comfort and advocate for all patients regardless of
   their condition. However, in the area of HIV/AIDS, nurses suffer as a
   result of expectations put on them by their professional roles.
   Design.
   This was a descriptive, cross-sectional design that used a survey
   approach.
   Method.
   Data were collected from Summer 2003-Winter 2004.
   Results.
   Nurses reported significant perceived severity of risk from occupational
   exposure. Many nurses were frequently exposed to being stuck by needles
   (86\%) and being splashed by body fluids and more than half of them (59
   center dot 7\%) were concerned about contracting HIV/AIDS. Nurses who
   had experience of finger pricks worried about potentially contacting HIV
   and being unaware of it (odds ratio= 0 center dot 444, p = 0 center dot
   004). Nurses demonstrated a lack of knowledge and training in infectious
   diseases which may be a result of the fact that the study location is
   not considered a `concentrated area' for infectious disease
   transmission; therefore, the need for the infectious diseases training
   has not been considered urgent.
   Conclusions.
   A well-designed educational programme on occupational hazards and risk
   behaviour should be implemented to educate nurses in suburban cities and
   the general public. Hospital administrators should implement on-site
   continuing education on HIV/AIDS throughout China. Armed with better
   knowledge of both transmission routes and precautions, nurses can
   protect themselves while providing care to patients.
   Relevance to clinical practice.
   Nurses in China urgently need psychosocial and physical supports from
   families, friends, communities and their working environments while
   combating HIV epidemic. With good support system, nurses will better
   educate patients and their family members on how to prevent transmission
   not only of HIV/AIDS but of a wide range of other infectious diseases as
   well.}},

Abstract = {{This exploratory study analyzes how students use different communication
   modes to share information, negotiate meaning and construct knowledge in
   the process of doing a group learning activity in a Primary Grade 5
   blended learning environment in Singapore. Small groups of students
   interacted face-to-face over a computer-mediated communication (CMC)
   technology called Group Scribbles (GS) to jointly complete a learning
   task. The lesson designers attempted to optimize the use of CMC
   technology and face-to-face (F2F) discussion in students' collaborative
   learning, with the aim of harnessing the specific features of each
   medium. Building on notions from communication studies and from
   interaction analysis, we observed the construction and evolution of the
   interactions through analyzing the artifacts that were produced by a
   group of students - in verbal talk, gestures, and sketches drawn and
   text inscribed in GS. F2F and GS interactions intertwined to support
   collaborative learning. The findings from this study could inform design
   aspects concerning integrating and reinforcing the strengths of both
   communication modes when introducing computer-assisted collaborative
   learning (CSCL) in a F2F classroom. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Carbon-based nanomaterials such as metallic single-walled carbon
   nanotubes, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and graphene have been
   considered as some of the most promising candidates for future
   interconnect technology because of their high current-carrying capacity
   and conductivity in the nanoscale, and immunity to electromigration,
   which has been a great challenge for scaling down the traditional copper
   interconnects. Therefore, studies on the performance and optimization of
   carbon-based interconnects working in a realistic operational
   environment are needed in order to advance the technology beyond the
   exploratory discovery phase. In this paper, we present the first
   demonstration of graphene interconnects monolithically integrated with
   industry-standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, as
   well as the first experimental results that compare the performance of
   high-speed on-chip graphene and MWCNT interconnects. The graphene
   interconnects operate up to 1.3-GHz frequency, which is a speed that is
   commensurate with the fastest high-speed processor chips today. A
   low-swing signaling technique has been applied to improve the speed of
   carbon interconnects up to 30\%.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate if stem or progenitor cells are found in
   adenomyosis and to characterize the role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in
   adenomyosis-derived mesenchymal stem cell (AMSC)-related pathogenesis of
   adenomyosis.
   Design: Experimental clinical study.
   Setting: University hospital.
   Patient(s): Ten patients with adenomyosis.
   Intervention(s): Hysterectomy.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): The gene expression of AMSCs and endometrial
   mesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs) were analyzed by microarray, quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Methylthiazol tetrazolium,
   proliferation, apoptosis, and migration/invasion assays of AMSCs and
   EMSCs were evaluated after COX-2 inhibitor treatment.
   Result(s): We isolated nine EMSCs from normal endometrium (n = 10) and
   six AMSCs (n = 10) from adenomyosis. The morphology, phenotype, and
   potential of multilineage differentiation between EMSCs and AMSCs were
   not significantly different. Using complementary DNA microarrays, the
   expression profiles of EMSCs are related to those of bone marrow-derived
   mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), but AMSCs are different from EMSCs and
   BMSCs in the gene profiles. We validated the microarray results and
   showed that there is increased COX-2 expression in AMSCs compared with
   EMSCs. Treatment with a COX-2 inhibitor suppressed migration and
   invasion and induced apoptotic capabilities of AMSCs, but not of EMSCs.
   Conclusion(s): Overexpression of COX-2 in AMSCs may play an important
   role in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis. COX-2 could be a possible
   target for treatment and prevention of adenomyosis. (Fertil Steril (R)

Abstract = {{Central neurocytoma is a rare benign intraventricular tumor which occurs
   in young adults. Craniotomy with tumor removal is associated with
   relatively high rates of morbidity and mortality. To improve the
   efficiency of endoscopic surgery for removal of this tumor, we used a
   polypropylene tube combined with a working channel endoscope. From
   January 2006 to October 2008, three patients with intraventricular
   central neurocytoma with acute hydrocephalus were treated by endoscopic
   surgery in our hospital. The tumor was almost totally removed. At

Abstract = {{By a ball-covering B of a Banach space X, we mean that B is a collection
   of open (or closed) balls off the origin whose union contains the unit
   sphere S(X) of X; and X is said to have the ball-covering property (BCP)
   provided it admits a ball-covering by countably many balls. In this note
   we give a natural example showing that the ball-covering property of a
   Banach space is not inherited by its subspaces: and we present a sharp
   quantitative version of the recent Fonf and Zanco renorming result
   saying that if the dual X{*} of X is w{*} separable, then for every
   epsilon > 0 there exist a (1 + epsilon)-equivalent norm on X, and an R >
   0 such that in this new norm S(X) admits a ball-covering by countably
   many balls of radius R. Namely, we show that R = R(epsilon) can be taken
   arbitrarily close to (1+epsilon)/epsilon, and that for X = l(1){[}0, 1]
   the corresponding R cannot be equal to 1/epsilon. This gives the sharp
   order of magnitude for R(epsilon) as epsilon -> 0. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) is a promising criterion for
   linear precoder design in multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output
   (MIMO) systems. It decouples the precoder design problem and makes
   closed-form solution available. In this letter, we present a new linear
   precoding scheme by slightly relaxing the SLNR maximization for MU-MIMO
   systems with multiple data streams per user. The precoding matrices are
   obtained by a general form of simultaneous diagonalization of two
   Hermitian matrices. The new scheme reduces the gap between the
   per-stream effective channel gains, an inherent limitation in the
   original SLNR precoding scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the
   proposed precoding achieves considerable gains in error performance over
   the original one for multi-stream transmission while maintaining almost
   the same achievable sum-rate.}},

   describes the generation mechanism of the ringing noise and derives an

   by covering the original microstrip structure with a superstrate of
   higher permittivity. A design space versus the superstrate thickness and
   the dielectric constant are constructed and in which, the guard trace
   needs be grounded at the two ends only without causing any ringing
   noise. Finally, the time-domain simulations and experiments are

Abstract = {{Malaria is a major global public health problem, and the alarming spread
   of drug resistance and limited number of effective drugs now available
   underline how important it is to discover new antimalarial compounds. An
   ethnopharmacological investigation was undertaken on Western Ghats
   plants traditionally used to treat malaria in India; 50 plants were very
   carefully selected from a total of 372 plants, and 200 extracts were
   prepared and tested for in vitro antiplasmodial activity alone and in
   combination with chloroquine (CQ) against CQ-resistant Plasmodium
   falciparum (strain MRC-Pf-43). In in vitro antiplasmodial activity, when
   plant extract alone is used, 29 extracts (or 14.5\%) showed significant
   high in vitro antiplasmodial activity with IC50 values ranging from 3.96
   to 4.85 mu g/ml, 53 extracts (or 26.5\%) showed significant good in
   vitro antiplasmodial activity with IC50 values ranging from 5.02 to 9.87
   mu g/ml, and 28 extracts (or 14\%) showed significant moderate in vitro
   antiplasmodial activity with IC50 values ranging from 10.87 to 14 mu
   g/ml, respectively. In combination with CQ, 103 extracts (or 51.5\%)
   showed significant synergistic in vitro antiplasmodial activities with
   synergistic factor values ranging from 1.03 to 1.92, and these
   activities were up to a fold higher with CQ, suggesting synergistic
   interactions of the two drugs. Our investigation has confirmed that
   above 62.1\% of the plant extracts showed moderate to high in vitro
   antiplasmodial activity when used alone, and in combination with CQ,
   55.7\% of the extracts showed borderline to good synergistic activity.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether there is a correlation between liver MR
   findings and the clinical manifestations and severity of liver
   dysfunction in patients with Wilson's disease.
   Materials and Methods: Two radiologists retrospectively evaluated MR
   images of the liver in 50 patients with Wilson's disease. The
   Institutional Review Board approved this retrospective study and
   informed consent was waived. MR images were evaluated with a focus on
   hepatic contour abnormalities and the presence of intrahepatic nodules.
   By using Fisher's exact test, MR findings were compared with clinical
   presentations (neurological and non-neurological) and hepatic
   dysfunction, which was categorized by the Child-Pugh classification
   system (A, B and C). Follow-up MR images were available for 17 patients.
   Results: Contour abnormalities of the liver and intrahepatic nodules
   were observed in 31 patients (62\%) and 25 patients (50\%),
   respectively. Each MR finding showed a statistically significant
   difference (p < 0.05) among the three groups of Child-Pugh
   classifications (A, n = 36; B, n = 5; C, n = 9), except for splenomegaly
   (p = 0.243). The mean age of the patients with positive MR findings was
   higher than that of patients with negative MR findings. For patients
   with Child-Pugh class A (n = 36) with neurological presentation,
   intrahepatic nodules, surface nodularity, and gallbladder fossa widening
   were more common. Intrahepatic nodules were improved (n = 8, 47\%),
   stationary (n = 5, 29\%), or aggravated (n = 4, 24\%) on follow-up MR
   images.
   Conclusion: MR imaging demonstrates the contour abnormalities and
   parenchymal nodules of the liver in more than half of the patients with
   Wilson's disease, which correlates with the severity of hepatic
   dysfunction and clinical manifestations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the effect of glucose and insulin
   concentrations on differentiation of umbilical cord lining progenitor
   cells to adipocyte-like cells (ALCs).
   Methods: Cord lining mesenchymal cells (CLMCs) were isolated from the
   explant of human umbilical cord amniotic membrane. CLMCs were subjected
   to differentiation under various culture conditions for 20 days. Lipid
   droplets were confirmed with Oil Red O staining. Gene expressions of
   adipsin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR
   gamma) were analyzed using reverse transcription-PCR. Leptin and
   adiponectin secretions were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay kit.
   Results: CLMCs became irregular, cuboidal-shaped cells that resemble
   adipocytes, and Oil Red O staining showed the presence of lipid
   droplets. The gene expressions of PPAR gamma and adipsin were
   upregulated. Leptin and adiponectin secretions by naive CLMCs were below
   the limits of detection. Matured ALCs cultured in low-glucose medium
   significantly secreted leptin and adiponectin, whereas those in
   high-glucose medium significantly secreted only leptin. Insulin
   concentration affects leptin but not adiponectin secretion.
   Conclusions: Under different culture conditions, CLMCs can differentiate
   into ALCs that resemble adipocytes in either normal-weight or obese
   individuals. Hence, these ALCs have the potential to be used as an in
   vitro model to study adipogenesis and obesity, and possibly as a drug
   discovery model for metabolic disorders. International Journal of

Abstract = {{Background/Aim: The CD34(+)CD38(-) leukaemia cell population contains
   leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) responsible for treatment failure in acute
   myeloid leukaemia (AML) and, thus, novel therapies are required to
   eradicate LSCs without harming healthy haematopoietic stem cells (HSC).
   Materials and Methods: The present study evaluated the effects of
   co-treatment with LY294002 (a PI3K/Akt inhibitor) and apigenin (a CK2
   inhibitor) (LY/Api) at subtoxic concentrations on leukaemia cell lines
   and primary AML cells. Results: LY/Api synergistically induced apoptosis
   in leukaemia cells, especially CD34(+)CD38(-) leukaemia cells. However,
   these effects were negligible in HSCs. LY/Api-induced apoptosis was
   accompanied by activation of caspase cascades and disruption of
   mitochondrial membrane potential. Caspase inhibitor or Akt
   overexpression abrogated this synergistic induction in apoptosis by
   LY/Api. LY/Api also led to remarkable down-regulation of anti-apoptotic
   proteins including Bcl-xL and NF-kappa B in CD34(+)CD38(-) leukaemia
   cells, but not in healthy hematopoietic stem cells. Conclusion:
   Inhibition of both CK2 and PI3K/Akt pathways may be a promising
   LSCs-targeted therapeutic strategy for AML.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study examined the efficacy of a treatment, Oral Reading
   for Language in Aphasia (ORLA), delivered by computer to individuals
   with chronic nonfluent aphasia and compared its efficacy with the same
   treatment delivered by a speech-language pathologist (SLP). Method: With
   ORLA, the person with aphasia systematically and repeatedly reads aloud
   sentences, first in unison and then independently. Following a
   no-treatment period, 25 individuals with chronic nonfluent aphasia were
   randomly assigned to receive 24 sessions of ORLA, 1-3 times per week,
   either by computer or by the SLP. Results: For participants receiving
   computer ORLA, change made on the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia
   Quotient (WAB-AQ) during the treatment phase was larger than the change
   made during the no-treatment phase. Positive effect sizes for change
   during treatment compared with change during the no-treatment phase were
   obtained and were benchmarked as medium or large for the WAB-AQ and
   discourse measures. There was no significant difference between outcomes
   for computer ORLA compared with SLP-ORLA. Conclusion: Low-intensity
   ORLA, delivered by computer to individuals with chronic nonfluent
   aphasia, is efficacious and may be equivalent to ORLA delivered by an
   SLP.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, direct numerical simulation of fully developed turbulent
   pipe flow is carried out at Re-tau approximate to 170 and 500 to
   investigate the effect of the streamwise periodic length on the
   convergence of turbulence statistics Mean flow, turbulence intensities,
   correlations, and energy spectra were computed The findings show that in
   the near-wall region (below the buffer region, r(+) <= 30), the required
   pipe length for all turbulence statistics to converge needs to be at
   least a viscous length of O(6300) wall units and should not be scaled
   with the pipe radius (delta) It was also found for convergence of
   turbulence statistics at the outer region that the pipe length has to be
   scaled with pipe radius and a proposed pipe length of 8 pi delta seems
   sufficient for the Reynolds numbers considered in this study (C) 2010

Abstract = {{In the present study, samples representing three hard tick species and
   one soft tick species, namely Dermacentor marginatus, Haemaphysalis
   punctata, Ixodes ricinus and Argas persicus from southwestern Romania,
   and one hard tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, from China were
   characterized genetically by a portion of mitochondrial cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit 1 gene (pcox1) and a portion of nicotinamide adenine
   dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 5 gene (pnad5). The pcox1 and pnad5
   were amplified separately from individual ticks by PCR, sequenced and
   analyzed. The length of pcox1 and pnad5 sequences of all samples was 732
   and 519 bp, respectively. The intra-specific sequence variation in De.
   marginatus was 0.1-1.0\% for pcox1 and 0.2-1.2\% for pnad5, whereas in
   Ha. punctata it was 0.4-1.9\% for pcox1 and 0.4-1.0\% for pnad5. For the
   tick species examined in the present study, sequence comparison revealed
   that the inter-specific sequence differences were higher: 15.9-27.6\%
   for pcox1 and 20.3-42.4\% for pnad5. This suggests that the cox1 and
   nad5 sequences could provide useful genetic markers for the specific

   n-alkane-inducible cytochrome P450 gene (ALK1), isocitrate lyase gene
   (ICL1), ribosomal protein S7 gene (RPS7), and the translation elongation
   factor-1 alpha gene (TEF1) for the heterologous gene in Yarrowia
   lipolytica. The promoters were introduced into the upstream of the lacZ
   or hERa reporter genes, respectively, and the activity was evaluated by
   beta-galactosidase assay for lacz and Western blot analysis for hER
   alpha. The expression analysis revealed that the ALK1 and ICL1 promoters
   were induced by n-decane and by EtOH, respectively. The constitutive
   promoter of RPS7 and TEF1 showed mostly a high level of expression in
   the presence of glucose and glycerol, respectively. In particular, the
   TEF1 promoter showed the highest beta-galactosidase activity and a
   significant signal by Western blotting with the anti-estrogen receptor,
   compared with the other promoters. Moreover, the detection system was
   constructed with promoters linked to the upstream of the expression
   vector for the hERa gene transformed into the Y. lipolytica with a
   chromosome-integrated lacZ reporter gene under the control of estrogen
   response elements (EREs). It was indicated that a combination of
   pTEF1p-hER alpha and CXAU1-2XERE was the most effective system for the
   E-2-dependent induction of the beta-galactosidase activity. This system
   showed the highest beta-galactosidase activity at 10(-6) M E-2, and the
   activity could be detected at even the concentration of 10(-10) M E-2.
   As a result, we have constructed a strongly sensitive detection system
   with Y lipolitica to evaluate recognized/suspected ED chemicals, such as
   natural/synthetic hormones, pesticides, and commercial chemicals. The
   results demonstrate the utility, sensitivity, and reproducibility of the
   system for identifying and characterizing environmental estrogens.}},

Abstract = {{A method is explored for the development of nano-network structures in
   aluminum-based composites containing C-60-fullerenes by annealing at 500
   degrees C. During annealing, although carbon atoms are decomposed from
   fullerenes attempting to form carbides, they cannot readily form
   carbides because C-60-fullerenes are individually dispersed and the
   driving force for long-range diffusion of carbon atoms is not sufficient
   at 500 degrees C. Carbon atoms rather occupy the interstices of
   aluminum, providing a meta-stable supersaturated aluminum phase with
   distorted crystal structures. The supersaturated aluminum phases grow
   with a strong anisotropy derived from lattice mismatch, meet neighboring
   phases, and then self-assemble into network structures. These nano-scale
   network structures are extremely stable at 500 degrees C, and offer
   significant potential for the development of structural aluminum matrix
   composites with a GPa-level strength. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Wound-adhesive and thermo-responsive hydrogels were prepared in an aim
   to develop a wound-care device for diabetic ulcers. A mixture of
   glycidyl methacrylated chitooligosaccharide (COS), di-acrylated
   Pluronic, and a recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) formed
   a physical hydrogel. Photo-irradiation was subsequently applied to
   chemically crosslink the hydrogel. Release profiles of encapsulated
   rhEGF from the hydrogel showed that release rates were dependent on
   degradation rates of hydrogels. Human primary keratinocytes were
   cultivated with the released fraction from the hydrogel to measure
   effects of released rhEGF on in vitro differentiation of keratinocytes.
   Muco-adhesive property of the hydrogel was investigated in animal skins
   and significant amounts of quantum dot-labeled rhEGF were retained at
   wound sites along with chitosan. The hydrogel was administered to dorsal
   burn wounds in wound healing impaired animals and photo-irradiated. COS
   and rhEGF in the hydrogels significantly enhanced epidermal
   differentiation during the wound healing process. Thus, the
   rhEGF-encapsulated hydrogel was expected to be a potential wound care
   product by increasing local concentration of rhEGF at wound sites with
   maintaining keratinocytic differentiation. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Introduction: This study aimed to examine the epidemiology and outcome
   of subglottic stenosis in infants and children, and to evaluate the
   current techniques used in its diagnosis and management at the KK
   Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore.
   Methods: A retrospective review and long-term follow-up was conducted in
   all infants and children diagnosed with subglottic stenosis between
   January 1997 and December 2008.
   Results: A total of 18 patients (nine male and nine female) with a
   median age of 7.5 months were identified. Two patients were diagnosed
   with definite congenital stenosis and 16 patients with acquired
   stenosis. The majority had Grade I stenosis (55.6 percent), followed by
   Grade 11 (27.8 percent) and Grade III (16.7 percent). None had Grade IV
   stenosis. 17 patients were intubated, and seven underwent tracheostomy.
   The most common surgical intervention performed was microlaryngoscopy
   and bronchoscopy with bougie dilation. The other surgical interventions
   included cricoid split, laryngotracheal reconstruction and cricotracheal
   resection. As of December 2008, the median duration of treatment was
   four years, with an overall recovery rate of 66.7 percent. The
   successful decannulation rate was 57.1 percent. Two mortalities were
   reported due to reasons unrelated to subglottic stenosis. Two patients
   were still undergoing treatment at the time of the study, and two were
   lost to follow-up.
   Conclusion: Conservative management alone may be required in the
   majority of Grade I stenosis cases. We observed that the mean number of
   reconstructive procedures performed per patient increased with the
   increase in the severity of stenosis. Each laryngeal framework procedure
   has to be customised to suit the individual.}},

   (1)), a combination of the two and placebo in these subgroups. Patients
   were randomized to treatment for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint
   was the change from baseline in mean seated diastolic blood pressure
   (DBP). Secondary efficacy endpoints included the change from baseline in
   mean seated systolic BP (SBP), proportions of patients achieving BP goal
   (<140/90 mm Hg or <130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes), and the
   number and percentage of patients achieving a range of BP targets.
   Safety and tolerability of amlodipine 5 and 10 mg, olmesartan medoxomil
   10, 20 and 40 mg, and all possible combinations of the two were also
   assessed. For each prespecified subgroup, all active treatments resulted
   in significant BP reductions from baseline (P<0.05). The
   antihypertensive effect of the combination of amlodipine+ olmesartan
   medoxomil was generally greater than the constituent amlodipine or
   olmesartan medoxomil monotherapies, regardless of subgroup. In general,
   more patients receiving combination therapy achieved BP goal than those
   treated with monotherapies. The safety and tolerability of combinations
   were similar to monotherapies across the subgroups. These results
   suggest that the combination of amlodipine+ olmesartan medoxomil
   provides a safe and effective option for the treatment of hypertension
   in challenging patient populations. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010)

Abstract = {{This report describes a case of Cushing syndrome due to ectopic
   adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion, complicated with
   disseminated nocardiosis. A 52-year-old postmenopausal woman presented
   with acute onset of hirsutism and easy bruisability associated with
   fatigue and generalized weakness, predominantly involving the proximal
   musculature of the extremities. Laboratory evaluation revealed high
   cortisol and ACTH levels, with negative pituitary magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI). A 2-day high-dose dexamethasone suppression test (8 mg/d)
   was indicative of ectopic ACTH secretion. During the course of the
   disease, the patient developed disseminated nocardiosis that involved
   the left lung, skin, and central nervous system and was treated
   accordingly. Despite ketokonazole treatment, cortisol levels remained
   high and a bilateral adrenalectomy was planned but not performed because
   the patient died approximately 2 months after initial admission.}},

Abstract = {{In volume-sensitive clays the annual cycle of wetting and drying causes
   shrink and swell displacements. These movements cause damage to many
   infrastructure types, including railway and highway embankments and cut
   slopes, earth dams and flood embankments. At present there is little
   information on the impacts of expected climate change on the stability
   and serviceability of infrastructure embankments and slopes constructed
   of clay in the UK. In this paper, a water balance model is used to
   calculate daily changes in soil moisture content in the surface layers
   of a clay slope. Summer soil moisture deficit and winter runoff are
   calculated over a baseline period (1960-1991) for four locations in the
   UK. The calculations are repeated using synthetically generated time
   series of weather data representative of UKCIP climate change scenarios
   for the 21st century. Results indicate that recent summers considered to
   be exceptionally dry are likely to become the average condition later in
   the 21st century. Although total annual runoff is predicted to decrease,
   extreme wet events are still likely to occur. This will increase the
   magnitude of the cycles of winter soil wetting and summer drying. The
   implications for the design and maintenance of clay slopes and
   embankments are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to estimate an adult-equivalent scale for calorie
   requirements and to determine the differences between adult-equivalent
   and per capita measurements of calorie availability in the Brazilian

   Budget Survey. The calorie requirement for a reference adult individual
   was based on the mean requirements for adult males and females
   (2,550kcal/day). The conversion factors were defined as the ratios
   between the calorie requirements for each age group and gender and that
   of the reference adult. The adult-equivalent calorie availability levels
   were higher than the per capita levels, with the largest differences in
   rural and low-income households. Differences in household calorie
   availability varied from 22kcal/day (households with adults and an
   adolescent) to 428kcal/day (households with elderly individuals), thus
   showing that per capital measurements can underestimate the real calorie
   availability, since they overlook differences in household composition.}},

Abstract = {{Low pressure die casting is used to manufacture complex metal components
   where there is a need for high structural integrity. In this process,
   liquid metal is fed from below into the die used to form the component
   under a positive pressure. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a
   meshfree Lagrangian method that has specific advantages for modelling
   such material forming applications. This paper describes extensions to
   the SPH method for predicting shrinkage of the cooling metal, tracking
   of oxide formation, prediction of feeding, solidification front dynamics
   and finally direct prediction of the residual pressure distribution in
   the solidified metal and of cavity defect formation. These are
   demonstrated using a simple two dimensional example which contains the
   essential features of an engine block. Crown Copyright (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Anthrax toxin (ATx) is composed of the binary exotoxins lethal toxin
   (LTx) and edema toxin (ETx). They have separate effector proteins (edema
   factor and lethal factor) but have the same binding protein, protective
   antigen (PA). PA is the primary immunogen in the current licensed
   vaccine anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA {[}BioThrax]). AVA confers
   protective immunity by stimulating production of ATx-neutralizing
   antibodies, which could block the intoxication process at several steps
   (binding of PA to the target cell surface, furin cleavage, toxin complex
   formation, and binding/translocation of ATx into the cell). To evaluate
   ATx neutralization by anti-AVA antibodies, we developed two
   low-temperature LTx neutralization activity (TNA) assays that
   distinguish antibody blocking before and after binding of PA to target
   cells (noncomplexed {[}NC] and receptor-bound {[}RB] TNA assays). These
   assays were used to investigate anti-PA antibody responses in
   AVA-vaccinated rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) that survived an aerosol
   challenge with Bacillus anthracis Ames spores. Results showed that
   macaque anti-AVA sera neutralized LTx in vitro, even when PA was
   prebound to cells. Neutralization titers in surviving versus
   nonsurviving animals and between prechallenge and post-challenge
   activities were highly correlated. These data demonstrate that AVA
   stimulates a myriad of antibodies that recognize multiple neutralizing
   epitopes and confirm that change, loss, or occlusion of epitopes after
   PA is processed from PA83 to PA63 at the cell surface does not
   significantly affect in vitro neutralizing efficacy. Furthermore, these
   data support the idea that the full-length PA83 monomer is an
   appropriate immunogen for inclusion in next-generation anthrax vaccines.}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Galicia (NW Spain) is a region with a high number of freshwater
   endemics, and probably the best preserved area concerning fish
   populations in the Iberian Peninsula, where records of non-indigenous
   freshwater species are recent when compared to the rest of the
   Peninsula. Detailed analysis of introductions of those species with
   records after 1900 present in both areas shows that delays were up to
   100 years for species introduced on the Iberian Peninsula at the
   beginning of the twentieth century, but the tendency adjust to a
   decreasing linear regression, with species introduced after 1995 being
   almost immediately present in Galicia. We underline the outstanding role
   of aquarium trade on these results. Analysis of temporal trends
   highlights several periods with numerous introductions, and shows a
   different trend in the last decade depending on the group of organisms,
   with a clear deceleration in introduction rates of vertebrates, but a
   continuous growing trend for invertebrates. Recent educational programs
   might be responsible for the reduction in the inflow of vertebrates, but
   there is still a need for the control of less conspicuous but equally
   harmful invertebrates and plants, as it will take longer to make both
   stakeholders and public aware of their detrimental effects on their new
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{There is ongoing debate about feasibility of performing
   hepatobiliopancreatic (HPB) cases in low-volume, community hospitals. We
   decided to analyze outcomes of HPB surgical cases done in our community
   hospital and compare it with published data from academic centers and/or
   national data.
   We reviewed all HPB cases (liver, pancreas, and bile duct cases)
   performed in an 8-year-period (2001-2009) by HPB-fellowship-trained
   general surgeon (P.F.S.) at the Danbury Hospital, CT, USA. All
   electronic files of the patients, who underwent HPB surgery, were
   reviewed, and all pertinent clinical information was retrieved.
   Complications and mortality were recorded for length of hospital stay
   and 30 days after discharge. All complications were graded according to
   Clavien classification. Pancreatic specific complications-pancreatic
   fistula/leak and delayed gastric emptying-were graded using
   International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula and International Study
   Group of Pancreatic Surgery definitions.
   There were 140 HPB cases. These included 33 pancreatoduodenectomies, 29
   distal pancreatectomies, 52 hepatic cases, and 26 cases of other cases
   involving pancreas and biliary tract. Overall complication rate was
   36.4\%. Using Clavien classifications, there were 26 grade 1
   complications, 21 grade 2 complications, and four grade 3 complications.
   Two patients underwent reoperation for postoperative complications.
   Overall mortality was 0.7\% (one patient). Pancreas-specific
   complications included 6\% pancreatic leak rate after
   pancreatoduodenectomy and 24.1\% leak rate for distal pancreatectomy.
   HPB surgery could be safely performed in community setting, with
   morbidity and mortality comparable to high-volume centers.}},

   approach utilizing models that reliably capture the underlying
   evolutionary processes. A variety of features are available including
   the ability to analyze the data with various evolutionary models, to

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess effects of a short-term resistance
   program on strength in fit young women using weight machines/free
   weights or elastic tubing. 42 physically fit women (21.79 +/- 0.7 years)
   were randomly assigned to the following groups: (i) the Thera-Band (R)
   Exercise Station Group (TBG); (ii) the weight machines/free weights
   group (MFWG); or (iii) the control group (CG). Each experimental group
   performed the same periodised training program that lasted for 8 weeks,
   with 2-4 sessions per week and 3-4 sets of 8- 15 submaximal reps. A load
   cell (Isocontrol; ATEmicro, Madrid, Spain) was used to test the
   evolution of the Maximum Isometric Voluntary Contraction (MIVC) in 3
   different exercises: Vertical Rowing (VR), Squat (S) and Back Extension
   (BE). A mixed model MANOVA {[}group (CG, TBG, MFWG) x testing time
   (pre-test, post-test)] was applied to determine the effect of the
   different resistance training devices on strength. The only groups to
   improve their MIVC (p < 0.005) were TBG and MFWG, respectively: VR
   19.87\% and 19.76\%; S 14.07 and 28.88; BE 14.41\% and 14.00\%. These
   results indicate that resistance training using elastic tubing or weight
   machines/free weights have equivalent improvements in isometric force in
   short-term programs applied in fit young women.}},

Abstract = {{In this article I argue that the future of psychological research on
   educational processes would benefit from an interdisciplinary approach
   that enables psychologists to locate their objects of study within the
   cultural, social, and historical contexts of their research. To make
   this argument, I begin by examining anthropological accounts of the
   characteristics of education in small, face-to-face, preindustrial
   societies. I then turn to a sample of contemporary psychoeducational
   research that seeks to implement major, qualitative changes in modern
   educational practices by transforming them to have the properties of
   education in those self-same face-to-face societies. Next I examine the
   challenges faced by these modern approaches and briefly describe a
   multi-institutional, multidisciplinary system of education that responds
   to these challenges while offering a model for educating psychology
   students in a multigenerational system of activities with potential
   widespread benefits.}},

Abstract = {{On the transient impact response of a structure made of shape memory
   alloy. In this paper, some improvements in the RL model are presented in
   order to solve transient dynamics problems. the initial model, based on
   the therm mechanics behaviour of alloy coupled with the heat equation
   has been implemented in a finite-element code for low frequency dynamics
   in previous works. Using this non linear model for transient dynamics
   (structural response to impact excitation) leads to non-physical
   solutions or to non convergence of the time integration algorithm. These
   behaviours are clue to strong non-linearities of equations that govern
   the transformation kinetics between both phases (austenite/martensite).
   Adding a relaxation term in differential equations allows the algorithms
   to converge without disturbing the original system. this term can be
   associated to a physical effect which is the propagation velocity of the
   phase transformation, classically considered as instantaneous in static
   or quasi-static simulations. The results are shown using a 2D structure
   excited by an impact force.}},

Abstract = {{Iridium oxide (IrOx) has been widely studied due to its applications in
   electrochromic devices, pH sensing, and neural stimulation. Previous
   work has demonstrated that both Ir and IrOx films with porous
   morphologies prepared by sputtering exhibit significantly enhanced
   charge storage capacities. However, sputtering provides only limited
   control over film porosity. In this work, we demonstrate an alternative
   scheme for synthesizing nanoporous Ir and activated IrOx films (AIROFs).
   This scheme utilizes atomic layer deposition to deposit a thin conformal
   It film within a nanoporous anodized aluminum oxide template. The It
   film is then activated by potential cycling in 0.1 M H2SO4 to form a
   nanoporous AIROF. The morphologies and electrochemical properties of the
   films are characterized by scanning electron microscopy and cyclic
   voltammetry, respectively. The resulting nanoporous AIROFs exhibit a
   nanoporous morphology and enhanced cathodal charge storage capacities as
   large as 311 mC/cm(2). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We calculate the one-loop Yukawa couplings and threshold corrections for

   and vertex renormalisation. The former comes in the IR from conventional
   field theory running and in the UV from threshold corrections that cause
   it to run from the winding scale associated to the full Calabi-Yau
   volume. The vertex correction is naively absent as it appears to
   correspond to superpotential renormalisation. However, we find that
   while the Wilsonian superpotential is not renormalised there is a

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To analyze the dimensionality of 2 self-report outcome
   measures (Foot/Ankle Disability Index {[}FADI] and Short-Form
   {[}SF]-36), 3 biomechanical measures (stance and step symmetry measures,
   gait speed, and step width), 2 physical-performance measures (timed
   get-up and go {[}TUG] and 4-square step test {[}4SST]), and 1
   clinician-report outcome measure (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle
   Society {[}AOFAS] Hindfoot Scale) in a patient population with
   unilateral ankle arthritis. These measures captured the following
   functions: mobility and speed, pain and its relationship to function,
   social integration, and symmetry and efficiency of gait.
   Design: Case series design.
   Setting: Biomechanical research laboratory adjacent to a busy orthopedic
   clinical practice.
   Patients: Seventy-nine consecutive patients with unilateral traumatic
   arthritis who were candidates for a total ankle replacement.
   Methods: An exploratory factor analysis with oblimin rotation was
   performed to determine the dimensions of the physical performance,
   biomechanical, self-report, and clinician-report measures.
   Main Outcome Measurements: Outcomes measures included the SF-36 and
   pertinent subscales, gait speed, the 4SST, the TUG, the FADI, the AOFAS
   Hindfoot Scale, and biomechanical measures of step width, step symmetry,
   and stance symmetry.
   Results: Four distinct dimensions were captured during factor analysis.
   Factor 1 included the TUG, gait speed, the 4SST, and step width; factor
   2 included the FADI, the SF-36 bodily pain score, and the SF-36 physical
   function score; factor 3 included the biomechanical scores of stance
   symmetry ratio and the step symmetry ratio; and factor 4 included SF-36
   social functioning and the AOFAS Hindfoot Scale.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that various outcome measures for the
   ankle capture different dimensions and should be considered when
   evaluating the presence of disability or long-term change in outcome. PM

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   After hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) donor-derived natural
   killer (NK) cells kill tumor cells to prevent relapse and mediate other
   beneficial clinical effects including control of infections without
   inducing graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD). Understanding the determinants
   of NK cell alloreactivity and function will support improvements in the
   design of HCT and adoptive cellular therapies.
   Recent findings
   Refinements to the model of NK cell education or licensing have been
   made which will inform strategies to develop functional alloreactive NK
   cells for therapeutic use. Differences in NK cell function have been
   shown to be dependent on the nature of the stimuli. Recent advances have
   been made in our understanding of the role of activating NK receptors on
   education and outcome after HCT. The use of adoptively transferred NK
   cells to treat hematopoietic malignancies has been expanding. New
   approaches to modulate target sensitivity to NK cell-mediated killing
   are under development.
   Summary
   NK cells play an important role in the therapeutic efficacy of HCT, with
   effects on control of infections, GVHD, engraftment and relapse
   prevention. Recent advances in our understanding of NK cell biology will
   support improvements in our ability to exploit NK cells to treat cancer.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the possible contribution of actuation redundancy in
   obtaining very high acceleration with parallel robot manipulators. This
   study is based on redundant and nonredundant Delta/Par4-like
   manipulators, which are frequently used for pick-andplace applications,
   and addresses the cases of translational manipulators (also called 3T
   manipulators) and manipulators with Schoenflies motions (also called
   3T1R manipulators). A dynamic model, valid for both redundant and
   nonredundant manipulators, is used to analyze the moving platform's
   acceleration capabilities: (i) at zero speed and in any direction and
   (ii) at zero speed in the ``best{''} direction. The results show that
   actuation redundancy makes it possible to homogenize dynamic
   capabilities throughout the work-space and to increase the moving
   platform's accelerations. Designs of redundant Delta/Par4-like
   manipulators capable of high acceleration pick-and-place trajectories
   are presented for both 3T and 3T1R manipulators.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study a new family of iterative methods for solving
   nonlinear equations with sixth and seventh order convergence. The new
   methods are obtained by composing known methods of third and fourth
   order with Newton's method and using an adequate approximation for the
   last derivative, which provides high order of convergence and reduces
   the required number of functional evaluations per step. The new methods
   attain efficiency indices of 1.5651 and 1.6266, which makes them
   competitive. We introduce a new efficiency index involving the
   computational effort as well as the functional evaluations per
   iteration. We use this new index, in combination with the usual
   efficiency index, in order to compare the methods described in the paper
   with other known methods and present several numerical tests. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Objective. The pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) has a strong
   genetic contribution. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal
   recessively inherited autoinflammatory disorder caused by MEFV gene
   missense variations, and a clinical association between FMF and AS has
   been reported previously. The aim of this study was to analyze the
   association of common MEFV variations (M694V, M680I, V726A, and E148Q)
   with AS in a group of Turkish patients.
   Methods. The study group comprised 193 patients with AS and 103 matched
   healthy control subjects. All individuals were genotyped for 4 MEFV
   variations and HLA-B27 using genomic DNA, and association of the
   variations with the clinical and laboratory features of the patients was
   analyzed.
   Results. The MEFV missense variations were significantly more frequent
   in patients with AS (22.3\%) compared with healthy control subjects
   (9.7\%; odds ratio {[}OR] 2.67, 95\% confidence interval {[}95\% CI]
   1.28-5.56). This difference was more prominent for exon 10 variations
   (M694V, V726A, M680I) (OR 3.75, 95\% CI 1.41-9.97), especially for the
   most-penetrant variation M694V (OR 4.73, 95\% CI 1.39-16.12). MEFV
   variations were more frequent in HLA-B27-negative patients with AS, and
   the difference was statistically significant in patients carrying exon
   10 variants.
   Conclusion. FMF-related MEFV variations are associated with AS, and
   these variations may contribute to the pathogenesis of AS, especially in
   populations in which the prevalence of FMF is high.}},

   0.20, prepared by using the so-called sol-gel method fallowed by a
   sealed quartz tube synthesis. The analyses of the synthesized products
   were performed by XRD, AFM, SEM and EDX methods. The results, obtained
   from the analyses of the XRD and EDX spectra or patterns, and the SEM
   and AFM images, indicate that the high-T-c Hg-(1223) and Hg-(1234)
   phases gradually disappear with increasing amounts of Ho. In addition it
   is observed that, Hg is excluded from the structure with the addition of
   Ho for Hg. As a result, it has been concluded that the high-T-c phases,
   Hg-(1223) and Hg-(1234), gradually disappear with increasing amount of
   Ho content, due to the exclusion of excess amount of Hg from the
   structures of the samples. This exclusion and observation may be
   attributed either to the quite different sizes of Ho and Hg ions or to
   the large HgO powders compared to the sol-gel powders and/or even to the
   sample preparation method used in this work.}},

Abstract = {{The extracellular matrix protein Pl-nectin, a 210-kDa homodimer
   originally purified from sea urchin eggs, plays a crucial role in cell
   adhesion and embryonic morphogenesis. The compiled cDNA sequence,
   obtained by RT-PCR primer walking and 3' RACE, identified a 984aa
   product containing a 23aa signal peptide and including all six internal
   peptides identified by protein microsequencing. The protein is a new
   member of the galactose-binding protein superfamily as it consists of
   six 151-156aa-long tandemly repeated domains (D1-D6), homologous to the
   discoidin-like domains, also known as F5/8-type C domains. Based on
   homology modelling, we present a three-dimensional structure (3D) for
   D5, identified as the prototype domain. The molecular modelling of the
   assembled Pl-nectin homodimer accounts for a Pl-nectin quaternary
   structure composed of two 105-kDa C-shaped monomers linked by a S-S
   bridge. The presence of an LDT motif between the first and the second
   exposed loops of the D2 domain suggests the binding of Pl-nectin to an
   integrin receptor. Altogether, the in silico analysis described here is
   consistent with previous biochemical reports and offers a basis for
   predictions to be experimentally tested.}},

Title = {{Species diversity and decomposition in laboratory aquatic systems: the

Abstract = {{P>1. Interest in the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes is
   increasing, stimulated by the global species decline. Different
   hypotheses about the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF)
   relationship have been put forward and various underlying mechanisms
   proposed for different ecosystems.
   2. We investigated BEF relationships and the role of species
   interactions in laboratory experiments focussing on aquatic
   decomposition. Species richness at three different trophic levels (leaf
   detritus, detritus-colonising fungi and invertebrate detritivores) was
   manipulated, and its effects on leaf mass loss and fungal growth were
   assessed in two experiments. In the first, monocultures and mixtures of
   reed (Phragmites australis), alder (Alnus glutinosa) and oak (Quercus
   cerris) leaf disks were incubated with zero, one or eight fungal
   species. Leaf mixtures were also incubated with combinations of three
   and five fungal species. In the second experiment, reed leaf disks were
   incubated with all eight fungal species and offered to combinations of
   one, two, three, four or five macroinvertebrate detritivores with
   different feeding modes.
   3. Results from the first experiment showed that leaf mass loss was
   directly related to fungal mass and varied unimodally with the number of
   fungi, with a maximum rate attained at intermediate diversity in oak and
   reed and at maximum diversity in alder (the fastest decomposing leaf).
   4. Mixing litter species stimulated fungal growth but interactions
   between species of fungi slowed down decomposition. In contrast,
   mixtures of macroinvertebrate detritivores reduced fungal mass and
   accelerated leaf decomposition. Possible explanations of the positive
   relationship between detritivore diversity and decomposition are a
   reduction in fungal dominance and a differentiation in the use of
   different resource patches promoted by higher fungal diversity.
   5. In conclusion, the results show a general increase in decomposition
   rate with increasing biodiversity that is controlled by within- and
   between-trophic level interactions, and support the hypothesis of both
   bottom-up and top-down effects of diversity on this process.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Panoramic Camera (PanCam) instrument will provide visible-near IR
   multispectral imaging of the ExoMars rover's surroundings to identify
   regions of interest within the nearby terrain. This multispectral
   capability is dependant upon the 12 preselected ``geological{''} filters
   that are integrated into two wide-angle cameras. First devised by the
   Imager for Mars Pathfinder team to detect iron oxides, this baseline
   filter set has remained largely unchanged for subsequent missions (Mars
   Exploration Rovers, Beagle 2, Phoenix) despite the advancing knowledge
   of the mineralogical diversity on Mars. Therefore, the geological
   filters for the ExoMars PanCam will be redesigned to accommodate the
   astrobiology focus of ExoMars, where hydrated mineral terrains (evidence
   of past liquid water) will be priority targets. Here, we conduct an
   initial investigation into new filter wavelengths for the ExoMars PanCam
   and present results from tests performed on Mars analog rocks. Two new
   filter sets were devised: one with filters spaced every 50nm
   ({''}F1-12{''}) and another that utilizes a novel filter selection
   method based upon hydrated mineral reflectance spectra ({''}F2-12{''}).
   These new filter sets, along with the Beagle 2 filter set (currently the
   baseline for the ExoMars PanCam), were tested on their ability to
   identify hydrated minerals and biosignatures present in Mars analog
   rocks. The filter sets, with varying degrees of ability, detected the
   spectral features of minerals jarosite, opaline silica, alunite,
   nontronite, and siderite present in these rock samples. None of the
   filter sets, however, were able to detect fossilized biomat structures
   and small (<2mm) mineralogical heterogeneities present in silica
   sinters. Both new filter sets outperformed the Beagle 2 filters, with
   F2-12 detecting the most spectral features produced by hydrated minerals
   and providing the best discrimination between samples. Future work
   involving more extensive testing on Mars analog samples that exhibit a
   wider range of mineralogies would be the next step in carefully
   evaluating the new filter sets.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel cosmological scenario, in which standard inflation is
   replaced by an expanding phase with a drastic violation of the Null
   Energy Condition (NEC):. H >> H-2. The model is based on the recently
   introduced Galileon theories, which allow NEC violating solutions
   without instabilities. The unperturbed solution describes a Universe
   that is asymptotically Minkowski in the past, expands with increasing
   energy density until it exits the regime of validity of the effective
   field theory and reheats. This solution is a dynamical attractor and the
   Universe is driven to it, even if it is initially contracting. The study
   of perturbations of the Galileon field reveals some subtleties, related
   to the gross violation of the NEC and it shows that adiabatic
   perturbations are cosmologically irrelevant. The model, however,
   suggests a new way to produce a scale invariant spectrum of isocurvature
   perturbations, which can later be converted to adiabatic: the Galileon
   is forced by symmetry to couple to the other fields as a dilaton; the
   effective metric it yields on the NEC violating solution is that of de
   Sitter space, so that all light scalars will automatically acquire a
   nearly scale-invariant spectrum of perturbations.}},

Abstract = {{Reactions of hydride complexes of ruthenium(II) with hydride acceptors
   have been examined for Ru(terpy)(bpy)H+, Ru(terpy)(dmb)H+, and
   Ru(eta(6)-C6Me6)(bpy)(H)(+) in aqueous media at 25 degrees C (terpy =
   2,2';6',2 `'-terpyridine, bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine, dmb =
   4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine). The acceptors include CO2, CO, CH2O, and
   H3O+.CO reacts with Ru(terpy)(dmb)H+ with a rate constant of 1.2 (0.2) x
   10(1) M-1 s(-1), but for Ru(eta(6)-C6Me6)(bpy)(H)(+), the reaction was
   very slow, k <= 0.1 M-1 s(-1) Ru(terpy)(bpy)H+ and
   Ru(eta(6)-C6Me6)(bpy)(H)(+) react with CH2O with rate constants of (6
   +/- 4) x 10(6) and 1.1 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1), respectively. The reaction of
   Ru(eta(6)-C6Me6)(bpy)(H)(+) with acid exhibits straightforward,
   second-order kinetics, with the rate proportional to
   {[}Ru(eta(6)-C6Me6)(bpy)(H)(+)] and {[}H3O] and k = 2.2 x 10(1) M-1
   s(-1) (mu = 0.1 M, Na2SO4 medium). However, for the case of
   Ru(terpy)(bpy)(H)(+), the protonation step is very rapid, and only the
   formation of the product Ru(terpy)(bpy)(H2O)(2+) (presumably via a
   dihydrogen or dihydride complex) is observed with a k(obs) of ca 4
   s(-1). The hydricities of HCO2-, HCO-, and H3CO- in water are estimated
   as +1.48, -0.76, and +1.57 eV/molecule (+34, -17.5, +36 kcal/mol),
   respectively. Theoretical studies of the reactions with CO2 reveal a
   ``product-like{''} transition state with short C-H and long M-H
   distances. (Reactant) Ru-H stretched 0.68 angstrom (product) C-H
   stretched only 0.04 angstrom. The role of water solvent was explored by
   including one, two, or three water molecules in the calculation.}},

   particle fluences. Diamond is a particularly radiation hard material and
   exhibits further properties that makes it an attractive material for

   pixel detectors. While the quality of the poly-crystalline diamond
   samples is constantly increasing and the feasibility of producing wafers
   has been demonstrated, recently a single-crystal diamond pixel detector
   has been assembled and characterized in a 100 GeV particle beam at CERN.

Abstract = {{The ATLAS ReadOut System (ROS) receives data fragments from similar to
   1600 detector readout links, buffers them and provides them on demand to
   the second-level trigger or to the event building system. The ROS is
   implemented with similar to 150 PCs. Each PC houses a few, typically 4,
   custom-built PCI boards (ROBIN) and a 4-port PCIe Gigabit Ethernet NIC.
   The PCs run a multi-threaded object-oriented application managing the
   requests for data retrieval and for data deletion coming through the
   NIC, and the collection and output of data from the ROBINs. At a nominal
   event fragment arrival rate of 75 kHz the ROS has to concurrently
   service up to approximately 20 kHz of data requests from the
   second-level trigger and up to 3.5 kHz of requests from event building
   nodes. The full system has been commissioned in 2007. Performance of the
   system in terms of stability and reliability, results of laboratory rate
   capability measurements and upgrade scenarios are discussed in this

Abstract = {{A bacterial consortium able to degrade the herbicide
   4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) butyric acid (2,4-DB) was obtained from an
   agricultural soil of the Argentinean Humid Pampa region which has a
   history of long-term herbicide use. Four bacterial strains were isolated
   from the consortium and identified as members of the genera Cupriavidus,
   Labrys and Pseudomonas. A polyphasic systematic analysis was carried out
   on strain CPDB6(T), the member of the 2,4-DB-degrading consortium able
   to degrade 2,4-DB as a sole carbon and energy source. The Gram-negative,
   rod-shaped, motile, non-sporulating, non-fermenting bacterium was shown
   to belong to the genus Cupriavidus on the basis of 16S rRNA gene
   sequence analyses. Strain CPDB6(T) did not reduce nitrate, which
   differentiated it from the type species of the genus, Cupriavidus
   necator; it did not grow in 0.5-4.5 \% NaCl, although most species of
   Cupriavidus are able to grow at NaCl concentrations as high as 1.5 \%;
   and it was able to deamidate acetamide, which differentiated it from all
   other species of Cupriavidus. DNA-DNA hybridization data revealed low
   levels of genomic DNA similarity (less than 30 \%) between strain
   CPDB6(T) and the type strains of Cupriavidus species with validly
   published names. The major cellular fatty acids detected were
   cis-9-hexadecenoic (16 : 1 omega 7c) and hexadecanoic (16 : 0) acids. On
   the basis of phenotypic and genotypic characterizations, strain CPDB6(T)
   was recognized as a representative of a novel species within the genus
   Cupriavidus. The name Cupriavidus pampae sp. nov. is proposed, with
   strain CPDB6(T) (=CCUG 55948(T)=CCM-A-29:1289(T)) as the type strain.}},

   or lymphadenopathy on preoperative imaging or intraoperative palpation
   were exclusion criteria.
   Results. A total of 211 patients underwent SLN mapping. Of these, 165
   patients (78\%) were female and 46 (22\%) were male. Also, 75 (36\%)
   were <= 45 years of age, and 136 (64\%) were older than 45. Tumors were
   <= 2.0 cm (T1) in 142 patients (67\%), 2-4 cm (T2) in 35 patients
   (17\%), >4 cm with minimal invasion (T3) in 32 patients (15\%), and
   locally invasive (T4) in 2 patients (1\%). At least 1 blue node was
   found in 192 patients (91\%). Also, 47 patients had a positive SLN on
   frozen section, with an additional 24 node-positive patients on
   permanent section, for a total of 71 (37\%). There were 43 patients
   (91\%) who underwent central neck dissection; 26 (60\%) had additional
   metastases.
   Conclusions. Sentinel lymphadenectomy for papillary thyroid carcinoma is
   feasible, safe, and can identify patients who may benefit from central
   neck dissection.}},

Abstract = {{A brief search in Sci Finder for oxalic acid and oxalates will reward
   the researcher with a staggering 129,280 hits. However, the generation
   of alkali metal and silver anions via collision-induced dissociation of
   the metal oxalate anion has not been previously been reported, though
   Tian and coworkers recently investigated the dissociation of lithium
   oxalate {[}18]. The exothermic decomposition of alkali metal oxalate
   anion to carbon dioxide in the collision cell of a triple quadrupole
   mass spectrometer leaves no place for the electron to reside, resulting
   in a double electron-transfer reaction to produce an alkali metal anion.
   This reaction is facilitated by the negative electron affinity of carbon
   dioxide and, as such, the authors believe that metal oxalates are
   potentially unique in this respect. The observed dissociation reactions
   for collision with argon gas (1.7-1.8 x 10(-3) mbar) for oxalic acid and
   various alkali metal oxalates are discussed and summarized. Silver
   oxalate is also included to demonstrate the propensity of this system to
   generate transition-metal anions, as well. (J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 2010,

Abstract = {{It has recently been demonstrated that air bubbles released from a
   nozzle are excited into volume mode oscillations by the collapse of the
   neck of air formed at the moment of bubble detachment. A pulse of sound
   is caused by these breathing mode oscillations, and the sound of
   air-entraining flows is made up of many such pulses emitted as bubbles
   are created. This paper is an elaboration on a JASA-EL paper, which
   examined the acoustical excitation of bubbles released from a nozzle.
   Here, further details of the collapse of a neck of air formed at the
   moment of bubble formation and its implications for the emission of
   sound by newly formed bubbles are presented. The role of fluid surface
   tension was studied using high-speed photography and found to be
   consistent with a simple model for neck collapse. A re-entrant fluid jet
   forms inside the bubble just after detachment, and its role in acoustic
   excitation is assessed. It is found that for slowly-grown bubbles the
   jet does make a noticeable difference to the total volume decrease
   during neck collapse, but that it is not a dominant effect in the
   overall acoustic excitation. (C) 2010 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract = {{The real-time polymerase chain reaction has been applied for the
   specific detection and quantification of goat's milk adulteration with
   cows' milk. Beside cow-specific primers a primer pair targeting
   conserved regions in goats and cow's mitochondrial genomes was used to
   normalize the total quantity of DNA. The method has been shown to be
   highly specific, as the cow 300-bp amplicon was observed only in the
   presence of cow's milk and in mixtures of cow and goat milk-derived DNA.
   The usefulness of the primers used for normalization was confirmed with
   a dilution series of goat's milk containing cow's milk, showing that the
   results were not influenced by dilution of the DNA template. The
   standard curve with an R-2 value of better than 0.99 allows the
   quantification of cow milk addition in the range of 0.5-100\%.
   The study presents also the high influence of heat treatment and somatic
   cell count on cow's milk quantification.
   The method was applied to assess the quality of UHT goat's milk in the
   years 2005 and 2009. Significant improvement in goat's milk quality was
   observed, what may be related to the tightening of quality control
   measurements introduced in Polish dairies in recent years. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{During the period of 2007-2008, a total of 270 pig fecal samples were
   collected from a meat processing plant located in southern Japan and
   examined for Salmonella species. A total of 44 Salmonella isolates were
   recovered, and antimicrobial resistance was detected in serotypes
   Typhimurium (n=9), Infantis and Choleraesuis (n=2), and Derby, Miyazaki
   and Schwarzengrund (n=1). Multidrug resistance was seen in serotypes
   Typhimurium (n=8) and Infantis (n=2). The most commonly observed
   resistance phenotypes were against streptomycin, oxytetracycline and
   sulfamethoxazole (100\%), ampicillin (90\%), chloramphenicol (50\%),
   cephalothin (30\%) and cefoxitin, celtazidime and kanamycin (each 20\%).
   Extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Salmonella Infantis isolates
   producing plasmid-mediated, bla(CMY-2) gene were detected. These
   AmpC-producing isolates showed resistance to ampicillin and cephems
   (cephalothin, cefoxitin and ceftazidime). Resistance transfer
   experiments showed that transconjugants and transformants coexpressed
   resistance phenotypes similar to the donor isolates. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first report worldwide describing serovar
   Infantis from pigs capable of producing AmpC beta-lactamase. Then, we
   detected the pentadrug-resistance phenotype in Salmonella Typhimurium
   isolates, which yielded class I integron amplicons of 1.0 and 1.2 kb.
   Genetic fingerprinting analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and
   an assay by polymerase chain reaction confirmed the isolates to be
   Salmonella Typhimurium DT104. In conclusion, the findings of this survey
   call for the systematic and comprehensive domestic and international
   surveillance programs to determine the true rates of occurrence of
   AmpC-producing Salmonella both in the livestock and public health
   sectors.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to perform a comparative assessment of microleakage in
   Class V cavities among five different composite resins For this purpose
   100 fresh caries-free human permanent molars were randomly assigned to
   one of five groups (n=20) Clearfil Majesty Esthetic + Clearfil S3 Bond
   (Group I) TPH Spectrum + Xeno V (Group II) Gradia Direct Anterior + G
   Bond (GC) (Group III) Premise + Optibond All in One (Group IV) and
   Charisma + iBond (Group V) were applied and polymerized under LED
   Specimens were varnished immersed in 0 5\% methylene and sectioned
   bucco-palatinally/lingually and microleakage scores were determined
   Gingival and occlusal microleakage scores among groups were
   statistically significant (p < 0 05) (p=0 043 p=0 005) Occlusal
   microleakage scores for Clearfil Majesty Esthetic and Premise were lower
   than in the other groups Charisma had the highest microleakage scores
   with no difference among the other groups (p > 0 05)
   In conclusion occlusal and gingival microleakage scores were
   satisfactory except for Charisma}},

Abstract = {{C1 inhibitor (C1INH) is a serpin that regulates both complement and
   contact (kallikrein kinin) system activation It consists of a serpin do
   main that is highly homologous to other serpins and an amino terminal
   non serpin mum like domain Deficiency of C1INH results in hereditary
   angioedema a disease characterised by episodes of angioedema of the skin
   or the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract or the oropharynx AI though
   early data suggested that angioedema was mediated via corn plement
   system activation the preponderance of the data indicate that bradykinin
   is the mediator In the past few years, it has become apparent that C1INH
   has additional anti inflammatory functions independent of protease
   inhibition These include interactions with leukocytes that may result in
   enhanced phagocytosis with endothelial cells via E and P selectins that
   interfere with leukocyte rolling and in turn results in suppression of
   transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelium and interactions
   with extracellular matrix components that may serve to concentrate C1INH
   at sites of inflammation In addition C1INH sup presses gram negative
   sepsis and endotoxin shock, partly via direct interaction with endotoxin
   that interferes with its interaction with macro phages thereby
   suppressing tumour necrosis factor a and other in flammatory mediators
   C1INH treatment improves outcome in a number of disease models including
   sepsis and other bacterial infections possibly malaria, ischaemia
   reperfusion injury (intestinal, he patic muscle cardiac, brain), hyper
   acute transplant rejection and other inflammatory disease models Recent
   data suggest that this effectiveness is the result of mechanisms that do
   not require protease inhibition in addition to both complement and
   contact system activation}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To report the incidence and management of intraoperative
   complications while using the IntraLase FS femtosecond laser (Abbott

   METHODS: A prospective log of intraoperative flap creation complications
   using the femtosecond laser was maintained over 3009 consecutive LASIK
   surgeries from August 2002 through July 2009.
   RESULTS: Eleven (0.37\%) intraoperative complications occurred. Eight
   suction breaks occurred, seven of which were treated with reapplication
   of the laser, the other by completing the side-cut with surgical
   dissection. One case of incomplete flap creation was treated with
   surgical dissection. Two cases of adherent flap were treated with
   reapplication of laser energy and surgical dissection. All surgeries
   were completed successfully during the same operative session.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative complications during flap creation are
   minor, infrequent, and can be managed effectively within the same
   surgical session. {[}J Refract Surg. 2010; 26(11): 851-857.]

Abstract = {{Due to differences in definitions and measurement methods, cross-country
   comparisons of international migration patterns are difficult and
   confusing. Emigration numbers reported by sending countries tend to
   differ from the corresponding immigration numbers reported by receiving
   countries. In this paper, a methodology is presented to achieve
   harmonised estimates of migration flows benchmarked to a specific
   definition of duration. This methodology accounts for both differences
   in definitions and the effects of measurement error due to, for example,
   under reporting and sampling fluctuations. More specifically, the
   differences between the two sets of reported data are overcome by
   estimating a set of adjustment factors for each country's immigration
   and emigration data. The adjusted data take into account any special
   cases where the origin-destination patterns do not match the overall
   patterns. The new method for harmonising migration flows that we present
   is based on earlier efforts by Poulain (European Journal of Population,
   9(4): 353-381 1993, Working Paper 12, joint ECE-Eurostat Work Session on
   Migration Statistics, Geneva, Switzerland 1999) and is illustrated for
   movements between 19 European countries from 2002 to 2007. The results
   represent a reliable and consistent set of international migration flows
   that can be used for understanding recent changes in migration patterns,
   as inputs into population projections and for developing evidence-based
   migration policies.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To determine infectious causes in patients with uveitis of
   unknown origin by intraocular fluids analysis.
   DESIGN: Case-control study.
   METHODS: Ocular fluids from 139 patients suspected of infectious
   uveitis, but negative for herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus,
   cytomegalovirus, and Toxoplasma gondii by polymerase chain reaction
   and/or antibody analysis in intraocular fluids, were assessed for the
   presence of 18 viruses and 3 bacteria by real-time polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR). The ocular fluids from 48 patients with uveitis of known
   etiology or with cataract were included as controls.
   RESULTS: Positive PCR results were found for Epstein-Barr virus, for
   rubella virus, and for human herpesvirus 6 each in 1 patient and for
   human parechovirus in 4 patients. Of the human parechovirus-positive
   patients, 1 was immunocompromised and had panuveitis. The other 3
   patients were immunocompetent and had anterior uveitis, all with corneal
   involvement.
   CONCLUSIONS: Human parechovirus might be associated with infectious
   (kerato)uveitis. (Am J Ophthalmol 2010;150:628-636. (C) 2010 by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Global sustainable development depends on the capacity of natural,
   social and economic systems to adapt to external stimuli. However,
   building this adaptive capacity in the developing world context of
   sub-Saharan Africa will require substantial investment in these systems,
   which most countries in this region simply cannot afford. Given that
   their social, economic and environmental security depends on
   developments in developing countries, we argue that developed countries
   should assume a leading role in making such investments in developing
   countries, in order to secure their own long-term well-being. This will
   require cooperative governance between developed and developing
   countries, and targeted investment in a number of key areas. This calls
   for a new global contract between rich and poor nations in order to
   achieve global stability and sustainability. Copyright (C) 2009 John

Abstract = {{Silicon (Si) accumulation in organs and cells is one of the most
   prominent characteristics of plants of the family Poaceae. Many species
   from this family are used as forage plants for animal feeding. The
   present study investigates in Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.)
   Stapf. cv. Marandu: (1) the dry matter production and Si content in
   shoot due to soil Si fertilizations; (2) the Si distribution among shoot
   parts; and (3) the silica deposition and localization in leaves. Plants
   of B. brizantha cv. Marandu were grown under contrasting Si supplies in
   soil and nutrient solution. Silica deposition and distribution in grass
   leaf blades were observed using light microscope and scanning electron
   microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer
   (SEM-EDXS). Silicon concentration in the B. brizantha shoot increased
   according to the Si supply. Silicon in grass leaves decreased following
   the order: mature leaf blades > recently expanded leaf blades >
   non-expanded leaf blades. Silicon accumulates mainly on the upper
   (adaxial) epidermis of the grass leaf blades and, especially, on the
   bulliform cells. The Si distribution on adaxial leaf blade surface is
   non uniform and reflects a silica deposition exclusively on the cell
   wall of bulliform cells.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the clinimetric properties of the de Morton
   Mobility Index (DEMMI) in a Geriatric Evaluation and Management (GEM)
   population.
   Design: A longitudinal validation study (n=100) and inter-rater
   reliability study (n=29) in a GEM population.
   Patients: Consecutive patients admitted to a GEM rehabilitation ward
   were eligible for inclusion.
   Methods: At hospital admission and discharge, a physical therapist
   assessed patients with physical performance instruments that included
   the 6-metre walk test, step test, Clinical Test of Sensory Organization
   and Balance, Timed Up and Go test, 6-minute walk test and the DEMMI.
   Consecutively eligible patients were included in an inter-rater
   reliability study between physical therapists.
   Results: DEMMI admission scores were normally distributed (mean 30.2,
   standard deviation 16.7) and other activity limitation instruments had
   either a floor or a ceiling effect. Evidence of convergent, discriminant
   and known groups validity for the DEMMI were obtained. The minimal
   detectable change with 90\% confidence was 10.5 (95\% confidence
   interval 6.1-17.9) points and the minimally clinically important
   difference was 8.4 points on the 100-point interval DEMMI scale.
   Conclusion: The DEMMI provides clinicians with an accurate and valid
   method of measuring mobility for geriatric patients in the subacute
   hospital setting.}},

   factors were obtained from the Simapro 7.1.8. software and other

   our study was 1:5.37. In comparison the range for the other studies is

Abstract = {{Recently we presented a method for the assessment of in vivo forces on
   pectoral device implants motivated from technological and clinical
   advancements toward smaller implantable cardiac pacemakers and the
   altered structural demands arising from the reduced device size.
   Objective of this study was the investigation of the intra-species
   proportionality of in-line force and transverse reaction force of the
   Pectoralis major for the characterization of mechanical in vivo loadings
   on pectoral implants. Two Chacma baboons (23.9 +/- A 1.2 kg) received
   bilaterally one chronic and one acute pectoral sub-muscular instrumented
   pacemaker (IPM) implant. The Pectoralis major muscle was electrically
   stimulated and resulting in-line and transverse muscle force were
   measured. The correlation of in-line force and transverse force of the
   Pectoralis major was investigated using linear regression analyses. The
   proportionality of in-line and transverse force of the Pectoralis major
   was found to be subject-specific (R (2) = 0.17, p < 0.003). Including
   morphometric parameters, i.e., length along line of action, width over
   implant and stress, in the regression analysis provided a strong
   intra-species correlation between in-line and transverse force (R (2) =
   0.71, p < 10(-7)). The novel intra-species correlation provides a tool
   toward the characterization of mechanical in vivo loading conditions of
   pectoral device implants.}},

   and imbalance between phases. Improvement of the energetic performances
   of an EAF imposes a careful technical and economical analysis. The
   static voltampere reactive compensator solution is the best one for
   compensating the reactive energy and increasing the power factor but has
   the highest costs. Also, we evaluate existing processes' equipment
   performance, the point of improvement opportunities for the best

Abstract = {{The concern with the volume of waste has generated interest in the
   development of biodegradable packaging able to replace, at least in
   part, the conventional synthetic plastics, such as packs of expanded
   polystyrene (Isopor). This study aimed to characterize the expansion

   (WSI) and color (coordinates L{*}, a{*} and b{*}) of expanded
   biodegradable composites produced by extrusion, from the mixture cassava
   starch, glycerol (plasticizer) and two different types of vegetable
   fibres. The composites were prepared in a single screw extruder, with
   three different levels of oat or sugar cane fibres (0, 5 and 10 g/100 g
   starch), two levels of humidity (18 and 26\%) and a fixed level of
   glycerol (20 g/100 g solds). The addition of fibres did not affect
   significantly the expansion index, density and WAI of materials, and
   reduced WSI of products, which is an advantage and promotes the use of
   these fibres in the reinforcement of composites. The addition of fibers
   led to the darkening of the samples, with decrease in lightness (L{*})
   and increase in the values of the color parameters a{*} and b{*}. This
   study is a key step for a future industrial scale production of these
   composites, which requires process conditions that provide reproducible
   results of expansion and absorption capacity and solubility in water,
   properties of great importance in these products.}},

Abstract = {{Background Apoptosis of cardiac myocytes plays a key role in the
   pathogenesis of many cardiac diseases including viral myocarditis The
   apoptotic signaling pathways that are activated during viral myocarditis
   and the role that these pathways play in disease pathogenesis have not
   been clearly delineated
   Methods and Results We investigated the role of apoptotic signaling
   pathways after virus infection of primary cardiac myocytes The death
   receptor associated initiator caspase, caspase 8 and the effector
   caspase caspase 3, were significantly activated after infection of
   primary cardiac myocytes with myocarditic but not non-myocarditic
   reovirus strains Furthermore reovirus-induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis
   was significantly inhibited by soluble death receptors In contrast, the
   mitochondrial membrane potential remained unaltered and caspase 9 the
   initiator caspase associated with mitochondrial apoptotic signaling was
   only weakly activated in cardiac myocytes after infection with
   myocarditic reovirus strains Inhibition of mitochondrial apoptotic
   signaling had no effect on reovirus-induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis In
   accordance with our in vitro data caspase 8 but not caspase 9 was
   significantly activated in the hearts of reovirus infected mice
   Conclusions Death receptor, but not mitochondrial apoptotic signaling
   plays a key role in apoptosis after infection of cardiac myocytes with

Abstract = {{The Arcachon lagoon is a 156 km(2) temperate mesotidal lagoon dominated
   by tidal flats (66\% of the surface area). The methane (CH4) sources,
   sinks and fluxes were estimated from water and pore water
   concentrations, from chamber flux measurements at the sediment air (low
   tide), sediment-water and water-air (high tide) interfaces, and from
   potential oxidation and production rate measurements in sediments. CH4
   concentrations in waters were maximal (500-1000 nmol l(-1)) in river
   waters and in tidal creeks at low tide, and minimal in the lagoon at
   high tide (<50 nmol l(-1)). The major CH4 sources are continental waters
   and the tidal pumping of sediment pore waters at low tide.
   Methanogenesis occurred in the tidal flat sediments, in which pore water
   concentrations were relatively high (2.5-8.0 mu mol l(-1)) Nevertheless,
   the sediment was a minor CH4 source for the water column and the
   atmosphere because of a high degree of anaerobic and aerobic CH4
   oxidation in sediments. Atmospheric CH4 fluxes at high and low tide were
   low compared to freshwater wetlands. Temperate tidal lagoons appear to
   be very minor contributor of CH4 to global atmosphere and to open ocean.

Abstract = {{For achieving realistic numerical simulations of bowed string
   instruments, based on physical modeling, a good understanding of the
   actual friction interaction phenomena is of great importance. Most work
   published in the field including our own has assumed that bow/string
   frictional forces behave according to the classical Coulomb stick-slip
   model, with an empirical velocity-dependent sliding friction
   coefficient. Indeed, the basic self-excited string motions (such as the
   Helmholtz regime) are well captured using such friction model. However,
   recent work has shown that the tribological behavior of the bow/string
   rosin interface is rather complex, therefore the basic
   velocity-dependent Coulomb model may be an over-simplistic
   representation of the friction force. More specifically, it was
   suggested that a more accurate model of the interaction force can be
   achieved by coupling the system dynamical equations with a thermal model
   which encapsulates the complex interface phenomena. In spite of the
   interesting work performed by Askenfelt {[}32], a direct measurement of
   the actual dynamical friction forces without disturbing the string
   motion is quite difficult. Therefore, in this work we develop a
   modal-based identification technique making use of inverse methods and
   optimization techniques, which enables the identification of the
   interface force, as well as the string self-excited motion, from the
   dynamical reactions measured at the string end supports. The method
   gives convincing results using simulated data originated from nonlinear
   computations of a bowed string. Furthermore, in cases where the force
   identifications are very sensitive to errors in the transfer function
   modal parameters, we suggest a method to improve the modal frequencies
   used for the identifications. Preliminary experimental results obtained
   using a basic bowing device, by which the string is excited with the
   stick of the bow, are then presented. Our identifications, from the two
   dynamical string reactions, are consistent as attested by the comparison
   of the two available versions of the string dynamical motion and of the
   friction force. Furthermore, the method seems adequate to investigate
   the interface force for the bowed string. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Cortisol Awakening Response and Hippocampal Volume: Vulnerability for

Abstract = {{Background: Major depressive disorder is associated with dysregulated
   basal cortisol levels and small hippocampal (HC) volume. However, it is
   still debated whether these phenomena are a consequence of the illness
   or whether they may represent a vulnerability marker existing before the
   illness onset. Here, we aimed to examine this notion of vulnerability by
   assessing whether abnormalities in basal cortisol secretion and HC
   volumes are already present in a sample of healthy young adults who
   showed varying levels of depressive tendencies, but at subclinical
   levels.
   Methods: We recruited healthy young men and women from the local
   university. On the basis of depression scores derived from standard
   questionnaires, three groups were formed: a control group (n = 27), a
   subclinical group (n = 23), and a high-risk subclinical group (n = 9).
   The participants underwent a magnetic resonance imaging scan and
   collected saliva samples for the assessment of diurnal cortisol levels.
   Results: Both the subclinical and the high-risk subclinical group failed
   to show a significant increase in cortisol levels after awakening. The
   high-risk subclinical group also showed a lower area-under-the-curve
   increase of cortisol levels after awakening compared with control
   subjects. In addition, this group also had smaller total HC volume
   compared with control subjects.
   Conclusions: The findings from this subclinical sample suggest that
   dysregulated cortisol awakening response and small HC volume may
   constitute vulnerability factors for major depressive disorder. Further
   investigations are needed to discern the mechanisms that may underlie
   these phenomena.}},

   increased levels of internal job insecurity experienced by `atypical'

Abstract = {{Objective. - To review the definitions and classifications of chronic
   pelvic and perinea( pain and to describe the concepts of chronic pelvic
   and perineal pain syndrome and the global diagnostic and aetiopathogenic
   approach.
   Material and methods. - A review of the literature was performed by
   searching the Medline database (National Library of Medicine). Search
   terms were either medical subject heading (MeSH) keywords
   (classification, complex regional pain syndrome, fibromyalgia,
   myofascial pain syndrome, neuralgia, pelvic pain, postoperative pain,
   prostatitis, referred pain, syndrome) or terms derived from the title or
   abstract. Search terms were used alone or in combinations by using the
   ``AND{''} operator. The literature search was conducted from 1990 to the
   present time.
   Results. - Chronic pelvic and perineal pain does not only consist of
   symptoms localized to an anatomical region present for 3 to 6 months,
   but also constitutes a distinct, complex, multidimensional disease
   entity, comprising psychological, organic and psychosomatic phenomena,
   called chronic pelvic and perineal pain syndromes. These syndromes are
   responsible for disability, impaired quality of life, and induce
   considerable health care consumption and sick leave. They alter the
   patient's personality and affect his or her behaviour, sex life, family
   life, social life and work life. The usual clinical approach to these
   syndromes, looking for an organ or tissue disease responsible for pain,
   is negative. The approach to this type of pain must be much more global
   and consists of looking for disturbances of the regulation of pelvic and
   perineal nociceptive messages and dysfunction of the organ or structure
   concerned.
   Conclusion. - The current definitions and classifications of chronic
   pelvic and perineal pain comprise the concepts of syndrome, functional
   disease and global approach and differ from the strict organ-based
   context and the classical medical approach (infectious, inflammatory,
   metabolic, endocrine) in order to focus pain syndromes on the pain
   itself and the associated symptoms. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: The androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a disease
   connected with the inactivation of AR due to a mutation that inactivate
   male sexual differentiation, and causes a spectrum of phenotypic
   anomalies having as a common aspect the loss of reproductive
   characteristics.
   Patients: In this paper the clinical, endocrino-logical and molecular
   features of three patients are reported. The first case concerns a 17
   years old patient, the second an infant suffering from inguinal hernia
   that has been surgically corrected when he was 3 months old and finally
   the third case concerns a 57 years old woman.
   Results: All the subjects had a common primary amenorrhea and a
   following pelvic echography highlighted the absence of internal genital
   organs and the presence of a dead-end vagina. All the patients are
   characterized by a normal male karyotype and present on the short arm of
   the Y chromosome the SRY gene. Moreover, FISH revealed the presence of
   androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome and the SRY gene on the Y
   one.
   The automatic sequencing of the genes for the androgen receptor (AR)
   shows that each subject has a mutation in the gene for the androgen
   receptor (AR). These mutations are associated with complete androgen
   insensivity syndrome (CAIS). All the cases of study exhibited a negative
   family history for CAIS.
   Conclusion: This study confirms the need to perform a pelvic examination
   by means of echography in pre-pubertal and pubertal age to highlight the
   normality of the internal genitalia (uterus and ovaries). If a primary
   amenorrhea is checked, the karyotyping is compulsory.
   If a Morris's syndrome is suspected, it is of critical importance to
   find the rudimentary male gonads (by means of MRI, pelvic echography,
   laparoscopy) and surgically remove them to prevent the onset of
   malignancies (teratoblastoma, gonadoblastoma). Once the considered
   disease has been identified, a continuous psychological help can be
   considered useful for the patient and the family.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The aim of this study was (i) to characterise differentially
   expressed proteins in cervico-vaginal fluid (CVF) at the time of preterm
   labour onset and (ii) to confirm these studies in human CVF samples
   taken from women before and during spontaneous labour
   Study design Preterm labour was induced in sheep (n = 5) via fetal
   dexamethasone infusion (1 mg/24 h) CVF samples were taken prior to
   dexamethasone infusion (0 h) 28 h after the start of dexamethasone
   infusion and immediately prior to delivery Two-dimensional gel
   electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) were used to identify
   differentially expressed proteins For the human studies paired CVF
   samples were taken 5-9 days before labour and during spontaneous labour
   onset (n = 7)
   Results There was a 4 2-fold increase in alpha-enolase protein
   expression in sheep CVF dunng labour Likewise a-enolase protein
   expression was significantly increased during spontaneous human labour
   at term
   Conclusions Alpha-enolase is known to be bound to neutrophils and
   interact in the immune response and thus may play a role in inflammation

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In sessile marine organisms, gene flow between populations depends
   mainly on free-living reproductive stages (such as larvae and gametes),
   and usually the strength of genetic structure is related to the time
   spent in the plankton and physical factors as oceanographic conditions.
   In Antarctica, abyssal depths that surround the continent and the Polar
   Front are considered strong barriers for benthic marine fauna, keeping
   the continent isolated from other shelves. The only available shallow
   water habitats between South America and the Antarctic continent are
   those around the Scotia Arc Islands; there are no shallow water habitats
   between the other southern continents and Antarctica. In this work,
   ISSRs-PCR markers were used to study the genetic structure of
   populations of Aplidium falklandicum, a compound ascidian with
   short-lived lecitotrophic larvae. A highly significant genetic
   differentiation (I broken vertical bar(ST) = 0.405; P < 0.05) and a
   pattern of isolation by distance were found. A genetic landscape
   approach identified a discontinuity in genetic diversity, coincident
   with the southernmost registered position of the Polar Front. For A.
   falklandicum, a species with presumably low capacity of long distance
   dispersal, the abyssal depths together with the large geographic
   distances create a barrier for gene flow.}},

Title = {{RACK-1 Acts with Rac GTPase Signaling and UNC-115/abLIM in
   Caenorhabditis elegans Axon Pathfinding and Cell Migration}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Migrating cells and growth cones extend lamellipodial and filopodial
   protrusions that are required for outgrowth and guidance. The mechanisms
   of cytoskeletal regulation that underlie cell and growth cone migration
   are of much interest to developmental biologists. Previous studies have
   shown that the Arp2/3 complex and UNC-115/abLIM act redundantly to
   mediate growth cone lamellipodia and filopodia formation and axon
   pathfinding. While much is known about the regulation of Arp2/3, less is
   known about regulators of UNC-115/abLIM. Here we show that the
   Caenorhabditis elegans counterpart of the Receptor for Activated C
   Kinase (RACK-1) interacts physically with the actin-binding protein
   UNC-115/abLIM and that RACK-1 is required for axon pathfinding. Genetic
   interactions indicate that RACK-1 acts cell-autonomously in the
   UNC-115/abLIM pathway in axon pathfinding and lamellipodia and filopodia
   formation, downstream of the CED-10/Rac GTPase and in parallel to
   MIG-2/RhoG. Furthermore, we show that RACK-1 is involved in migration of
   the gonadal distal tip cells and that the signaling pathways involved in
   this process might be distinct from those involved in axon pathfinding.
   In sum, these studies pinpoint RACK-1 as a component of a novel
   signaling pathway involving Rac GTPases and UNC-115/abLIM and suggest
   that RACK-1 might be involved in the regulation of the actin
   cytoskeleton and lamellipodia and filopodia formation in migrating cells
   and growth cones.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to find out the relationship
   between Malnutrition-Inflammation score (MIS) and the endothelial
   function parameters, including measurements of flow-mediated
   vasodilatation (FMD) in the brachial artery and serum vascular cell
   adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Furthermore, predictors of FMD were also
   assessed.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 70 anuric hemodialysis patients were
   enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Measurements of FMD, serum
   VCAM-1, oxidized low density lipoprotein cholesterol (oxLDL) were done
   before the mid-week dialysis session from all participants at the time
   of MIS calculation. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to MIS
   (the MIS was <= 4 in group I, 4 < and <= 7 in group II, and > 7 in group
   III) and compared for above parameters.
   Results: Patients with higher MIS had higher serum high sensitive
   C-reactive protein, oxLDL and VCAM-1 levels whereas these patients had
   lower serum albumin, hemoglobin levels, and FMD rates. MIS was
   positively correlated with high sensitive C-reactive protein, oxLDL and
   VCAM-1 levels. However, there was a negative correlation between MIS and
   FMD. MIS and oxLDL were found as an independent significant predictors
   of FMD (P = .014 and P = .018, respectively) in a multivariate analysis.
   Conclusions: MIS is a useful tool in prediction of the severity of
   endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, decrease in MIS by the modifiable
   parameters and also treatment of oxLDL could be expected to improve
   endothelial dysfunction in hemodialysis patients. (C) 2010 by the

Abstract = {{Bulk geochemistry of similar to 1.8 Ma lacustrine claystone at Olduvai
   Gorge, Tanzania, is controlled principally by the geochemistry of
   ultrafine (<0.1 mu m), authigenic clay minerals. Authigenic clays have
   an average structural formula of
   (Si3.83Al0.17)(Al0.43Fe0.49Mg0.84)(Na0.99K0.22Ca0.16)O-10(OH)(2):
   octahedral composition varies, with Mg/(Al + Fe) ranging from 0.7 to
   2.3. These clay minerals have a complex history of interaction with
   saline, alkaline water, followed by secondary diagenetic reactions that
   leached Mg in freshwater paleoenvironments. Lateral variations in
   whole-rock and clay geochemistry show westward enrichment in Mg, from
   Mg-oct = 0.6-1.6. This is consistent with persistence of saline,
   alkaline Paleolake Olduvai to the west, and the presence of groundwater
   wetlands and other freshwater paleoenvironments to the east. Stone
   artifact mass density also varies systematically across the basal Bed II
   deposits, ranging from 10(0.0) to 10(4.3) g of artifacts per cubic meter
   of excavated sediment. Significant correlation is found between clay
   geochemistry and the density of artifacts excavated from associated
   archeological trenches (r(2) = 0.59, p < 0.01). This relationship
   supports models of hominin land use in which artifact use and discard is
   concentrated near freshwater paleoenvironments such as wetlands
   associated with surface and groundwater discharge. Independent
   paleoenvironmental proxies such as clay geochemistry allow quantitative
   hypothesis testing to improve our understanding of early hominin
   behavior and paleoecology. (C) 2010 University of Washington. Published

Abstract = {{A new imagery of London emerged through the widespread circulation of

   the work of the air-survey company Aerofilms Ltd, which established

   Specific photographs are examined in relation to the different cultural
   contexts and discourses in which they operated. The analysis of tourist
   and architectural literature, in particular, reveals that aerial views
   became increasingly pervasive over the 1920s and 1930s, and that
   Aerofilms played a central role in shaping an aerial iconography of
   London.}},

Abstract = {{Bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) on the tongue probably evolved to evoke
   signals for avoiding ingestion of plant toxins. We found expression of
   TAS2Rs on human airway smooth muscle (ASM) and considered these to be
   avoidance receptors for inhalants that, when activated, lead to ASM
   contraction and bronchospasm. TAS2R agonists such as saccharin,
   chloroquine and denatonium evoked increased intracellular calcium
   ({[}Ca2+](i)) in ASM in a G beta gamma-, phospholipase C beta (PLC
   beta)-and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor-dependent manner, which
   would be expected to evoke contraction. Paradoxically, bitter tastants
   caused relaxation of isolated ASM and dilation of airways that was
   threefold greater than that elicited by beta-adrenergic receptor
   agonists. The relaxation induced by TAS2Rs is associated with a
   localized {[}Ca2+](i) response at the cell membrane, which opens
   large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels, leading to ASM
   membrane hyperpolarization. Inhaled bitter tastants decreased airway
   obstruction in a mouse model of asthma. Given the need for efficacious
   bronchodilators for treating obstructive lung diseases, this pathway can
   be exploited for therapy with the thousands of known synthetic and
   naturally occurring bitter tastants.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis being tested in this study is that hypofractionated
   radiotherapy is well tolerated and not lower in terms of oncological
   outcome than conventional radiotherapy. Forty patients with
   histologically proven glottic cancer were included in the analysis.
   Twenty-two were treated by hypofractionated radiotherapy (3D-HFRT) (25
   fractions of 2.4 Gy delivered daily to a total close of 60 G,,). This
   group was retrospectively compared to 18 subjects who met the same
   inclusion criteria and who were treated with conventional radiotherapy
   (3D-CRT) (33 fractions of 2 Gy delivered daily to a total close of 66
   Gy). One year after RT treatment in 10 patients (5 in the Arm-1 and 5 in
   the Arm-2) mild dysphonia persisted. The other patients achieved a
   complete recovery of the overall quality of voice with no significant
   difference documented between the two groups. At 3 years the local
   control rate was 100\% for the patients treated with hypofractionated
   radiotherapy and 96\% for the patients treated with conventional
   regimen. The statistical analysis did not show any significant
   difference in local control between the two groups (p=0.45). No
   significant acute and late toxicity was documented in both groups.
   Subjects with early glottic cancer seem to experience comparable levels
   of morbidity irrespective whether they were treated by hypofractionated
   or conventional conformal therapy without any worsening of the tumor
   local control. Thus, we provide clinical evidence to justify trends
   already emerging toward hypofractionated regimens in early glottic
   cancer.}},

Abstract = {{P>With 500 000 cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis there is an
   urgent need for attractive targets to enable the discovery of novel
   antimycobacterials. The biosynthesis of essential cofactors is of
   particular interest as these pathways are absent in man and their
   inhibition is expected to affect the metabolism of Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis at multiple sites. Our data demonstrate that the pathogen
   synthesizes pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP), the bioactive form of vitamin
   B6, by a heteromeric PLP synthase composed of Pdx1 (Rv2606c) and Pdx2
   (Rv2604c). Disruption of the pdx1 gene generated a strictly B6
   auxotrophic M. tuberculosis mutant, Delta pdx1. Removal of the cofactor
   during exponential growth or stationary phase demonstrated the
   essentiality of vitamin B6 biosynthesis for growth and survival of the
   pathogen in culture. In a tuberculosis dormancy model based on gradual
   oxygen depletion, de novo biosynthesis of PLP was required for regrowth
   of the bacillus after direct oxygen exposure. The Delta pdx1 mutant
   showed a severe growth defect in immunocompetent mice: bacilli applied
   intranasally failed to persist in host tissues and were quickly cleared.
   We conclude that vitamin B6 biosynthesis is required for survival of M.
   tuberculosis in vivo and thus might represent a candidate pathway for
   the development of new antitubercular agents.}},

Abstract = {{Background Rates of mental illness in children are increasing throughout
   the world Observational studies of depression anxiety and
   attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder suggest that zinc is an
   alternative treatment
   Objective We examined the effect of zinc supplementation on the mental
   health of school-age children in Guatemala
   Design From January to October 2006 we conducted a 6 mo randomized
   double blind controlled trial comparing zinc supplementation non (10 mg
   ZnO/d for 5 d/wk) with a placebo (10 mg glucose) in 674 Guatemalan
   children in grades 1-4 Outcome measures included intern timing (ie
   depression and anxiety) and externalizing (ie hyper activity and conduct
   disorder) problem behaviors positive behaviors (le socialization and
   leadership) and serum zinc concentrations
   Results Zinc and placebo groups did not differ significantly in any
   behavioral measures at baseline or at follow up At baseline 21 4\% of
   children had serum zinc concentrations <65 mu g/dL At follow-up both
   groups improved significantly and zinc concentrations were higher in the
   zinc group Increases in serum zinc concentrations were inversely
   associated with decreases in depressive symp toms (estimate -0 01 points
   per mu g Zn/dL P = 0 01) anxiety (estimate -0 012 points per mu g Zn/dL
   P = 0 02) internalizing symptoms (estimate -0 021 points per mu g Zn/dL
   P = 0 02) rind social skills (estimate -0019 points per mu g Zn/dL P = 0
   01) in adjusted models that weft controlled for child age sex,
   socioeconomic status household and treatment group
   Conclusions Six months of zinc supplementation did not induce
   differences in mental health outcomes between zinc and placebo groups
   However, increases in serum zinc concentrations were associated with
   decreases in internalizing symptoms (ie depression and anxiety) in a
   community based sample of children at risk of zinc deficiency This trial
   was registered at clinicaltrials gov as NCT00283660 Am J Clin Nutr 2010

Abstract = {{Finding the optimum matching between the numerically realizable part of
   the (space-charge dominated) sheath solution (i.e., potential
   distribution) and the (quasineutral) presheath plasma solution is quite
   a challenging problem in general. Here, an analytic-numerical matching
   procedure is proposed for the sheath-plasma transition related to a
   spherical probe in a low-density plasma. First, a fairly general
   spherical-probe scenario based on trajectory integration of the Vlasov
   equation is formulated and specialized to the particular situation
   considered in {[}I. B. Bernstein and I. N. Rabinowitz, Physics of Fluids
   2, 112 (1959)] (B\&R), in which the incident ions are monoenergetic and
   isotropic. Then, this newly developed formalism is used for finding the
   potential profile in the entire ``plasma-probe transition (PPT){''}
   region. The complete ``sheath{''} solution, which by definition
   satisfies Poisson's equation, consists of the ``inward{''} sheath
   solution (r < r(0), region without reflected ions) and the ``outward{''}
   one (r >= r(0), region with reflected ions), but only the inward sheath
   solution can be realized numerically. The outward sheath solution, on
   the other hand, is approximated for r(0) <= r <= r(mtch) (where r(mtch)
   is the ``matching{''} radius) by the (second-order) ``expanded{''}
   sheath solution, and for r > T(mtch) by the ``plasma{''} solution, which
   by definition satisfies the quasineutrality conditon. The ``optimum{''}
   values of r(mtch) and r(0) are simultaneously determined by requiring
   that at r = r(mtch) both the values and the first derivatives of the
   (second-order) expanded sheath and plasma solutions are equal,
   respectively. While the inward sheath solution was also given by B\&R,
   the expanded outward sheath and plasma solutions, the quasineutral
   solution and the related matching procedure represent genuinely new
   results. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the activation of Mitogen activated protein
   (MAP) kinases in and around cartilage subjected to mechanical damage and
   to determine the effects of their inhibitors on impaction-induced
   chondrocyte death and cartilage degeneration.
   Design: The phosphorylation of MAP kinases was examined with confocal
   microscopy and immuno-blotting. The effects of MAP kinase inhibitors on
   impaction-induced chondrocyte death and proteoglycan (PG) loss were
   determined with fluorescent microscopy and 1, 9-Dimethyl-Methylene Blue
   (DMMB) assay. The expression of catabolic genes at mRNA levels was
   examined with quantitative real-time PCR.
   Results: Early p38 activation was detected at 20 min and 1 h
   post-impaction. At 24 h, enhanced phosphorylation of p38 and
   extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)1/2 was visualized in
   chondrocytes from in and around impact sites. The phosphorylation of p38
   was increased by 3.0-fold in impact sites and 3.3-fold in adjacent
   cartilage. The phosphorylation of ERK-1 was increased by 5.8-fold in
   impact zone and 5.4-fold in adjacent cartilage; the phosphorylation of
   ERK-2 increased by 4.0-fold in impacted zone and 3.6-fold in adjacent
   cartilage. Furthermore, the blocking of p38 pathway did not inhibit
   impaction-induced ERK activation. The inhibition of p38 or ERK pathway
   significantly reduced injury-related chondrocyte death and PG losses.
   Quantitative Real-time PCR analysis revealed that blunt impaction
   significantly up-regulated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13, Tumor
   necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and ADAMTS-5 expression.
   Conclusion: These findings implicate p38 and ERK mitogen activated
   protein kinases (MAPKs) in the post-injury spread of cartilage
   degeneration and suggest that the risk of post-traumatic osteoarthritis
   (PTOA) following joint trauma could be decreased by blocking their
   activities, which might be involved in up-regulating expressions of
   MMP-13, ADAMTS-5, and TNF-alpha. (C) 2010 Osteoarthritis Research

Abstract = {{The application of additives via seeds is a technique preconized and
   greatly utilized by the industry, but, little is known about of the
   effect upon the physiological and biochemical quality in seeds. This
   work was accomplished with the purpose of evaluating the effect of the
   covering with micronutrients, aminoacids, growth regulators and their
   combinations in the germination, vigor and activity for same enzymes in
   lettuce seeds. For the film-coating of the seed, a mixture of 50 mL of
   L88 (R) polymer, 40 mL of the additive and 10 mL of water was done. The
   additives used were micronutrients, aminoacids, growth regulators and
   the mixture of these. After film-coating, the seeds were dried in room
   temperature and next they were evaluated as to the percentage of
   germination, percentage of emergence and index of emergence velocity of
   the seedlings and activity of the enzymes esterase and
   endo-beta-mannase. It follows that the addition of micronutrients,
   aminoacids and growth regulators to the lettuce seeds do not negatively
   affect their germination and the esterase enzyme activity, but reduce
   the activity of the endo-beta-mannase enzyme. The coating of lettuce
   seeds with micronutrients, with a mixture of micronutrients + growth
   regulators, and a mixture of micronutrients + growth regulators +
   aminoacids increase the index of emergence velocity of the seedlings.}},

Abstract = {{Volatile components extracted from the aerial parts and separated organs
   of Corsican and Sardinian Teucrium massiliense have been studied. The
   chemical composition of essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation
   (HD) has been investigated using GC-RI, GC-MS (El and Cl modes) and
   (13)CNMR spectroscopy. For the first time, a real concentration via
   calibration curves and response factor calculations has been determined
   for each oil component. The concentrations of the major components were
   6-methyl-3-heptyl acetate (23.83-18.16 g/100 g), 3-octyl acetate
   (10.55-6.95 g/100 g), isobutyl isovalerate (7.67-2.91 g/100 g),
   germacrene D (6.13-1.01 g/100 g) and linalool (6.63-5.23 g/100 g). To
   the best of our knowledge, the occurrence of 6-methyl-3-heptyl acetate
   as a natural product is reported for the first time. Furthermore, the
   chemical composition of volatile fractions emitted from the aerial parts
   and separated organs of T. massiliense L. has been studied by
   HS-SPME/GC-RI and GC-MS after optimization of SPME parameters.
   Concerning the contribution of plant organs to the aromatic plant
   fingerprint, we noted that the flowers produced more volatiles than
   other organs. The volatile fractions obtained from the different organs
   were qualitatively quite similar to each other but differed in the
   percentages of their major components. Also, the influence of HS-SPME
   extraction parameters (equilibrium and extraction times and temperature)
   on the chemical composition of the plant volatile fraction is discussed.

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. We investigated the clinical utility of combined use of Goal
   Attainment Scaling (GAS) and the Canadian Occupational Performance
   Measure (COPM) to plan goals and measure progress in a community
   rehabilitation setting.
   METHOD. Fourteen participants with traumatic brain injury completed an
   outpatient, goal-directed 12-wk occupational therapy program; 53 goals
   were generated. Performance and satisfaction self-ratings and GAS
   ratings were collected before and after intervention. Self-awareness,
   motivation to change, and perceived client-centeredness measures were
   taken before intervention.
   RESULTS. Sensitivity to change was demonstrated by significant
   improvements after intervention for total performance self-ratings on
   the COPM and GAS T scores.
   CONCLUSION. Combined use of these tools, although time consuming,
   resulted in goals that were perceived almost unanimously as client
   centered, despite most participants' having moderate or severe
   impairment in self-awareness. The process also enabled subjective and
   objective demonstration of goal achievement, thereby supporting the
   clinical utility and treatment validity of the combined use of these
   tools.}},

Abstract = {{The Baikal program aimed at the creation of a superhigh-power generator
   for experiments in the field of inertial thermonuclear fusion includes
   the development of a MOL facility for modeling the main principles of
   the generator structure. It is suggested to use a six-module plasma
   opening switch (POS) in an external magnetic field as the output power
   sharpener. The scheme of upgraded plasma guns of the module of the MOL
   facility's POS and the results of studying the dynamics of filling the
   POS gap with plasma transversely to an external magnetic field are
   presented. It is shown that, in the presence of a long (similar to 40 mu
   s) prepulse in this module, a POS cathode-anode closure with plasma
   along the force lines of the external magnetic field occurs within a
   time interval between the first turning-on of the plasma guns and the
   POS operation, which is hazardous for its operation. To eliminate this
   threat, it is proposed to increase the POS length to similar to 70 cm.
   On the basis of the results obtained, a simpler and more reliable
   solution of the prepulse problem is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{The generation of broadband microwave frequency comb from a femtosecond
   pulse train by direct photodetection opens the possibility for
   high-accuracy length measurements of long distances. We demonstrate a
   relatively simple realization of this measurement principle: an
   electronic distance measurement system based on a time-of-flight
   approach, driven by a femtosecond fibre laser source as a modulator. By
   the evaluation of the phase shifts of two distinct comb frequencies, a
   coarse and a fine measurement of the absolute distance can be performed.
   The range of the measurement system is demonstrated up to a length of
   100 m. The experimental comparison of the femtosecond laser system with
   a conventional reference counting interferometer shows a precision
   better than +/- 10 mu m at 100 m, corresponding to a relative
   measurement uncertainty of 1 x 10(-7) L. The limiting factors for the
   measurement uncertainty of the system are theoretically investigated and
   shown to be of the same order of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{The SPIN model checker and its specification language Promela have been
   used extensively in industry and academia to check the logical
   properties of distributed algorithms and protocols. Model checking with
   SPIN involves reasoning about a system via an abstract Promela
   specification, thus the technique depends critically on the soundness of
   this specification. Promela includes a rich set of data types including
   first-class channels, but the language syntax restricts the declaration
   of channel types so that it is not generally possible to deduce the
   complete type of a channel directly from its declaration. We present the
   design and implementation of ETCH, an enhanced type checker for Promela,
   which uses constraint-based type inference to perform strong type
   checking of Promela specifications, allowing static detection of errors
   that SPIN would not detect until simulation/verification time, or that
   SPIN may miss completely. We discuss theoretical and practical problems
   associated with designing a type system and type checker for an existing
   language, and formalise our approach using a Promela-like calculus. To
   handle subtyping between base types, we present an extension to a
   standard unification algorithm to solve a system of equality and
   subtyping constraints, based on bounded substitutions. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Advanced Mission Concepts and Technologies Office (Mission
   Technologies Office, MTO for short) at the European Space Operations
   Centre (ESOC) of ESA is entrusted with research and development of
   innovative mission operations concepts systems and provides operations
   support to special projects.
   Visions of future missions and requests for improvements from currently
   flying missions are the two major sources of inspiration to
   conceptualize innovative or improved mission operations processes. They
   include monitoring and diagnostics, planning and scheduling, resource
   management and optimization.
   The newly identified operations concepts are then proved by means of
   prototypes, built with embedded, enabling technology and deployed as
   shadow applications in mission operations for an extended validation
   phase.
   The technology so far exploited includes informatics, artificial
   intelligence and operational research branches. Recent outstanding
   results include artificial intelligence planning and scheduling
   applications for Mars Express, advanced integrated space weather
   monitoring system for the Integral space telescope and a suite of
   growing client applications for MUST (Mission Utilities Support Tools).
   The research, development and validation activities at the Mission
   technologies office are performed together with a network of research
   institutes across Europe. The objective is narrowing the gap between
   enabling and innovative technology and space mission operations.
   The paper first addresses samples of technology infusion cases with
   their lessons learnt. The second part is focused on the process and the
   methodology used at the Mission technologies office to fulfill its
   objectives. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequent tumor in males in
   Brazil. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been demonstrated in
   the promoter region of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) genes and have
   been associated with development and progression of some cancers. In
   this study, our aim was to investigate a possible relation between
   polymorphism of the promoter region of the MMP2 gene and classical
   prognostic parameters in prostate cancer.
   Materials and methods: Genomic DNA was extracted using conventional
   protocols. The DNA sequence containing the polymorphic site was
   amplified by real-time polymerase chain reaction, using fluorescent
   probes (TaqMan).
   Results: In patients with tumors of a higher stage (pT3), a polymorphic
   allele in the MMP2 gene was more frequent (P = 0.026) than in patients
   with lower tumor stage. A polymorphic allele in the MMP2 gene was more
   frequent in Gleason >= 7 than in Gleason <= 6 (P = 0.042).
   Conclusions: We conclude that MMP2 polymorphism can be used together
   with pathological stage and Gleason score to identify patients with
   worse prognosis. Our results illustrate the potential use of MMP2 SNP as
   a molecular marker for prostate cancer. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Over the next two decades, NASA and ESA are planning a series of
   space-based observatories to find Earth-like planets and determine
   whether life exists on these planets. Previous studies have assessed the
   likelihood of detecting life through signs of biogenic gases in the
   atmosphere or a red edge. Biogenic gases and the red edge could be signs
   of either single-celled or multicellular life. In this study, we propose
   a technique with which to determine whether tree-like multicellular life
   exists on extrasolar planets. For multicellular photosynthetic organisms
   on Earth, competition for light and the need to transport water and
   nutrients has led to a tree-like body plan characterized by hierarchical
   branching networks. This design results in a distinct bidirectional
   reflectance distribution function (BRDF) that causes differing
   reflectance at different sun/view geometries. BRDF arises from the
   changing visibility of the shadows cast by objects, and the presence of
   tree-like structures is clearly distinguishable from flat ground with
   the same reflectance spectrum. We examined whether the BRDF could detect
   the existence of tree-like structures on an extrasolar planet by using
   changes in planetary albedo as a planet orbits its star. We used a
   semi-empirical BRDF model to simulate vegetation reflectance at
   different planetary phase angles and both simulated and real cloud cover
   to calculate disk and rotation-averaged planetary albedo for a vegetated
   and non-vegetated planet with abundant liquid water. We found that even
   if the entire planetary albedo were rendered to a single pixel, the rate
   of increase of albedo as a planet approaches full illumination would be
   comparatively greater on a vegetated planet than on a non-vegetated
   planet. Depending on how accurately planetary cloud cover can be
   resolved and the capabilities of the coronagraph to resolve exoplanets,
   this technique could theoretically detect tree-like multicellular life
   on exoplanets in 50 stellar systems.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, populations of long-distance migrant birds have
   declined markedly. Resource availability, both on breeding and wintering
   grounds, is likely to be important particularly since changing climates
   are affecting the timing and synchrony of such resources. We use novel
   analytical methods to examine whether large-scale population declines in
   the brood-parasite common cuckoo Cuculus canorus are the result of
   changes in the abundance or timing of breeding of its host species. We
   find that, due to climate-induced changes in the timing of breeding,
   availability of dunnock Prunella modularis nests has decreased, but that
   availability of reed warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus has increased.
   Although there is no evidence that the timing of breeding of cuckoo has
   changed, these changes are likely to have had only a minimal impact on
   its population trend, but may explain an increase in the rate of
   parasitism of reed warbler nests in recent decades.}},

Abstract = {{Although core needle biopsy has been shown to be an accurate means of
   diagnosing lung malignancies, there is relatively little information in
   the literature about its utility in diagnosing specific non-malignant
   conditions. We reviewed the pathologic findings in 159 core needle
   biopsies showing benign changes in order to determine the types of
   processes that can be diagnosed by this technique and the factors that
   influence accuracy and specificity. There were 155 patients ranging in
   age from 3 to 86 years (mean 58). Nodules or masses were present
   radiologically in most. They ranged from 0.5 to 8.0 cm (mean 1.65 cm) in
   size and 80\% measured 2.0 cm or less. Twenty percent were spiculated,
   and positron emission tomography scans were positive in 48 of 56 cases
   tested (30\% of total). Specific diagnoses were established in 122
   (77\%) of 159 core needle biopsies, while 24(15\%) were nonspecific and
   13 (8\%) were nonrepresentative. The most common specific diagnoses were
   necrotizing granulomatous inflammation (45), scar (28), organizing
   pneumonia (13), and benign neoplasms (11). A mixture of interstitial
   fibrosis and chronic inflammation (16) was the most common nonspecific
   diagnosis. A specific diagnosis was significantly more likely in
   biopsies with 3 or more cores or with a core length of more than 1 cm.
   Malignancy was diagnosed on a subsequent biopsy in only one case, and
   the initial biopsy in that case showed non-specific chronic inflammation
   and fibrosis. Our findings confirm that core needle biopsy is an
   accurate method of diagnosing benign lung lesions, yielding specific
   diagnoses in the majority. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bio-inspired networking techniques have been investigated since more
   than a decade. Findings in this field have fostered new developments in
   networking, especially in the most challenging domains such as handling
   large-scale networks, their dynamic nature, resource constraints,
   heterogeneity, unattended operation, and robustness. Even though this
   new research area started with highly theoretical concepts, it can be
   seen that there is also practical impact. This article aims to give an
   overview to the general field of bio-inspired networking, introducing
   the key concepts and methodologies. Selected examples that outline the
   capabilities and the practical relevance are discussed in more detail.
   The presented examples outline the activities of a new community working
   on bio-inspired networking solutions, which is converging and becomes
   visible in term of the provided astonishingly efficient solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Systematic transient analysis in water supply systems is intended to
   determine the reliability of water supply and the integrity of hydraulic
   devices when hydraulic transients (i.e., water hammers) occur. In the
   analysis, parameters such as wavespeed, pipe diameter, friction, and
   others, usually considered as known inputs in traditional water hammer
   models, are actually subject to uncertainties due to natural or human
   behaviors. The paper considers these uncertainties and investigates
   their effects on the reliability of water transportation systems and
   water supply networks under transient conditions with or without
   protection devices. In addition, the optimization of transient
   protection devices is also evaluated based on the probabilistic
   analysis. The results show that the probabilistic analysis method could
   inspect the influence of the different input uncertainties on the system
   responses under transient conditions and provide detailed information on
   the design for water supply systems and protection devices. A
   one-dimensional water hammer model of pipe fluid systems and Monte Carlo
   simulation method are used in this investigation.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR CANCER THERAPEUTICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Most targeted anticancer drugs are inhibitors of kinases that are
   aberrantly activated in cancer cells. However, the mechanisms by which
   kinase inhibitors suppress tumor growth remain unclear. In this study,
   we found that UCN-01, a staurosporine analogue and broad-range kinase
   inhibitor used in clinical trials, inhibits colon cancer cell growth by
   inducing apoptosis via PUMA, a BH3-only Bcl-2 family member and a p53
   target. PUMA expression was markedly elevated in a p53-independent
   fashion following UCN-01 treatment. The induction of PUMA by UCN-01 was
   mediated by direct binding of FoxO3a to the PUMA promoter following
   inhibition of AKT signaling. Deficiency in PUMA abrogated UCN-01-induced
   apoptosis, caspase activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, and
   rendered UCN-01 resistance in a clonogenic assay, whereas elevated PUMA
   expression or a BH3 mimetic sensitized UCN-01 induced apoptosis.
   Chemosensitization by UCN-01 seemed to involve simultaneous PUMA
   induction through both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms.
   Furthermore, deficiency in PUMA suppressed the antitumor effects of
   UCN-01 in a xenograft model, concurrent with reduced apoptosis and
   caspase activation in vivo. These results suggest that PUMA-mediated
   apoptosis is pivotal for the anticancer activities of UCN-01, and
   possibly other clinically used kinase inhibitor drugs, and that PUMA
   manipulation may be useful for improving their anticancer activities.

Abstract = {{We investigated a cluster of three cases of inflammatory breast cancer

   Information about medical history, pregnancy history, family history of
   breast cancer, oral contraceptive use/hormone replacement therapy,
   exposure to possible oncogenic agents and tumor promoters were obtained
   to determine whether there were differences in risk factors for IBC
   between cases and controls. The physical environment and location of the
   cases' office raised concern about air and water quality as well as
   radiation as being contributory risk factors for developing IBC. Of the
   three women with IBC, two had high exposures to pesticides/herbicides,
   all three used oral contraceptives and two used hormone replacement
   therapy at the time of diagnosis, two had a family history of breast
   cancer, and two were obese. Among fifteen controls four had
   pesticide/herbicide exposure, one had a family history of breast cancer,
   nine used oral contraceptives, seven used hormone replacement therapy,
   and five were obese. No specific environmental causes were established
   for this cluster. Several promoting factors have been suggested that
   could result in subclinical breast cancer emerging as IBC. Among them
   are exogenous hormones and exposure to herbicides/pesticides.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: A novel cancer syndrome associated with biallelic mismatch
   repair (MMR) mutations has been described recently. Patients presenting
   with childhood-onset gastrointestinal (GI) cancers may carry biallelic
   MMR mutations and have a distinct phenotype from classic Lynch syndrome.
   The aim of this study was to characterize patients with GI small bowel
   and/or colorectal cancers (CRCs) who have germline biallelic MMR
   mutations.
   METHODS: A search of a Canadian GI cancer registry and literature review
   to identify patients with biallelic MMR was conducted.
   RESULTS: The database identified 237 patients with intestinal cancer
   diagnosed before the age of 35 years. Five (2.1\%) patients had
   biallelic MMR mutations. Overall, 32 individuals, from 29 families, with
   biallelic MMR gene mutations and GI cancers were identified by the
   registry and literature review. Among the 29 patients with CRCs, the
   mean age of first cancer diagnosis was 16.4 years (range: 5-28). More
   than one-third of patients had multiple colorectal adenomas (>10
   polyps). Six individuals with biallelic MMR gene mutations have been
   reported with small bowel adenocarcinoma (mean age 20 years (range:
   11-41)). Cafe-au-lait (CAL) macules were reported in 72\% and, based on
   mutation analysis, consanguinity was suspected in 52\% of kindred. Of
   the 29 kindred, 19 (66\%) had PMS2 mutations, 6 (21\%) had MSH6
   mutations, 3 (10\%) had MLH1 mutations, and 1 (3\%) had MSH2 mutation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Biallelic MMR mutations are an underrecognized cause of
   small bowel and colonic cancers in children and young adults. This
   distinct phenotype includes multiple adenomatous polyps and CAL skin
   lesions. It is important to identify such patients, so that families can
   be referred for genetic testing and counseling.}},

Abstract = {{Oilseed rape (Brassica napus) is an allotetraploid species consisting of
   two genomes, derived from B. rapa (A genome) and B. oleracea (C genome).
   The presence of these two genomes makes single nucleotide polymorphism
   (SNP) marker identification and SNP analysis more challenging than in
   diploid species, as for a given locus usually two versions of a DNA
   sequence (based on the two ancestral genomes) have to be analyzed
   simultaneously during SNP identification and analysis. One hundred
   amplicons derived from expressed sequence tag (ESTs) were analyzed to
   identify SNPs in a panel of oilseed rape varieties and within two sister
   species representing the ancestral genomes. A total of 604 SNPs were
   identified, averaging one SNP in every 42 bp. It was possible to clearly
   discriminate SNPs that are polymorphic between different plant varieties
   from SNPs differentiating the two ancestral genomes. To validate the
   identified SNPs for their use in genetic analysis, we have developed
   Illumina GoldenGate assays for some of the identified SNPs. Through the
   analysis of a number of oilseed rape varieties and mapping populations
   with GoldenGate assays, we were able to identify a number of different
   segregation patterns in allotetraploid oilseed rape. The majority of the
   identified SNP markers can be readily used for genetic mapping, showing
   that amplicon sequencing and Illumina GoldenGate assays can be used to
   reliably identify SNP markers in tetraploid oilseed rape and to convert
   them into successful SNP assays that can be used for genetic analysis.}},

   open new vistas of research in dialogically oriented communication

   subalternity enters into dialog with the dominant sites of knowledge
   production in communication studies. By sensitizing the researcher to
   the position of power and privilege embodied in academic knowledge, the
   project calls for a reflexive journey of solidarity between researcher
   and subaltern community. In doing so, subaltern studies becomes an entry
   point to explore the emancipatory potential of dialog in the backdrop of

Abstract = {{This paper presents a general framework for a refined spectral analysis
   of a group of isometries acting on a Banach space, which extends the

   absolutely continuous and singular-continuous parts of this spectrum are
   specified. Conditions are given, in terms of the transposed action of
   the group of isometries, which guarantee that the pure-point and
   continuous subspaces span the entire Banach space. In the case of a
   unitarily implemented group of automorphisms, acting on a C{*}-algebra,
   relations between the continuous spectrum of the automorphisms and the
   spectrum of the implementing group of unitaries are found. The group of
   spacetime translation automorphisms in quantum field theory is analyzed
   in detail. In particular, it is shown that the structure of its
   continuous spectrum is relevant to the problem of existence of
   (infra-)particles in a given theory.}},

Abstract = {{In December 2008, an intense avalanche cycle occurred in the eastern
   part of the southern French Alps. Southerly atmospheric fluxes that
   progressively evolved into an easterly return caused important snowfalls
   with return periods up to 10 years. Cold temperatures and drifting snow
   had important aggravating effects. The return period for the number of
   avalanches was above 50 years in two massifs and some of the avalanche
   had very long runouts that exceeded historical limits recorded in the
   French avalanche atlas. Using this case study, this paper illustrates
   and discusses how avalanche reports, snow and weather data and results
   from numerical modelling of the snow cover call be combined to analyse
   abnormal temporal clusters of snow avalanches. For instance, it is shown
   how statistical techniques developed in other fields can be used to test
   the significance of different explanatory factors, extract
   spatio-temporal patterns, compare them with previous cycles and quantify
   the magnitude/frequency relationship at different scales. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Background: Pauses in chest compressions during cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation have been shown to correlate with poor outcomes. In an
   attempt to minimize these pauses, the American Heart Association
   recommends charging the defibrillator during chest compressions. While
   simulation work suggests decreased pause times using this technique,
   little is known about its use in clinical practice.
   Methods: We conducted a multi-center, retrospective study of
   defibrillator charging at three US academic teaching hospitals between
   April 2006 and April 2009. Data were abstracted from CPR-sensing
   defibrillator transcripts. Pre-shock pauses and total hands-off time
   preceding the defibrillation attempts were compared among techniques.
   Results: A total of 680 charge-cycles from 244 cardiac arrests were
   analyzed. The defibrillator was charged during ongoing chest
   compressions in 448 (65.9\%) instances with wide variability across the
   three sites. Charging during compressions correlated with a decrease in
   median pre-shock pause{[}2.6s (IQR 1.9-3.8) vs 13.3 s (IQR 8.6-19.5); p
   < 0.001] and total hands-off time in the 30 s preceding defibrillation
   110.3 s (IQR 6.4-13.8) vs 14.8 s (IQR 11.0-19.6); p < 0.0011. The
   improvement in hands-off time was most pronounced when rescuers charged
   the defibrillator in anticipation of the pause, prior to any rhythm
   analysis. There was no difference in inappropriate shocks when charging
   during chest compressions (20.0\% vs 20.1\%; p = 0.97) and there was
   only one instance noted of inadvertent shock administration during
   compressions, which went unnoticed by the compressor.
   Conclusions: Charging during compressions is underutilized in clinical
   practice. The technique is associated with decreased hands-off time
   preceding defibrillation, with minimal risk to patients or rescuers. (c)

Abstract = {{This study examines discretionary bonus payments by firms to
   senior-level executives. Interpreting discretionary bonuses as the
   result of implicit incentive contracts, I analyze an analytical model
   that includes a contractible and a non-contractible performance measure.
   The model yields the primary hypothesis that discretionary bonuses occur
   when the outcome of the contractible measure is either low or high, but
   not when the contractible outcome falls in the medium range. Based on a
   sample collected from public sources, I find empirical support for the
   notion that discretionary bonuses are paid based on non-contractible
   performance measures that are related to future financial performance.
   Moreover, discretionary bonus payments occur significantly more often
   when the contractible performance measure falls in the tails of the
   distribution. In contrast, I do not find support for the predictions
   that discretionary bonus payments are related to the manipulability of
   the contractible performance measures or that discretionary bonus
   payments are related to the power of the executives in the companies.}},

Abstract = {{Radio-sounding experiments using signals from the Japanese NOZOMI
   spacecraft to probe the circum solar plasma were performed from December
   2000 through January 2001. They can be used to obtain information about
   the properties of the solar wind plasma in the region where it is
   accelerated at heliocentric distances of 12.8-36.9R (s) (where R (s) is
   the radius of the Sun). Measurements of the intensity and frequency of
   the received signals were carried out with high time resolution (similar
   to 0.05 s for the frequency and similar to 0.0064 s for the intensity),
   making it possible to investigate the anisotropy of inhomogeneities and
   the spatial spectrum of the turbulence of the circum solar plasma.
   Analysis of these radio-sounding data has shown that the scintillation
   index and intensity of the frequency fluctuations decrease approximately
   according to a power law with increasing distance of the line of sight
   from the Sun. Measurements of the amplitude fluctuations and estimates
   of the solar wind velocity derived from spatially separated observations
   indicate the presence of small-scale inhomogeneities with sizes of the
   order of 50 km at heliocentric distances less than 25R (s) , which are
   elongated in the radial direction with anisotropy coefficients from 2.3
   to 3.0. The inhomogeneities at heliocentric distances exceeding 30R (s)
   become close to isotropic.}},

   Against this background the allocation of purchasing budgets across

   proactively manage the share of its customer s business We report the
   results of a cross-sectional study among purchasing managers in U S
   manufacturing industries Our findings confirm the role of customer value
   as an antecedent to customer share in business relationships The study
   further shows that customer share influences the stability of key
   supplier relationships Rather than displaying a direct impact our
   results suggest that trust mediates and dependence moderates the link
   between customer share and search for alternative suppliers Based on
   these findings we propose a framework for managing customer share in key

Journal = {{LAB ANIMAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{352-359}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Research using rats sometimes requires long-term placement of catheters
   in the subarachnoid space, the cavity between the arachnoid mater and
   the pia mater in the brain. These catheters can be used to
   experimentally induce subarachnoid bleeding by injecting blood or to
   locally administer drugs or other substances. To date, published
   techniques for penetrating the subarachnoid space of small experimental
   animals require the use of inflexible or relatively inflexible
   catheters. These catheters typically consist of metal or stiff plastic
   and are used to access the occipital or frontal cranial cavity or to
   directly access the cisterna magna via the atlantooccipital membrane.
   However, inflexible catheters are not ideal for long-term placement in
   the subarachnoid space. In this paper, the authors describe a reliable
   procedure for long-term catheterization of the subarachnoid cavity of
   the rat. For this method, personnel insert the catheter and keep it in
   place in the rat's middle cranial cavity, in the vicinity of the
   cerebral arterial circle. This new approach allows personnel to
   repeatedly use the catheter for a period of at least 2 weeks. The
   catheter, which is welt-tolerated by rats, can be used for administering
   saline solutions and for injecting blood that has not been treated with
   heparin into the subarachnoid space.}},

Abstract = {{STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort study without a control group
   OBJECTIVES Firstly to present our 5 week progressive exercise therapy
   program in the early stage after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury
   Secondly to evaluate changes in knee function after completion of the
   program for patients with ACL injury in general and also when classified
   as potential copers or noncopers and finally to examine potential
   adverse events
   BACKGROUND Few studies concerning early stage ACL rehabilitation
   protocols exist Con sequently little is known about the tolerance for
   and outcomes from short term exercise therapy programs in the early
   stage after injury
   METHODS One hundred patients were included in a 5 week progressive
   exercise therapy program within 3 months after injury Knee function
   before and after completion of the program was evaluated from isokinetic
   quadriceps and hamstrings muscle strength tests 4 single leg hop tests 2
   different self assessment questionnaires and a global rating of knee
   function A 2 way mixed model analysis of variance was conducted to
   evaluate changes from pretest to posttest for the limb symmetry index
   for muscle strength and single leg hop tests and the change in scores
   for the patient reported questionnaires In addition absolute values and
   the standardized response mean for muscle strength and single leg hop
   tests were calculated at pretest and posttest for the injured and
   uninjured limb Adverse events during the 5 week period were recorded
   RESULTS The progressive 5 week exercise therapy program led to
   significant improvements (P< 05) in knee function from pretest to
   posttest both for patients classified as potential copers and noncopers
   Standardized response mean values for changes in muscle strength and
   single leg hop performance from pretest to posttest for the injured limb
   were moderate to strong (0 49 0 84) indicating the observed improvements
   to be clinically relevant Adverse events occurred in 3 9\% of the
   patients
   CONCLUSION Short term progressive exercise therapy programs are well
   tolerated and should be incorporated in early stage ACL rehabilitation
   either to improve knee function before ACL reconstruction or as a first
   step in further nonoperative management

Abstract = {{Because the family Chironomidae, or non-biting midges, is one of the
   most species-rich groups of macro-invertebrates in freshwater habitats,
   species-level identifications of chironomids are important for
   biodiversity assessments in these ecosystems. Morphology-based species
   identifications from adult female chironomids usually are considerably
   more difficult than from adult males, or even impossible; thus, the
   females are often neglected in community assessments. We used DNA
   barcoding to investigate how inclusion of the females influenced the
   species count from springs and spring brooks at Solendet Nature Reserve
   in Central Norway. By means of the barcodes we were able to identify
   77.6\% of the females to species by associating them with males from the
   study site or from other regions, whereas the remaining, unassociated
   females could be identified to genus level only. The number of recorded
   species increased by 27\% when females were included. We also found that
   DNA barcoding is effective for the detection of taxonomically
   challenging species and species groups. Using DNA barcoding in
   combination with traditional taxonomy, we recognised at least five
   species new to science and three species and one genus new to Norway.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a method of preparing single-, double-, and
   triple-cation ferrite pigments by employing simple chemical techniques
   to study their corrosion protection properties. The prepared pigments
   were characterized using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron
   microscopy. All prepared ferrite pigments were evaluated using ASTM
   methods. Anticorrosive paint formulations were performed using different
   prepared pigment loadings. The physico-mechanical and corrosion
   properties of dry paint films were examined. The tests revealed that the
   prepared ferrite pigments show excellent anticorrosive behavior, and
   that the best among them in performance are zinc and zinc magnesium.
   Calcium, zinc-calcium, and zinc-magnesium-calcium ferrites show better
   performance in high pigment loadings, while magnesium ferrite pigments
   show good results only in low pigment loading.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a hierarchical algorithm to compute the 3-D
   capacitances of a large number of topologically different layout
   configurations that are all assembled from the same basic layout motifs.
   Our algorithm uses the boundary element method in order to compute a
   Markov transition matrix (MTM) for each motif. The individual motifs are
   connected together by building a large Markov chain. Such Markov chain
   can be simulated extremely efficiently using Monte Carlo simulations
   (e.g., random walks). The main practical advantage of the proposed
   algorithm is its ability to extract the capacitance of a large number of
   layout configurations in a complexity that is basically independent of
   the number of configurations. For instance, in a large 3-D layout
   example, the capacitance calculation of 1000 different configurations
   assembled from the same motifs is accomplished in the time required to
   solve independently two configurations, i.e., a 500X speedup.}},

Abstract = {{Comparative study of sulfoxidation activity of free and immobilized

   sulfide, added after 48-h cultivation of bacterial cells. Higher sulfide
   concentrations inhibited sulfoxidation activity of Rhodococcus. Use of
   immobilized cells allowed the 2-day preparatory stage to be omitted and
   a complete thioanisole bioconversion to be achieved in 24 h in the case
   that biocatalyst and 0.5 g/l thioanisole were added simultaneously. The
   biocatalyst immobilized on gel provides for complete thioanisole
   transformation into (S)-thioanisole sulfoxide (optical purity of 82.1\%)

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present work was to study swimmers' efficiency during
   the underwater phase of the grab start. Eight high-level swimmers
   participated in this study. They performed two types of start: a regular
   grab start ( with underwater leg propulsion after the glide) and a grab
   start with no underwater movement (swimmers had to remain in a
   streamlined position). Four cameras filmed the entire underwater phase
   of all starts. Nine anatomic landmarks were identified on the swimmers'
   bodies and their positions were calculated using a modified double plan
   DLT technique. From these positions and Dempster's anthropometric data,
   the center of mass position and velocity were also determined. Kinetic
   energies were also calculated. This velocity and kinetic energies for
   the two types of start were compared. Swimmers began underwater leg
   propulsion 1.69 m too soon. The global and internal energies were
   significantly higher for the start with underwater leg propulsion.
   Nevertheless, swimmers' velocities were equivalent for both starts.
   These results suggest that the swimmers did not use the underwater phase
   of the start efficiently: By kicking too soon, they did not succeed in
   producing higher velocities and thus wasted energy.}},

Abstract = {{Quantification of nanoparticles in biological systems (i.e., cells,
   tissues and organs) is becoming a vital part of nanotoxicological and
   nanomedical fields. Dose is a key parameter when assessing behavior and
   any potential risk of nanomaterials. Various techniques for nanoparticle
   quantification in cells and tissues already exist but will need further
   development in order to make measurements reliable, reproducible and
   intercomparable between different techniques. Microscopy allows
   detection and location of nanoparticles in cells and has been used
   extensively in recent years to characterize nanoparticles and their
   pathways in living systems. Besides microscopical techniques (light
   microscopy and electron microscopy mainly), analytical techniques such
   as mass spectrometry, an established technique in trace element
   analysis, have been used in nanoparticle research. Other techniques
   require `labeled' particles, fluorescently, radioactively or
   magnetically. However, these techniques lack spatial resolution and
   subcellular localization is not possible. To date, only electron
   microscopy offers the resolving power to determine accumulation of
   nanoparticles in cells due to its ability to image particles
   individually. So-called super-resolution light microscopy techniques are
   emerging to provide sufficient resolution on the light microscopy level
   to image or `see' particles as individual particles. Nevertheless, all
   microscopy techniques require statistically sound sampling strategies in
   order to provide quantitative results. Stereology is a well-known
   sampling technique in various areas and, in combination with electron
   microscopy, proves highly successful with regard to quantification of
   nanoparticle uptake by cells.}},

Abstract = {{To develop prevention activities, an analysis is conducted of child and
   parent characteristics that occur significantly more often among
   children with a mild intellectual disability and behavior problems than
   among children with a mild intellectual disability and no behavior
   problems and their families. The sample consisted of 45 children
   attenting schools for special education. Data were collected from the
   children, their parents, and their teachers. The instruments used are
   the Dutch version of the Parenting Stress Index, the Nijmegen
   Child-Rearing Situation Questionnaire and the Strenghts and Difficulties
   Questionnaire for parents, teachers and children. On the basis of the
   results of parents on the Strenghts and Difficulties Questionnaire, the
   research sample was divided into one group of children with behavior
   problems and one group without behavior problems. Parents of the
   children with behavior problems were found to feel less competent, more
   socially isolated, less satisfied about their relationship with their
   partner, and indicate more negative life occurrences than the parents of
   the children without behavior problems. Characteristics in the area of
   adaptability, mood, distractibility/hyperactivity, demandingness,
   reinforcement of parents, and acceptability were found to contribute to
   the total stress in the child-parent relationship for those children
   with behavior problems and their parents. On the basis of these results
   prevention activities will be developed and tested on their
   effectiveness. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Configurations of multiple concentric black rings play an important role
   in determining the pattern of branchings, connections and mergers

   that it is possible to have multiple black ring configurations in which
   all the rings have equal temperature and angular velocity. This allows
   us to correct and improve in a simple, natural manner, an earlier
   proposal for the phase diagram of singly-rotating black holes in D >= 6.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. We used longitudinal data from the Johns Hopkins Precursors
   Study to test the hypothesis that written propositional density measured
   early in life is lower for people who develop dementia categorized as
   Alzheimer's disease (AD). This association was reported in 1996 for the
   Nun Study, and the Precursors Study offered an unprecedented chance to
   reexamine it among respondents with different gender, education, and
   occupation profiles.
   Methods. Eighteen individuals classified as AD patients (average age at
   diagnosis: 74) were assigned 2 sex-and-age matched controls, and
   propositional density in medical school admission essays (average age at
   writing: 22) was assessed via Computerized Propositional Idea Density
   Rater 3 linguistic analysis software. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the
   matched case-control study were calculated using conditional
   (fixed-effects) logistic regression.
   Results. Mean propositional density is lower for cases than for controls
   (4.70 vs. 4.99 propositions per 10 words, 1-sided p = .01). Higher
   propositional density substantially lowers the odds of AD (OR = 0.16,
   95\% confidence interval = 0.03-0.90, 1-sided p = .02).
   Discussion. Propositional density scores in writing samples from early
   adulthood appear to predict AD in later life for men as well as women.
   Studies of cognition across the life course might beneficially
   incorporate propositional density as a potential marker of cognitive
   reserve.}},

Abstract = {{We report the use of ultrasound-guided axillary brachial plexus block in
   a child with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa needing surgical treatment
   of the right hand The regional anaesthesia was used in association with
   sedation! anaesthesia This technique is suitable for these difficult
   patients because It can minimise the risk of new bullae formation due to
   palpation of landmarks or unintentional intra- or subcutaneous
   injections Initial anaesthesia! sedation was provided with sevoflurane
   until intravenous access was obtained, following which intravenous
   propofol infusion with ketamine boluses without any invasive airway
   management was continued for performance of the block and the procedure
   This management plan provided good surgical conditions, early
   postoperative analgesia, minimised stress for the patient and avoided
   the need to manipulate the airway with instruments and the associated
   risk of mucosa! bullae
   The classification and breadth of clinical manifestation of
   epidermolysis bullosa is complex and briefly summarised The anaesthetist
   should clarify the details of a particular patient's form of

Abstract = {{The effects of diet-borne copper, cadmium, lead, and arsenic on juvenile
   fish were evaluated using a live diet consisting of the oligochaete
   Lumbriculus variegatus. In 30 d exposures, no effects were observed on
   the growth and survival of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), fathead
   minnow (Pimephales promelas), and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus)
   fed diets contaminated with copper {[}130-310 mu g Cu.(g dm)(-1)],
   cadmium {[}90-540 mu g Cd.(g dm)(-1)], and lead {[}850-1000 mu g Pb.(g
   dm)(-1)]. However, rainbow trout growth was reduced in a dose-dependent
   manner for diets contaminated with arsenic {[}26-77 mu g As.(g dm)(-1)].
   These effects of arsenic on fish growth were accompanied by slower
   feeding rate, reduced food conversion efficiency, liver cell
   abnormalities, and fecal matter changes suggestive of digestive effects,
   and occurred to a similar extent whether the diet was exposed to
   arsenate or arsenite. Effects from these dietary levels of arsenic, and
   the absence of effects from these dietary levels of metals, were
   generally consistent with literature reports using laboratory diets
   amended with toxicant salts. These results also indicated that reported

Abstract = {{Recent studies show associations between aircraft noise and
   cardiovascular outcomes such as hypertension However these studies were
   mostly cross-sectional and there are uncertainties regarding potential
   gender differences as well as sensitive subgroups In this study we
   investigated the cumulative incidence of hypertension in relation to
   aircraft noise exposure among Swedish men and women living in Stockholm
   County A total of 4721 subjects aged 35-56 at baseline were followed for
   8-10 years The population was selected according to family history of
   diabetes which was present for half of the subjects The exposure
   assessment was performed by geographical information systems and based
   on residential history during the period of follow-up Blood pressure was
   measured at baseline and at the end of follow-up Additional information
   regarding diagnosis and treatment of hypertension as well as various
   lifestyle factors was provided by questionnaires In the overall
   population no increased risk for hypertension was found among subjects
   exposed to aircraft noise >= 50 dB(A) L-den relative risk (RR) 1 02
   (95\% CI 0 90-1 15) When restricting the cohort to those not using
   tobacco at the blood pressure measurements a significant risk increase
   per 5 dB(A) of aircraft noise exposure was found in men RR 1 21 (1 05-1
   39) but not in women RR 097 (0 83-1 13) In both sexes combined an
   increased risk of hypertension related to aircraft noise exposure was
   indicated primarily among those reporting annoyance to aircraft noise RR
   1 42 (1 11-1 82) No consistent effect modification was detected for any
   of the cardiovascular risk factors under investigation although a family
   history of diabetes appeared to modify the risk in women In conclusion
   the results suggest an Increased risk of hypertension following
   long-term aircraft noise exposure in men and that subjects annoyed by
   aircraft noise may be particularly sensitive to noise related

Abstract = {{Human concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 ( hCNT3) is a
   broad-selectivity, high-affinity protein implicated in the uptake of
   most nucleoside-derived anticancer and antiviral drugs. Regulated
   trafficking of hCNT3 has been recently postulated as a suitable way to
   improve nucleoside-based therapies. Moreover, the recent identification
   of a putative novel hCNT3-type transporter lacking the first 69 amino
   acids and retained at the endoplasmic reticulum anticipated that the N
   terminus of hCNT3 contains critical motifs implicated in trafficking. In
   the current study, we have addressed this issue by using deletions and
   site-directed mutagenesis and plasma membrane expression and nucleoside
   uptake kinetic analysis. Data reveal that 1) a segment between amino
   acids 50 and 62 contains plasma membrane-sorting determinants in
   nonpolarized cells; 2) in particular, the Val(57)-Thr(58)-Val(59)
   tripeptide seems to be the core of the export signal, whereas acidic
   motifs upstream and downstream of it seem to be important for the
   kinetics of the process; and 3) in polarized epithelia, the
   beta-turn-forming motif (17)VGFQ(20) is necessary for proper apical
   expression of the protein.}},

Abstract = {{In order to find a new type of oxide ion conductor, the electrical
   conduction was measured in the substituted perovskite-type oxides. In
   the present case, LaYO3 was used as a based material with an
   orthorhombic and comparatively large unit cell, and a novel substitution
   method was introduced to intend to increase the concentration of oxide
   ions, e.g., LaY1-xZrxO3+x/2. As a result, the LaYO3-based
   perovskite-type solid solution was found to be formed, where the
   enhanced oxide ion conduction was observed as compared with that of the
   based material. A typical sample was LaY0.95Zr0.05O3.025, the ionic
   conduction of which was 1.2 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 1000 degrees C. Another
   substitution method of La1-xZrxYO3+x/2 resulted in the analogous result.
   Considering these results and the further structural and density

Abstract = {{In this work, we have studied the improvement on the oxidation
   resistance of AlCrN-based coatings by adding a subsurface titanium
   nitride barrier layer. Since oxidation is interrelated with the inward
   diffusion of oxygen into the surface of AlxCr1-xN (x = 0.70) coatings
   and the outward diffusion of Cr to the surface, the oxidation behaviour
   of the aluminium-rich AlCrN coatings can be tuned by designing the
   coating in an appropriate layered structure. The buried depth of the
   embedded layer and the oxidation time were varied, and the changes in
   the AlCrN/TiN depth composition profiles and surface oxidation
   stoichiometry were analysed by means of Glow Discharge Optical Emission
   Spectroscopy (GDOES) and Cross Sectional SEM (X-SEM) maps. It was
   observed that when a TiN diffusion barrier of 300 nm was deposited near
   the top surface (500 nm from the surface) the inhibition of the inward
   diffusion of oxygen and formation of beneficial alumina surface layers
   was promoted and consequently an increase of the oxidation resistance is
   achieved. This is explained in terms of a limited surplus of chromium
   from the coating to the surface. This was corroborated after performing
   experiments using CrN as embedded barrier layer which resulted in a
   continuous surplus of chromium to the surface and the formation of
   Cr-rich oxides. GDOES, in combination with X-SEM elemental maps, was
   proved to be a fast and accurate technique to monitor composition
   in-depth changes during oxidation, providing unique information
   regarding the oxide structure formation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

   To study whether placental weight is related to pre-eclampsia risk,
   independent of offspring birthweight.
   Design
   Registry study.
   Setting
   Medical Birth Registry of Norway.
   Population
   All singleton pregnancies in Norway from 1999 to 2004, 317 688 births.
   Methods
   Placental weight was grouped into deciles of placental weight z-scores.
   The proportion of pregnancies in each placental weight decile was
   calculated by maternal pre-eclampsia status for pregnancies with and
   without small-for-gestational-age (SGA) offspring.
   Main outcome measures
   Pre-eclampsia risk (proportions and odds ratios) according to placental
   weight.
   Results
   In pregnancies with SGA offspring, approximately 60\% of pregnancies
   were in the lowest decile of placental weight, 59.9\% in pregnancies
   with and 61.4\% in pregnancies without pre-eclampsia. Pregnancies
   without SGA offspring were evenly distributed across placental weight
   deciles, but were slightly higher in the lowest (9.5\% versus 8.5\%) and
   highest (11.9\% versus 10.2\%) deciles in pre-eclamptic pregnancies
   compared with pregnancies without pre-eclampsia. A weak U-shaped
   association of placental weight with pre-eclampsia was also estimated as
   odds ratios in pregnancies with SGA, but not without SGA, in the
   offspring.
   Conclusions
   Placental weight is linked to the offspring's birthweight, but is not
   clearly associated with pre-eclampsia risk, suggesting that placental
   weight is not a useful indicator for the placental dysfunction in
   pre-eclampsia.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the application and performance comparison of particle
   swarm optimization (PSO) and Genetic algorithms (GA) optimization
   methods, for power system stabilizer (PSS) design is presented.
   Recently, GA and PSO methods have attracted considerable attention among
   different modern heuristic optimization methods. The GA has been popular
   in academia and the industry, mostly because of its intuitiveness, ease
   of implementation, and the capability to efficiently solve highly
   non-linear, mixed integer optimization problems that are typical of
   complex engineering systems. PSO method is a relatively new heuristic
   search method whose mechanics are inspired by the swarming or
   collaborative behavior of biological populations. Since the two
   approaches are supposed to find a solution to a given objective function
   but utilize different strategies and computational effort, it is
   appropriate to compare their performance. The design objective is to
   increase the power system stability. The design problem of the PSS
   parameters is formulated as an optimization problem and both PSO and GA
   optimization methods are used to search for optimal PSS parameters. The
   two-area multi-machine power system, under a wide range of system
   configurations and operation conditions is investigated to illustrate
   the performance of the both PSO and GA. The performance of both
   optimization methods is compared with the conventional power system
   stabilizer (CPSS) in terms of parameter accuracy and computational time.
   The eigenvalue analysis and non-linear simulation results are presented
   and compared to show the effectiveness of both the methods in optimal
   tuning of PSS, to enhance power system stability. Copyright (c) 2010

Abstract = {{Objective. Congenital anomalies are the leading cause of infant
   mortality in the United States, and congenital heart defects (CHDs) are
   the most common type of birth defects. Recently, 4-dimensional
   ultrasonography (4DUS) with spatiotemporal image correlation (STIC) has
   been introduced for fetal echocardiography. Accumulating evidence
   indicates that 4DUS with STIC may facilitate the examination of the
   fetal heart. Our objectives were to determine the accuracy of 4DUS for
   the diagnosis of CHDs and the agreement among centers. Methods. This
   study included 7 centers with expertise in 4D fetal echocardiography.
   Fetuses with and without confirmed heart defects were scanned between 18
   and 26 weeks, and their volume data sets were uploaded onto a
   centralized file transfer protocol server. Intercenter agreement was
   determined using a kappa statistic for multiple raters. Results. Ninety
   volume data sets were randomly selected for blinded analysis. Overall,
   the median (range) sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative
   predictive values, and false-positive and -negative rates for the
   identification of fetuses with CHDs were 93\% (77\%-100\%), 96\%
   (84\%-100\%), 96\% (83\%-100\%), 93\% (79\%-100\%), 4.8\% (2.7\%-25\%),
   and 6.8\% (5\%-22\%), respectively. The most frequent CHDs were
   conotruncal anomalies (36\%). There was excellent intercenter agreement
   (kappa = 0.97). Conclusions. (1) Four-dimensional volume data sets can
   be remotely acquired and accurately interpreted by different centers.
   (2) Among centers with technical expertise, 4DUS is an accurate and
   reliable method for fetal echocardiography.}},

   representation at the tree level if the space-time coordinates are

   framework, we obtain the differential cross section of neutrino-electron
   scattering. Similar to the magnetic moment effect, one of the NC terms

   Therefore, this scattering provides a chance to achieve a stringent

Abstract = {{To calculate the measurement error of the hourly fetal urine production
   rate (HFUPR) and evaluate the implication of different methods for
   measuring the HFUPR, i.e. ellipsoid versus sum-of-cylinders method.
   The calculation was based on sonographic documentation of the increased
   bladder volumes during the filling phase, the bladder volume measurement
   error and the number and time points of bladder image capture.
   The probability of a false pathological reading was excluded (0\%) with
   the sum-of-cylinders method for gestational ages of a parts per thousand
   yen30 weeks. With the ellipsoid method, the risk was higher. The maximum
   changes which could be exclusively explained by measurement error were
   four to five times greater with the ellipsoid method compared with the
   sum-of-cylinders method.
   The present paper illustrates a careful evaluation of the HFUPR
   measurement error and the implications of using different ultrasound

   entropy flux, is introduced and a general expression for its evaluation

   attributes of heat exchangers. For a given effectiveness, a single
   stream heat exchanger has the absolute maximum entropy flux, and for
   capacity ratios greater than zero, counterflow has the highest entropy
   flux, parallel flow the lowest, and the shell and tube heat exchangers

Abstract = {{Persuasion is at the root of countless social exchanges in which one
   person or group is motivated to have another share its beliefs, desires,
   or behavioral intentions. Here, we report the first three functional
   magnetic resonance imaging studies to investigate the neurocognitive
   networks associated with feeling persuaded by an argument. In the first
   two studies, American and Korean participants, respectively, were
   exposed to a number of text-based persuasive messages. In both Study 1
   and Study 2, feeling persuaded was associated with increased activity in
   posterior superior temporal sulcus bilaterally, temporal pole
   bilaterally, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. The findings suggest a
   discrete set of underlying mechanisms in the moment that the persuasion
   process occurs, and are strengthened by the fact that the results
   replicated across two diverse linguistic and cultural groups.
   Additionally, a third study using region-of-interest analyses
   demonstrated that neural activity in this network was also associated
   with persuasion when a sample of American participants viewed
   video-basedmessages. In sum, across three studies, including two
   different cultural groups and two types of media, persuasion was
   associated with a consistent network of regions in the brain. Activity
   in this network has been associated with social cognition and
   mentalizing and is consistent with models of persuasion that emphasize
   the importance of social cognitive processing in determining the
   efficacy of persuasive communication.}},

   The joint epidemic of HIV and TB in southern Africa is having a profound
   impact on the livelihood of the general population. This study of young
   people dying in a general hospital, serving a big conurbation in South
   Africa, points to a number of problems linked to disease control in the
   community. These include late presentation, low uptake of efforts to
   treat HIV and TB, a high frequency of people with infectious TB in the
   community and anti-TB drug resistance. The arguments are convincingly
   made for an improvement in case detection and earlier institution of
   adequate treatment. The investigative methodology used by the authors

Abstract = {{High cis-1,4 polyisoprene with narrow molecular weight distribution has
   been prepared via coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP)
   using a homogeneous rare earth catalyst composed of neodymium versatate
   (Nd(vers)(3)), dimethyldichlorosilane (Me(2)SiCl(2)), and
   diisobutylaluminum hydride (Al(i-Bu)(2)H) which has strong chain
   transfer affinity is used as both cocatalyst and chain transfer agent
   (CTA). Differentiating from the typical chain shuttling polymerization
   where dual-catalysts/CSA system has been used, one catalyst/CTA system
   is used in this work, and the growing chain swapping between the
   identical active sites leads to the formation of high cis-1,4
   polyisoprene with narrowly distributed molecular weight. Sequential
   polymerization proves that irreversible chain termination reactions are
   negligible. Much smaller molecular weight of polymer obtained than that
   of stoichiometrically calculated illuminates that, differentiating from
   the typical living polymerization, several polymer chains can be
   produced by one neodymium atom. The effectiveness of Al(i-Bu)(2)H as a
   CTA is further testified by much broad molecular weight distribution of
   polymer when triisobutylaluminum (Al(i-Bu)(3)), a much weaker chain
   transfer agent, is used as cocatalyst instead of Al(i-Bu)(2)H. Finally,
   CCTP polymerization mechanism is validated by continuously decreased
   M(w)/M(n) value of polymer when increasing concentration of Al(i-Bu)(2)H
   extra added in the Nd(ver)(3)/Me(2)SiCl(2)/Al(i-Bu)(3) catalyst system.

Abstract = {{Fouling mechanisms of a light conventional crude were investigated by
   characterizing the crude oil, performing fouling tests using a
   bench-scale Alcor hot liquid process simulator (HLPS) unit and
   characterizing fouling deposits by means of elemental analysis, scanned
   electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and
   photoacoustic Infrared spectroscopy (PAS-IR) In addition, a mathematical
   fouling model was developed under a laminar flow regime following
   Epstein s methodology Fouling tests were conducted at different
   temperatures and bulk velocities Although the asphaltene content in the
   crude oil is low, the asphaltenes are still unstable because of a high
   saturate content and this crude oil has a high fouling propensity On the
   basis of the fouling test results, fouling model analysis, and
   characterization of fouling deposits the fouling mechanism of this crude
   oil can be explained as follows In a laminar flow regime, unstable
   asphaltenes transport to the hot surface, become attached to the
   surface, and then, through chemical reactions, form fouling deposits
   Mass transfer of entrained suspended particulates in the crude oil also
   contributes to fouling, although it is not the main cause However under
   turbulent flow conditions, such as those that prevail in industrial
   operations, it is expected that suspended particles would play a greater
   role in fouling}},

Abstract = {{Neutrophils isolated from BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice and treated in vitro
   with anthrax lethal toxin release bioactive neutrophil elastase, a
   proinflammatory mediator of tissue destruction. Similarly, neutrophils
   isolated from mice treated with anthrax lethal toxin in vivo and
   cultured ex vivo release greater amounts of elastase than neutrophils
   from vehicle-treated controls. Direct measurements from murine
   intestinal tissue samples demonstrate an anthrax lethal toxin-dependent
   increase in neutrophil elastase activity in vivo as well. These findings
   correlate with marked lethal toxin-induced intestinal ulceration and
   bleeding in neutrophil elastase(+/+) animals, but not in neutrophil
   elastase(-/-) animals. Moreover, neutrophil elastase(-/-) mice have a
   significant survival advantage over neutrophil elastase(+/+) animals
   following exposure to anthrax lethal toxin, thereby establishing a key
   role for neutrophil elastase in mediating the deleterious effects of
   anthrax lethal toxin. The Journal of Immunology, 2010, 185: 5463-5467.}},

Abstract = {{We present six tree-ring chronologies from Mount Emei and Xinglong
   Mountain, central China, which were used to study tree growth in the
   context of local climate variations and to provide insight into the
   regional response of tree growth to climatic and environmental change.
   The intra- and inter-site running correlations between tree-ring series
   may be related to shifts in environmental stress. Persistently declining
   drought response of tree growth at Mount Emei may be related to the
   moss-induced ``swamping effect{''}. Diebacks at Mount Emei at similar to
   1974 may have been caused by sharply elevated levels of pollutants from
   a forest fire in 1972. Tree growth at the two lower sites at Xinglong
   Mountain shows positive correlations with moisture during a water-year,
   while a negative drought response is seen at the uppermost site. An
   increase in drought sensitivity of tree growth is observed under the
   persistent drying trend in recent decades at the Xinglong Mountain.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES To evaluate the initial results of a prostate cancer
   screening program using mobile units in Brazil.
   METHODS Since 2004, we have conducted a program of prostate cancer
   screening using mobile units across 231 municipalities from 6 Brazilian
   states.
   RESULTS A total of 17 571 men were evaluated by clinical history,
   digital rectal examination (DRE), and serum free and total
   prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. The recommendations for biopsy
   were a PSA level of >= 4.0 ng/mL, DRE findings suspicious for cancer, or
   a PSA level of 2.5-4.0 ng/mL with a percent-free PSA level <15\%. The
   biopsy protocol included 12 biopsy cores from the peripheral zone, 2
   from the transition zone, and additional sampling of suspicious areas.
   The cumulative cancer detection rate was 3.7\%. The main indication for
   biopsy was a PSA level of >= 4.0 ng/mL (51.2\%), with a positive
   predictive value (PPV) of 44.1\%. Another 19.7\% of biopsied men had
   suspicious DRE findings with a normal PSA level (PPV 23.5\%). A
   percent-free PSA level of <15\% in men with a PSA level of 2.5-4.0 ng/mL
   and normal DRE findings yielded a PPV of 31.1\%. The PPV was greater
   (70.9\%) for the 7.1\% of men with both suspicious DRE findings and a
   PSA level of >4.0 ng/mL. Most cancers were Stage T1-T2 (93.4\%), and the
   percentage of Gleason score of >= 7 was 32.5\%. The proportion of
   insignificant cancers according to Epstein's criteria was 13.5\%.
   CONCLUSIONS A mobile prostate cancer screening unit enabled an
   underserved population to gain access to specialized care through the
   public healthcare system. The cancer detection rate in this population
   was similar to those from international studies. UROLOGY 76: 1052-1057,

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Sacral nerve stimulation is offered to patients presenting with
   fecal incontinence of neurological or idiopathic etiology, when medical
   management has failed. The purpose of this study was to investigate the
   causes of surgical revision following sacral nerve stimulation in
   consecutive patients who had received implants.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: From September 2001 to August 2009, 123 patients
   (105 women) of mean age 56 years were operated on for neurological (n =
   104) or idiopathic (n = 19) fecal incontinence. The mean preoperative
   Cleveland Clinic score was 13/20 (range 6/20 to 19/20). Eighty-seven
   patients of 123 had a positive test and underwent stimulator
   implantation. Any stimulator dysfunction was prospectively studied.
   RESULTS: Among the 87 patients, 36 had surgical revision of the device
   for the following reasons: device-related failure due to infection in 4
   (successful reimplant in 4), electrode displacement in 2, electrode
   breakage in 2 (reimplantation of electrode in 4), and dysfunction owing
   to impedance increase of the system in 4; adverse stimulation with pain
   in 7 (stimulator repositioning in 4 and explantation in 3); battery
   depletion either spontaneously (n = 6) or owing to a MRI examination (n
   = 2); total or partial loss of clinical efficacy in 9 (removal of the
   generator and electrode).
   CONCLUSION: Sacral nerve stimulation is a recognized treatment for fecal
   incontinence. The stimulator reoperation rate is high and is caused by
   stimulator dysfunction in 24\% of cases.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare visual acuity and refractive outcomes after Anwar's
   deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) between eyes with and without
   successful big-bubble formation.
   Materials and Methods: In this retrospective comparative study,
   keratoconic eyes undergoing DALK with the big-bubble technique were
   divided into 2 groups: group 1 in which a bared Descemet membrane (DM)
   was achieved and group 2 in which layer-by-layer manual dissection was
   performed because of the lack of big-bubble formation after several
   intrastromal air injections. The 2 groups were compared with respect to
   best spectacle-corrected visual acuity, keratometric astigmatism, and
   refractive error at months 1, 3, 6, and 12, and at least 3 months after
   complete suture removal.
   Results: A total of 123 keratoconic eyes were enrolled. A bared DM was
   successfully achieved in 100 eyes (81.3\%) (group 1), whereas in 23 eyes
   (18.7\%) (group 2), some posterior stroma was left in place. The mean
   follow-up period was 2169 months in group 1 and 2369 months in group 2
   (P = 0.37). Postoperative best spectacle-corrected visual acuity was
   significantly better in group 1 than in group 2 at months 1, 3, 6, and
   12. But, at the final examinations, there was no significant difference
   between the study groups (0.24 +/- 0.21 logarithm of the minimum angle
   of resolution in group 1 and 0.32 +/- 0.14 logarithm of the minimum
   angle of resolution in group 2; P = 0.18). The 2 groups were comparable
   regarding keratometric astigmatism and spherical equivalent refractive
   error throughout the follow-up period.
   Conclusions: Retention of posterior corneal stroma delayed visual
   recovery after DALK using Anwar's technique, but the participants in
   this group ultimately reached the same levels of visual acuity as
   observed in the bared-DM group.}},

Abstract = {{A series of mesoporous titanium dioxide microspheres were calcined at
   various temperatures to improve their photocatalytic activity. The
   prepared catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, TG-DTA, UV-vis,
   and N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements and their photocatalytic
   performances were investigated by photooxidation of gaseous toluene. As
   the results revealed, calcination temperatures obviously influenced the
   surface morphology and photocatalytic activity of the mesoporous TiO2
   microspheres. The noncalcined samples had a mesoporous structure of the
   anatase phase. The sample calcined at 400 degrees C showed a superior
   photocatalytic performance, which had a reaction rate constant 2-fold
   higher than that of P-25. The enhanced photoreactivity is possibly due
   to the synergetic effects of the mesoporous structure and
   light-transmittance ability of the catalysts. Two new reaction
   intermediates were discovered as well and a tentative degradation
   pathway was proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial chromatin organization is emerging as an important mechanism to
   regulate the expression of genes. However, very little is known about
   genome architecture at high-resolution in vivo. Here, we mapped the
   three-dimensional organization of the human Hox clusters with chromosome
   conformation capture (3C) technology. We show that computational
   modeling of 3C data sets can identify candidate regulatory proteins of
   chromatin architecture and gene expression. Hox genes encode
   evolutionarily conserved master regulators of development which strict
   control has fascinated biologists for over 25 years. Proper
   transcriptional silencing is key to Hox function since premature
   expression can lead to developmental defects or human disease. We now
   show that the HoxA cluster is organized into multiple chromatin loops
   that are dependent on transcription activity. Long-range contacts were
   found in all four silent clusters but looping patterns were specific to
   each cluster. In contrast to the Drosophila homeotic bithorax complex
   (BX-C), we found that Polycomb proteins are only modestly required for
   human cluster looping and silencing. However, computational
   three-dimensional Hox cluster modeling identified the insulator-binding
   protein CTCF as a likely candidate mediating DNA loops in all clusters.
   Our data suggest that Hox cluster looping may represent an
   evolutionarily conserved structural mechanism of transcription
   regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Methods. A longitudinal, retrospective, cohort study was designed to
   assess the mean treatment cost of invasive cervical cancer,
   cross-linking clinical and administrative databases. The study was
   performed from the Italian NHS perspective. Costs were estimated using
   DRG charges. All patients with histological diagnosis of invasive
   cervical cancer admitted to Gynecologic Oncology centres of the Catholic
   University of the Sacred Heart between 2000 and 2007 were enrolled.
   Results. Overall, 351 patients (212 with LACC and 139 with ECC) were
   eligible for analysis. The mean direct medical cost by patient was (sic)
   22,200 +/- 21,600 with a significantly higher burden for LACC compared
   with ECC patients ((sic) 28,696 +/- 24,874 versus (sic) 12,329 +/-
   8,726). Radical surgery accounted for (sic)6,851 +/- 1,406, and (sic)
   7,709 +/- 3,710 in ECC and LACC group, respectively; the resulting
   difference achieved a statistical significance. The extent of disease,
   disease progression/recurrence, and length of hospitalization confirmed
   their independent role as cost predictive factors.
   Conclusions. The combined use of administrative and clinical databases
   allowed a feasible assessment of the mean cost induced by the invasive
   cervical cancer. Management of LACC patients was associated with higher
   costs due to the utilization of several therapeutic strategies and more
   frequent appearance of disease progression/recurrence. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is
   constrained by focusing on the baryon-dominated central regions of
   strong lensing galaxies. We study in this Letter the Einstein Cross
   (Q2237+0305), a z = 0.04 barred galaxy whose bulge acts as lens on a
   background quasar. The positions of the four quasar images constrain the
   surface mass density on the lens plane, whereas the surface brightness
   (H-band HST/NICMOS imaging) along with deep spectroscopy of the lens
   (VLT/FORS1) allows us to constrain the stellar mass content, for a range
   of IMFs. We find that a classical single power law (Salpeter IMF)
   predicts more stellar mass than the observed lensing estimates. This
   result is confirmed at the 99 per cent confidence level, and is robust
   to systematic effects due to the choice of population synthesis models,
   the presence of dust or the complex disc/bulge population mix. Our
   non-parametric methodology is more robust than kinematic estimates, as
   we do not need to make any assumptions about the dynamical state of the
   galaxy or its decomposition into bulge and disc. Over a range of
   low-mass power-law slopes (with Salpeter being Gamma = +1.35) we find
   that at a 90 per cent confidence level, slopes Gamma > 0 are ruled out.}},

Abstract = {{Deep H alpha images of portions of a faint 3 degrees x 4 degrees H alpha
   shell centered at l = 159 degrees.6, b = 7 degrees.3 seen on the
   Virginia Tech Spectral Line Survey images revealed the presence of
   several thin emission filaments along its eastern limb. Low-dispersion
   optical spectra of two of these filaments covering the wavelength range
   of 4500-7500 angstrom show narrow H alpha line emissions with velocities
   around -170 +/- 30 km s(-1). Both the morphology and spectra of these
   filaments are consistent with a Balmer-dominated shock interpretation
   and we propose that these optical filaments indicate that the large H
   alpha emission shell is a previously unrecognized supernova remnant
   (SNR). ROSAT All Sky Survey images indicate the possible presence of
   extremely faint, diffuse emission from the shell's central region. The
   shell's location more than 7 degrees off the Galactic plane in a region
   of relatively low interstellar density may account for the lack of any
   reported associated non-thermal radio emissions. The rare discovery of a
   Galactic SNR at optical wavelengths suggests that additional
   high-latitude SNRs may have escaped radio and X-ray detection.}},

Abstract = {{Dehorning of cattle is a routine husbandry practice which improves the
   safety of stock handlers and reduces injury, bruising of carcasses and
   damage to hides, but methods of dehorning are probably painful and
   stressful. The aim of the study was to evaluate the stress response and
   the oxidant /antioxidant equilibrium against dehorning process by
   amputation performed under local anaesthesia in mature cattle. Blood
   malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) concentrations, plasma
   cortisol, nitric oxide (NO), glucose and cholesterol concentrations as
   well as plasma total antioxidant activity (AOA) were measured in 6
   female Holstein cattle one hour before dehorning procedure and
   immediately after. Circulating MDA, NO and cortisol concentrations were
   dramatically increased compared to initial values after dehorning
   whereas AOA and GSH concentrations were significantly depressed. Glucose
   concentrations significantly increased after dehorning, while the plasma
   cholesterol concentrations significantly decreased. These results
   demonstrate that MDA, NO, AOA and GSH are the most powerful markers for
   evaluating the oxidant/antioxidant status in mature cattle and that
   dehoming was a stressful situation leading to an oxidative stress which
   can be amplified by strong glucocorticoid secretion.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Terutroban is a selective prostaglandin endoperoxide (TP)
   receptor antagonist with antithrombotic, antivasoconstrictive and
   antiatherosclerotic properties and is currently in development for
   long-term cardiovascular secondary prevention. Objectives: TAIPAD is an
   international, double-blind, randomized controlled study comparing the
   effects of five dosages of oral terutroban vs. aspirin and placebo on
   platelet aggregation in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients.
   Patients/methods: After 10 day's placebo run-in, included patients (n =
   435; ankle-brachial pressure index, 0.7 +/- 0.1) were randomly allocated
   to aspirin 75 mg day-1, terutroban 1, 2.5, 5, 10 or 30 mg day-1 or
   placebo. On day 5, the placebo group was reallocated to one of the
   terutroban groups for the rest of the study (day 83). Ex vivo platelet
   aggregation induced by the thromboxane analog U46619 (7 mu m) was
   measured 24 h after dosing, as well as platelet aggregation induced by
   arachidonic acid (AA), collagen and ADP. Results: Terutroban
   dose-dependently inhibited U46619-induced platelet aggregation at days 5
   and 83. At day 5, the inhibition was significant vs. placebo for all
   terutroban dosages (P < 0.001). Terutroban (5, 10 and 30 mg day-1) was
   at least as effective as aspirin in inhibiting platelet aggregation
   induced by arachidonic acid (AA), collagen and adenosine diphosphate
   (ADP). Terutroban was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to
   aspirin. Conclusions: In PAD patients, terutroban dose-dependently
   inhibited platelet aggregation 24 h after dosing, and was at least as
   effective as aspirin at 5, 10 and 30 mg day-1. Terutroban was well
   tolerated.}},

Abstract = {{Mating systems of Angiosperms are important determinants of population
   genetic structure and evolutionary potential. Nicotiana longiflora and
   N. plumbaginifolia are self-compatible, sister species, with contrasting
   floral morphology and can be found in allopatry and sympatry in North
   Argentina. In two sympatric and 10 nearby allopatric populations we
   studied their natural interpopulational variability and sympatry effects
   on corolla length and anther-stigma distance. We also estimated seed set
   by selfing and via pollinators using pollination treatments. Both
   corolla length and anther-stigma distance varied significantly among N.
   longiflora, but not among N. plumbaginifolia populations. We did not
   detect an effect of sympatry in either species for any of the floral
   traits studied. Pollination treatments suggest that N. longiflora is
   mainly an outcrosser, although selfing occurs at some extent. Seed set
   attributed to pollinators was significantly higher in N. longiflora
   whereas most seeds in N. plumbaginifolia were sired through
   self-pollination. In N. plumbaginifolia, selfing seems to assure
   reproduction in sympatric populations, where floral visitors have a
   strong preference for N. longiflora. Corolla length was significantly
   negatively correlated with an increase in the percentage of self-seeds
   estimated by pollination treatments. Within N. longiflora, anther-stigma
   distance showed a positive correlation with selfing.}},

Abstract = {{On the Necessity of Gradients at Parking Decks
   When design and executing new car parks or when surveying existing ones
   an often discussed question is whether a gradient of parking decks is
   always necessary In this context different arguments are commonly used
   These arguments have been collected and reviewed under the aspect of
   usability as a car park on the one hand and under the aspect of
   durability of the rein forced construction on the other hand It has been
   shown why in the new DBV Code of Practice Multi Storey and Underground
   Car Parks {[}1] an incline is not required as a standard construction
   method in every case Instead of that it has been concluded that an
   appropriate owners decision on pro or contra an incline would be
   reasonable and necessary based on the above consideration of
   differentiated arguments}},

Abstract = {{BioMNY a bacterial high-affinity biotin transporter is a member of the
   recently defined class of ECF (energy-coupling factor) transporters
   These systems are composed of ABC (ATP-binding-cassette) ATPases
   (represented by BioM in the case of the biotin transporter), a
   universally conserved transmembrane protein (BioN) and a core
   transporter component (BioY), in unknown stoichiometry The quaternary
   structure of BioY, which functions as a low affinity biotin transporter
   in the absence of BloMN, and of BioMNY was investigated by a FRET
   (Forster resonance energy transfer) approach using living recombinant
   Escherichia colt cells To this end, the donor acceptor pair, of Cerulean
   and yellow fluorescent protein respectively, were fused to BioM, BioN
   and BioY The fusion proteins were stable and the protein tags did not
   interfere with transport and ATPase activities Specific donor acceptor
   interactions were characterized by lifetime-based FRET spectroscopy The
   results suggest an oligomeric structure for the solitary BioY core
   transporter and oligomeric forms of BioM and BioY in BioMNY complexes We
   surmise that oligomers of BioY are the functional units of the low- and
   high-affinity biotin transporter in the living cell Beyond its relevance
   for clarifying the supramolecular organization of ECF transporters, the
   results demonstrate the general applicability of lifetime-based FRET
   studies in living bacteria}},

Pages = {{534-550}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We consider the problem of management of an aquatic invader spreading in
   a lake system. We assume that each year the invader can be removed from
   a certain proportion of invaded lakes, which depends on the selected
   intensity of control. Control decisions are generated and compared for
   an optimally controlled system and for a static optimization across
   asymptotic steady states. Control close to eradication of the invasive
   species is always optimal for invasions with relatively high damages,
   low rates of density dependent spread and/or low chance of additional
   random introductions. Control to a highly invaded steady state is
   optimal for those invasions with low relative damages, high chances of
   random introduction and high levels of uncertainty in species location.
   In all other cases the optimal outcome depends upon initial conditions.
   Comparing the relative performance of the optimally controlled system
   and the static optimization demonstrates situations when the differences
   are small and when not. When invasions are acted upon in their later
   stages and across certain parameter combinations a static optimization
   provides a reasonable approximation of an optimally controlled system.
   The flip-side is that optimal policies directed at an invasion in its
   early stages tend to provide significantly savings. The savings vary
   across parameter combinations, yet in these situations little useful
   insight will be generated without consideration of a dynamically
   optimized system. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) remains a controversial
   subject in Earth sciences and beneath cratonic regions appears to be a
   particularly difficult boundary to consistently image Seismic methods
   give different indicators on the velocity structure of the upper mantle
   tomographic models provide estimates of the velocity variations at a
   variety of lateral scales but have limited vertical resolution receiver
   function techniques provide good indication of the depth to seismic
   discontinuities but less information on the absolute velocities This
   study assesses whether the different methods give consistent estimates
   for the depth of the LAB in southern Africa
   Using a surface wave dataset with nearly 12 000 paths in the African
   region new tomographic models of central and southern Africa are
   calculated To show the non-unique nature of tomography results are
   presented for two different parameterisations The models indicate
   varying velocity structure beneath the cratonic regions of central and
   southern Africa which yield estimates of the LAB depth from around 150
   km depth in Tanzania to approximately 200 km depth beneath the Kalahari
   Craton down to depths of 225-250 km beneath parts of the Congo
   At a broad scale these depth estimates are compatible with
   geothermometry from kimberlite xenoliths In regions such as Tanzania the
   kimberlite magmatism is observed to occur along strong horizontal
   gradients in upper mantle seismic velocity structure - potentially edge
   features in lithospheric structure In contrast a detailed comparison
   beneath the Kalahari Craton indicates that in this region and given the
   present resolution of the tomography there is no clear link between the
   kimberlites and velocity gradients However in general the kimberlites do
   not sample the regions of fastest seismic velocities
   The relationship between LAB depth estimates from the tomographic
   modelling and those estimates from receiver functions is not clear
   Results from receiver function techniques beneath southern Africa tend
   to place discontinuities at either shallower (100-150 km) or deeper
   (300-350 km) depths than the thermally defined LAB estimates As such
   particular care should be taken in automatically associating a
   discontinuity from fast to slow seismic velocities as the same location
   as a thermally defined lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (C) 2010

Abstract = {{This article presents a method for automatic seam-tracking in friction
   stir welding (FSW) of lap joints. In this method, tracking is
   accomplished by weaving the FSW tool back-and-forth perpendicular to the
   direction of travel during welding and monitoring force and torque
   signals. Research demonstrates the ability of this method to
   automatically track weld seam positions. Additionally, tensile and
   S-bend test result comparisons demonstrate that weaving most likely does
   not reduce weld quality. Finally, benefits of this weave-based method to
   FSW of lap joints are discussed and methods for incorporating it into
   existing friction stir welding control algorithms (such as axial load
   control) are examined.}},

Abstract = {{Dr Simon Horobin has recently written an interesting critique of an
   earlier essay of the present author that argued the value of reflecting
   on whether one of the scribal hands in Dublin, Trinity College, MS 244,
   may have been that of Adam Pynkhurst or not, the man now celebrated as
   the copyist, amongst other things, of the Ellesmere Chaucer manuscript.
   This essay exposes deficiencies in both the content and argument of his
   critique that dispose of much of its credibility. Furthermore, and more
   importantly, the essay invites wider reflection upon the question of how
   palaeographers and historical linguists decide that one and the same
   scribal hand is present in more than one manuscript. Thus the issues at
   stake, though raised in the local context of a discussion about what
   Adam Pynkhurst may or may not have written, have a far more general and
   far reaching application and concern.}},

Abstract = {{A kinetic model was employed to represent biodiesel production via
   transesterification of vegetable oils. Reaction rate constants found in
   the open literature were used in order to compare the behavior of batch
   and continuous processes. A single continuous stirred tank reactor
   (CSTR) under the usual operation conditions was not capable of achieving
   the same productivity as a batch process. However, when reactors in
   series were used, the continuous process presented a behavior similar to
   batch processes. As a result, it was evidenced that a series of CSTRs
   can be an industrially feasible choice for replacing batch
   transesterification reactors in large scale biodiesel plants. Further,
   it was shown that the loss in productivity caused by changing from batch
   to continuous process can be compensated by means of using higher
   catalyst concentrations. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Trade and asymmetric alliances}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{685-696}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Alliances are usually understood as a way for states to aggregate
   military capabilities in the face of a common threat. From this
   perspective, the willingness of relatively powerful states to form
   alliances with much weaker partners is puzzling. The weaker ally often
   adds little to the stronger state's security and may increase its chance
   of military entanglement. This article presents evidence that
   international trade helps explain these alliances. States that have the
   power to do so have incentives to protect their trading relationships
   against interference from either third states or internal conflict.
   Alliances are one means of providing this protection. This argument
   differs from most other research on trade and alliances, which reverses
   the causal arrow and suggests instead that alliances increase trade.
   Empirical analysis indicates that trade increases the probability of
   alliance formation in major power-minor power dyads and decreases the
   chance that alliances will dissolve. These results are robust to a
   variety of changes in the specification of the model and the data used
   for estimation. They also do not stem from any influence of alliance
   relationships on trade. An analysis of the effect of alliance formation
   on change in the level of bilateral trade turns up no evidence that the
   formation of an alliance increases commerce.}},

   allows remote monitoring of patients, and makes it possible for them to
   receive treatment according to preventive medical protocol. The proposed
   MAS manage the infrastructure of services within the environment both
   efficiently and securely by reasoning, task-planning, and synchronizing
   the data obtained from the sensors. Additionally, this paper presents

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the effect of age, symptom duration, symptom
   presentation, presenting location, and type of acute upper respiratory
   tract infection (URI) on the receipt of inappropriate antibiotic
   prescriptions in adult patients.
   Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted within a U.
   S. Department of Veterans Affairs health system. A total of 500 adult
   patients with acute URI during a 1-year study period were randomly
   selected and evaluated for receipt of antibiotic prescriptions. Patients
   were excluded if they had an indication for antibiotics based on Centers
   for Disease Control and Prevention criteria, concomitant infection, or
   unreviewable patient record. Patients were grouped and compared by age,
   symptom duration, symptom presentation (purulence of secretions),
   presenting location, and type of URI.
   Results: Overall, antibiotics were prescribed to 77\% (219 of 283) of
   patients included in the study. Patients with purulent symptoms received
   a higher proportion of antibiotic prescriptions compared with those
   without purulent symptoms (P < 0.01). Patients seen in routine primary
   care received a lower proportion of antibiotic prescriptions compared
   with those seen in the emergency department or urgent care/primary care
   walk-in clinic (P < 0.01). No significant difference was observed in the
   proportion of antibiotic prescriptions based on symptom duration (P =
   0.99) or age (P = 0.19). Patients with acute sinusitis or bronchitis
   received a higher proportion of antibiotics than those with acute
   pharyngitis or nonspecific URI (P < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Despite evidence-based practice guidelines for the rational
   use of antibiotics in patients with upper respiratory tract infections,
   these conditions are being treated inappropriately. Patient and provider
   factors play a role in the receipt of antibiotics. Further efforts,
   including those by pharmacists, are needed to improve the use of
   antibiotics for acute URI in adult patients.}},

   We detected that the purifying selection is the main force driving the

   CCID in clock machinery. Our survey revealed that period provides
   valuable phylogenetic information that allowed to resolve phylogenetic
   relationships among D. gouveai, D. borborema and D. seriema, which
   composed a polytomic clade in preliminary studies. The analysis of
   patterns of intraspecific variation revealed two different lineages of
   period in D. koepferae, probably reflecting introgressive hybridization
   from D. buzzatii, in concordance with previous molecular data.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to establish normal values for the position of the
   native anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) insertion on the tibia to assist
   in the evaluation of tunnel placement after primary ACL reconstruction
   or prior to revision surgery. One hundred consecutive MRI studies
   performed on patients with a mean age of 29 years (range 20-35) from a
   single MRI facility were reviewed. Patients with prior surgery,
   significant osteoarthritis, acute ACL injury, or evidence of ACL
   reconstruction were excluded. Using digital image software, measurements
   were taken of anterior-most and posterior-most portions of the ACL
   insertion on the tibia. Depth of the tibia was also measured from the
   anterior edge of the tibial plateau to the posterior edge at the origin
   of the posterior cruciate ligament. The anterior insertion of the native
   ACL was located at a mean of 14 +/- A 3 mm (28 +/- A 5\%) from the
   anterior tibial articular margin; the posterior portion of the ACL was
   located at a mean of 31 +/- A 4 mm (63 +/- A 6\%). The tibial insertion
   of the ACL is located between 28 and 63\% of the total
   anterior-posterior depth of the tibia. The results from this study are
   clinically relevant as they provide the clinician with baseline data to
   describe the position of the tibial footprint of the native ACL on
   sagittal MR imaging. Further, this data can be used as a guide to
   evaluate tibial tunnel position prior to primary ACL reconstruction,
   revision ACL surgery, or in ACL-reconstructed patients who continue to
   experience pain, instability, or dysfunction postoperatively.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To compare comorbidity measures and to analyze survival
   rates in men undergoing radical prostatectomy at age 70 years or older.
   Materials and methods: A total of 329 consecutive patients aged 70 or
   more years who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1992 and 2004
   were studied. The patients were stratified by 5 comorbidity
   classifications, tumor stage, Gleason score, and PSA value. Mortality
   was subdivided into overall, comorbid, competing, prostate
   cancer-specific, and second cancer-specific mortality. Competing risk
   and Kaplan-Meier survival curves as well as Mantel-Haenszel hazard
   ratios were calculated. Comparisons were made with the log-rank test.
   Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the independent
   significance of prognostic variables.
   Results: Considering the dose-response relationship, P values and the
   discrimination of 2 risk groups, the Charlson score was the best of the
   tested comorbidity classifications in men selected for radical
   prostatectomy at age 70 years or older. Beside the tumor-related factors
   Gleason score 8-10 (hazard ratio 2.61, P = 0.0234) and lymph node
   involvement (hazard ratio 2.89, P = 0.0145), a Charlson score of I or
   greater was identified as an independent predictor of overall mortality
   (hazard ratio 2.16, P = 0.0441). Without comorbidity or adverse
   tumor-related risk factors, elderly men had an excellent 10-year overall
   survival probability (77\% to 100\%, depending on the classification
   used), whereas 10-year overall survival was distinctly poor in the
   presence of lymph node metastases (30\%) or Gleason score 8-10 disease
   (33\%).
   Conclusions: The Charlson comorbidity score may be used to stratify men
   selected for radical prostatectomy at age 70 years or older and to
   estimate long-term survival probability. In the absence of adverse
   tumor-related parameters or serious comorbidity, long-term survival
   probability is excellent in this subgroup. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{This paper gives practical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of
   chronic pancreatitis. Statements have been elaborated by working teams
   of experts, by searching for and analysing the literature, and submitted
   to a consensus process by using a Delphi modified procedure. The
   statements report recommendations on clinical and nutritional approach,
   assessment of pancreatic function, treatment of exocrine pancreatic
   failure and of secondary diabetes, treatment of pain and prevention of
   painful relapses. Moreover, the role of endoscopy in approaching
   pancreatic pain, pancreatic stones, duct narrowing and dilation, and
   complications was considered. Recommendations for most appropriate use
   of various imaging techniques and of ultrasound endoscopy are reported.
   Finally, a group of recommendations are addressed to the surgical
   treatment, with definition of right indications, timing, most
   appropriate procedures and techniques in different clinical conditions
   and targets, and clinical and functional outcomes following surgery. (C)

   spruce strands (Picea abies Karst.) embedded in aaEuro-aEuro-cement

   of varying thickness were used whereas aaEuro-aEuro-strong influence of

   (800aEuro-mu m) showed negative effect on bonding strength which is due
   to the swelling effect. The treatment of thin strands (400aEuro-mu m)
   showed that using wet strands (similar to aEuro-90\% moisture content)
   leads to the best results compared to untreated dry (12\%) strands. By
   addition of setting accelerators (ammonium chloride) bonding strength of
   wet strands was even improved. Furthermore, effects of hot water and
   sodium hydroxide extraction as well as sodium silicate treatment were
   examined.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{It is unknown whether the abnormalities in brain structure and function
   observed in dyslexic readers are congenital or arise later in
   development. Analyzing the 2 components of gray matter volume separately
   may help in differentiating these possibilities. Gray matter volume is
   the product of cortical surface area, determined during prenatal brain
   development, and cortical thickness, determined during postnatal
   development. For this study, 16 adults with a history of phonological
   dyslexia and 16 age- and gender-matched controls underwent magnetic
   resonance imaging and an extensive battery of tests of reading-related
   skills. Cortical surface area and gray matter volume measures of the
   whole brain, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the fusiform gyrus were
   similarly related to phonological skills and a history of dyslexia.
   There was no relationship between cortical thickness and phonological
   skills or history of dyslexia. Because cortical surface area reflects
   cortical folding patterns determined prenatally, this suggests that
   brain differences in dyslexia are rooted in early cortical development
   and are not due to compensatory changes that occur during postnatal
   development and would be expected to influence cortical thickness. This
   study demonstrates the importance of examining the separate components
   of gray matter volume when studying developmental abnormalities.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate clinical targeting precision and assess patient
   movement data during fiducial-free, single-fraction spinal radiosurgery
   with the Cyberknife (CK).
   Methods and Materials: Image-guided spine tracking accuracy was tested
   using two phantoms. Movement patterns (three translations, roll, pitch
   and yaw) were obtained from log files of 260 patient treatments (47
   cervical, 89 thoracic, 90 lumbar, and 34 pelvic/sacral). For two
   treatments (average and maximum motion scenario), we added offsets to
   all beams according to recorded patient movements and recalculated the
   delivered dose distribution to simulate the dosimetric impact of
   intrafraction motion.
   Results: Phantom spine position was registered with an accuracy of <0.2
   mm for translational and <0.3 degrees for rotational directions.
   Residual patient motion yielded mean targeting errors per beam of 0.28
   +/- 0.13 mm (X), 0.25 +/- 0.15 mm (Y), 0.19 +/- 0.11 mm (Z) and 0.40 +/-
   0.20 degrees (roll), 0.20 +/- 0.08 degrees (pitch), and 0.19 +/- 0.08
   degrees (yaw). Spine region had little influence on overall targeting
   error, which was <1 mm for more than 95\% of treatments (median, 0.48
   mm). In the maximum motion case, target coverage decreased by 11.7\%
   (from 92.1\% to 90.4\%) for the 20-Gy prescription isodose. Spinal cord
   volume receiving more than 8 Gy increased slightly, from 2.41 to 2.46
   cm(3).
   Conclusions: Submillimeter targeting precision was obtained for
   fiducial-free spinal radiosurgery despite patient motion. Patient motion
   has little effect on the delivered dose distribution when image-guided
   correction of beam aiming is employed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We report the analysis of a Japanese male using high-throughput
   sequencing to x40 coverage. More than 99\% of the sequence reads were
   mapped to the reference human genome. Using a Bayesian decision method,
   we identified 3,132,608 single nucleotide variations (SNVs). Comparison
   with six previously reported genomes revealed an excess of singleton
   nonsense and nonsynonymous SNVs, as well as singleton SNVs in conserved
   non-coding regions. We also identified 5,319 deletions smaller than 10
   kb with high accuracy, in addition to copy number variations and
   rearrangements. De novo assembly of the unmapped sequence reads
   generated around 3 Mb of novel sequence, which showed high similarity to
   non-reference human genomes and the human herpesvirus 4 genome. Our
   analysis suggests that considerable variation remains undiscovered in
   the human genome and that whole-genome sequencing is an invaluable tool

Abstract = {{When people anticipate that future temptations may undermine valued
   goals, they use a number of prospective self-control strategies (or
   ``precommitment devices{''}) to increase the likelihood of future
   self-control success. Little is known, however, about the conditions
   under which people are more or less likely to use them. Drawing from
   construal level theory (e.g., Trope \& Liberman, 2003), we argue that
   people are more likely to engage in prospective self-control when they
   construe events more abstractly (at higher-level construals). Results
   from two experiments demonstrated that higher-level construals promote
   use of two well-documented prospective strategies: choice bracketing and
   self-imposing punishment. Higher-level construals thus appear to enhance
   people's efforts to protect their valued goals from anticipated
   temptations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   rat tibiae and solidified in situ. After 6 and 12 weeks, tibiae were
   removed for evaluation of osteoconductivity using Stevenel's Blue and
   Van Gieson's picrofuchsin staining. The affinity indices reflecting the
   osteoconductivity of T10 and T20 were 33.4 +/- 12.8 and 56.5 +/- 14.1 at
   6 weeks, and 67.0 +/- 18.0 and 65.0 +/- 51.7 at 12 weeks, respectively,
   and were significantly higher than for PMMAc (p < 0.01). The compressive
   and flexural strengths of T5, T10, and T20 exceeded those of PMMAc,
   whereas the elasticity did not differ significantly. Scanning electron
   microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis showed that the
   micron-sized and spherical titania particles were well dispersed in T20
   and were exposed on the surface of the cement that made direct contact
   with bone. These results show that T20 is a promising bioactive bone
   cement for use in prosthesis fixation. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract = {{Noxious stimuli cause prompt phosphorylation of extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the spinal dorsal horn that contributes
   to facilitation of pain sensation and is often used as an immediate
   marker for excitation of spinal neurons following somatic and colonic
   nociception. Here we asked whether two distinct pronociceptive stimuli
   with proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) agonists and hydrogen
   sulfide (H2S) in the pancreas cause phosphorylation of ERK in the spinal
   dorsal horn and also examined involvement of their possible downstream
   signaling molecules, transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1)
   and T-type Ca2+ channels, respectively. Capsaicin (a TRPV1 agonist),
   trypsin (an endogenous PAR2 agonist), SLIGRL-NH2 (a PAR2-activating
   peptide), and NaHS (an H2S donor) were infused into the pancreatic duct
   in anesthetized rats, and phosphorylated ERK in the spinal cord was
   detected by immunohistochemistry. Intraductal administration of
   capsaicin and trypsin caused prompt phosphorylation of ERK in the
   superficial layers of T9, but not T5 or T12, spinal dorsal horn.
   SLIGRL-NH2 and NaHS, administered in the same manner, also produced ERK
   phosphorylation in the corresponding spinal regions. Mibefradil, a
   T-type Ca2+ channel blocker, abolished the phosphorylation of ERK caused
   by intraductal NaHS but not SLIGRL-NH2. In contrast, capsazepine, an
   inhibitor of TRPV1, suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK caused by
   intraductal SLIGRL-NH2 but not NaHS. Our data thus demonstrate that
   pancreatic pronociceptive stimuli with PAR2 agonists and H2S cause ERK
   phosphorylation in the spinal dorsal horn, through activation of TRPV1
   and T-type Ca2+ channels, respectively, and that those two
   pronociceptive pathways are independent of each other. (c) 2010

   also analyzed. Gram-positive catalase-positive cocci were the
   predominant flora in the muscles affected with hollow defect, with the
   main species being Staphyloccocus equorum, Staphylococcus nepalensis and
   Staphylococcus xylosus. Lactic acid bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes and
   Staphylococcus aureus were <2 log CFU g(-1) and Salmonella spp. was not
   detected. Volatile profile of samples affected with hollow defect had
   higher amounts of compounds such as esters, pyrazines, sulfurs and

   compounds and the hollow defect intensity. Moisture content was lower
   and pH values were higher in affected areas than in unaffected areas.

Abstract = {{The genetic barrier to development of raltegravir resistance is
   considered to be low, requiring at least one primary integrase mutation:
   Y143C, Q148H/K/R or N155H to confer raltegravir therapy failure.
   However, during continued raltegravir treatment failure, additional
   mutations may be selected. In a patient failing raltegravir therapy, we
   investigated the impact of multiple integrase mutations on resistance
   and viral replication. Furthermore, in vivo fitness was investigated
   during failure of raltegravir-containing highly active antiretroviral
   therapy and after raltegravir was discontinued from the regimen.
   Patient-derived viral integrase genes were cloned into a reference
   strain. These recombinant viruses were used to determine the
   contribution of individual integrase mutations to raltegravir resistance
   and replication capacity in vitro. To determine in vivo fitness, the
   relative proportion of specific integrase mutations was monitored over
   time by in-depth clonal analysis of the viral integrase at baseline,
   during and after raltegravir treatment.
   Raltegravir therapy failure was associated with the initial selection of
   primary resistance mutation N155H. This mutation conferred a 3.8-fold
   reduction in raltegravir susceptibility and a severe reduction in viral
   replication. Acquisition of integrase mutation Q95K increased resistance
   (6.2-fold) and partly restored viral replication. Selection of a third
   mutation, V151I, further increased raltegravir resistance (20-fold), but
   decreased viral replication. After prolonged raltegravir interruption,
   raltegravir resistance mutations were lost, demonstrating the reduced
   replication capacity of the resistant virus.
   We describe selection of Q95K as a secondary resistance mutation during
   raltegravir therapy failure. In the background of N155H, Q95K enhances
   raltegravir and elvitegravir resistance and improves the impaired
   replication of the virus.}},

Abstract = {{A non-lipophilic, coryneform bacterium isolated from a patient's wound
   caused by a dog bite was characterized by phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and
   molecular genetic methods. Chemotaxonomic features suggested assignment
   of the unknown bacterium to the genus Corynebacterium. The isolate
   exhibited the following unusual features, which made it possible to
   phenotypically differentiate it from all other medically relevant
   corynebacteria: the Gram stain showed some very filamentous rods (>15 mu
   m in length); some cells exhibited branching; colonies were domed and
   adherent to agar; the micro-organism was positive for pyrazinamidase,
   beta-glucosidase, alpha-glucosidase and trypsin but negative for
   beta-galactosidase. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and partial rpoB gene
   sequencing showed that the closest phylogenetic relative,
   Corynebacterium freiburgense, exhibited more than 1.9 \% and 17.9 \%
   divergence with the unknown bacterium, respectively. Based on both
   phenotypic and molecular genetic data, it is proposed that the isolate
   should be classified as a novel species, Corynebacterium canis sp. nov.,
   with the type strain 1170(T) (=CCUG 58627(T) =DSM 45402(T)).}},

Title = {{Operative Strategy for Descending and Thoracoabdominal Aneurysm Repair

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background. Our study aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of preoperative
   intraarterial computed tomographic angiography to identify the
   Adamkiewicz artery (AKA). We also aimed to investigate the impact of
   identification of the AKA on the strategy for preventing spinal cord
   injury.
   Methods. Thirty-seven patients (24 cases of descending aortic aneurysms
   and 13 cases of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms), were studied.
   Average age was 63.8 years old. A pigtail catheter was inserted into the
   descending aorta and its tip was located immediately below the left
   subclavian artery. Subsequently, intraarterial computed tomographic
   angiography was performed and the segmental artery to the AKA was
   identified. Aneurysms were replaced electively with prosthetic graft in
   all cases. In cases where the aortic segment that supplied the AKA was
   cross-clamped, the identified segmental artery-AKA was selectively
   perfused. In these cases, the segmental artery-AKA was reconstructed
   with an interposition graft.
   Results. Intraarterial computed tomographic angiography successfully
   identified the segmental artery-AKA in all patients. The average number
   of AKA observed per patient was 1.3 +/- 0.6 AKAs. Selective perfusion of
   preoperatively identified segmental artery-AKAs was performed in 11
   cases. The average number of reconstructed segmental arteries was 0.5 in
   descending aortic aneurysms and 1.7 in thoracoabdominal aortic
   aneurysms. Although paraparesis occurred in two patients (5\%), the
   remaining 35 patients did not suffer spinal cord injury.
   Conclusions. Intraarterial computed tomographic angiography reliably
   identifies the segmental-AKA. Furthermore, selective perfusion of the
   segmental arteryAKA, based on accurate preoperative identification,
   might be one option for preventing intraoperative spinal cord ischemia.

Abstract = {{Passive mode locking (PML) regimes in two-section lasers with quantum
   wells in broad waveguides operating at lambda = 1.06 mu m have been
   studied. The room temperature spectrum of the saturable absorber section
   retains exciton peak at the absorption edge, which decreases in
   amplitude shifts toward longer wavelengths by 18 meV when the reverse
   bias voltage is varied from 0 to 14 V. The PML regime is observed at
   relatively large voltages (above 9 V) that are necessary to compensate
   for the effect of band broadening in the gain section by the Stark shift
   of absorption in the reversely biased section. The PML regime exists,
   beginning with threshold values of the pumping current, and is
   characterized by a narrow RF signal with a 20-kHz linewidth. As the
   reverse bias voltage on the absorber section is increased, a
   low-frequency amplitude modulation superimposes on the mode-locked laser
   radiation.}},

Abstract = {{Voltage-gated ion channels couple conformational change(s) of the
   voltage-sensing domain to those of the opening of an intracellular gate
   to allow ionic conduction. Much larger positive potentials are required
   to couple these conformational changes to the opening of the gate of
   Shaker K+ channels with the concurrent mutations V369I, I372L, and S376T
   (ILT) at the N-terminal end of the S4 segment. We used cut-open oocyte
   voltage clamp to study the biophysical and thermodynamical properties of
   heterotetrameric concatemerized channels with different stoichiometries
   of ILT mutations. The voltage-sensing domains of ILT mutant channels
   require smaller depolarization to activate but their intracellular gate
   does not immediately follow the movement of the voltage-sensing domain,
   requiring larger depolarization to open. Our results demonstrate that
   each subunit contributes equally to the rightward shift of the
   conductance-voltage relationship and that a single ILT-containing
   subunit is sufficient to induce a large enthalpic and entropic barrier,
   limiting opening of the intracellular gate.}},

   is shown that time delay can destabilize the otherwise stable non-zero

Abstract = {{We present a second paper of a complete characterization of stars whose
   low-depth transits were discovered by the OGLE-III campaign to select
   the most promising candidates for spectroscopic confirmation. This paper
   follows a similar analysis to one previously performed in Gallardo et
   al. (2005, A\&A, 431, 707). We present new optical and near-IR
   photometry and derive physical parameters such as effective temperature
   (T-eff), distance (d), the stellar radii (R-{*}), and the companion
   radii (R-c). We selected eight M (2800 K <= T-eff <= 3850 K) or K (3850
   K <= T-eff <= 5150 K) stellar objects as potential candidates to host
   exoplanets, even though, considering the radii of their companions, only
   the stars OGLE-TR-61, OGLE-TR-74, OGLE-TR-123, and OGLE-TR-173 are the
   most promising M-type transit candidates to host planets. A confirmation
   of the planetary nature of any of these objects would be extremely
   valuable in providing a means of characterizing planets transiting
   M-type dwarfs with effective temperatures down to only 2900 K.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Sufficiently powered studies to investigate
   the CKD prevalence are few and do not cover southern Europe.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements: For the INCIPE study,
   6200 Caucasian patients >= 40 years old were randomly selected in
   northeastern Italy in 2006. Laboratory determinations were centralized.
   The albumin to creatinine ratio in urine and estimated GFR from
   calibrated creatinine (SCr) were determined. A comparison with 2001
   through 2006 NHANES surveys was performed.
   Results: Prevalence of CKD was 13.2\% in northeastern (NE) Italy (age
   and gender standardized to the U.S. 2007 Caucasian population).
   Prevalence of CKD in U.S. Caucasians is higher (20.3\%), the major
   difference being in CKD 3. Risk factors for CKD are more prevalent in
   the United States than in Italy. With use of CKD 3a and 3b stages, CKD
   prevalence decreased in NE Italy (8.5\%) and in the United States
   (12.8\%).
   Conclusions: The prevalence of CKD is high in NE Italy, but lower than
   that in the United States. A large part of the difference in CKD
   prevalence in NE Italy versus that in the United States is due to the
   different prevalence of CKD 3. The higher prevalence of a number of
   renal risk factors in persons from the United States explains in part
   the different dimensions of the CKD problem in the two populations. Clin

Abstract = {{In many applications, decision making under uncertainty often involves
   two steps-prediction of a certain quality parameter or indicator of the
   system under study and the subsequent use of the prediction in choosing
   actions. The prediction process is severely challenged by highly dynamic
   environments that particularly involve sequential decision making, such
   as air traffic control at airports in which congestion prediction is
   critical for smooth departure operations. Taxi-out time of a flight is
   an excellent indicator of surface congestion and is a quality parameter
   used in the assessment of airport delays. The regression, queueing, and
   moving average models have been shown to perform poorly in predicting
   taxi-out times because they are slow in adapting to the changing airport
   dynamics. This paper presents an approximate dynamic programming
   approach (reinforcement learning, RL) to taxi-out time prediction. The
   taxi-out prediction performance was tested on flight data obtained from
   the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Aviation System Performance
   Metrics (ASPM) database on Detroit International (DTW), Washington
   Reagan National (DCA), Boston (BOS), New York John F. Kennedy (JFK) and
   Tampa International (TPA) airports. For example, at the Boston airport
   (presented in detail) the prediction accuracy by RI model was 14\%
   higher than the queueing model and 39\% higher than a running-average
   model. In general, the RL model was 35-50\% more accurate than the
   regression model for all of the above airports. Copyright (c) 2010 John

Abstract = {{A fully coupled compressible multi-phase flow solver was developed to
   effectively design a large furnace for producing large-size SiC

   included. A small and experimental furnace is used to validate the
   solver. First, the essentiality of 2D flow calculation and the
   significance of incorporating buoyancy effect and gas convection, the
   Stefan effect, and flow interaction between argon gas and species were
   investigated by numerical results. Then the effects of argon gas on
   deposition rate, growth rate, graphitization on the powder source, and
   supersaturation and stoichiometry on the seed were analyzed. Finally,
   the advantages of an extra chamber design were explained, and
   improvement of growth rate was validated by the present solver. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{A set of k balls B-1,...,B-k in a Euclidean space is said to cover a
   collection of lines if every line intersects some ball. We consider the
   k-center problem for lines in high-dimensional space: Given a set of n
   lines l = \{l(1),...,l(n)\} in R-d, find k balls of minimum radius which
   cover l. We present a 2-approximation algorithm for the cases k = 2, 3
   of this problem, having running time quasi-linear in the number of lines
   and the dimension of the ambient space.
   Our result for 3-clustering is strongly based on a new result in
   discrete geometry that may be of independent interest: a Helly-type
   theorem for collections of axis-parallel ``crosses{''} in the plane. The
   family of crosses does not have finite Helly number in the usual sense.
   Our Helly theorem is of a new type: it depends on epsilon-contracting
   the sets.
   In statistical practice, data is often incompletely specified; we
   consider lines as the most elementary case of incompletely specified
   data points. Clustering of data is a key primitive in nonparametric
   statistics. Our results provide a way of performing this primitive on
   incomplete data, as well as imputing the missing values.}},

Abstract = {{Temporary transfemoral cardiac pacing is widely accepted, but is
   associated with high incidence of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis
   (DVT), which in turn is associated with restricted patient mobility. The
   passive-fixation lead typically used in this procedure restricts patient
   mobility during implantation.
   An active-fixation lead allowing normal ambulation was prospectively
   assessed in 47 consecutive patients. Prior to explantation, venous
   duplex ultrasound was performed to determine DVT incidence, with the
   contralateral leg as control. To reduce possible false negatives,
   ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy was also performed (n = 42). Patient
   mobility during implantation was classified as high (n = 29), moderate
   (n = 6), or low (n = 12). Anticoagulants were limited to cases meeting
   standard guidelines. Asymptomatic DVT was diagnosed in three patients
   (6.4\%), compared with 25-39\% reported using standard passive-fixation
   leads. Furthermore, all of these patients had low mobility during the
   implantation period. No post-implantation lung scan showed high
   probability of pulmonary embolism.
   In the 75\% of patients with moderate or high mobility, there were no
   DVT cases. The 6.4\% DVT incidence was limited to patients with low
   mobility and was significantly lower than the norm for this procedure. A
   larger, randomized study is needed to confirm the benefits of the
   mobility allowed by an active-fixation lead.}},

Abstract = {{The present analysis reveals the social comparison bias - a bias that
   emerges from the social comparison process and taints recommendations.
   We hypothesize that people who have high standing on a relevant
   dimension (e.g., quantity of publications) begin to protect their social
   comparison context by making recommendations that prevent others, who
   might surpass them on the relevant dimension, from entering their
   comparison context. Studies 1 and 2 instantiate this effect in both
   hypothetical and real decision situations, showing that people tend not
   to recommend individuals who surpass them on the relevant dimension on
   which they have high standing. Finally, Study 3, in a sample of real
   employees, links the effect to one's concern for protecting self-esteem.
   Theoretical and organizational implications are discussed. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Objectives. To evaluate marginal integrity of direct resin composite
   restorations before and after thermo-mechanical loading in vitro, and
   before and after 6 years of clinical service in a prospective clinical
   trial.
   Methods. For the in vitro part, MO cavities with the proximal box
   beneath the cemento-enamel junction were prepared in 32 extracted human
   third molars. The specimens were randomly assigned to four groups (n =
   8) and received bonded resin composite restorations (two groups each
   Grandio bonded with Solobond M and Tetric Ceram bonded with Syntac).
   Specimens were subjected to three different aging protocols: 6-year
   water storage (WS), thermo-mechanical loading (TML; 100,000 x 50 N; 2500
   x +5/+ 55 degrees C), and 6-year water storage plus thermo-mechanical
   loading (WS + TML). Initially and after aging, marginal qualities in
   enamel and dentin were evaluated using replicas at 200 x magnification
   (SEM). For the in vivo part, 30 patients received 68 direct resin
   composite restorations of the same materials in a prospective clinical
   trial. Replicas of 11 selected subjects per group were assessed for
   marginal quality under a SEM at 200x.
   Results. in vitro, all initial results showed nearly 100\% gap-free
   margins. For TML, percentages of gap-free margins dropped to 87-90\% in
   enamel and to 58-66\% in dentin (p < 0.05). For WS, enamel margins still
   were at 97-99\% whereas dentin margins exhibited 67-75\% gap-free
   margins, and for WS + TML, enamel margins were at 85-87\% and dentin
   margins at 42-52\% gap-free margins. In vivo, gap-free enamel margins
   were reduced from initially 86-90\% to 74-80\% after 6 years of clinical
   service (p < 0.05). Proximally exposed dentin margins were not
   recordable by impressions, however, clinically no considerable problems
   like recurrent caries or discolorations were detected.
   Significance. In vitro, hydrolytic degradation supports mechanical
   fatigue in dentin-composite bonds over time. In vivo, wear phenomena are
   superimposing marginal quality aspects. Gaps between enamel and resin
   composite did not play a major role. (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {{Organic solar cells, both in the hybrid dye sensitized technology and in
   the full organic polymeric technology, are a promising alternative that
   could supply solar electricity at a cost much lower than other more

   life cycle analysis of the laboratory production of a typical bulk
   heterojunction organic solar cell and compares this result with those
   obtained for the industrial production of other photovoltaic
   technologies. Also a detailed material inventory from raw materials to
   final photovoltaic module is presented, allowing us to identify
   potential bottlenecks in a future supply chain for a large industrial
   output. Even at this initial stage of laboratory production, the energy
   payback time and CO2 emission factor for the organic photovoltaic
   technology is of the same order of other inorganic photovoltaic
   technologies, demonstrating that there is plenty of room for improvement
   if the fabrication procedure is optimized and scaled up to an industrial

   decreasing the likelihood of recidivism. Despite the existing barriers
   to parental involvement in the juvenile justice system, parents should
   be informed of their youth's educational rights in school, juvenile

Abstract = {{Applying certain visualization techniques to datasets described on
   unstructured grids requires the interpolation of variables of interest
   at arbitrary locations within the dataset's domain of definition.
   Typical solutions to the problem of finding the grid element enclosing a
   given interpolation point make use of a variety of spatial subdivision
   schemes. However, existing solutions are memory-intensive, do not scale
   well to large grids, or do not work reliably on grids describing complex
   geometries. In this paper, we propose a data structure and associated
   construction algorithm for fast cell location in unstructured grids, and
   apply it to the interpolation problem. Based on the concept of bounding
   interval hierarchies, the proposed approach is memory-efficient, fast
   and numerically robust. We examine the performance characteristics of
   the proposed approach and compare it to existing approaches using a
   number of benchmark problems related to vector field visualization.
   Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach can successfully
   accommodate large datasets, and discuss application to visualization on
   both CPUs and GPUs.}},

Title = {{Medication Adherence in Adolescents With Behaviorally-acquired HIV:
   Evidence for Using a Multimethod Assessment Protocol}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{47}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The present study investigated medication adherence in an
   understudied population, adolescents with behaviorally acquired HIV, to
   improve upon prior methodological limitations using concurrent
   collection of HIV health status markers (viral load {[}VL]; percentage
   CD4 count {[}CD4\%]) and multimethod adherence assessment (pill count,
   missed doses, off-schedule dosing).
   Methods: Participants: A total of 60 youth with behaviorally acquired
   HIV receiving routine care in a multidisciplinary specialty clinic in
   the Mid-Southern United States. Adherence was assessed by routine
   pharmacy pill count and self-reported 3-day recall of doses missed and
   doses taken off-schedule, collected concurrently with clinically
   obtained VL and CD4\% indicators. Adherence measures were evaluated as
   predictors of VL and CD4\% using logistic regression analyses.
   Results: Adherence difficulties were detected by all assessment methods,
   with off-schedule dosing appearing the most problematic (29.4\% taken
   off-schedule). Self-report of doses missed (p = .038) and off-schedule
   dosing (p = .021) significantly predicted detectable VL. For each
   percent increase in nonadherence by off-schedule dosing, there was a 2\%
   increased likelihood of detectable VL. No adherence measure
   significantly correlated with CD4\%; pharmacy pill count did not relate
   to either health status marker.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to document multimethod medication
   adherence measurement in a defined sample of adolescents with
   behaviorally acquired HIV, using imposed concurrent collection of CD4\%
   and VL. Adherence difficulties were detected regardless of assessment
   strategy, with off-schedule dosing representing the greatest
   nonadherence behavior. Both 3-day recall methods predicted VL. Further
   investigation of adherence in larger samples of youth with behaviorally
   acquired HIV is needed to better understand the relationship to CD4\%
   suppression. (C) 2010 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All

Volume = {{93}},

Pages = {{275-286}},

Abstract = {{This paper has two related objectives. First, it seeks to identify the
   key determinants of some policies that have been at the heart of the
   reforms of the telecommunications industry in developing countries,
   namely, liberalization, privatization, and the (re)structuring of
   regulation. Second, it attempts to estimate the extent to which these
   policies have translated into actual deployment of telecommunications
   infrastructure. This simultaneous investigation is conducted by means of
   an econometric analysis of a 1985-1999 time-series-cross-sectional
   database on 86 developing countries. Sectoral as well as institutional
   and financial factors are found to be important determinants of the
   actual reforms implemented. We uncover a positive relationship between
   the decision to introduce competition in the digital cellular segment
   and the growth of the fixed-line segment, suggesting that these two
   segments have benefited from each other. We also find that countries
   facing increasing institutional risk and financial constraints are more
   likely to introduce competition in the digital cellular segment and to
   privatize the fixed-line incumbent, these policies being economically
   attractive to both investors and governments. In turn, these policies
   are those that enhance the deployment of fixed-line infrastructure. In
   contrast, competition in the analogue cellular segment and the creation
   of a separate regulator seem to be relatively less attractive policies
   as they are found to be less likely to be introduced in countries facing
   increasing institutional risk and budget constraints. Their impact on
   fixed network deployment is found to be negative or non significant. (C)

Abstract = {{A rich coral-associated decapod assemblage is recorded from the `Depiru
   Beds' of the upper part of the Upper Coralline Limestone (Messinian,
   Upper Miocene), from the island of Malta. Nineteen species within 17
   genera have been discovered, where 14 genera are new for Malta. Four new
   species are described, namely Micippa annamariae sp. nov., Pilumnus
   scaber sp. nov., Panopeus muelleri sp. nov. and Herbstia melitense sp.
   nov. Herbstia melitense sp. nov. constitutes the first record of the
   genus from the fossil record in the Mediterranean region. This discovery
   more than doubles the number of known fossil decapod species from Malta.
   The fossil bivalve Jouannetia (J.) semicaudata Des Moulins, 1830 and the
   extant decapod Maja goltziana D'Oliveira, 1888, are also recorded for
   the first time from Malta. Other Neogene coral-associated decapod
   assemblages are investigated and correlated with the new assemblage from
   Malta. The migration of taxa between the Mediterranean region and the
   Paratethys, particularly during the Lower Badenian (Langhian), is
   evidenced by the strong affinity of the Maltese decapod assemblage with
   that of the Middle Miocene Badenian assemblages from Hungary, Poland and
   Ukraine. Upper Miocene, Messinian assemblages from Spain, Algeria and
   Morocco are also similar to that from Malta.}},

Abstract = {{Cattle production plays a significant role in terms of world food
   production. Nearly 82\% of the world's 1.2 billion cattle can be found
   in developing countries. An increasing demand for meat in developing
   countries has seen an increase in intensification of animal industries,
   and a move to cross-bred animals. Heat tolerance is considered to be one
   of the most important adaptive aspects for cattle, and the lack of
   thermally-tolerant breeds is a major constraint on cattle production in
   many countries. There is a need to not only identify heat tolerant
   breeds, but also heat tolerant animals within a non-tolerant breed.
   Identification of heat tolerant animals is not easy under field
   conditions. In this study, panting score (0 to 4.5 scale where 0 = no
   stress and 4.5 = extreme stress) and the heat load index (HLI) {[}HLIBG
   < 25A degrees C = 10.66 + 0.28 x rh + 1.30 x BG - WS; and, HLI (BG > 25A
   degrees C) = 8.62 + 0.38 x rh + 1.55 x BG - 0.5 x WS + e((2.4 - WS)),
   where BG = black globe temperature (C-o), rh = relative humidity
   (decimal form), WS = wind speed (m/s) and e is the base of the natural
   logarithm] were used to assess the heat tolerance of 17 genotypes
   (12,757 steers) within 13 Australian feedlots over three summers. The
   cattle were assessed under natural climatic conditions in which HLI
   ranged from thermonuetral (HLI < 70) to extreme (HLI > 96; black globe
   temperature = 40.2A degrees C, relative humidity = 64\%, wind speed =
   1.58 m/s). When HLI > 96 a greater number (P < 0.001) of pure bred Bos
   taurus and crosses of Bos taurus cattle had a panting score a parts per
   thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 2 compared to Brahman cattle, and
   Brahman-cross cattle. The heat tolerance of the assessed breeds was
   verified using panting scores and the HLI. Heat tolerance of cattle can
   be assessed under field conditions by using panting score and HLI.}},

Abstract = {{The absorption of CO2 from LFG in different weight concentration ammonia
   solution and metal salts (Zinc and Barium) is investigated in this
   study. Addition of metal salts results in useful metal carbonates when
   LFG is passed through the solution. Barium salts show a better potential
   of removing CO2 as compared to Zinc salts. Addition of Barium salts to
   ammonia solution results in a new absorbent as no study has been focused
   on it till date. Also metal salts are added to alkaline wastewater which
   not only decreases the pH of the wastewater but also useful metal
   carbonates are obtained from wastewater when LFG is passed through it.
   Different parameters like CO2 loading, reaction rate and change in pH
   are investigated. Formation of carbonates is proved by using SEM and XRD
   analysis. Raman spectroscopy was performed on the discarded liquid after
   removal of carbonates to understand the formation of bicarbonates,
   carbonates and carbamates. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{184}},

Pages = {{1872-1876}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Radical nephrectomy is inevitably associated with a variable
   renal function decrease. We assessed the association of
   histopathological parameters in nonneoplastic renal parenchyma with the
   renal function decrease after radical nephrectomy.
   Materials and Methods: We evaluated 32 male and 17 female patients with
   a mean age of 55.9 years who underwent laparoscopic radical nephrectomy.
   Using the Cockcroft-Gault formula we calculated the estimated glomerular
   filtration rate preoperatively and at last followup at a mean of 19.7
   months. The study end point was the percent change in the estimated
   glomerular filtration rate from baseline, defined as (absolute
   change/baseline) x 100. Three histological features in the nonneoplastic
   parenchyma were assessed by a renal pathologist, including global
   glomerulosclerosis, arteriosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis/tubular
   atrophy. For glomerulosclerosis assessment the percent of affected
   glomeruli was determined. Arteriosclerosis or the extent of arterial
   luminal occlusion was graded into 4 groups, including 1-0\% to 5\%,
   2-6\% to 25\%, 3-26\% to 50\% and 4-greater than 50\%. However, due to
   small patient numbers groups 1 and 2, and 3 and 4 were condensed, and AS
   was statistically evaluated as 0\% to 25\% or greater than 25\%.
   Interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy was evaluated as absent/present.
   Results: The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased 31\%
   from 122 to 85 ml/minute/1.73 m(2) after surgery (p < 0.0001). The
   percent change in the estimated glomerular filtration rate was
   associated with glomerulosclerosis extent (p = 0.034). For each 10\%
   increase in glomerulosclerosis the estimated glomerular filtration rate
   decreased by 9\% from baseline. The extent of arteriosclerosis or the
   presence of interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy did not correlate with
   the estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease.
   Conclusions: Glomerulosclerosis severity in nonneoplastic parenchyma can
   predict the rate of renal function decrease after radical nephrectomy.
   This histopathological parameter should be assessed in all tumor
   nephrectomy specimens, given that preserving renal function is important
   for quality of life and clinical outcome in patients with renal cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contains a dynamic and complex mixture of
   proteins, which can reflect a physiological and pathological state of
   the central nervous system. In our present study, we show CSF protein
   patterns from patients with the two most frequent subtypes of sporadic
   Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) defined by the codon 129 genotype (MM,
   MV, and VV) and the protease-resistant form of prion protein (type 1 and
   type 2). The densitometric analysis of 2D gels showed up-regulation of
   27 and down-regulation of 3 proteins in the MM-sCJD as well as the
   up-regulation of 24 proteins in the VV-sCJD as compared to nondemented
   control. Almost 40\% of sCJD specific regulated proteins in CSF are
   involved in glucose metabolism, regardless of the codon 129
   polymorphism. The increase in CSF levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
   glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (G6PI), and fructosebisphosphate aldolase
   A (ALDOA) were validated on a larger group of sCJD patients including
   three possible codon 129 polymorphism carriers and three control groups
   consisting of nondemented, neurological cases as well as patients
   suffering from Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia. Subsequently,
   the abundance of these glycolytic enzymes in the brain as well as their
   cellular localization were determined. This study demonstrates for the
   first time the implication of G6PI in prion-induced pathology as well as
   its cellular translocalization in sCJD. The identification of
   sCJD-regulated proteins in CSF of living symptomatic patients in our
   study can broaden our knowledge about pathological processes occurring
   in sCJD, as they are still not fully understood.}},

Abstract = {{A new type of bend is proposed that reduces differential-to-common mode
   conversion occuring at the bend discontinuity in coupled microstrip
   lines for high-speed digital circuits. Simultaneously, great care has
   been taken to minimize the differential reflection coefficient and
   insertion loss, leading to an overall improved signal integrity. This is
   achieved by tapering the microstrip lines to tightly or very tightly
   coupled ones in the area of the bend. Full-wave simulations in the DC to
   6 GHz frequency range show that over 9 dB and 14 dB suppression of
   conversion noise is achieved for tightly coupled and very tightly
   coupled bends, respectively. Also for these new structures, with a total
   length of 100 mm, the insertion loss remains below 0.6 dB. Measurements
   on prototype bends show very good agreement with full-wave simulations.
   Also time domain measurements demonstrate the significant reduction in
   conversion noise while keeping return loss low. Moreover, for design
   purposes, a dedicated circuit model which closely matches the full-wave
   characteristics of the proposed bends is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Selenium like any other element can both be essential and toxic
   depending upon the concentration at which It occurs in human diet This
   paper assessed the level of this trace element in twenty different (20)
   types of locally produced food items around Abeokuta town and the blood
   obtained from the antecubital fossa vein of eighty-eight (88) healthy
   adults resident in Abeokuta
   This study is to ascertain whether or not the Se concentration is high
   enough to cause deleterious health effect or adequate to meet the
   necessary nutritional needs of the people in the study area
   Determination of Se concentration in the digested samples was achieved
   using Hybride Generation Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (HGAAS) The
   result indicates that Se concentration in the selected food items ranged
   from 030 to 978 mg/kg with a mean value of 1 94 mg/kg while the value of
   blood Se of healthy adults in Abeokuta was 19 1 + 30 mu g/dl with a mean
   value of 0 191 + 0 003 mu g/dl Also the mean values of Se (19 4 +/- 271
   mu g/dl) obtained from the blood of male healthy adult population was
   significantly different from that of the female adult population (18 7 +
   3 2 mu g/dl) Besides the mean value of blood Se in the healthy people
   from Abeokuta compared favourably well with the blood Se values obtained
   from healthy people in the developed countries The study also confirms
   that people consuming yam and yam products in Abeokuta are likely to
   have higher concentration of Se in their blood It is anticipated that
   the result of this study will form the basis of further studies in this

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To identify genes and molecular mechanisms associated with
   photoreceptor degeneration in a canine model of XLRP caused by an RPGR
   exon ORF15 microdeletion.
   METHODS. Expression profiles of mutant and normal retinas were compared
   by using canine retinal custom cDNA microarrays. qRT-PCR, Western blot
   analysis, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were applied to selected genes,
   to confirm and expand the microarray results.
   RESULTS. At 7 and 16 weeks, respectively, 56 and 18 transcripts were
   downregulated in the mutant retinas, but none were differentially
   expressed (DE) at both ages, suggesting the involvement of temporally
   distinct pathways. Downregulated genes included the known
   retina-relevant genes PAX6, CHML, and RDH11 at 7 weeks and CRX and SAG
   at 16 weeks. Genes directly or indirectly active in apoptotic processes
   were altered at 7 weeks (CAMK2G, NTRK2, PRKCB, RALA, RBBP6, RNF41,
   SMYD3, SPP1, and TUBB2C) and 16 weeks (SLC25A5 and NKAP). Furthermore,
   the DE genes at 7 weeks (ELOVL6, GLOD4, NDUFS4, and REEP1) and 16 weeks
   (SLC25A5 and TARS2) are related to mitochondrial functions. qRT-PCR of
   18 genes confirmed the microarray results and showed DE of additional
   genes not on the array. Only GFAP was DE at 3 weeks of age. Western blot
   and IHC analyses also confirmed the high reliability of the
   transcriptomic data.
   CONCLUSIONS. Several DE genes were identified in mutant retinas. At 7
   weeks, a combination of nonclassic anti- and pro-apoptosis genes appear
   to be involved in photoreceptor degeneration, whereas at both 7 and 16
   weeks, the expression of mitochondria-related genes indicates that they
   may play a relevant role in the disease process. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis

   diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a subsequent pregnancy and determine whether
   recurrence risk is modified by race/ethnicity.
   STUDY DESIGN: We used the Kaiser Permanente Southern California
   longitudinally linked records (1991-2008) to study women with first 2 (n
   = 65,132) and first 3 (n = 13,096) singleton pregnancies. Adjusted odds
   ratios (ORs) were used to estimate the magnitude of recurrence.
   RESULTS: Risks of GDM in the second pregnancy among women with and
   without previous GDM were 41.3\% and 4.2\%, respectively (OR, 13.2; 95\%
   confidence interval, 12.0-14.6). The recurrence risk of GDM in the third
   pregnancy was stronger when women had GDM in both prior pregnancies (OR,
   25.9; 95\% confidence interval, 17.4-38.4). Hispanics and Asian/Pacific
   Islanders have higher risks of recurrence.
   CONCLUSION: A pregnancy complicated by GDM is at increased risk for
   subsequent GDM. The magnitude of risk increases with the number of prior
   episodes of GDM. These recurrence risks also showed heterogeneity by
   race-ethnicity.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method of image analysis for quantifying diaphragmatic motion is
   described using ultrasound. Nineteen patients scheduled for thoracic
   surgery were evaluated with ultrasound preoperatively and through their
   postoperative hospital stay. Diaphragmatic motion was measured using a
   horizontal on-screen ruler, allowing for quantification and tracking of
   dynamic diaphragm function. A percentage (73.5\%) of all attempted
   measurements was quantifiable. Preoperative measurements of left and
   right diaphragm movement were correlated and there was no significant
   difference between the two. Postoperative diaphragm movement ipsilateral
   to the incision was statistically significantly less when compared to
   the contralateral side (p = 0.02 vs. p = 0.19). While not universally
   feasible in all patients, this method for quantifying diaphragmatic
   function is the only known imaging technique that can be performed at
   the bedside. Further evaluation of the impact of diaphragmatic
   dysfunction on patients undergoing thoracic surgery and its correlation
   with dyspnea is planned. (E-mail: tgethin-jones@partners.org) (C) 2010

Abstract = {{A coverage-dependent, mean-field microkinetic model of catalytic NO
   oxidation, NO+0.5O(2)-NO2, at a Pt(111) surface has been developed,
   based on large supercell density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
   DFT is used to determine the overall energetics and activation energies
   of candidate reaction steps as a function of surface coverage. Surface
   coverage is found to have a significant but non-uniform effect on the
   energetics, pathways, and activation energies of reaction steps
   involving formation or cleavage of ON-O and O=O bonds, and inclusion of
   this coverage dependence is essential for obtaining a qualitatively
   correct representation of the catalysis. Correlations are used to
   express all reaction parameters in terms of a single coverage variable q
   and steady-state solutions to the resultant mean-field models are
   obtained in the method of DeDonder relations. At conditions
   representative of NO oxidation catalysis, the surface coverage is
   predicted to be 0.25 <= theta <0.4 ML and to be controlled by
   equilibrium between gas-phase NO and NO2 and chemisorbed O, O-2
   dissociative adsorption (O-2(g)-> 2O{*}) is rate limiting in the model.
   The DFT-based mean-field model captures many features of the
   experimentally observed catalysis, and its short-comings point the way
   toward more robust models of coverage-dependent kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the association between depressive symptoms and
   physical inactivity in community samples of patients with diabetes
   mellitus (DM).
   Methods: Two representative samples of Israeli adults (age >= 21 years)
   were analyzed: The First Israeli National Health Interview Survey
   (INHIS-1) (n=9509) and the Israel National Health Survey (INHS)
   (n=4859). Information was obtained about past-month depressive symptoms,
   physician-diagnosed DM and physical activity. Multiple logistic
   regression models were used to examine the association between level of
   depressive symptoms and physical inactivity among individuals with DM,
   adjusting for potential confounders.
   Results: Prevalence of DM ranged from 7.2\% (INHIS-1) to 8.7\% (INHS).
   In both samples, physical inactivity was significantly more prevalent
   among persons with significant depressive symptoms, compared to those
   without depressive symptoms {[}INHIS-1 : 67.0\% vs. 50.6\%; adjusted
   odds ratio (AOR): 1.57; 95\% confidence interval (95\% Cl), 1.05-2.35,
   P=.03; INHS: 71.4\% vs. 43.9\%; AOR: 2.67; 95\% Cl, 1.67-4.27, P
   <.0001].
   Conclusions: Depressive symptoms were associated with a higher
   likelihood of physical inactivity in persons with DM. Body mass index of
   patients reporting no regular physical activity was elevated compared to
   persons who were physically active. This finding supports the view that
   identification and management of depression should be part of
   interventions designed to improve self care behaviors in patients with
   DM. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The existing well-known short-term traffic forecasting algorithms
   require large traffic flow data sets, including information on current
   traffic scenarios to predict the future traffic conditions. This article
   proposes a random process traffic volume model that enables estimation
   and prediction of traffic volume at sites where such large and
   continuous data sets of traffic condition related information are
   unavailable. The proposed model is based on a combination of wavelet
   analysis (WA) and Bayesian hierarchical methodology (BHM). The average
   daily ``trend{''} of urban traffic flow observations can be reliably
   modeled using discrete WA. The remaining fluctuating parts of the
   traffic volume observations are modeled using BHM. This BHM modeling
   considers that the variance of the urban traffic flow observations from
   an intersection vary with the time-of-the-day. A case study has been
   performed at two busy junctions at the city-centre of Dublin to validate
   the effectiveness of the strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Satellite multi-sensor data were used to investigate the evolution in
   time and space of Lake Trasimeno, a shallow and turbid lake in central
   Italy. Large-swath MERIS and MODIS sensors were proposed for regular
   broad scale monitoring of water quality, having compared the retrieved
   chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, Secchi disk (SD) depth and surface
   water temperature with the 2005-2008 time-series of the in situ data.
   Although, in a shorter time span, also the MERIS-derived total suspended
   matter (TSM) matched the in situ data. MERIS-derived water quality
   products confirmed the meso-eutrophic conditions of Lake Trasimeno
   (average Chl-a = 8.5 mg/m(3)) and the low levels of transparency
   (average SD = 1 m). A negative correlation found between water levels
   and Chl-a suggest the importance of maintaining water levels as close as
   possible to the hydrometric zero. A spatial analysis of TSM also reveals
   how small tributaries may affect the load of suspended solids in the
   southern part of the lake. Higher spatial resolution satellite images
   were exploited both to describe land use/cover transformation from 1978
   to 2008 and to assess the recent changes in macrophyte colonisation
   patterns. Land cover change detection analysis results showed a decrease
   in cultivated areas starting from the early Nineties and the subsequent
   increase in unproductive terrain (bare land and pastures) and natural
   woods as well as the changing fragmentation of agricultural areas
   through time. A reduction in macrophyte beds from 2003 to 2008 was also
   observed. We expect the results of this study to support local water
   authorities in redrawing the management plan of Lake Trasimeno.}},

Abstract = {{In this article I attempt to show that Heidegger's notions of
   temporality suggest a role for education in averting what he refers to
   as the abandonment of being in the face of machination. I use
   `machination' to translate Machenschaft, his term for self-making; its
   consequences are mechanical and biological ways of thinking about
   beingness. I argue that this role might prevent, by encouraging
   questioning, our adopting this technological way of being and seeing
   others as a means to our ends since, despite world time's continuum of
   temporality, we retain an understanding of an originary notion of
   future.}},

Journal = {{ORGANIZATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1159-1175}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study examines how women's and men's career referents-the people
   they see as having similar careers-affect career expectations. We raise
   two questions. First, what is the relative effect of the gender
   composition and comparison level of career referents on such
   expectations? Second, what happens to career expectations when women and
   men identify career referents at the same comparison level? Current
   research suggests that women have lower career expectations than men
   because they compare themselves with women who hold lower-level
   positions than the career referents identified by men. Thus, if women
   and men identify with career referents at a similar level, their career
   expectations should be equal. However, this chain of reasoning has not
   been tested. Using data collected from a large organization, we identify
   both the specific individuals that women and men perceive as having
   similar careers and these referents' career levels, defined as their
   hierarchical level in the firm. The results show that the level of
   career referents is more important than their gender composition in
   explaining individuals' career expectations. In contrast to extant
   explanations, the results show that even when women identify career
   referents at the same levels as men do, they still exhibit significantly
   lower career expectations. Drawing on social comparison theory, we
   speculate that this occurs because men's expectations are bolstered by
   extreme upward comparisons, whereas women's expectations are dampened,
   perhaps because they see high-achieving others as representing a less
   probable goal.}},

Abstract = {{Cambodia's trials of the leaders of the Khmer Rouge raise the question
   of whether this process of historical accountability will have a broader
   impact on Cambodian political culture. A reasonable hypothesis is that
   the trials will restore Cambodians' faith in the rule of law, a faith
   undermined by the failure of the state to take action against the
   miscreants for 30 years. Based on a 2007 nationally representative
   survey - conducted well before the trials began - the authors find that
   Cambodians hold a strong preference for strict adherence to legal
   universalism. Because support for the rule of law is so strong, the
   trials are unlikely to make it stronger. Understanding transitional
   justice processes requires that the state of society prior to the
   implementation of justice processes be understood so that change can be
   measured. Moreover, cultural values may be just as likely to be causes
   of transitional justice processes as results.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Empathic and informative interactions with health
   professionals are important for the well-being of people with cancer.
   However, there is a dearth of research examining the construction and
   experience of interactions with health professionals from the
   perspective of informal cancer carers. Objective: The aim of this study
   was to explore how cancer carers subjectively position their experiences
   of interactions with health professionals, in particular, their
   construction of experiences as positive or negative, and the perceived
   consequences of such interactions. Positioning theory is used to examine
   how the sociomedical construction of health professionals shapes carers'
   experiences of interactions with them. Method: Semistructured interviews
   were carried out with 53 informal cancer carers across a range of cancer
   types and stages, analyzed using thematic decomposition. Results: Carers
   positioned positive interactions as those involving health professionals
   who were warm and genuine, accessible and approachable, and who made
   carers feel accepted and comfortable. In the case of allied health
   professionals, the provision of a space for carers' cathartic release
   was also constructed positively. Negative interactions were positioned
   as those involving poor communication and a lack of empathy, poor or
   absent information provision, and absence of guidance about additional
   support. Conclusions: Positive experiences with health professionals
   were positioned by carers as leading to feelings of empowerment, value,
   and recognition, and negative interactions as leading to distress,
   anger, frustration, and feelings of isolation. Implications for
   Practice: It is important for health professionals to be supportive of
   carers' needs, to communicate in an empathic manner, to be approachable
   and accessible, and to recognize carers needs and concerns.}},

Abstract = {{Optical signatures and combustion times for micron-sized aluminum
   particles are measured in oxidizing environments including nitrogen
   mixtures with oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water. Particles in a room
   temperature oxidizing gas stream are fed into a CO2 laser beam where
   they are ignited. Prior to entering the CO2 laser beam, each particle
   crosses a second, low energy laser beam and produces a scattered light
   signal used to determine the particle size in real time. The correlation
   between the measured particle sizes and their burn times produces an
   experimental trend that is compared to various correlations reported in
   the literature. In addition to the burn time measurements, detailed
   optical signatures are recorded for micron-sized aluminum particles
   burning in different environments. For aluminum burning in water vapor,
   the optical signature of the particle is substantially weaker than in
   other environments, possibly indicating a primarily surface oxidation.
   It is shown that semi-empirical and widely used tau(b)-D-n expressions
   for the particle burn time, tau(b), as a function of its diameter, D,
   are inaccurate for the conditions that are different from those used to
   establish respective trends initially. It is observed that the effect of
   oxygen concentration on combustion time of micron-sized aluminum
   particles is weak when oxygen concentrations exceed 21\%. Combustion
   times increase substantially for lower oxygen concentrations. Aluminum
   particle combustion times are substantially longer than predicted for
   experiments with water and carbon dioxide oxidizers. For all
   environments, the observed effect of particle size is relatively weak
   and the exponents in the descriptive D-n relations appropriate for the
   current experiments vary approximately from 0.3 to 1. The exponent close
   to 0.3 adequately describes current results for those oxidizing
   environments for which heterogeneous reactions appear to dominate. (C)

Abstract = {{A retrospective case-control study of listeriosis in patients in England
   aged over 60 years is described. The incidence of listeriosis in
   patients aged >= 60 years in England has doubled since 2001; hence, the
   investigation of risk factors for infection in this group is important
   to inform on prevention and control. Standardized epidemiological
   information has been sought on cases since 2005, but the value of the
   data accrued is limited without some perception of exposure prevalence
   in the population at risk of listeriosis. The exposures of listeriosis
   cases aged >= 60 years reported in England from 2005 to 2008 were
   compared to those of market research panel members representing the same
   population (i.e., residents of England aged >= 60 years) and time
   period. Exposures were grouped to facilitate comparison. Odds ratios and
   95\% confidence intervals were calculated. Cases were more likely than
   panel members to report the consumption of cooked meats (beef and
   ham/pork, but not poultry), cooked fish (specifically smoked salmon) and
   shellfish (prawns), dairy products (most noticeably milk but also
   certain cheeses), and mixed salads. They were less likely to report the
   consumption of other forms of seafood, dairy spread, other forms of
   dairy, sandwiches, and fresh vegetables. The diversity of high-risk food
   exposures reflects the ubiquity of the microorganism in the environment
   and/or the susceptibility of those at risk, and suggests that a wider
   variety of foods can give rise to listeriosis. Food safety advice on
   avoiding listeriosis should be adapted accordingly. While not
   inexpensive, the application of market research data to infectious
   disease epidemiology can add value to routine surveillance data.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We present our initial experience in 40 patients undergoing
   laparoendoscopic single site donor nephrectomy.
   Materials and Methods: We prospectively collected data on 40 consecutive
   patients. A single access GelPOINT (TM) device was inserted into the
   abdomen through a 4 to 5 cm periumbilical incision. We used a bariatric
   camera with a right angle attachment for the light cord to maximize
   triangulation. Parameters analyzed included warm ischemia time,
   operative time, estimated blood loss, visual analog pain score, time to
   recipient creatinine less than 3 mg/dl, and recipient creatinine at
   discharge home, and 3 and 6 months.
   Results: A total of 38 left and 2 right donor nephrectomies were
   performed. Complete laparoendoscopic single site donor nephrectomy was
   successful in 38 cases. One left and 1 right case were converted to a
   hand assisted approach. Average +/- SD body mass index was 26.1 +/- 5.2
   kg/m(2). Mean operative time to allograft extraction was 93.5 +/- 27.5
   minutes and mean total operative time was 166.7 +/- 33.8 minutes.
   Average estimated blood loss was 106.7 +/- 93.5 cc. Mean warm ischemia
   time was 3.96 +/- 0.72 minutes. Mean hospital stay was 1.77 +/- 0.43
   days and median time to recipient creatinine less than 3.0 mg/dl was
   54.2 +/- 110.3 hours. Mean recipient creatinine at discharge home, and
   at 3 and 6 months was 1.48 +/- 0.67, 1.29 +/- 0.38 and 1.19 +/- 0.34
   mg/dl, respectively. Complications included hyponatremia in 1 patient,
   wound infection in 1, and a grade III laceration in an allograft that
   was sustained during extraction.
   Conclusions: Our initial experience with laparoendoscopic single site
   donor nephrectomy is encouraging. This approach to kidney donation
   without an extra-umbilical incision could become particularly relevant
   to minimize morbidity in young, healthy organ donors.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of teen dating violence have focused heavily on family and peer
   influences, but little research has been conducted on the relationship
   contexts within which violence occurs. The present study explores
   specific features of adolescent romantic relationships associated with
   the perpetration of physical violence. Relying on personal interviews
   with a sample of 956 adolescents, results indicate that respondents who
   self-report violence perpetration are significantly more likely than
   their non-violent counterparts to report higher levels of other
   problematic relationship dynamics and behaviors such as jealousy, verbal
   conflict, and cheating. However, we find no significant differences in
   levels of love, intimate self-disclosure, or perceived partner caring,
   and violent relationships are, on average, characterized by longer
   duration, more frequent contact, sexual intimacy and higher scores on
   the provision and receipt of instrumental support. Finally, violence is
   associated with the perception of a relatively less favorable power
   balance, particularly among male respondents. These findings complicate
   traditional views of the dynamics within violent relationships, add to

Abstract = {{We consider an inverse problem for the Poisson equation with point
   sources in dimension 2. This problem has been studied extensively for
   the data in the form of the values of both the solution and its normal
   derivative given on the boundary. Our focus is on another type of data,
   namely the absolute value of the gradient and its derivatives. We
   present a method for converting the boundary data of the latter type to
   the boundary data of the former type. For the resulting system of
   ordinary differential equations, we establish the necessary and
   sufficient conditions for the existence of periodic solutions. To
   guarantee the uniqueness of the solution we introduce an additional
   constraint. Next, we present some numerical examples to illustrate the
   method and comment on the rate of convergence of the algorithm. Finally,
   we show that the method in its present form cannot be extended to
   dimension 3.}},

   pressure (Pa) during airway obstruction was ascribed to ventricular
   interdependence, afterload, and transmission of intrathoracic pressure
   swings. We have shown this effect significantly reduced in the elderly,
   but the underlying reasons remain unclear. Here we compare the results
   of inspiratory loading in young and older subjects with a mathematical
   model that simulated beat-by-beat fluctuations in cardiopulmonary
   variables. By increasing arterial and left ventricular elastance
   parameters in the older group, simulations strongly correlated with the
   experimental Pa and identified a linear increase of left ventricular
   transmural pressures with negative intrathoracic pressure that was
   nearly 38\% larger than that in the younger group. The apparent
   perfusion preservation by less Pa decline with obstruction in the
   elderly could be misleading, since it reflects an increased afterload

Abstract = {{Poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS)-based microfluidic devices are now
   commonly used for a wide variety of biological experiments, including
   cell culture assays. However, the porous, hydrophobic polymer matrix of
   PDMS rapidly absorbs small hydrophobic molecules, including hormones and
   most small-molecule drugs. This makes it challenging to perform
   experiments that require such substances in PDMS microfluidic devices.
   This study presents evidence that a sol-gel treatment of PDMS that fills
   the polymer matrix with silica nanoparticles is effective at reducing
   the absorption of drugs into the material while preserving its
   biocompatibility, transparency, and oxygen permeability. We show that
   the absorption of two anticancer drugs, camptothecin and a kinase
   inhibitor, is reduced to such an extent that on-chip microfluidic cell
   culture experiments can recapitulate the results obtained off-chip.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregate signature is a digital signature with a striking property that
   anyone can aggregate n individual signatures on n different messages
   which are signed by n distinct signers, into a single compact signature
   to reduce computational and storage costs. In this work, two practical
   certificateless aggregate signature schemes are proposed from bilinear
   maps. The first scheme CAS-1 reduces the costs of communication and
   signer-side computation but trades off the storage, while CAS-2
   minimizes the storage but sacrifices the communication costs. One can
   choose either of the schemes by consideration of the application
   requirement. Compare with ID-based schemes, our schemes do not entail
   public key certificates as well and achieve the trust Level 3, which
   imply the frauds of the authority are detectable. Both of the schemes
   are proven secure in the random oracle model by assuming the
   intractability of the computational Diffie-Hellman problem over the
   groups with bilinear maps, where the forking lemma technique is avoided.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Several types of forceps are available for use in sampling
   Barrett's esophagus (BE). Few data exist with regard to biopsy quality
   for histologic assessment.
   Objective: To evaluate sampling quality of 3 different forceps in
   patients with BE.
   Design: Single-center, randomized clinical trial.
   Patients: Consecutive patients with BE undergoing upper endoscopy.
   Interventions: Patients randomized to have biopsy specimens taken with 1
   of 3 types of forceps: standard, large capacity, or jumbo.
   Main Outcome Measurements: Specimen adequacy was defined a priori as a
   well-oriented biopsy sample 2 mm or greater in diameter and with at
   least muscularis mucosa present.
   Results: A total of 65 patients were enrolled and analyzed (standard
   forceps, n = 21; large-capacity forceps, n = 21; jumbo forceps, n = 23).
   Compared with jumbo forceps, a significantly higher proportion of biopsy
   samples with large-capacity forceps were adequate (37.8\% vs 25.2\%, P =
   .002). Of the standard forceps biopsy samples, 31.9\% were adequate,
   which was not significantly different from specimens taken with
   large-capacity (P = .20) or jumbo (P = .09) forceps. Biopsy specimens
   taken with jumbo forceps had the largest diameter (median, 3.0 mm vs 2.5
   mm {[}standard] vs 2.8 mm {[}large capacity]; P = .0001). However, jumbo
   forceps had the lowest proportion of specimens that were well oriented
   (overall P = .001).
   Limitations: Heterogeneous patient population precluded dysplasia
   detection analyses.
   Conclusions: Our results challenge the requirement of jumbo forceps and
   therapeutic endoscopes to properly perform the Seattle protocol. We
   found that standard and large-capacity forceps used with standard upper
   endoscopes produced biopsy samples at least as adequate as those
   obtained with jumbo forceps and therapeutic endoscopes in patients with
   BE. (Gastrointest Endosc 2010;72:935-40.)}},

Title = {{When to Use Broader Internalising and Externalising Subscales Instead of

Abstract = {{The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a widely used
   child mental health questionnaire with five hypothesised subscales.
   There is theoretical and preliminary empirical support for combining the
   SDQ's hypothesised emotional and peer subscales into an `internalizing'
   subscale and the hypothesised behavioral and hyperactivity subscales
   into an `externalizing' subscale (alongside the fifth prosocial
   subscale). We examine this using parent, teacher and youth SDQ data from
   a representative sample of 5-16 year olds in Britain (N = 18,222).
   Factor analyses generally supported second-order internalizing and
   externalizing factors, and the internalizing and externalizing subscales
   showed good convergent and discriminant validity across informants and
   with respect to clinical disorder. By contrast, discriminant validity
   was poorer between the emotional and peer subscales and between the
   behavioral, hyperactivity and prosocial subscales. This applied
   particularly to children with low scores on those subscales. We conclude
   that there are advantages to using the broader internalizing and
   externalizing SDQ subscales for analyses in low-risk samples, while
   retaining all five subscales when screening for disorder.}},

Pages = {{14405-14419}},

Abstract = {{Improving the accuracy and thus broadening the applicability of
   electronic density functional theory (DFT) is crucial to many research
   areas, from material science, to theoretical chemistry, biophysics and
   biochemistry. In the last three years, the mathematical structure of the
   strong-interaction limit of density functional theory has been
   uncovered, and exact information on this limit has started to become
   available. The aim of this paper is to give a perspective on how this
   new piece of exact information can be used to treat situations that are
   problematic for standard Kohn-Sham DFT. One way to use the
   strong-interaction limit, more relevant for solid-state physical
   devices, is to define a new framework to do practical, non-conventional,
   DFT calculations in which a strong-interacting reference system is used
   instead of the traditional non-interacting one of Kohn and Sham. Another
   way to proceed, more related to chemical applications, is to include the
   exact treatment of the strong-interaction limit into approximate
   exchange-correlation energy density functionals in order to describe
   difficult situations such as the breaking of the chemical bond.}},

Abstract = {{Peroxidasins form a highly conserved family of extracellular peroxidases
   of unknown cellular function. We identified the C. elegans peroxidasin
   PXN-2 in screens for mutants defective in embryonic morphogenesis. We
   find that PXN-2 is essential for specific stages of embryonic
   morphogenesis and muscle-epidermal attachment, and is also required
   postembryonically for basement membrane integrity. The peroxidase
   catalytic activity of PXN-2 is necessary for these developmental roles.
   pxn-2 mutants display aberrant ultrastructure of the extracellular
   matrix, suggesting a role in basement membrane consolidation. PXN-2
   affects specific axon guidance choice points in the developing nervous
   system but is dispensable for maintenance of process positions. In
   adults, loss of pxn-2 function promotes regrowth of axons after injury,
   providing the first evidence that C. elegans extracellular matrix can
   play an inhibitory role in axon regeneration. Loss of function in the
   closely related C. elegans peroxidasin pxn-1 does not cause overt
   developmental defects. Unexpectedly, pxn-2 mutant phenotypes are
   suppressed by loss of function in pxn-1 and exacerbated by
   overexpression of wild-type pxn-1, indicating that PXN-1 and PXN-2 have
   antagonistic functions. These results demonstrate that peroxidasins play
   crucial roles in development and reveal a new role for peroxidasins as
   extracellular inhibitors of axonal regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are encapsulated yeast
   agents of cryptococcosis and facultative intracellular pathogens. The
   interaction of these yeasts with macrophages is essential for containing
   the infection. However, Cryptococcus spp. overcome this initial host
   defense barrier using a unique pathogenic strategy involving
   intracellular replication and cytoplasmic accumulation of
   polysaccharide-containing vesicles. Here, we employed representational
   difference analysis (RDA) to identify C. neoformans and C. gattii genes
   differentially expressed during intracellular growth in rat peritoneal
   macrophages. The upregulated transcripts of C. neoformans during
   macrophage interaction were related to ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
   transporters, intra-golgi transport, chaperone activity, ribosomal
   maintenance, NAD metabolism, histone methylation, stress response, and
   monosaccharide metabolism. In contrast, with C. gattii, upregulated
   genes were associated with cell growth, aerobic respiration, protein
   binding, microtubule nucleation, monosaccharides and nitrogen
   metabolism, inositol or phosphatidylinositol phosphatase activity,
   cellular signaling, and stress response. Our findings reveal new genes
   that may be necessary for the intracellular parasitism of C. neoformans
   and C. gattii.}},

Abstract = {{Medical sequencing for diseases with locus and allelic heterogeneities
   has been limited by the high cost and low throughput of traditional
   sequencing technologies ``Second generation{''} sequencing (SGS)
   technologies allow the parallel processing of a large number of genes
   and, therefore, offer great promise for medical sequencing, however,
   their use in clinical laboratories is still in its infancy Our
   laboratory offers clinical resequencing for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
   using an array based platform that interrogates 19 of more than 30 genes
   known to cause DCM We explored both the feasibility and cost
   effectiveness of using PCR amplification followed by SGS technology for
   sequencing these 19 genes in a set of five samples enriched for known
   sequence alterations (109 unique substitutions and 27 insertions and
   deletions) While the analytical sensitivity for substitutions was
   comparable to that of the DCM array (98\%), SGS technology performed
   better than the DCM array for insertions and deletions (90 6\% versus
   58\%) Overall, SGS per formed substantially better than did the current
   array based testing platform, however, the operational cost and
   projected turnaround time do not meet our current standards Therefore,
   efficient capture methods and/or sample pooling strategies that shorten
   the turnaround time and decrease reagent and laborcosts are needed
   before implementing this platform into routine clinical applications (J

Abstract = {{Epidemiologists often study the incidence density (ID; also known as
   incidence rate), which is the number of observed events divided by
   population-time at risk. Its computational simplicity makes it
   attractive in applications, but a common concern is that the ID is
   misleading if the underlying hazard is not constant in time. Another
   difficulty arises if competing events are present, which seems to have
   attracted less attention in the literature. However, there are
   situations in which the presence of competing events obscures the
   analysis more than nonconstant hazards do. The authors illustrate such a
   situation using data on infectious complications in patients receiving
   stem cell transplants, showing that a certain transplant type reduces
   the infection ID but eventually increases the cumulative infection
   probability because of its effect on the competing event. The authors
   investigate the extent to which IDs allow for a reasonable analysis of
   competing events. They suggest a simple multistate-type graphic based on
   IDs, which immediately displays the competing event situation. The
   authors also suggest a more formal summary analysis in terms of a best
   approximating effect on the cumulative event probability, considering
   another data example of US women infected with human immunodeficiency
   virus. Competing events and even more complex event patterns may be
   adequately addressed with the suggested methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing both glutamatergic and dopaminergic drive in the nucleus

   opioid antagonist, naltrexone, compared to placebo in the treatment of
   methamphetamine dependence. Thirty-one subjects with methamphetamine
   dependence (mean age 36.8 +/- 7.12 years; 29\% female) were randomly
   assigned in a 1:1 fashion to NAC plus naltrexone or placebo and returned
   for one post-baseline visit. The Penn Craving Scale was the primary
   outcome measure. Self-report methamphetamine use frequency and urine
   toxicology were secondary measures. NAC plus naltrexone failed to
   demonstrate statistically significant differences. from placebo on
   primary and secondary outcomes. The current study failed to demonstrate
   greater efficacy for NAC plus naltrexone compared to placebo. Given the
   small sample size, the statistical power to detect significant effects
   of active treatment versus placebo was limited. The question of whether
   a larger, well-powered sample would have detected differences between
   NAC plus naltrexone and placebo deserves further examination. (C) 2010

Title = {{CrNx Films Prepared by DC Magnetron Sputtering and High-Power Pulsed
   Magnetron Sputtering: A Comparative Study}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{11, 1}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{CrNx (0 <= x <= 0.91) films synthesized using high-power pulsed
   magnetron sputtering, also known as high-power impulse magnetron
   sputtering (HiPIMS), have been compared with those made by conventional
   direct-current (dc) magnetron sputtering (DCMS) operated at the same
   average power. The HiPIMS deposition rate relative to the DCMS rate was
   found to decrease linearly with increasing emission strength from the Cr
   ions relative to Cr neutrals, in agreement with the predictions of the
   target-pathway model. The low deposition rate in HiPIMS is thus a direct
   consequence of the high ionization level (similar to 56\%) of the target
   material and effective capturing of Cr ions by the cathode potential.
   Although the HiPIMS deposition rate did not exceed 40\% of the DCMS
   rate, the drop in the relative deposition rate upon increasing the
   N-2-to-Ar flow ratio, f(N2/Ar), was found to be similar for both
   sputtering techniques. Films prepared by HiPIMS contained similar
   amounts of atomic nitrogen as the dc-sputtered samples grown at the same
   f(N2/Ar), indicating that the nitride formation at the substrate takes
   place mostly during the time period of the high-power pulses, and the
   N-2 uptake between the pulses is negligible. The microstructure
   evolution in the two types of CrNx films, however, differed clearly from
   each other. A combination of a high substrate bias and a high flux of
   doubly charged Cr ions present during the HiPIMS discharge led to a
   disruption of the grain growth and renucleation, which resulted in
   column-free films with nanosized grains not observed in the conventional
   DCMS-based process. The comparison of nanoindentation hardness as a
   function of f(N2/Ar) revealed superior properties of HiPIMS-sputtered
   films in the entire range of gas compositions.}},

Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{873-880}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, help others in a variety of contexts. Some
   researchers have claimed that this only occurs when food is not involved
   and the recipient actively solicits help. In the current study, however,
   we found that chimpanzees often helped conspecifics obtain food in a
   pulling task with no solicitation whatsoever, in a situation in which,
   based on past experience, the conspecific's desire for the food was
   apparent. We also assessed whether the collaborative context of the
   situation impacted helping rates. Specifically, we compared how often
   both partners obtained rewards when one partner needed the help of the
   other, who had already received a reward for free (helping without
   collaboration), and when one partner needed the other's help after they
   had already begun collaborating (helping during collaboration). Partners
   provided assistance significantly more often in both of these helping
   conditions than in a control condition in which partners could provide
   unneeded help. However, unlike human children who have been tested in a
   similar task, chimpanzees did not help their partner more during (than
   without) collaboration. These results suggest that chimpanzees' helping
   behaviour is more robust than previously believed, but at the same time
   may have different evolutionary roots from the helping behaviour of
   humans. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Objective. To examine associations between activity and dietary habits
   reported by mothers for themselves and their children aged 2 to 11
   years. Design/Methods. Cross-sectional, consecutive samples of parents

   questions were used to define 5 ``healthy{''} habits: low-fat milk
   choice; low fast food use; low weekend screen time; low juice/sweet
   drinks intake; and high-frequency physical activity. Mixed-effects
   logistic regression models were applied. Results. Responses from a
   socioeconomically diverse group of 2115 mothers were analyzed. For each
   healthy behavior self-reported by the mother, the odds of the healthy
   behavior being reported for the child were significantly higher (range:
   odds ratio {[}OR] = 3.2 for high-frequency physical activity to OR =
   19.7 for low-fat milk choice). Conclusions. Mothers and children often
   have similar health habits. The impact of clinician counseling for

Abstract = {{After completion of the solar cell manufacturing process the
   current-density versus voltage curves (J( U) curves) are measured to
   determine the solar cell's efficiency and the mechanisms limiting the
   efficiency. An accurate and robust analysis of the measured curves is
   essential. In this work it is shown that fitting the two-diode model is
   inappropriate to quantify recombination in the space charge region and
   ohmic losses due to series resistance. Three fill factors, namely the
   fill factor of the illuminated J(U) curve, the pseudo fill factor of the
   suns Voc curve and the ideal fill factor of the single diode model, are
   the base of a quick loss analysis that is evaluated in the present
   paper. It is shown that for an accurate analysis the distributed
   character of the series resistance and the network character of the
   solar cell cannot be neglected. An advanced current-voltage curve
   analysis including fill factors and fit is presented. Copyright (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Neurochemical and pharmacological studies of the central nervous system
   are important in understanding normal brain function and discovering
   effective treatments for brain diseases. Imaging systems are capable of
   providing large spatiotemporal chemical information, but they require
   the subject to remain still during recording. Implantable chemical
   sensors can be used in freely behaving animals and are able to provide
   higher resolution than imaging systems, but only in close proximity to
   the sensor.
   The aim of this research was to design and evaluate an artificial neural
   network capable of generating 3D chemical information over time using
   data acquired from a limited number of chemical sensors that could
   eventually be recorded from a freely behaving animal. The results show
   that the spatiotemporal neural network is capable of learning ion
   diffusion in a model of the cortical brain, in ideal or noisy
   conditions, and that network simulations of sensor data are as accurate
   as mathematical simulations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pulmonary hypertension may primarily affect either the arterial
   (precapillary) or the venous (postcapillary) pulmonary circulation.
   Pulmonary arterial hypertension may be idiopathic or arise in
   association with chronic pulmonary thromboembolism; pulmonary embolism
   caused by tumor cells, parasitic material, or foreign material;
   parenchymal lung disease; liver disease; vasculitis; human
   immunodeficiency virus infection; or a left-to-right cardiac shunt. Its
   histologic characteristics include vascular changes-medial hypertrophy,
   intimal cellular proliferation, intraluminal thrombosis, and the
   development of plexiform lesions-that manifest primarily in the muscular
   pulmonary arteries. Features of pulmonary arterial hypertension that may
   be seen at computed tomography (CT) are central pulmonary artery
   dilatation, abrupt narrowing or tapering of peripheral pulmonary
   vessels, right ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular and atrial
   enlargement, dilated bronchial arteries, and a mosaic pattern of
   attenuation due to variable lung perfusion. Pulmonary venous
   hypertension may result from pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, pulmonary
   venous compression by extrinsic lesions (eg, mediastinal fibrosis),
   left-sided cardiac disease, or pulmonary vein stenosis. Its histologic
   hallmarks include venous intimal cellular proliferation, medial
   hypertrophy, and thickening of the internal elastic lamina; capillary
   congestion and proliferation; interlobular septal thickening; lymphatic
   dilatation; and, sometimes, venous infarction and vascular changes
   characteristic of pulmonary arterial hypertension. CT scans in patients
   with pulmonary venous hypertension show pulmonary interstitial and
   alveolar edema with signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
   High-resolution CT with standard axial and angiographic acquisitions is
   useful for identifying underlying disorders and differentiating among
   the various causes of secondary pulmonary hypertension. (C) RSNA, 2010.

Abstract = {{Recent media coverage and case reports have highlighted women's attempts
   to end their pregnancies by self-inducing abortions in the United
   States. This study explored women's motivations for attempting
   self-induction of abortion. We surveyed women in clinic waiting rooms in
   Boston, San Francisco, New York, and a city in Texas to identify women
   who had attempted self-induction. We conducted 30 in-depth interviews
   and inductively analyzed the data. Median age at time of self-induction
   attempt was 19 years. Between 1979 and 2008, the women used a variety of
   methods, including medications, malta beverage, herbs, physical
   manipulation and, increasingly, misoprostol. Reasons to self-induce
   included a desire to avoid abortion clinics, obstacles to accessing
   clinical services, especially due to young age and financial barriers,
   and a preference for self-induction. The methods used were generally
   readily accessible but mostly ineffective and occasionally unsafe. Of
   the 23 with confirmed pregnancies, three reported a successful abortion
   not requiring clinical care. Only one reported medical complications in
   the United States. Most would not self-induce again and recommended
   clinic-based services. Efforts should be made to inform women about and
   improve access to clinic-based abortion services, particularly for
   medical abortion, which may appeal to women who are drawn to
   self-induction because it is natural, non-invasive and private. (C)2010

Abstract = {{The thermodynamics of metals ions binding to proteins and other
   biological molecules can be measured with isothermal titration
   calorimetry (ITC), which quantifies the binding enthalpy (Delta H
   degrees) and generates a binding isotherm A fit of the isotherm provides
   the binding constant (K), thereby allowing the free energy (Delta G
   degrees) and ultimately the entropy (Delta S degrees) of binding to be
   determined The temperature dependence of Delta H degrees can then
   provide the change in heat capacity (Delta C-p degrees) upon binding
   However, ITC measurements of metal binding can be compromised by
   undesired reactions (e g, precipitation, hydrolysis, and redox), and
   generally involve competing equilibria with the buffer and protons,
   which contribute to the experimental values (K-ITC, Delta H-ITC)
   Guidelines and factors that need to be considered for ITC measurements
   involving metal ions are outlined A general analysis of the experimental
   ITC values that accounts for the contributions of metal buffer
   speciation and proton competition and provides condition-independent
   thermodynamic values (K, Delta H degrees) for metal binding is developed
   and validated}},

Abstract = {{In February 2008, five patients were infected with the H1N1 subtype of
   influenza A virus in one hospital ward for immunocompromised patients at
   a hospital in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. All of these patients had
   an established haematologic disease and tested positive either for viral
   RNA or antigen shortly after the beginning of respiratory illness. In
   three of the patients, influenza virus was repeatedly detected, and four
   of the patients died in coincidence with the virus infection. Sequencing
   of the amplified (HA1) haemagglutinin yielded identical nucleotide
   sequences in isolates from three of the patients, whereas one nucleotide
   difference was found in the isolate of the fourth patient, resulting in
   an amino acid substitution (G153R). To investigate the source of
   infection, the medical staff (n = 104) of the hospital unit was tested
   and found negative for influenza virus RNA and antigen in pharyngeal
   lavages. Testing for influenza virus antibodies by immunofluorescence
   assay revealed that 12 staff members were positive for influenza virus A
   IgA antibodies. These findings suggest that wild-type influenza virus
   infections occurred within the medical staff at the same time the
   patients were infected and that the staff might have contributed to the
   circulation of virus in the hospital ward.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium (Mg) is the fourth most abundant cation in the body and plays
   a key role in numerous cellular functions such as glycolysis and energy
   metabolism. Its deficit may cause gastrointestinal disturbances,

   may range from muscle weakness and numbness, to lethargy, hyperreflexia,
   ataxia, tetany, convulsions and coma. We report the case of a man of 65
   with short bowel syndrome secondary to extensive bowel resection for
   sigma neoplasm and subsequent peritonitis, with end ileostomy, who
   presented several episodes of tonic-clonic seizures secondary to severe
   magnesium deficiency as a result a decrease in intestinal absorption of
   losses for high debit ileostomy. After beginning treatment with

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a
   paediatric tube feed supplemented with a multifibre mixture on the gut
   microbiota and nutritional and micronutrient status of children on
   long-term enteral nutrition (EN). A randomised, controlled,
   double-blind, cross-over trial (2 x 3 months) with a washout period of 1
   month was carried out. Twenty-seven children (80\% neurologically
   impaired) aged 11.9 (SD 3.9) years, on long-term EN (4.8 (SD 3.9) years)
   were recruited. The analyses of the children's faecal pH, microbiota
   along with anthropometric measures, bowel movements and markers of blood
   micronutrient status were made. Twenty children completed the study. A
   significant increase in the proportion of stool bifidobacteria (+ 16 .6
   \%, P<0.05) was observed during the multifibre period than during the
   fibre-free period, together with a significant reduction in stool pH
   (P<0.001). Stool frequency and consistency as well as growth did not
   differ between the two periods. There was a significant increase
   (P<0.05) in plasma ferritin at the end of the fibre-free period, but
   plasma ferritin levels remained within normal ranges during both
   periods. No diet effects on other blood parameters were observed. In
   conclusion, addition of a multifibre mixture with prebiotic components
   to paediatric EN is well tolerated, promotes bifidobacteria and reduces
   stool pH, indicating an improved gut health. British Journal of

Abstract = {{An efficient phosphate-solubilizing plant growth-promoting Acinetobacter
   rhizosphaerae strain BIHB 723 exhibited significantly higher
   solubilization of tricalcium phosphate (TCP) than Udaipur rock phosphate
   (URP), Mussoorie rock phosphate (MRP) and North Carolina rock phosphate
   (NCRP). Qualitative and quantitative differences were discerned in the
   gluconic, oxalic, 2-keto gluconic, lactic, malic and formic acids during
   the solubilization of various inorganic phosphates by the strain.
   Gluconic acid was the main organic acid produced during phosphate
   solubilization. Formic acid production was restricted to TCP
   solubilization and oxalic acid production to the solubilization of MRP,
   URP and NCRP. A significant increase in plant height, shoot fresh
   weight, shoot dry weight, root length, root dry weight, and root, shoot
   and soil phosphorus (P) contents was recorded with the inoculated
   treatments over the uninoculated NP0K or NPTCPK treatments. Plant growth
   promotion as a function of phosphate solubilization suggested that the
   use of bacterial strain would be a beneficial addition to the
   agriculture practices in TCP-rich soils in reducing the application of
   phosphatic fertilizers.}},

   having different technical capabilities and conditions. We define CBIR
   system profiles in terms of hardware and system platform attributes and
   propose CBIR parameters for each profile. Hence, the study consists of
   two main parts: system profiling and adaptation of indexing and
   retrieval parameters for each profile. The proposed CBIR parameters are
   appropriate configurations for optimal CBIR use on every platform. The
   proposed parameters for each system profile are assessed over a large
   set of experiments. Experimental studies show that the proposed
   parameters for each system profile have satisfactory semantic retrieval
   performance, with reduced computational complexity and storage space
   requirement. 45 to 78\% improvement is achieved in the computational
   complexity of the retrieval process depending on the profile.}},

Abstract = {{According to the initial density of a single species with Allee effect
   and corresponding management strategy, three kinds of mathematical
   models are presented to describe the evolutionary process of the species
   by impulsive differential equations. When the initial density of the
   species is larger than economic injury level (EIL) (or economical
   threshold, ET), impulsive harvest control is considered in a finite time
   to decrease the population of the species. The feasibility of the
   impulsive harvest control in a finite time is given by the existence of
   solution of the model with initial and boundary value problem. When the
   initial density of the species is less than EIL (or ET), the model with
   state feedback control is formulated according to the state of the
   species. The existence and stability of periodic solution of the model
   with state feedback control are discussed. When the initial density of
   the species is less than the Allee threshold and the species tends to
   extinction, the model with impulsive release at fixed moments is
   presented to study the restoration of the species. The conditions for
   the feasibility of periodic restoration of the species are given.
   Finally, some discussions are given. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Domestic exotics and the perception of invasibility}},
Journal = {{DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1034-1039}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Susceptibility of an area to invasion by exotic species is often judged
   by the fraction of introduced species in the local biota. However, the
   degree of invasion, particularly in mainland areas, has often been
   underestimated because of the exclusion of `domestic exotics' (those
   introduced to internal units from within the national border) in
   calculations. Because all introduced species on islands are considered
   as exotics, this contributes to the perception that islands are more
   susceptible to invasion than are continental regions. Here, we determine
   the contribution of domestic exotic species to the degree of invasion
   (exotic fraction) in mainland areas. We quantify the relationships of
   exotic fraction to the area, human population density and land use
   within each of the 48 conterminous US states to identify mechanisms that
   potentially influence the degree of invasion. For each of the 48
   conterminous US states, we compiled the number of species introduced
   from outside the United States ('foreign exotics') and the number of
   exotics introduced from other conterminous US states ('domestic
   exotics'). The status of each species as foreign or domestic was
   determined for each state by researching its precise origins through
   vouchered herbarium records, supplemented by literature (Kartesz, 2010).
   We found that (1) the exotic fraction inevitably decreases with
   increasing area as the pool of potential exotic species decreases; (2)
   exotic richness of areas within large mainland regions is underestimated
   to the extent that species introduced among areas within a region are
   considered as natives; and (3) human activities contribute
   disproportionately more exotics to smaller than to larger administrative
   areas. How we define `exotic' influences how we count non-native species
   and perceive invasibility. Excluding domestic exotics in mainland
   regions leads to a biased perception of increased invasibility on
   islands, where all introduced species are considered exotic. Thus,
   future documentation and interpretation of invasion patterns and
   management of exotics should account for these biases in quantifying the
   exotic fraction.}},

Journal = {{INORGANIC CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{The crystal and electronic structures of three related R(3)TnX(3) phases
   (R = rare-earth metal, Tn = transition metal, X = Cl, I) containing
   extended mixed-metal chains are compared and contrasted: (1) Pr3RuI3
   (P2(1)/m), (2) Gd3MnI3 (P21/m), and (3) Pr3RuCI3 (Pnma). The structures
   all feature double chains built of pairs of condensed R-6(Tn) octahedral
   chains encased by halogen atoms. Pr3RuI3 (1) lacks significant Ru-Ru
   bonding, evidently because of packing restrictions imposed by the large
   closed-shell size of iodine. However, the vertex Pr2 atoms on the chain
   exhibit a marked electronic differentiation. These are strongly bound to
   the central Ru (and to four l), but very little to four neighboring Pr
   in the cluster according to bond populations, in contrast to Pr2-Pr
   ``bond{''} distances that are very comparable to those elsewhere. In
   Gd3MnI3 (2), the smaller metal atoms allow substantial distortions and
   Mn-Mn bonding. Pr3RuCI3 (3), in contrast to the iodide (1), can be
   described in terms of a more tightly bound superstructure of (2) in
   which both substantial Ru-Ru bonding and an increased number of Pr-CI
   contacts in very similar mixed-metal chains are favored by the smaller
   closed-shell contacts of chlorine. Local Spin Density Approximation
   (LSDA) Linearized Muffin-Tin Orbital (LMTO)-ASA calculations and Crystal
   Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) analyses show that the customary
   structural descriptions in terms of condensed, Tn-stuffed, R-R bonded
   polyhedral frameworks are poor representations of the bonding in all.
   Hamilton bond populations (-ICOHP) for the polar mixed-metal R-Tn and
   the somewhat smaller R-X interactions account for 75-90\% of the total
   populations in each of these phases, together with smaller contributions
   and variations for R-R and Tn-Tn interactions. The strength of such R-Tn
   contributions in polar intermetallics was first established or
   anticipated by Brewer. The rare-earth-metal atoms are significantly
   oxidized in these compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To prospectively assess diagnostic performance of response
   assessment fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed
   tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in patients with HNSCC treated with
   high-precision definitive (chemo)radiation.
   Methods: Fifty-seven patients treated on a prospective clinical trial
   having post-treatment response assessment FDG-PET/CT scans were
   included. Clinico-pathologic findings and follow-up information was
   considered as reference standard.
   Results: First response assessment FDG-PET/CT was done at a median of 9
   weeks (inter-quartile range 8-10 weeks) from compleation of treatment.
   The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative
   predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of first response assessment
   FDG-PET/CT for identifying residual disease at primary site was 50\%,
   91.8\%, 50\%, 91.8\%, and 86\%. The corresponding figures for the neck
   were 62.5\%, 98\%, 83.3\%, 94.1\%, and 93\%. With a median follow-up of
   26 months (range 7-45 months), the 3-year loco-regional control (83.9\%
   vs 58.3\%, p = 0.001) and overall survival (68.8\% vs 58.3\%, p = 0.063)
   was significantly better in patients with negative response assessment
   scans.
   Conclusion: The overall diagnostic accuracy of response assessment
   FDG-PET/CT is good, but its sensitivity and PPV is somewhat low,
   particularly for primary site. A negative response assessment FDG-PET/CT
   scan is highly suggestive of absence of viable disease that could be
   used to guide decision-making. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{During the past 22 ka of activity at Somma-Vesuvius, catastrophic
   pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) have been generated repeatedly.
   Examples are those that destroyed the towns of Pompeii and Ercolano in
   AD 79, as well as Torre del Greco and several circum-Vesuvian villages
   in AD 1631. Using new field data and data available from the literature,
   we delineate the area impacted by PDCs at Somma-Vesuvius to improve the
   related hazard assessment. We mainly focus on the dispersal, thickness,
   and extent of the PDC deposits generated during seven plinian and
   sub-plinian eruptions, namely, the Pomici di Base, Greenish Pumice,
   Pomici di Mercato, Pomici di Avellino, Pompeii Pumice, AD 472 Pollena,
   and AD 1631 eruptions. We present maps of the total thickness of the PDC
   deposits for each eruption. Five out of seven eruptions dispersed PDCs
   radially, sometimes showing a preferred direction controlled by the
   position of the vent and the paleotopography. Only the PDCs from AD 1631
   eruption were influenced by the presence of the Mt Somma caldera wall
   which stopped their advance in a northerly direction. Most PDC deposits
   are located downslope of the pronounced break-in slope that marks the
   base of the Somma-Vesuvius cone. PDCs from the Pomici di Avellino and
   Pompeii Pumice eruptions have the most dispersed deposits (extending
   more than 20 km from the inferred vent). These deposits are relatively
   thin, normally graded, and stratified. In contrast, thick, massive,
   lithicrich deposits are only dispersed within 7 to 8 km of the vent.
   Isopach maps and the deposit features reveal that PDC dispersal was
   strongly controlled by the intensity of the eruption (in terms of magma
   discharge rate), the position of the vent area with respect to the Mt
   Somma caldera wall, and the pre-existing topography. Facies
   characteristics of the PDC deposits appear to correlate with dispersal;
   the stratified facies are consistently dispersed more widely than the
   massive facies.}},

Abstract = {{Terbinafine, a widely used antifungal drug, is a challenging molecule
   for quantitative bioanalysis due to certain factors contributing assay
   variability Despite previous attempts at human plasma determination of
   terbinafine, exhaustive stability of the drug or an internal standard
   was lacking Internal standard stability with negligible variation
   throughout the analysis is an indicator of a reliable bioanalytical
   method as the majority of LC-MS/MS assays are based on analyte/IS
   response ratios for quantitation A newly developed high-throughput
   simple LC-MS/MS method is described for human plasma determination of
   terbinafine using naftifine internal standard and eluting all compounds
   within 2 min A solid-phase extraction of terbinafine achieving mean
   recovery of 84 3\% (CV < 4\%) without compromising sensitivity (limit of
   quantitation 5 11 ng/mL) or linearity (5 11-3014 19 ng/mL) is delineated
   in this paper A heated nebulizer in positive multiple reaction
   monitoring mode was employed with transitions m/z 292 2 -> 141 1 and 288
   2 -> 117 0 for terbinafine and naftifine, respectively, resulting in
   excellent chromatographic separation on a Hypurity Advance (50 x 4 6 mm,
   5 mu m) column The developed method was successfully applied to clinical
   samples and for the first time demonstrated marked improved extraction
   efficiency and reliable long-term plasma stability results without any
   internal standard response variation during the entire course of study

Abstract = {{Long-term depression (LTD) is a form of synaptic plasticity that may
   contribute to information storage in the central nervous system. Here we
   report that LTD can be elicited in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the rat
   prefrontal cortex by pairing low frequency stimulation with a modest
   postsynaptic depolarization. The induction of LTD required the
   activation of both metabotropic glutamate receptors of the mGlu1 subtype
   and voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (VSCCs) of the T/R, P/Q and N types,
   leading to the stimulation of intracellular inositol trisphosphate (IP3)
   receptors by IP3 and Ca2+. The subsequent release of Ca2+ from
   intracellular stores activated the protein phosphatase cascade involving
   calcineurin and protein phosphatase 1. The activation of purinergic
   P2Y(1) receptors blocked LTD. This effect was prevented by P2Y(1)
   receptor antagonists and was absent in mice lacking P2Y(1) but not
   P2Y(2) receptors. We also found that activation of P2Y(1) receptors
   inhibits Ca2+ transients via VSCCs in the apical dendrites and spines of
   pyramidal neurons. In addition, we show that the release of ATP under
   hypoxia is able to inhibit LTD by acting on postsynaptic P2Y(1)
   receptors. In conclusion, these data suggest that the reduction of Ca2+
   influx via VSCCs caused by the activation of P2Y(1) receptors by ATP is
   the possible mechanism for the inhibition of LTD in prefrontal cortex.

Abstract = {{The search task and the system both affect the demand on cognitive
   resources during information search. In some situations the demands may
   become too high for a person. This article has a three-fold goal. First,
   it presents and critiques methods to measure cognitive load. Second, it
   explores the distribution of load across search task stages. Finally, it
   seeks to improve our understanding of factors affecting cognitive load
   levels in information search. To this end, a controlled Web search
   experiment with 48 participants was conducted. Interaction logs were
   used to segment search tasks semiautomatically into task stages.
   Cognitive load was assessed using a new variant of the dual-task method.
   Average cognitive load was found to vary by search task stages. It was
   significantly higher during query formulation and user description of a
   relevant document as compared to examining search results and viewing
   individual documents. Semantic information shown next to the search
   results lists in one of the studied interfaces was found to decrease
   mental demands during query formulation and examination of the search
   results list. These findings demonstrate that changes in dynamic
   cognitive load can be detected within search tasks. Dynamic assessment
   of cognitive load is of core interest to information science because it
   enriches our understanding of cognitive demands imposed on people
   engaged in the search process by a task and the interactive information
   retrieval system employed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we offer an account of the meta-evaluation of a special
   administrative arrangement, the Dutch Closed Criminal Cases Evaluation
   Commission (Dutch acronym: CEAS).The CEAS is a provisional evaluation
   institution meant to investigate alleged missteps during criminal
   investigation and prosecution, which may have caused the conviction of
   an innocent person
   We developed a tailor-made approach to reconstruct the commission's
   `evaluation logic'; this is illustrated by reconstructing the activities
   of a selection committee and two investigative subcommittees of the
   CEAS. Subsequently, we applied a set of criteria to assess among others
   the timeliness, independence and transparency of the commission's
   work.We offer a number of conclusions and recommendations, particularly
   with regard to future (meta-)evaluation research.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling and analysis of MR Images of the developing human brain is a
   challenge due to rapid changes in brain morphology and morphometry. We
   present an approach to the construction of a spatiotemporal atlas of the
   fetal brain with temporal models of MR intensity, tissue probability and
   shape changes This spatiotemporal model is created from a set of
   reconstructed MR images of fetal subjects with different gestational
   ages Groupwise registration of manual segmentations and voxelwise
   nonlinear modeling allow us to capture the appearance, disappearance and
   spatial variation of brain structures over time Applying this model to
   atlas-based segmentation, we generate age-specific MR templates and
   tissue probability maps and use them to initialize automatic tissue
   delineation in new MR images The choice of model parameters and the
   final performance are evaluated using clinical MR scans of young fetuses
   with gestational ages ranging from 20 57 to 24 71 weeks. Experimental
   results indicate that quadratic temporal models can correctly capture
   growth-related changes in the fetal brain anatomy and provide
   improvement in accuracy of atlas-based tissue segmentation (C) 2010

Title = {{Potential oral manifestations of cardiovascular drugs}},
Journal = {{ORAL DISEASES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{769-773}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective:
   The aim of this work was to determine the frequency and nature of oral
   manifestations secondary to use of cardiovascular drugs.
   Methods:
   Five hundred and thirty one patients attending an adult cardiology
   clinic in Saudi Arabia were questioned about the occurrence of oral
   dryness, dysgeusia, or burning sensation and were clinically evaluated
   for the presence of oral mucosal or gingival disease. Data were
   statistically analyzed with chi-squared tests, odds ratios and Student's
   t-test.
   Results:
   Oral symptoms and/or signs were recorded in 75 (14.1\%) patients with
   xerostomia being the most common (7.5\%), followed by lichenoid (lichen
   planus-like) lesions (3.6\%) and dysgeusia (1.9\%). Xerostomia was
   significantly more frequent in patients with a history of diabetes
   mellitus and in female patients (P < 0.05). There were no statistically
   significant differences (P > 0.05) between patients with or without oral
   manifestations when age, gender, cardiovascular risk factor, cardiac
   disease, type of cardiac drug used or the number of medications were
   assessed. There was a trend for xerostomia to be less frequent in
   patients receiving therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
   and a slight trend of xerostomia to be more likely with increased number
   of non-cardiac and total number of agents per subject. The number of
   non-cardiac and total medications taken by patients with potential oral
   manifestations tended to be greater than that of patients without oral
   manifestations.
   Conclusions:
   The frequency of potential oral manifestations in patients receiving
   cardiovascular agents was 14.1\%. The occurrence and character of the
   oral manifestations had no significant relation with individual cardiac
   drugs, although there was a trend for oral manifestations to be likely
   with increasing number of drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Background Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
   (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
   with the Proms system (St Jude Medical, St Paul, MN, USA) achieved
   significantly better microvascular flow as measured by ST-segment
   resolution However, no differences were observed in left ventricular
   ejection fraction or infarct size as obtained by cardiovascular magnetic
   resonance imaging The goal of the present study was to evaluate the
   effect of combined proximal embolic protection and thrombus aspiration
   on core lab adjudicated angiographic outcomes
   Methods In the PRoximal Embolic Protection in Acute myocardial
   infarction and Resolution of ST Elevation (PREPARE) study, patients were
   randomised to primary PCI with the Proms system (n=141) or primary PCI
   alone (n=143) An independent core laboratory re-evaluated all angiograms
   and adjudicated the angiographic outcomes and computerised quantitative
   blush evaluation (QuBE) value
   Results There were no significant differences in Thrombolysis In
   Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade, myocardial blush grade, or
   angiographic signs of distal embolisation among the two arms QuBE values
   did not significantly differ between the Proxis-treated patients and
   control patients (15 1 +/- 5 4 vs 15 8 +/- 5 5, respectively, p=0 34)
   Conclusion Primary PCI with combined proximal embolic protection and
   thrombus aspiration in STEMI patients more frequently resulted in
   complete immediate ST resolution compared with control patients However,
   there were no significant differences in core laboratory adjudicated
   angiographic outcomes (Neth Heart J 2010,18 531-6)}},

Abstract = {{Steel conical vessels with upper cylindrical caps are widely used as
   liquid containments in elevated water tanks. This type of structure for
   containing water is referred to as ``combined conical tank{''}. A number
   of catastrophic failures of combined conical tanks occurred during the
   past decades in various locations around the globe. Previous studies
   available in the literature focused on pure conical tanks, where the
   vessels have no upper cylindrical caps. The current study focuses on
   characterizing the buckling behaviour of combined conical tanks under
   the effect of hydrostatic pressure. The study is conducted numerically
   using a three-dimensional finite element model developed in-house. The
   effects of geometric imperfection and residual stresses as well as the
   variation of the geometric and material parameters on the buckling
   capacity of combined conical tanks are investigated. Finally, a
   comparison between the buckling capacities of combined and equivalent
   pure conical tanks is conducted. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Most palliative care patients will require multidisciplinary management
   to optimise symptom control. This overview will show that endovascular
   procedures are an important consideration in many cases. These
   procedures can be used primarily, or more commonly, as an adjunct to
   other therapy modalities. Catheter, wire and modern imaging technology
   allow interventional radiologists to treat a wide, and growing, spectrum
   of conditions. Percutaneous endovascular procedures allow for minimal
   discomfort and rapid recovery, ideal for palliative care patients. Many
   symptoms (or life-threatening conditions) can be treated with
   endovascular techniques. This discussion aims to demonstrate the
   increasing spectrum of endovascular interventions and review the
   evidence available. This overview cannot provide an exhaustive list of
   possible procedures, but covers most aspects and should reinforce the
   evidence base for intervention in this field. We have included a section
   on the technical aspects of endovascular intervention, including the use
   of sedoanalgesia, and post-embolisation syndrome. Embolisation of
   bleeding tumours, including bronchial artery embolisation and
   symptomatic renal tumour embolisation, is a fairly well-established
   technique. Embolisation of symptomatic skeletal metastases has shown
   good results. Covered stent grafting of ruptured or threatened arteries
   is an evolving field that has benefited from developments in stent graft
   technology and design. Symptomatic, unresectable liver tumours can be
   embolised with good results. Stent insertion in the superior vena cava
   produces dramatic relief of superior vena cava syndrome. Advanced
   malignancy predisposes to venous thrombosis; caval filtration is
   discussed together with venous thrombectomy. (C) 2010 The Royal College

Abstract = {{There is no doubt that laparoscopic surgeries have replaced open
   surgeries in many gynecologic operations and have led to the development
   of novel techniques such as single-port laparoscopic surgery.
   Single-port surgery has been performed mainly for hysterectomy or
   adnexectomy recently, and it has also been carefully considered for
   other possible single-port surgeries such as cancer operations. Although
   pelvic lymph node dissection is a common procedure in gynecologic cancer
   operations, it has been rarely performed with single-port laparoscopic
   access because of technical difficulties. In this report, we present a
   detailed description of single-port laparoscopic pelvic lymph node
   dissection with modified radical vaginal hysterectomy in 2 patients with
   cervical cancer, stage IA2. Combining either classic or modified Schauta
   radical vaginal hysterectomy with single-port laparoscopic technique
   could be a good option for the management of patients with cervical
   cancer.}},

Abstract = {{In 2008, the Phase 3 program to complete a 1.3 GHz (30.5 T) NMR magnet
   started at the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute
   of Technology. It comprises two sub-phases, 3A and 3B. In Phase 3A, a
   600 MHz high temperature superconductor (HTS) insert magnet (H600) will
   be designed, constructed, and operated in the bore of a 500 MHz low
   temperature superconductor (LTS) background magnet. This will be
   followed by Phase 3B, in which the H600 will be combined with a 700 MHz
   LTS background magnet to complete a 1.3 GHz NMR LTS/HTS magnet. This
   paper presents and discusses design issues for two conductor options for
   H600: BiSCCO-2223 (Bi2223) and coated-YBCO or its variants, here
   designated as YBCO. For each conductor option, we focused on the
   following issues: (1) elastic and thermal properties; (2) critical
   current vs. field performance; (3) splice and index heat dissipations;
   (4) mechanical and thermal stresses; and (5) protection. (c) 2010

   In contrast to standard deconvolution approaches, for which noise can be
   a limiting factor in the performance, our approach allows the retrieval
   of distorted signals embedded in a very-high-noise environment. We
   analyzed the deconvolution orders for this device using a nonlinear
   transform method. Resolution gray-level recovery of blurred noisy images
   is demonstrated for several different types of image blur. (C) 2010

   Candida albicans}},
Journal = {{PLOS PATHOGENS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{When colonising host-niches or non-animated medical devices, individual
   cells of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans expand into significant
   biomasses. Here we show that within such biomasses, fungal metabolically
   generated CO2 acts as a communication molecule promoting the switch from
   yeast to filamentous growth essential for C. albicans pathology. We find
   that CO2-mediated intra-colony signalling involves the adenylyl cyclase
   protein (Cyr1p), a multi-sensor recently found to coordinate fungal
   responses to serum and bacterial peptidoglycan. We further identify Lys
   1373 as essential for CO2/bicarbonate regulation of Cyr1p. Disruption of
   the CO2/bicarbonate receptor-site interferes selectively with C.
   albicans filamentation within fungal biomasses. Comparisons between the
   Drosophila melanogaster infection model and the mouse model of
   disseminated candidiasis, suggest that metabolic CO2 sensing may be
   important for initial colonisation and epithelial invasion. Our results
   reveal the existence of a gaseous Candida signalling pathway and its
   molecular mechanism and provide insights into an evolutionary conserved
   CO2-signalling system.}},

Abstract = {{Authors who do not distinguish between Emerging Market Economies (EMEs)

   the effects of real exchange-rate volatility on exports of ten EMEs and
   eleven other developing countries that were not classified as EMEs over
   our estimation period. We use panel-data sets that cover the periods
   1980:Q1-2006:Q4 for the EMEs and 1980:Q1-2005:Q4 for the other
   developing countries. We use two estimation methods generalized method
   of moments (GMM) estimation and time-varying-coefficient (TVC)
   estimation. The TVC procedure removes specification biases from the
   coefficients, revealing the underlying stable parameters of interest. We
   obtain similar results as previous authors for only the eleven non-EME
   developing countries we consider. In contrast, our results for the EMEs
   do not show a negative and significant effect of exchange-rate
   volatility on the exports of the countries considered. Our findings
   suggest that the open capital markets of EMEs may have reduced the
   effects of exchange-rate fluctuations on exports compared with those
   effects in the cases of other developing countries. (C) 2010 Published

Abstract = {{Phosphogypsum (PG), a byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer industry,
   was produced and stockpiled at the Agrium Fort Saskatchewan facility
   from 1965 to 1991. Upon decommissioning, the outer slopes of the PG
   stacks were reclaimed by applying 15 cm of topsoil and planting a
   non-native seed mix. Physical, chemical, and hydrologic evaluations of
   the cover system confirmed that plants were successfully growing in
   various soil capping depths and were often rooting more than 200 mm into
   the PG. Percolation past the substrate into PG during a typical storm
   event was low (<10 mm), and runoff from the stacks was negligible.
   Runoff quality met most guidelines, but some parameters, including
   fluoride, were up to 18 times higher than provincial or federal
   guidelines for soil and water quality. However, the cover system, when
   applied appropriately, does meet basic reclamation objectives. The
   exceedances are found in areas where the cover system has been
   compromised by erosion or mixing or in areas where the cover system has
   not been fully applied, such as roads or the inner basin. In areas where
   the cover system has been applied successfully, basic reclamation
   requirements are met.}},

Abstract = {{Using mean field theory and high-temperature series expansions (HTSEs),
   extrapolated with the Pade approximants method, the effect of Zn doping
   on magnetic properties of NiFe2O4 ferrite spinel has been studied. The
   nearest neighbour super-exchange interactions for intra-site (J(AA),
   J(BB)) and inter-site (J(AB)) of the ZnxNi1-xFe2O4 ferrites spinels, in
   the range 0 <= x <= 1, have been computed using the probability
   approach, based on Mossbauer data. The paramagnetic CurieWeiss
   temperature theta and the Curie temperature T-C are calculated as a
   function of Zn concentration. The critical exponent gamma associated
   with magnetic susceptibility is calculated. The spin correlation
   functions intra-plane and inter-plane have been also computed and
   compared with exchange couplings. The obtained theoretical results are
   in good agreement with experimental ones obtained by magnetic
   measurements and Mossbauer spectroscopy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Introduction: CD40 and CD40L, as costimulatory molecules, are reported
   to play a critical role for cytokine production and antigen-specific
   T-cell activation in acute viral myocarditis (VMC). The purpose of this
   study was to probe the therapeutic effect of CD40-Ig in coxsackievirus
   B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis. Methods: Adolescent male Balb/c mice were
   infected with cardiovirulent CVB3 and then injected with CD40-Ig (0.1
   mg/kg) at 6 h and 3 days postinfection (pi), with IgG (0.1 mg/kg) as
   control. The surviving mice were sacrificed on the seventh day. The
   copies of CVB3 mRNA in the myocardium were detected by real-time PCR and
   the expression of CD40 protein and CD4(+) T cell was assessed by
   immunohistochemistry method. The serum level of IL-4 and IFN-gamma and
   their transcriptions in the myocardium were determined by ELISA and
   real-time PCR. Results: The mortality was low in VMC model mice
   receiving CD40-Ig treatment with relived inflammation and reduced
   transcription of CVB3 in the myocardium. The expression pattern of
   IFN-gamma (Th1-related cytokine) and IL-4 (Th2-related cytokine) was
   altered to Th1 prevalence in the acute phase of VMC. Intervention of
   CD40-Ig switched the balance of Th1/Th2. Conclusions: Our findings
   suggest that intervention of CD40-Ig can relieve the myocardial injury
   and inhibit viral replication of CVB3 in VMC. Its mechanism may involve
   blocking the interaction between CD40 and CD40L and regulating the
   Th1/Th2 balance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A microstructure fibre for broadband dispersion compensation with low

   The effects of the number of air-hole rings, the air-hole diameters and

   phenomenon are numerically described. The results indicate that the
   inner six air-hole rings have stronger impact on dispersion and

   rings and the lattice pitch, the proposed microstructure fibre can
   compensate (to within 0.5\%) the dispersion of 190 times of its length
   of a standard single-mode fibre with a low nonlinear coefficient over

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recently, a nonperturbative formulation of 4d N = 4 super Yang-Mills
   theory which does not require fine tuning at least to all order in
   perturbation theory has been proposed by combining two-dimensional
   lattice and matrix model techniques. In this paper we provide an
   analogous model by utilizing deconstruction approach of Kaplan et al.
   Two-dimensional lattice with a plane wave deformation is deconstructed
   from a matrix model and two additional dimensions emerge through the
   Myers effect. In other words we construct a D1-brane theory from which a
   D3-brane theory comes out. The action is much simpler than the previous
   formulation and hence numerical study, which enables us to test the
   AdS(5)/CFT4 duality at fully nonperturbative level, becomes much easier.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{Tomographic reconstructions of sections of human femoral bone were
   created from x-ray data sets taken using synchrotron radiation of 26.4
   key and with isotropic voxels 1.47 mu m on a side. We demonstrate that
   it is possible to segment the data to isolate both the osteocyte lacunae
   and the Haversian canals in the bone as well as identifying osteon
   boundaries. From this information a wealth of data relating to bone
   structure becomes available. The data were used to map the spatial
   positions of the osteocyte lacunae, relative to the Haversian canals and
   of the osteon boundaries. The dimensions and volume of the imaged
   osteocyte lacunae were measured for close to 10,000 lacunae. When
   averaged over the 11 osteons measured, osteocyte densities varied from 4
   x 10(4) per mm(3) close to the Haversian canals to about 9 x 10(4) per
   mm(3) at 80\% of osteon radius. The nearest-neighbour distances varied
   from 10 mu m to 40 mu m with a peak at 23 mu m and an approximately
   normal distribution. The distribution of lacunar long-axis length was
   also approximately normal with a small positive skew and the peak value
   was 8 mu m with a range from 3 mu m to 20 mu m. The most significant
   finding from this study was that the distribution of the measured
   volumes of osteocyte lacunae had two distinct peaks, one at 200 mu m(3)
   and a second at 330 mu m(3). (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{NiSO4/Al2O3 and NiO/Al2O3 catalyst precursors were formed by calcination
   of NiSO4 center dot 6H(2)O/ Al2O3 at 500 and 800 degrees C,
   respectively. The catalyst precursor was reduced under H-2 and N-2 and
   then reacted under C2H2, H-2 and N-2 at 650 degrees C. Coiled carbon
   fibres were formed in fixed- and fluidised-bed reactors using the
   NiSO4/Al2O3 catalyst precursor. Thermodynamic modelling using an
   infinite equilibrium stage construction predicted complete reduction of
   NiSO4 to Ni and simultaneous H2S formation occurs in both fixed- and
   fluidised-bed systems. XRD measurements confirmed that Ni was the only
   catalytically active crystalline species present at concentrations >0.5
   wt.\% (XRD detection limit) post-reduction, however XRF and XPS
   measurements additionally detected the presence of small quantities
   (<0.9 wt.\% S) of S species. S is adsorbed onto the Ni surfaces during
   reduction when H2S is released and dissociates on the Ni surface.
   Non-coiled carbon fibres produced on the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst formed from
   the NiO/Al2O3 precursor demonstrated that modification of Ni/Al2O3 with
   S is required for coiled carbon fibre synthesis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A noval composite electrolyte incorporating inorganic NiO nanosheets
   into iodide/triiodide liquid electrolyte containing 4-tert-butylpyridine
   (TBP) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) was reported herein for the
   first time. The hydrothermally prepared NiO nanosheets showed a high
   aspect ratio, confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy
   (FESEM). DSCs assembled with such nanosheet-based composite electrolytes
   showed more than 15\% increased photocurrent, and hence significantly
   promoted light-to-energy conversion efficiency relative to reference
   one. The enhancement of photocurrent is primarily due to the
   light-scattering effect which is brought by the incorporating of
   inorganic nanosheets. Also, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
   was employed to investigate the charge-transfer kinetics at the
   interface between the counter electrode and the composite electrolyte of
   DSCs. The symmetrical cells (TCO/Pt/electrolyte/Pt/TCO) assembled with
   such nanosheet-based composite electrolyte showed a decreased
   charge-transfer resistance (R,). The optimum DSC including NiO
   nanosheets showed a short-circuit current of 14.01 mA/cm(2), an
   open-circuit voltage of 0.73 V, a fill factor of 0.54, and an overall
   conversion efficiency of 5.44\% at 100 mW/cm(2).}},

Abstract = {{We have recently shown that women with endometriosis express an
   increased amount of telomerase and nucleolin, with concomitant loss of
   gamma-H2AX in eutopic endometrium. To further examine these selected
   factors that regulate cell fate, in the pathogenesis of endometriosis,
   we studied the expression of telomerase, nucleolin, proliferating cell
   nuclear antigen and gamma-H2AX in ectopic endometriotic deposits from
   women, and in matched eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissue from a
   baboon model of endometriosis.
   Ectopic active peritoneal endometriotic lesions were collected from
   seven symptomatic women. Endometriosis was induced in six baboons by
   intra-peritoneal autologous inoculation of menstrual endometrium.
   Eutopic and matched ectopic endometrial tissues were collected prior to
   and 6, 12 and 15 months after the induction of endometriosis as
   previously described. Eutopic endometrium was also obtained from eight
   healthy fertile control baboons. Immunohistochemistry was performed as
   previously described, and telomerase activity was confirmed using the
   telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay.
   All active human endometriotic lesions expressed the proliferative
   markers but showed weak or absent staining for gamma-H2AX. A similar
   expression pattern of these markers was seen in the ectopic lesions of
   the baboons with induced disease. In these baboons, the eutopic
   endometrium also showed intense immunoreactivity for all proliferative
   markers 6-12 months after induction with a parallel loss of gamma-H2AX.
   The opposite staining pattern was seen in eutopic endometrium of healthy
   animals and in pre-induction endometrium of animals with induced
   disease.
   Endometriotic lesions have excess proliferative potential; in baboons,
   these were present within 12 months of the initiation of the disease. In
   eutopic tissue, these changes appear to be induced by the development of
   endometriosis.}},

Abstract = {{A processing technology based upon a temporary bond-debond approach has
   been developed that enables direct fabrication of high-performance
   electronic devices on flexible substrates. This technique facilitates
   processing of flexible plastic and metal-foil substrates through
   automated standard semiconductor and flat-panel tool sets without tool
   modification. The key to processing with these tool sets is rigidifying
   the flexible substrates through temporary bonding to carriers that can
   be handled in a similar manner as silicon wafers or glass substrates in
   conventional electronics manufacturing. To demonstrate the power of this
   processing technology, amorphous-silicon thin-film-transistor (a-Si:H
   TFT) backplanes designed for electrophoretic displays (EPDs) were
   fabricated using a low-temperature process (180 degrees C) on
   bonded-plastic and metal-foil substrates. The electrical characteristics
   of the TFTs fabricated on flexible substrates are found to be consistent
   with those processed with identical conditions on rigid silicon wafers.
   These TFTs on plastic exhibit a field-effect mobility of 0.77
   cm(2)/V-sec, on/off current ratio >10(9) at V-ds = 10 V, sub-threshold
   swing of 365 mV/dec, threshold voltage of 0.49 V, and leakage current
   lower than 2 pA/mu m gate width. After full TFT-array fabrication on the
   bonded substrate and subsequent debonding, the flexible substrate
   retains its original flexibility; this enables bending of the EPD
   display without loss in performance.}},

Title = {{Direct and indirect food web regulation of microbial decomposers in

Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1785-1795}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The direct and indirect regulation of primary productivity has been well
   established in autotrophic-based ecosystems; however, less is known
   about the processes affecting decomposers in detrital-based ecosystems.
   Because, small headwater, woodland streams are a dominate feature in
   most ecosystems and are tightly linked to terrestrial detritus,
   understanding decomposer-mediated functions in these systems is critical
   for understanding carbon processes across the landscape. In this light,
   we conducted a microcosm and mesocosm experiment to test the direct and
   indirect food web effects on decomposers in small stream ecosystems. The
   results from the microcosm experiment supported an existing literature,
   demonstrating that nutrients directly stimulate decomposers and that
   microbivores directly reduce decomposers. Based on well-founded food web
   theory in autotrophic systems, we predicted that fishes from different
   trophic-functional guilds would indirectly stimulate decomposers by
   enhancing dissolved nutrients and by reducing microbivore densities. Our
   mesocosm experiment partially supported these predictions. Specifically,
   we found that fishes that consumed mostly terrestrial foods increased
   decomposers from the bottom-up by enhancing allochthonous nutrient
   loading into the stream ecosystems. Contrary to our predictions,
   however, predatory fishes that consume microbivores did not increase
   decomposers from the top-down. Rather, in streams with the predatory
   fish species, microbivores increased ( rather than decreased) on leaf
   litter. This may have resulted from an experimental artifact associated
   with refuge provided by leaf packs. In conclusion, our data demonstrate
   that decomposers are regulated by similar direct and indirect processes
   important in autotrophic-based ecosystems. This provides further
   evidence that food web processes can regulate leaf decomposition and
   flux of detrital carbon through ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Background The emergence in humans of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (pH1N1) with
   similarities to swine influenza viruses (SIVs) caused much concern for
   both human and animal health as potential for interspecies transmission
   was initially unknown.
   Objectives The goal of this study was to develop a real-time RT-PCR test
   for the detection and differentiation of 2009 pH1N1 and endemic
   influenza A viruses in North America. Methods Matrix (M) gene sequences
   from U.S. human pH1N1 cases and U.S. SIVs were aligned to determine a
   suitable region for an assay target. Primers were selected to amplify
   all influenza A. Two probes were designed to differentiate pH1N1 (EA
   matrix) from endemic (NA matrix) SIVs. The assay was validated using the
   first U.S. pH1N1 strain, 10 human pH1N1-positive specimens and nine U.S.
   SIV isolates, then evaluated on 165 specimens of swine and other animal
   origin submitted to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic
   Laboratory.
   Results were compared to other influenza A PCR assays. Sequences from
   additional pH1N1 strains and contemporary H1N1 SIVs were used to assess
   robustness of the selected primers and probes for the intended purpose.
   Results The new assay's results from clinical specimens concurred with
   confirmatory PCR testing. The additional probe designed from sequence
   analysis improved detection of the NA matrix subtype when added to the
   reaction mixture.
   Conclusion This assay detects and differentiates pH1N1 and US influenza
   A viruses in various sample matrices and species. Good bioinformatics
   support is critical when designing RT-PCR assays and monitoring their
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of the study was to identify which fall-risk tool is
   most accurate for assessing adults in the hospital setting.
   Background: Falls can have physical, emotional, social, and financial
   consequences. Risk assessment affords the first opportunity in
   prevention.
   Methods: To standardize the use of a fall-risk tool across the Baylor
   Health Care System, nurse executives undertook a meta-analysis of
   published research on fall-risk assessment tools used with adult
   inpatients.
   Results: Both random-effects and fixed-effects models showed that Morse
   Fall Scale had significantly higher sensitivity than St Thomas's Risk
   Assessment Tool (STRATIFY). Specificity of Morse Fall Scale was
   significantly lower than that of STRATIFY with the fixed-effects model,
   but the random-effects model showed the opposite. Morse Fall Scale had a
   significantly higher Youden index than STRATIFY with the fixed-effects
   model (P = .001), but the result from random-effects model indicated no
   significant difference (P = .117). The sensitivity, specificity, and
   Youden index fell within the 95\% confidence intervals.
   Conclusions: Meta-analysis is a useful methodology for evaluating
   current evidence when variation exists in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Pregnancy is a critical time for women struggling with disordered eating
   and weight concerns. For the majority of women with eating disorders,
   symptoms improve during pregnancy. Other women, particularly those with
   either subclinical or binge eating disorders, are at risk for an
   escalation of pathologic behaviors, putting both mother and fetus at
   risk for negative birth outcomes. Routinely screening for eating
   disorders will help identify those women who will most benefit from
   specialized care. Attention must be paid to possible harmful comorbid
   behaviors found in women with eating disorders, such as smoking, alcohol
   use, abusing laxatives or herbal supplements, and self-injurious
   behavior. This article reviews the mixed research findings of the impact
   of eating disorders upon pregnancy and identifies key times in prenatal
   care where nutritional counseling and specific interventions will
   increase the likelihood of positive pregnancy outcomes. The postpartum
   period is another critical time for provider intervention that may lower
   women's risks for eating disorder relapse, postpartum depression, and

Abstract = {{Predation is a strong selective force in most natural systems,
   potentially fueling evolutionary changes in prey morphology, life
   history and behaviour. Recent work has suggested that contrasting
   predation pressures may lead to population differentiation in
   personality traits. However, there are indications that these
   personality traits also differ between sexes and not necessarily in a
   consistent way between populations. We used an integrative approach to
   quantify boldness (latency to emerge from a shelter) in wild-caught
   guppies in relation to predation pressure, population origin, sex and
   size. In addition we quantified the repeatability of these personality
   traits. We show that predation regime had significant effects on
   emergence time. In general, fish from high predation localities emerged
   sooner from the shelter compared to those from low predation localities.
   We found strong sex differences; males were significantly bolder than
   females. The relationship between emergence time and body size was
   non-significant in all populations. We discuss what responses to expect
   from predator-nave versus predator-experienced individuals and how this
   can be linked to the shyness-boldness continuum.}},

Abstract = {{Background Tracheo oesophageal fistula (TOF) and oesophageal atresia
   (OA) are congenital anomalies commonly associated with pulmonary
   complications during early childhood This study investigated the role of
   the forced oscillation technique (FOT) in assessing lung function in
   young children with repaired TOF/OA Methods Forty children with repaired
   TOF/OA of median (range) age 8 0 (3 3-10 6) years and 20 healthy
   children without TOF aged 6 1 (3 1-10 8) years were studied FOT
   measurements were attempted in all subjects and spirometry only in those
   6 years and above Resistance and reactance (both hPasL(-1)) at 6 Hz
   (Rrs6 and Xrs6 respectively) and 8 Hz (Rrs8 and Xrs8) measured using FOT
   and forced expired volume in 1 sec (FEV(1)) forced vital capacity
   functional residual capacity total lung capacity and residual volume
   (all L) obtained from spirometry or plethysmography were compared with
   reference values and expressed as z scores Results Technically
   acceptable measurements of Rrs6 Rrs8 Xrs6 Xrs8 Fdep and Fres were
   obtained in 37 children with TOF and 20 healthy children without TOE
   respectively Those with TOE had significantly higher mean (SD) z scores
   for Rrs6 {[}0 99 (0 75)] versus healthy children without TOE {[}0 31 (0
   69)] and lower mean (SD) z scores for Xrs6 {[}-1 04 (1 07)] versus
   healthy children without TOE {[}-0 34 (0 83)] Spirometry was successful
   in 24 of the 29 with TOE in whom it was attempted and all healthy
   children without TOF Mean (SD) z score for FEV(1) was significantly
   lower in those with TOE {[}-0 86 (1 13)] versus healthy children without
   TOF {[}0 67 (0 54)] z Scores for Rrs6 and FEV(1) were significantly
   correlated (r = -0 49 P = 0 003) Conclusions Children with repaired TOF
   have diminished lung function compared with healthy children FOT is
   sensitive and correlates well with standard spirometry It can be used to
   measure lung function in younger children when spirometry is difficult
   to perform and should be considered as an objective method for
   monitoring clinical progress in young children with TOF Pediatr Pulmonol

Title = {{Computer simulation of tumour control probabilities after irradiation
   for varying intrinsic radio-sensitivity using a single cell based model}},

Abstract = {{Background. Currently, optimisation of the dose distribution and
   clinical acceptance are almost entirely based on the physical dose
   distribution and tumour control probability modelling is far from being
   routinely used as objective in treatment planning. For future
   individualised radiotherapeutic strategies, a reliable patient specific
   simulation model, taking into account customised tumour features, is
   needed to predict and improve treatment outcome. Materials and methods.
   To approach these demands, a single cell and Monte-Carlo based model was
   developed, which enables three-dimensional tumour growth and radiation
   response simulation. Tumour cells were characterised by cell-associated
   features such as age, intrinsic radio-sensitivity, proliferation
   ability, and oxygenation status, while capillary cells were considered
   as sources of a radial-dependent oxygen profile. Response to radiation
   was simulated by the linear-quadratic model, taking into account the
   lower radio-sensitivity of poorly oxygenated tumour cells. Results. The
   present study shows the influence of the model components and
   demonstrates the impact of the intra-and inter-tumoural
   radio-sensitivity heterogeneity on the treatment response. Conclusion.
   The simulation model adequately delineates the importance of the above
   described selected parameters on tumour control probability, providing
   an insight into the interplay of different physical and biological
   parameters, and its relevance for an individual tumour response.}},

Abstract = {{Probabilistic techniques are widely used in the analysis of algorithms
   to estimate the computational complexity of algorithms or a

   for analyzing the expected time complexity of algorithms using
   higher-order-logic theorem proving The approach calls for mathematically
   modeling the algorithm along with its inputs, using indicator random
   variables, in higher-order logic This model is then used to formally
   reason about the expected time complexity of the underlying algorithm in
   a theorem prover The paper includes the higher-order-logic formalization
   of indicator random variables, which are fundamental to the proposed
   infrastructure In order to illustrate the practical effectiveness and

Abstract = {{Thus far, cylindrical phantoms with F-18 or Ge-68/Ga-68 have been used
   in the standard techniques for determining the cross-calibration factors
   (CCFs) of PET scanners. This paper describes a new practical method that
   uses a point-like Na-22 radioactive source for determining CCFs.
   A point-like Na-22 radioactive source (about 700 kBq) was equipped with
   a spherical aluminium absorber capsule to ensure the symmetry of the
   emitted photons. During measurements, the source was moved in the axial
   direction to cover the whole axial field of view (FOV) of a clinical PET
   scanner, SET-2400 W. The region-of-interest (ROI) values obtained in
   reconstructed images without scatter and attenuation corrections were
   used to calculate the CCFs of the PET scanner.
   The CCFs obtained by the proposed method agreed with those obtained by
   the standard cross-calibration (CC) method within a precision of 1.5\%
   (sigma). The temporal variations in the CCFs by the standard CC method
   were reproduced by the proposed method with a precision better than 1\%.
   The CC method with a moving Na-22 point-like radioactive source is
   practically useful for determining the CCFs of PET scanners and
   monitoring their variations.}},

Abstract = {{The Cretaceous Blue Mountain Inlier of eastern Jamaica contains the
   Bellevue lavas, which represent a Mid-to Late Campanian back-arc basin
   succession of tholeiitic volcanic rocks. The lavas are composed of
   basic/intermediate and intermediate/acidic subgroups that can be related
   by intraformation fractional crystallization. Trace element and Hf
   radiogenic isotope data reveal that the mantle component of the Bellevue
   magmas is consistent with derivation from a mantle plume (oceanic
   plateau) source region. Modeling indicates that the magmas formed by
   10\%-20\% partial melting of an oceanic plateau mantle source comprising
   spinel peridotite that had previously undergone approximately 5\%-7.5\%
   prior melt extraction in the garnet stability field. Trace element and
   radiogenic isotope systematics suggest that the Bellevue mantle source
   region was contaminated with a slab-derived component from both the
   altered basaltic slab and its pelagic sedimentary veneer. The data from
   the Bellevue lavas support the plateau reversal model of Caribbean
   tectonic evolution, whereby subduction on the Great Arc of the Caribbean
   was to the northeast until the Caribbean oceanic plateau collided with
   the southern portion of the Great Arc in the Santonian (85.8-83.5 Ma),
   resulting in subduction polarity reversal and thus southwest-dipping
   subduction. This polarity reversal allowed oceanic plateau source
   regions to be melted beneath a new back-arc basin to the southwest of
   the Great Arc.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to measure the fetal gastric volume
   using three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound during pregnancy.
   Three-dimensional sonographic examinations were performed involving 35
   pregnant women from 12 to 38 weeks of gestation. The fetal gastric
   volume was monitored every 5 min for a minimum of 40 min (40-60 min) in
   each woman. The rotational technique with Virtual Organ Computer-aided
   AnaLysis (VOCAL) was used to calculate the fetal gastric volume. Maximum
   and minimum gastric volumes were curvilinearly associated with the
   gestational age, respectively (R(2) = 0.611, p < 0.0001, and R(2) =
   50.407, p < 0.0001, respectively). A curvilinear relationship was noted
   between the functional capacity (maximum volume - minimum volume) of the
   fetal stomach and gestational age (R(2) = 0.531, p < 0.0001). The
   maximum volume change {[}(maximum volume - minimum volume/maximum
   volume) x 100] did not change during pregnancy (mean and standard
   deviation, 64.1\% +/- 16.1\%). However, gastric emptying cycles could
   not be determined in this study because of the short observation period
   and small number of subjects. Our findings suggest that the fetal
   gastric volume calculated by conventional two-dimensional ultrasound in
   previous investigations is approximately one-third of the maximum volume
   using 3-D ultrasound in the present study and that 3-D ultrasound is a
   superior means of evaluating the fetal gastric volume in utero. However,

Abstract = {{This study examined associations between the endorsement of drug use
   expectancies and the frequency and severity of marijuana use in a
   community sample of 332 women aged 18-24 years who were not explicitly
   seeking treatment for their marijuana use. Participants were enrolled in
   a larger intervention study of motivational interviewing for various
   health behaviors and provided self-reports of their current and past
   marijuana use, marijuana abuse/dependence symptoms, and marijuana use
   expectancies. Marijuana use expectancies were measured using the six
   subscales of the Marijuana Effects Expectancy Questionnaire (MEEQ). Use
   frequency was defined as the number of use days in the past month,
   severity as the total number of DSM-IV marijuana abuse or dependence
   symptom criteria met. Replicating and extending prior research,
   expectations regarding Relaxation and Tension Reduction emerged as a
   robust belief in this cohort, predicting not only frequency (p<.01) but
   also severity (p<.01) of marijuana use in multivariate analyses.
   Severity of marijuana use was further predicted by expectations
   regarding loss of control, affective changes following marijuana use,
   and other aspects of emotion dysregulation (Global Negative Effects,
   p<.01). These findings document meaningful associations between
   substance-related cognitions and use behavior and suggest that marijuana
   users who hold certain beliefs regarding marijuana use may be
   particularly susceptible to clinically significant problems associated
   with their substance use. As such, marijuana use expectancies may
   represent a clinical target that could be incorporated into future
   interventions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present investigation, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)
   thermally treated by KOH were adopted as the platinum supporting
   material for the oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysts. FTIR and
   Raman spectra were used to investigate the surface state of MWCNTs
   treated by KOH at different temperatures (700, 800, and 900 degrees C)
   and showed MWCNTs can be successfully functionalized. The structural
   properties of (OH-activated MWCNTs supported Pt were determined by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and their
   electrochemical performance was evaluated by the aid of cyclic
   voltammetry (CV) and rotating disk electrode (ROE) voltammetry.
   According to the experimental findings of the present work, the surrface
   of MWCNTs can be successfully functionalized with oxygen-containing
   groups after activation by KOH, favoring the good dispersion of Pt
   nanoparticles with narrow size distribution. The as-prepared Pt
   catalysts supported on KOH treated MWCNTs at higher temperature, possess
   higher electrochemical surface area and exhibit desirable activity
   towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). More precisely, it has been
   found that the electrochemical active area of Pt/MWCNTs-900 is
   approximately two times higher than that of Pt/MWCNTs. It can be
   concluded that KOH activation is an effective way to decorate MWCNTs'
   surface with oxygen-containing groups and bigger surface area, which
   makes them more suitable as electrocatalyst support materials. (C) 2010

Title = {{Impact of elevated nitrate on sulfate-reducing bacteria: a comparative

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1386-1397}},

Abstract = {{Sulfate-reducing bacteria have been extensively studied for their
   potential in heavy-metal bioremediation. However, the occurrence of
   elevated nitrate in contaminated environments has been shown to inhibit
   sulfate reduction activity. Although the inhibition has been suggested
   to result from the competition with nitrate-reducing bacteria, the
   possibility of direct inhibition of sulfate reducers by elevated nitrate
   needs to be explored. Using Desulfovibrio vulgaris as a model
   sulfate-reducing bacterium, functional genomics analysis reveals that
   osmotic stress contributed to growth inhibition by nitrate as shown by
   the upregulation of the glycine/betaine transporter genes and the relief
   of nitrate inhibition by osmoprotectants. The observation that
   significant growth inhibition was effected by 70mM NaNO3 but not by 70mM
   NaCl suggests the presence of inhibitory mechanisms in addition to
   osmotic stress. The differential expression of genes characteristic of
   nitrite stress responses, such as the hybrid cluster protein gene, under
   nitrate stress condition further indicates that nitrate stress response
   by D. vulgaris was linked to components of both osmotic and nitrite
   stress responses. The involvement of the oxidative stress response
   pathway, however, might be the result of a more general stress response.
   Given the low similarities between the response profiles to nitrate and
   other stresses, less-defined stress response pathways could also be
   important in nitrate stress, which might involve the shift in energy
   metabolism. The involvement of nitrite stress response upon exposure to
   nitrate may provide detoxification mechanisms for nitrite, which is
   inhibitory to sulfate-reducing bacteria, produced by microbial nitrate
   reduction as a metabolic intermediate and may enhance the survival of
   sulfate-reducing bacteria in environments with elevated nitrate level.

Abstract = {{A nano-structured film composed of TiO2 and reduced graphite oxide (GO)
   was synthesized on ITO glass via a typical electrochemical route. A
   mixed solvent of Ti(SO4)(2) and GO was prepared, with the addition of
   H2O2, HNO3 and DMF at different ratio. A setup of two electrodes of ITO
   glass in a plastic cell and an electrochemical analyzer is used for the
   film forming. The film is characterized with a microstructure of GO
   plates being perpendicular to the glass substrate, since GO in the
   electrolyte solvent is separated as small plates at about several
   nanometers in diameter. TiO2 is found being deposited between these GO
   plates. This microstructure is quite different from the film formed by
   normal deposition, where the GO plates are generally parallel to the
   substrate. The oxygen containing groups of C=O, C-O-C and C-OH on the GO
   surface are reduced because of neighboring to TiO2, it means two phases
   being bonded to each other at the interface. The photoelectric current
   of the composite film is compared with the pure TiO2 film, the former
   one is almost one time higher than the latter one. The degradation of
   methyl orange of two kinds of film is also analyzed under the
   irradiation of ultraviolet light. The photocatalytic activity of two
   kinds of film presents the same trend of variation as that of
   photoelectric current. These results suggest that the photoexcited
   electrons of TiO2 may quickly transfer to the glass substrate through
   the reduced GO neighbor, that owns a better conductivity, and so far
   decrease the recovery of excited electron-hole. The unordinary
   microstructure of the composite film may favor both to the electron
   transmission between the GO and ITO glass substrate, and to the light
   excitation of TiO2. The microstructure of different films was studies by
   AFM, XPS, FESEM. The photo-electrochemical property was measured by an
   electrochemical instrument Model CHI660C with Blupoint4 as a UV light
   source.}},

Abstract = {{Tobacco smoke exposure during development can result in lasting
   alterations in sensory processing and attention. This suggests that some
   constituent of smoke, such as the primary addictive component, nicotine,
   alters neurodevelopment. Although many effects of developmental nicotine
   exposure have been identified in humans and animal models, very few
   mechanistic studies have identified the molecular and anatomical basis
   for a defined behavioral consequence of developmental exposure. We show
   in this study that a mouse model of developmental nicotine exposure
   results in hypersensitive passive avoidance in adulthood. We have used
   transgenic mice in which beta 2 subunit containing nicotinic
   acetylcholine receptors (beta 2{*} nAChRs) are expressed exclusively on
   corticothalamic neurons (beta 2 tr(CT) mice) to identify the receptor
   subtypes involved and also to define the circuit level site of action
   responsible for this persistent, nicotine-induced behavioral phenotype.
   Further characterization of the native nAChRs expressed in this circuit
   indicates that both (alpha 4)(2)(beta 2)(3) and
   (alpha(4))(2)(beta(2))(2)alpha 5 nAChR subtypes are present in
   corticothalamic projections. Consistent with a role for (a4) 2(b2) 2a5
   nAChRs in mediating the effect of developmental nicotine exposure on
   adult passive avoidance behavior, constitutive deletion of the alpha 5
   nAChR subunit also alters this behavior. A critical period for this
   developmental consequence of nicotine exposure was defined by limiting
   exposure to the early post-natal period. Taken together, these studies
   identify a novel consequence of developmental nicotine exposure in the
   mouse, define the nAChR subtypes and neural circuit involved in this
   behavioral change and delimit the neurodevelopmental period critical for
   vulnerability to a behavioral alteration that persists into adulthood.

   conceptual knowledge exerted strong influences on all 3 types of basic
   fraction skills and basic fraction skills exerted a more modest

   reference to how the identification of potentially malleable student

Abstract = {{Objective: Unilateral monofocal temporal magnetoencephalography (MEG)
   findings might determine epileptogenicity of a lesion in symptomatic
   epilepsy during presurgical evaluation. To evaluate the additive effect
   of video-electroencephalography (vEEG), monofocal temporal lobe MEG
   findings were compared to electrophysiological findings from vEEGs of
   patients with lesional epilepsy.
   Methods: In 28 patients with drug-resistant lesional temporal lobe
   epilepsy (TLE), epileptogenicity of the lesion was determined by
   monofocal temporal MEG localisations. Findings for Lesions of different
   aetiologies (20 mesial, 6 lateral, and 2 extended mesiolateral lesions)
   were compared to electrophysiological findings from long-term vEEG
   monitoring and validated by histology and postsurgical outcome (mean
   follow-up: 2 years (range 0.5-5)).
   Results: The mean distance between a lesion and MEG localisation was 11
   mm (range 0-30 mm). The distance to the lesion was on average 5 mm
   (range 0-22 mm) in patients with neocortical foci and on average 13 mm
   (range 0-30 mm) in patients with mesial foci. Predominant interictal and
   ictal vEEG findings were consistent with MEG findings in all patients,
   although they were sometimes distributed over multiple lobes and
   bilaterally pronounced on the side of the MEG findings. Postsurgical
   outcome of Engel 1 could be achieved in 82\% (23 patients), and none of
   the patients had an outcome worse than Engel 2.
   Conclusion: MEG localisations in lesional TLE are able to determine
   epileptogenicity of mesial and lateral temporal lobe lesions. MEG
   results are consistent with predominant electrophysiological findings
   from long-term vEEG. Future studies should assess the substitutability
   of vEEG by MEG in selected cases. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Detection of foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria by RNA-DNA
   hybridization is an alternative to traditional microbiological
   procedures. To achieve high sensitivity with RNA-DNA-based methods,
   efficient bacterial lysis and release of nucleic acids from bacteria are

   microorganism Escherichia coli in meat by use of electrochemical
   biochips. We improved RNA isolation from bacteria in meat juice from
   pork and beef. Samples, either naturally or artificially contaminated by
   E. coli. were enriched by incubation in full or minimal medium. A
   combined treatment of the samples with lysozyme, proteinase K. and
   sonication resulted in efficient cell disruption and high total RNA
   yields. Together with optimization of enrichment time, this ensures high
   sensitivity of electrochemical measurements on biochips. A. short
   enrichment period and the triple-lysis regimen in combination with
   electrochemical biochip measurement were tested with 25 meat samples.
   The lower limit of detection of the biochip was approximately 2,000 CFU
   of E. coli per ml. The entire analysis procedure (5 h of enrichment,
   triple lysis, and biochip detection) has a lower limit of detection of 1
   CFU of E. coli per ml within a total time needed for analysis of 7 h.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated 94 GHz millimeter-wave (MMW) scattering from neutral and
   charged water mist produced in the laboratory with an ultrasonic
   atomizer Diffusion charging of the mist was accomplished with a negative
   ion generator (NIG) We observed increased forward- and backscattering of
   MMW from charged mist, as compared to MMW scattering from an uncharged
   mist In order to interpret the experimental results, we developed a
   model based on classical electrodynamics theory of scattering from a
   dielectric sphere with diffusion-deposited mobile surface charge. In
   this approach, scattering and extinction cross-sections are calculated
   for a charged Rayleigh particle with effective dielectric constant
   consisting of the volume dielectric function of the neutral sphere and
   surface dielectric function due to the oscillation of the surface charge
   in the presence of applied electric field. For small droplets with
   radius smaller than 100 nm, this model predicts increased MMW scattering
   from charged mist, which is qualitatively consistent with the
   experimental observations. The objective of this work is to develop
   indirect remote sensing of radioactive gases via their charging action
   on atmospheric humid air. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of soil organic matter are a key factor in controlling the
   terrestrial carbon cycle. Compound specific stable carbon isotope
   analysis has given new insight in to the stability of individual organic
   molecules in soil. For lignin, one of the major plant compounds,
   available data suggest the existence of both a labile (turnover time <1
   year) and a relatively stable (turnover time in the range of decades)
   pool. However, these data derive almost exclusively from agricultural
   soils in temperate climates. In order to extend the range both in
   ecosystem type and observed time span, we analysed a pasture soil in
   subtropical Australia that had experienced a land use change from
   rainforest 90 years earlier. We determined the concentration and
   isotopic signature of lignin biomarkers and compared them to those in an
   existing rainforest soil nearby and to samples of the respective
   vegetation. The land use change shifted both the relative abundance of
   lignin biomarkers and their isotopic signatures. In particular, the
   isotope data indicate that the pasture soil contains only small
   proportions of inherited rainforest-derived lignin biomarkers, which are
   mostly close to or below detection limit. These drastic changes in
   biomarker composition indicate that the original lignin structure had
   little chance to persist in this soil over a century. Thus, the stable
   soil organic carbon identified an earlier study of this soil is probably
   highly altered material and lignin biomarkers are not a suitable proxy
   of this stable carbon. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a space-time adaptive solver for single- and multi-phase
   compressible flows that couples average interpolating wavelets with
   high-order finite volume schemes. The solver introduces the concept of
   wavelet blocks, handles large jumps in resolution and employs local
   time-stepping for efficient time integration. We demonstrate that the
   inherently sequential wavelet-based adaptivity can be implemented
   efficiently in multicore computer architectures using task-based
   parallelism and introducing the concept of wavelet blocks. We validate
   our computational method on a number of benchmark problems and we
   present simulations of shock-bubble interaction at different Mach
   numbers, demonstrating the accuracy and computational performance of the
   method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Improvement of soil organic matter content and its effect on soil
   mechanical properties is a key goal for sustainable agriculture. This
   study examines the effects of seven-year incorporation of organic
   manures (municipal solid waste compost; air-dry sewage sludge; cattle
   farmyard manure) on shear strength parameters (cohesion, c; internal
   friction angle, phi) of a silty clay loam soil. Disturbed samples
   collected from the topsoil of experimental plots to which the organic
   manures had been added at three rates (25, 50 and 100 t ha(-1)) were
   remoulded at two gravimetric water contents (WC) of 17.1 and 20.9\%.
   Three intact samples were removed from the large soil specimen and the
   shear tests were conducted using direct shear box. To study the effect
   of WC on the shear strength of the soils with different bulk densities
   (BD) arising from the organic manure management, an index of consistency
   (IC) was introduced, defined as the ratio of WC of a soil to its plastic
   limit (PL). By increasing WC from 17.1 to 20.9\%, c was almost doubled,
   whereas phi significantly decreased, but only by 13\%. The changes in c
   due to changes in WC were explainable using effective stress theory. The
   relationships of c and phi with IC were linearly increasing and
   decreasing below the plastic limit, respectively, with some evidence of
   a plateau or non-linearity above this level. The results showed that for
   soils having different organic matter contents (or BD), the change in
   shear strength parameters with WC could be unified and explained using
   the IC concept. (C) 2010 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{STRATEGIES USED BY CRITICAL CARE NURSES TO IDENTIFY, INTERRUPT, AND

Abstract = {{Background Medical errors are common in intensive care units. Nurses are
   uniquely positioned to identify, interrupt, and correct medical errors
   and to minimize preventable adverse outcomes. Nurses are increasingly
   recognized as playing a role in reducing medical errors, but only
   recently have their error-recovery strategies been described.
   Objectives To describe error-recovery strategies used by critical care
   nurses.
   Methods Data were collected by audio taping focus groups with 20 nurses
   from 5 critical care units at 2 urban university medical centers and 2
   community hospitals on the East and West coasts of the United States.
   Transcript content was analyzed as recommended by Krueger and Casey.
   Results Analysis of focus group data revealed that nurses in critical
   care settings use 17 strategies to identify, interrupt, and correct
   errors. Nurses used 8 strategies to identify errors: knowing the
   patient, knowing the ``players,{''} knowing the plan of care,
   surveillance, knowing policy/procedure, double-checking, using
   systematic processes, and questioning. Nurses used 3 strategies to
   interrupt errors: offering assistance, clarifying, and verbally
   interrupting. Nurses used 6 strategies to correct errors: persevering,
   being physically present, reviewing or confirming the plan of care,
   offering options, referencing standards or experts, and involving
   another nurse or physician.
   Conclusions These results reflect the pivotal role that critical care
   nurses play in the recovery of medical errors and ensuring patient
   safety. Several error-recovery strategies identified in this study were
   also reported by emergency nurses, providing further empirical support
   for nurses' role in the recovery of medical errors as proposed in the
   Eindhoven model. (American Journal of Critical Care. 2010;19:500-509)}},

Abstract = {{Lens regeneration among vertebrates is basically restricted to some
   amphibians. The most notable cases are the ones that occur in
   premetamorphic frogs and in adult newts. Frogs and newts regenerate
   their lens in very different ways. In frogs the lens is regenerated by
   transdifferentiation of the cornea and is limited only to a time before
   metamorphosis. On the other hand, regeneration in newts is mediated by
   transdifferentiation of the pigment epithelial cells of the dorsal iris
   and is possible in adult animals as well. Thus, the study of both
   systems could provide important information about the process. Molecular
   tools have been developed in frogs and recently also in newts. Thus, the
   process has been studied at the molecular and cellular levels. A
   synthesis describing both systems was long due. In this review we
   describe the process in both Xenopus and the newt. The known molecular
   mechanisms are described and compared. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Due to increasing interest in indoor air quality (IAQ) monitoring for
   demand controlled ventilation (DCV) aiming at improved perceived air
   quality, health, energy and cost saving, the objective of this study has
   been the development of a sensor module based on a single
   microelectromechanical-system (MEMS) metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas
   sensor for IAQ monitoring as close as possible to the human sensory
   impression in indoor environments. Based on the results of a statistical
   evaluation on human induced volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the
   ambient air of indoor environments correlating with human presence and
   perceived air quality, the performance of differently doped SnO2 thick
   film gas sensor materials has been investigated in laboratory and by
   means of field tests in order to find the most promising sensor material
   for IAQ monitoring based on the detection of changes of human induced
   VOCs in indoor air. Implementation of an empirical evaluation algorithm
   reversing proportionality of anthropogenic CO2 production and other
   bio-effluent generation allows prediction of CO2 equivalent units.
   Analytical instrumentation and reference sensors served to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the developed sensor module in real-life. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{A method for analyzing and displaying electroglottographic (EGG) signals
   (and their first derivative, DEGG) is introduced: the
   electroglottographic wavegram ({''}wavegram{''} hereafter). To construct
   a wavegram, the time-varying fundamental frequency is measured and
   consecutive individual glottal cycles are identified. Each cycle is
   locally normalized in duration and amplitude, the signal values are
   encoded by color intensity and the cycles are concatenated to display
   the entire voice sample in a single image, similar as in sound
   spectrography. The wavegram provides an intuitive means for quickly
   assessing vocal fold contact phenomena and their variation over time.
   Variations in vocal fold contact appear here as a sequence of events
   rather than single phenomena, taking place over a certain period of
   time, and changing with pitch, loudness and register. Multiple DEGG
   peaks are revealed in wavegrams to behave systematically, indicating
   subtle changes of vocal fold oscillatory regime. As such, EGG wavegrams
   promise to reveal more information on vocal fold contacting and
   de-contacting events than previous methods. (C) 2010 Acoustical Society

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the feasibility of modifying 3-Fr IVUS
   catheters in several designs to potentially achieve minimally-invasive,
   endovascular access for image-guided ultrasound hyperthermia treatment
   of tumors in the brain. Using a plane wave approximation, target
   frequencies of 8.7 and 3.5 MHz were considered optimal for heating at
   depths (tumor sizes) of 1 and 2.5 cm, respectively. First, a 3.5-Fr IVUS
   catheter with a 0.7-mm diameter transducer (30 MHz nominal frequency)
   was driven at 8.6 MHz. Second, for a low-frequency design, a 220-mu
   m-thick, 0.35 x 0.35-mm PZT-4 transducer-driven at width-mode resonance
   of 3.85 MHz-replaced a 40-MHz element in a 3.5-Fr coronary imaging
   catheter. Third, a 5 x 0.5-mm PZT-4 transducer was evaluated as the
   largest aperture geometry possible for a flexible 3-Fr IVUS catheter.
   Beam plots and on-axis heating profiles were simulated for each
   aperture, and test transducers were fabricated. The electrical
   impedance, impulse response, frequency response, maximum intensity, and
   mechanical index were measured to assess performance. For the 5 x 0.5-mm
   transducer, this testing also included mechanically scanning and
   reconstructing an image of a 2.5-cm-diameter cyst phantom as a
   preliminary measure of imaging potential.}},

   remains unclear. In general radiotherapy is thought to be ineffective
   for the treatment of ACC, and therefore not often used. However, recent
   reports suggest the opposite. The aim of this study was to perform a
   retrospective analysis to evaluate the application of radiotherapy in
   Dutch ACC patients, and to determine the occurrence of response.
   Materials and methods: The Dutch ACC Registry (no.=159) was screened for
   patients who had received radiotherapy between 1990 and 2008. Tumor
   response evaluation was performed according to the Response Evaluation
   Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). Results: Only 13 patients (8\% of
   registered patients) had received radiation therapy of whom 6 were
   irradiated for the palliation of painful bone metastases. In all
   patients this radiation resulted in pain relief. Three patients received
   adjuvant tumor bed radiation after resection. Four patients were
   radiated on irresectable tumor recurrence or tumor metastases. Two
   patients died soon after radiation therapy and therefore follow-up
   information regarding tumor response after radiation therapy of 2
   patients was available. Interestingly, partial tumor response according
   to RECIST criteria, was observed in both patients. Conclusion: ACC can
   be sensitive to radiotherapy and should be considered in the treatment
   of advanced ACC, particularly in worrisome lesions. The role of
   radiotherapy in advanced ACC is to complement a systemic treatment such
   as mitotane or classic cytotoxic agents. (J. Endocrinol. Invest. 33:

Abstract = {{In this work, the use of the area-averaged void fraction and bubble
   chord length entropies is introduced as flow regime indicators in
   two-phase flow systems. The entropy provides quantitative information
   about the disorder in the area-averaged void fraction or bubble chord
   length distributions. The CPDF (cumulative probability distribution
   function) of void fractions and bubble chord lengths obtained by means
   of impedance meters and conductivity probes are used to calculate both
   entropies. Entropy values for 242 flow conditions in upward two-phase
   flows in 25.4 and 50.8-mm pipes have been calculated. The measured
   conditions cover ranges from 0.13 to 5 m/s in the superficial liquid
   velocity j (f) and ranges from 0.01 to 25 m/s in the superficial gas
   velocity j (g). The physical meaning of both entropies has been
   interpreted using the visual flow regime map information. The
   area-averaged void fraction and bubble chord length entropies capability
   as flow regime indicators have been checked with other statistical
   parameters and also with different input signals durations. The
   area-averaged void fraction and the bubble chord length entropies
   provide better or at least similar results than those obtained with
   other indicators that include more than one parameter. The entropy is
   capable to reduce the relevant information of the flow regimes in only
   one significant and useful parameter. In addition, the entropy
   computation time is shorter than the majority of the other indicators.
   The use of one parameter as input also represents faster predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies acknowledge that the well-being of our nation hinges on
   the health of its people. There is specific concern about children
   because they represent the future. Ignoring children's health needs can
   compromise their educational preparedness, occupational pursuits,
   productivity, and longevity. Current science demonstrates that
   developmental, emotional, or behavioral limitations experienced during
   the early years of life and over the life course are associated with
   poor adult health outcomes. Poverty, restricted access to health
   insurance and health care services, cultural and linguistic barriers,
   neighborhood conditions, and racial and class inequalities exacerbate
   poor health outcomes and contribute to child health inequality. To
   respond to the complexities and threats of child health inequality,
   social workers must be sensitized to the physical and material
   constraints that support them and join forces with other disciplines in
   comprehensive approaches to reduce and prevent them. This article
   focuses on current knowledge about child health inequality and
   recommends how social workers can effect change in this area through
   practice, policy, and research that adheres to the profession's ethical
   principles and standards and promotes the public health.}},

Abstract = {{Recent in vivo studies have established astrocytes as a major target for
   locus coeruleus activation (Bekar et al., 2008), renewing interest in
   cell culture studies on noradrenergic effects on astrocytes in primary
   cultures and calling for additional information about the expression of
   adrenoceptor subtypes on different types of brain cells. In the present
   communication, mRNA expression of alpha(1)-, alpha(2)- and
   beta-adrenergic receptors and their subtypes was determined in freshly
   isolated, cell marker-defined populations of astrocytes, NG2-positive
   cells, microglia, endothelial cells, and Thy1-positive neurons (mainly
   glutamatergic projection neurons) in murine cerebral cortex. immediately
   after dissection of frontal, parietal and occipital cortex of
   10-12-week-old transgenic mice, which combined each cell-type marker
   with a specific fluorescent signal, the tissue was digested, triturated
   and centrifuged, yielding a solution of dissociated cells of all types,
   which were separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). mRNA
   expression in each cell fraction was determined by microarray analysis.
   alpha(1A)-Receptors were unequivocally expressed in astrocytes and
   NG2-positive cells, but absent in other cell types, and
   alpha(1B)-receptors were not expressed in any cell population. Among
   alpha(2)-receptors only alpha(2A)-receptors were expressed,
   unequivocally in astrocytes and NG-positive cells, tentatively in
   microglia and questionably in Thy1-positive neurons and endothelial
   cells. beta(1)-Receptors were unequivocally expressed in astrocytes,
   tentatively in microglia, and questionably in neurons and endothelial
   cells, whereas beta(2)-adrenergic receptors showed tentative expression
   in neurons and astrocytes and unequivocal expression in other cell
   types. This distribution was supported by immunochemical data and its
   relevance established by previous studies in well-differentiated primary
   cultures of mouse astrocytes, showing that stimulation of
   alpha(2)-adrenoceptors increases glycogen formation and oxidative
   metabolism, the latter by a mechanism depending on intramitochondrial
   Ca2+, whereas alpha(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation enhances glutamate
   uptake, and beta-adrenoceptor activation causes glycogenolysis and
   increased Na+, K+-ATPase activity. The Ca2+- and cAmP-mediated
   association between energy-consuming and energy-yielding processes is
   emphasized. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The various findings observed on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic
   resonance (MR) imaging examinations in patients with seizures reflect
   the variety of different causes that give rise to this common neurologic
   symptom. In the emergency setting, CT is most valuable in its ability to
   accurately identify acute abnormalities that require emergent medical or
   surgical treatment. MR imaging, by contrast, is usually reserved for
   patients with recurrent or refractory seizures. The accurate
   interpretation of either modality requires familiarity with how seizures
   are classified clinically, the most common presenting features of
   different causes for seizures, the relevant neuroanatomy, and the
   imaging manifestations of both common and uncommon causes of seizures
   and epilepsy. Of particular practical importance to the radiologist is
   the ability to recognize (1) the most common findings in patients with
   recurrent seizures and (2) potentially reversible causes for seizures
   that require prompt intervention to avoid or minimize permanent brain
   injury. This article surveys a variety of different causes for seizures
   and epilepsy, focusing on specific clinical features that can help to
   refine differential diagnosis, and on imaging findings characteristic of

Abstract = {{Purpose: To preoperatively assess the composition of urinary stones by
   using dual-energy computed tomography (CT), with postoperative in vitro
   x-ray diffraction analysis as the reference standard.
   Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval was obtained,
   and all participants provided written informed consent. Twenty-seven
   patients aged 50-64 years with renal stones, who were scheduled for
   stone extraction with percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL),
   preoperatively underwent non-enhanced single-source dual-energy
   multidetector CT with 2-mm section thickness, 1-mm increments, 140 kVp,
   and 250 mAs. Regions of interest were drawn on low-and high-energy
   images, and low-and high-energy attenuation ratios were calculated for
   each stone scanned in vivo. The attenuation ratios for the patients were
   compared with those for an in vitro stone library phantom model of 37
   stones with known chemical compositions. After surgery, the extracted
   stones were analyzed by using x-ray diffraction. The results of in vivo
   multidetector CT and ex vivo chemical analysis were compared.
   Results: Dual-energy low-and high-energy attenuation ratios measured
   with the phantom were less than 1.1 for uric acid, 1.1-1.24 for cystine,
   and greater than 1.24 for calcified stones. Struvite stones had
   attenuation ratios that overlapped with calcified stone ratios and thus
   could not be assessed reliably. Four patients had mixed stones (< 75\%
   of a single component), and one patient had a struvite stone. Of 27
   patients, 22 (82\%) (exact confidence interval {[}CI]: 68\%, 92\%)
   received a correct diagnosis with dual-energy CT: all six (100\%; exact
   CI: 54\%, 100\%) patients with uric acid stones, 15 (79\%; exact CI:
   62\%, 95\%) of the 19 patients with calcium stones, and the one (100\%)
   patient with a cystine stone. The patient with a struvite stone did not
   receive a correct dual-energy CT-based diagnosis.
   Conclusion: Dual-energy multidetector CT may enable accurate in vivo
   characterization of kidney stone composition. (C) RSNA, 2010}},

   response rates were 45\% with caspofungin and 16\% with standard
   therapy. The unadjusted odds ratio for a favorable response
   (caspofungin/standard therapy) was 4.1 (95\% confidence interval: 2.2,
   7.5). After adjusting for potential imbalances in the frequency of
   disseminated infection, neutropenia, steroid use, and bone marrow
   transplantation between groups, the odds ratio remained at 4.1 (2.1,
   7.9). Although only tentative conclusions about relative efficacy can be
   drawn from retrospective comparisons, caspofungin appeared to be at
   least as efficacious as an amphotericin B formulation and/or
   itraconazole for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in patients
   refractory to or intolerant of their initial antifungal therapy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the chemical composition and energy content of
   several fuel options that could hypothetically be used with the existing
   fleet of aircraft. Fuel specific energy (energy per unit mass) is an
   important consideration in determining alternative-fuel viability,
   because aircraft must travel fixed distances before refueling. Since
   most aircraft fly with excess tank capacity, fuel energy density (energy
   per unit volume) is of secondary concern relative to specific energy. A
   first-order approach using the Breguet-range equation shows that the
   fleet-wide use of pure synthetic paraffinic kerosene fuels, such as
   those created from Fischer Tropsch synthesis or hydroprocessing of
   renewable oil sources, could reduce aircraft energy consumption by
   0.3\%. Conversely, fuels with reduced specific energy, such as fatty
   acid methyl esters (biodiesel and biokerosene) and alcohols, will result
   in increased fuel volume usage and also a decrease in fleet-wide energy
   efficiency. No penalty in energy efficiency would occur were these fuels
   used in ground transportation; thus, fatty acid methyl esters and
   alcohols are better suited to use in ground-based applications.}},

   completed gender attitude, intergroup bias, and personal preference
   measures at the beginning and end of a 2-week period during which

   play were also made at both times. After 2 weeks, children in the high-
   (but not low-) salience condition showed significantly increased gender
   stereotypes, less positive ratings of other-sex peers, and decreased
   play with other-sex peers. Children's own activity and occupational
   preferences, however, remained unaffected.}},

Abstract = {{Nanometals are manufactured to particle sizes with diameters in the
   nanometer range and are included in a variety of consumer and health
   products. There is a lack of information regarding potential effects of
   these materials on aquatic organisms. Amphibians are regarded as
   environmental sentinels and demonstrate an exquisite sensitivity to
   thyroid hormone action, a hormone that is essential for human health.
   This present study assessed the effect of exposure to nanometals on
   stress and thyroid hormone signaling in frog tissue using a cultured
   tail fin biopsy (C-fin) assay derived from Rana catesbeiana tadpoles.
   The C-fin assay maintains tissue complexity and biological replication
   while multiple chemical responses can be assessed from the same
   individual. We tested the ability of nanosilver (0.06 mu g/L-5.5 mg/L),
   quantum dots (0.25 mu g/L-22 mg/L), and nanozinc oxide (0.19-10 mg/L) to
   alter gene expression in the presence or absence of
   3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (T-3) using quantitative real-time polymerase
   chain reaction. Results were compared to exposure to micrometer-silver,
   silver nitrate, and micrometer-cadmium telluride. Nanosilver (>= 2.75
   mg/L) and quantum dots (>= 0.22 mg/L) altered the expression of
   transcripts linked to T-3- and stress-mediated pathways, while nanozinc
   oxide had no effect Lower concentrations of nanosilver (0.6 to 550 mu
   g/L) perturbed T-3-mediated signaling while not inducing cell stress.
   The observed effects were orders of magnitude below acute toxicity
   levels and occurred at or below the current North American water quality
   guidelines for metals, underscoring the need for evaluating
   nanoparticles separately from their constituent chemicals.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a multiscale comparison method for three-dimensional
   trajectories. In order to deal with the problem that zero-crossings of
   curvature cannot be determined for space curve, we utilize the maxima of
   curvature. The method first traces the positions of curvature maxima
   across scales for recognizing the hierarchy of partial trajectories.
   Then it performs cross-scale matching of partial trajectories derived
   from two input trajectories, and obtains the structurally best matches.
   Finally, it calculates the value-based dissimilarity for each pair of
   the matched partial trajectories and output as the final dissimilarity
   between trajectories that can be further used for clustering or
   classification tasks. In experiments on the UCI character trajectory
   dataset we demonstrate that reasonable correspondences were captured
   successfully and the derived dissimilarity yielded good clustering
   results comparable to DTW. We also demonstrate using real medical data
   that the method could generate interesting clusters that might reflect
   distribution of fibrotic stages.}},

Abstract = {{A case of a large primary cardiac sarcoma on the left ventricular free
   wall is reported. Although the definitive diagnosis of this tumor was
   not made preoperatively, total excision was planned for rapid diagnosis
   and optimal procedure. However, the operation was discontinued due to
   intraoperative diagnosis of malignancy. As a result, the patient
   suffered from the symptoms of cardiac tamponade caused by the large
   tumor. We discuss the surgical strategy to provide therapeutic benefit
   for possible patients in the future. In conclusion, an aggressive
   attempt at volume reduction such as cardiac autotransplantation may
   relieve the symptoms, even though such surgery would only be palliative.

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Two cryptic memoranda in the Stationers' Register concern a play by
   Jonson and three by Shakespeare. The memoranda have long puzzled
   scholars, who have offered many and varied interpretations. Those
   scholars haven't examined the memoranda in their original handwriting,
   and in light of other Stationers' Company records and practices. Thus
   illuminated, the memoranda are notes of two hearings before the
   Company's Court of Assistants. In both cases the Lord Chamberlain's
   Company challenged the right of stationer James Roberts to enter their
   plays into the Register. At the first hearing the Court decided for
   Roberts, at the second, for the actors. The dispute's origins and the
   reasons for the Court's varying dispositions may be deduced from the
   circumstances. Roberts routinely dealt with the acting company's
   couriers. Twice, the circumstances suggest, a courier sold Roberts play
   manuscripts purportedly on behalf of the company. The actors wanted
   their manuscripts back before Roberts could publish them. The likeliest
   path to that result lay through the Court of Assistants. The Court held,
   applying standard legal principles, that the actors were bound by the
   first sale. The second time, however, Roberts knew from the first
   hearing that the acting company did not authorise any courier to sell
   play manuscripts. In anticipation of the second result Roberts probably
   had two of the plays copied. To prevent him from publishing his copies
   the acting company assisted other stationers in registering the two
   plays. When Roberts registered Hamlet two years later, he used not a
   manuscript belonging to the Lord Chamberlain's Company, but rather the
   manuscript behind of the First Quarto version of the play.}},

   analysis, the 26-cm stent was independently associated with the severity
   of frequency, urgency, and nocturia symptoms Crossing the midline of the
   distal end was significantly associated with urge incontinence The 24-cm
   and 26-cm stents were both very strongly associated with the severity of
   hematuria Crossing the midline of the distal end was significantly
   associated with bladder pain
   Conclusion The length of stent and crossing the midline of the distal
   end were significantly associated with stem-related symptoms after
   URSI., Selection of the proper length of double-J stent is the most
   Important factor in minimizing stent-related symptoms}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to achieve higher CO2 consumption ability and lipid
   productivity of an indigenous microalgal isolate Scenedesmus obliquus
   CNW-N by a two-stage cultivation strategy. The microalga strain was
   first cultivated with 10\% CO2 using a nutrient-rich medium to promote
   cell growth, which was followed by a nutrient-deficient condition to
   trigger lipid accumulation. The optimal biomass productivity, lipid
   productivity, and CO2 consumption rate were 292.50 mg L-1 d(-1), 78.73
   mg L-1 d(-1) (38.9\% lipid content per dry weight of biomass), and
   549.90 mg L-1 d(-1), respectively. This performance is superior to the
   results from most of the related studies. Under the nutrient-deficient
   condition, the microalgal lipid was mainly composed of C16/C18 fatty
   acids (accounting for 89\% of total fatty acids), which is suitable for
   biodiesel synthesis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of two flocculants on turbidity reduction was studied.
   The two flocculants were: a biopolymeric flocculant which was extracted
   from fruit waste and a commercial industrial flocculant. The effect of
   the flocculants' average molecular weight on turbidity treatment, the
   treatment efficiency of both flocculants and the flocculants'
   degradability were investigated. Response surface methodology was
   carried out using Box Behnken design to find the optimal pH, cation
   concentration, and flocculant dosage to maximize the turbidity
   reduction. The results showed that the maximum turbidity reduction by
   industrial flocculant occurs between pH 7.5 and pH 8.2, cation
   concentration between 0.02 and 0.06 mM, and industrial flocculant dosage
   between 6.5 and 8.0 mg/L. While with biopolymeric flocculant, maximum
   turbidity reduction occurred between pH 4.6 and pH 7.5, cation

Abstract = {{The special corrosion conditions in the rear section of automotive
   exhaust systems cause high demands on stainless steels used for these
   components: ferritic steels with different contents of chromium and
   molybdenum as well as austenitic steel types. For selecting an
   appropriate material enabling cost-effective design, the corrosion
   resistance of different materials has to be rated. The corrosion
   resistance of different stainless steel grades for automotive exhaust
   systems has been assayed in a laboratory test on the basis of the
   standard VDA 230-214-test. Concurrent to the laboratory tests the
   influence of the active carbon, simulating the soot particles, has been
   investigated in electrochemically measurements. A new preparation method
   of the samples has been developed, which eliminates the edge effects and
   also enables the placement of active carbon on the metallic surface of
   the samples. The results of the tests show that active carbon has a
   significant influence on the corrosion attack. This circumstance should
   be considered in the future test methods for stainless steels used in
   automotive exhaust systems.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare the AcrySof Toric intraocular lens (IOL) and an
   AcrySof spherical control IOL and to investigate rotational stability of
   the AcrySof Toric IOL (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX) in
   subjects with cataracts and preexisting corneal astigmatism.
   Design: Randomized, subject-masked, parallel-group, multicenter, 1-year
   study.
   Participants: We included 517 subjects (Toric IOL, n = 256; control IOL,
   n = 261).
   Methods: Unilateral implantation of an AcrySof Toric or AcrySof
   spherical control IOL (spherical powers, 12.00-25.00 diopters {[}D];
   cylinder powers 1.50, 2.25, or 3.00 D for corneal astigmatism correction
   of 0.75 to < 1.50, >= 1.50 to < 2.00, and >= 2.00 D with no upper limit,
   respectively). No limbal relaxing incisions were permitted.
   Main Outcome Measures: Visual acuity outcomes, IOL position,
   patient-reported spectacle use, and safety.
   Results: One year postoperatively, best spectacle-corrected distance
   visual acuity of >= 20/20 was 77.7\% (Toric IOL) versus 69.2\% (control
   IOL). Uncorrected distance visual acuity of 20/20 or better was 40.7\%
   (Toric IOL) versus 19.4\% (control IOL; P < 0.05). Mean absolute
   residual refractive cylinder was 0.59 D (Toric IOL) versus 1.22 D
   (control IOL; P < 0.0001). Mean rotation was <4 degrees (range, 0
   degrees-20 degrees) for the Toric IOL. Six-month spectacle freedom was
   61.0\% (Toric IOL) and 36.4\% (control IOL; P < 0.0001). Complications
   in both groups were few and were as would be expected with cataract
   surgery.
   Conclusions: Favorable efficacy, rotational stability, distance vision
   spectacle freedom, and safety results support the use of the AcrySof
   Toric IOL for patients with cataracts and corneal astigmatism.

Journal = {{RESTORATION ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{426-437}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{There is mounting concern over the source and genetic history of plant
   propagules used for habitat restoration because introduced genotypes may
   destabilize remnant local populations through competition and
   introgression. We examined whether introduced dune grass, Ammophila
   breviligulata, from Michigan is genetically distinct from a threatened
   local Minnesota population by comparing local and nonlocal genotypes in
   well-established stands in the field and in experimental common gardens.
   Both observational and experimental studies suggest that Michigan plants
   differed genetically and had an advantage over local plants in terms of
   vegetative spread and sexual reproduction. Well-established restoration
   populations composed of Michigan plants produced fertile culms that were
   1.8 times taller than Minnesota plants and more than twice as fecund.
   Introgression is unlikely, however, because Minnesota genotypes flowered
   on average 6.7 weeks earlier than Michigan plants and only 20\% of
   Minnesota pollen remained viable after 4 weeks. In the common gardens,
   Michigan plants from two sources were larger in size, grew faster, and
   flowered more frequently than Minnesota plants. Plant surveys across the
   study area suggest that nonlocal genotypes have spread beyond documented
   restoration areas and into local stands, particularly in foredunes. Even
   if gene flow between local and nonlocal plants is limited due to
   differences in flowering phenology, Michigan genotypes may out-compete
   plants in the threatened Minnesota population through greater vegetative
   and sexual reproduction. The fitness consequences of this change in the
   genetic composition of the local population have yet to be determined.}},

Journal = {{PHYTOPARASITICA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{Ips duplicatus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was reported in the
   Euro-Siberian taiga from Sweden to Sakhalin and in the Alps at the
   beginning of the 20th Century. It has been recorded in spruce stands in
   the north-eastern part of the Czech Republic since the beginning of the
   1970s; monitoring of I. duplicatus was conducted in the Czech Republic
   in 9 years between 1997 and 2009. Beetles of the overwintering
   generation were captured in Theysohn pheromone traps baited with a lure
   of ipsdienol and E-myrcenol, and after 2005 in ID Ecolure lures.
   Surprisingly, I. duplicatus was found throughout the Czech Republic
   already in 1997. In 2002, there was a nationwide decrease in their
   numbers. Particularly since 2005, there has been a spread from the main
   center of occurrence in the eastern areas to the south and west into the
   central part of Bohemia where, until that time, its population densities
   had been lower and had not caused economically significant damage.
   Moreover, it was observed that in the north-eastern parts of the Czech
   Republic up to 80\% of spruce trees from sanitary felling had been
   infested by this pest in recent years. The recorded amount of spruce
   trees infested by I. duplicatus is correlated significantly with the
   amount of spruce trees recorded as damaged by Ips typographus, Ips
   amitinus and Pityogenes chalcographus infestation as well as with the
   numbers of individuals of I. duplicatus captured during the

Abstract = {{Universal surveillance upon patient admission is important in reducing
   the transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
   and associated disease in hospitals. High costs for the health care
   system in conjunction with MRSA have promoted the development of rapid
   screening methods to detect MRSA carriers. This study compared two
   real-time PCR methods, the BD GeneOhm MRSA assay (BDGO) and the Xpert
   MRSA assay, with broth-enriched culture to define their performance
   characteristics and rapidity in an area with low MRSA prevalence. In
   total, 414 swabs from the nose and 389 swabs from the groin from 425
   patients were tested. Of those 425 patients, 378 had swabs from both the
   nose and groin in parallel. Two hundred thirty-one and 194 patients were
   randomly assigned to the BDGO group and the Xpert MRSA group,
   respectively. In general, sensitivity, specificity, and negative
   predictive value (NPV) were high for the BDGO (100\%, 98.5\%, and 100\%,
   respectively) and the Xpert MRSA (100\%, 98.2\%, and 100\%,
   respectively), irrespective of whether or not nasal and inguinal
   specimens were considered alone or combined. In contrast, the positive
   predictive value (PPV) was lower: before the resolution of discrepant
   results, the PPVs for nasal and inguinal specimens alone and combined
   were 87.5\%, 86.7\%, and 82.4\% for the BDGO and 91.7\%, 66.7\%, and
   92.9\% for the Xpert MRSA, respectively. After the resolution of
   discrepant results, PPVs were 93.8\%, 93.3\% and 94.1\% for the BDGO and
   91.7\%, 88.9\% and 92.9\% for the Xpert MRSA, respectively. With the
   BDGO, 4 of 16 carriers were each identified by nasal or inguinal swabs
   alone, whereas in the Xpert MRSA group, 4 of 13 carriers were
   exclusively identified by nasal swabs and 2 of 13 were identified by
   inguinal swabs alone. Both PCR methods showed no significant difference
   in the number of discrepant results (odds ratio, 0.70 {[}P = 0.789]),
   but specimens from wounds and other body sites (axilla, vagina, and
   throat) produced discrepancies more often than nasal and groin specimens
   (odds ratios, 4.724 {[}P = 0.058] and 12.163 {[}P < 0.001],
   respectively). The facts that no false-negative PCR results were
   detected and increased PPVs were found after the resolution of
   discrepant results point to PCR as the actual gold standard. Since both
   sensitivity and NPV were exceptionally high for PCR, backup cultures
   may, therefore, be unnecessary in an area with low prevalence and with a
   preemptive isolation strategy but may still be useful for PCR-positive
   specimens because of the lower PPV for both methods and the possibility
   of susceptibility testing. The median time for analysis, including
   extraction, hands-on time, and actual PCR was 2 h 20 min for the Xpert
   MRSA versus 5 h 40 min for the BDGO. Concerning reporting time,
   including administration and specimen collection, the Xpert MRSA was
   faster than the BDGO (7 h 50 min versus 17 h).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel digital signal processing (DSP) unit
   including a new baseline wander (BLW) corrector to support fast Ethernet
   in twisted pair (TP) cable channels. The proposed DSP unit consists of a
   programmable gain amplifier ( PGA), timing recovery loop, adaptive
   equalizer and the new BLW corrector. Unlike the existing BLW correctors,
   the proposed BLW corrector calculates the BLW error by subtracting the
   equalizer input from the slicer output. Moreover, the new BLW corrector
   implemented in the digital domain uses four symbols to remove the BLW
   instead of the two symbols used in previous works. In addition, the
   proposed adaptive equalizer uses 2(-7) as the optimum step size, i.e.,
   mu. Since mu is a multiple of 2, the equalizer eliminates the need for
   multipliers and, thus, has a small area and consumes less power. To
   verify the performance of the proposed DSP unit, floating-point and
   fixed-point simulations using the SPW (TM) tool were performed. The
   measured BER is less than 10(-10) when the cable length is 150 m. The
   proposed DSP unit was modeled by Verilog-HDL and synthesized using the
   0.18 mu m SEC cell library. The implemented DSP unit having 128,528
   gates can operate at 142.7 MHz.}},

Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{21}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Engineered nanoparticles are increasingly incorporated into consumer
   products and are emerging as potential environmental contaminants. Upon
   environmental release, nanoparticles could inhibit bacterial processes,
   as evidenced by laboratory studies. Less is known regarding bacterial
   alteration of nanoparticles, including whether bacteria affect physical
   agglomeration states controlling nanoparticle settling and
   bioavailability. Here, the effects of an environmental strain of
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa on TiO2 nanoparticle agglomerates formed in
   aqueous media are described. Environmental scanning electron microscopy
   and cryogenic scanning electron microscopy visually demonstrated
   bacterial dispersion of large agglomerates formed in cell culture medium
   and in marsh water. For experiments in cell culture medium, quantitative
   image analysis verified that the degrees of conversion of large
   agglomerates into small nanoparticle-cell combinations were similar for
   12-h-growth and short-term cell contact experiments. Dispersion in cell
   growth medium was further characterized by size fractionation: for
   agglomerated TiO2 suspensions in the absence of cells, 81\% by mass was
   retained on a 5-mu m-pore-size filter, compared to only 24\% retained
   for biotic treatments. Filtrate cell and agglomerate sizes were
   characterized by dynamic light scattering, revealing that the average
   bacterial cell size increased from 1.4 mu m to 1.9 mu m because of
   nano-TiO2 biosorption. High-magnification scanning electron micrographs
   showed that P. aeruginosa dispersed TiO2 agglomerates by preferential
   biosorption of nanoparticles onto cell surfaces. These results suggest a
   novel role for bacteria in the environmental transport of engineered
   nanoparticles, i.e., growth-independent, bacterially mediated size and
   mass alterations of TiO2 nanoparticle agglomerates.}},

Abstract = {{This paper draws on ethnographic fieldwork with Gambian women who have
   experienced infertility and/or child mortality and who have consequently
   become kanyalengs. Kanyaleng kafoos are groups of women united by their
   reproductive difficulties whose bold public performances are designed to
   ``beg God{''} for fertility and for children who will survive. I situate
   `kanyalengs' disrupted childbearing within a framework of stratified
   reproduction, which reveals the tensions between ongoing demands to meet
   norms of high fertility, women's heavy burden of reproductive disease
   and the limits of a reproductive public health agenda narrowly focused
   on family planning and HIV prevention. To ameliorate these tensions, I
   call for an expansion of the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) agenda
   in Gambia to include RTI/STI prevention, diagnosis and management. This
   expansion reflects the goals set out by the Cairo International
   Conference on Population and Development for a broader approach to
   reproductive health, the productive potential of linkages between SRH
   and HIV prevention efforts, as well as the reproductive objectives of
   Gambian women and men. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The surface of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was treated by plasma
   with an end-Hall ion source in vacuum in order to enhance its
   anti-reflectivity. The cone-shaped bumps induced by the plasma etching
   have shown an antireflective effect. Moreover, PMMA has poor thermal
   durability due to its low melting point; therefore, the etched PMMA was
   further coated by a 5 nm thick SiO(2) film after 900 and 1300 s plasma
   etching. Samples after SiO(2) coating were thermally annealed at
   temperature of 70A degrees C for 1 h. Experiments show that
   transmittance was increased after 5 nm thick SiO(2) coating. The of
   transmittance of PMMA after both sides treated by 900 s plasma etching
   and 5 nm SiO(2) coating was not changed after thermal annealing.
   However, without SiO(2) coating the transmission was reduced 1\% after
   annealing. Atomic force microscope (AFM) demonstrated that the
   nano-structures of cone-shaped bumps were formed on the PMMA after
   plasma etching and a smoother nano-structured pattern preserved the
   transmittance of the PMMA after both sides treated by 900 s plasma
   etching and 5 nm SiO(2) coating. Three dimensional photonic crystal
   formed by uniformly distributed cone-shaped bumps was assumed to result
   in the reduction of the anti-reflectivity of treated PMMA.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term treatment of patients with the macrolide antibiotic and

   inhibits the inflammatory response in liver. We show here that
   activation of the inflammatory response in hepatocytes strongly
   modulates SUMOylation of ligand-bound PXR. We provide evidence that the
   SUMOylated PXR contains SUMO3 chains, and feedback represses the immune
   response in hepatocytes. This information represents the first step in
   developing novel pharmaceutical strategies to treat inflammatory liver
   disease and prevent adverse drug reactions in patients experiencing
   acute or systemic inflammation. These studies also provide a molecular
   rationale for constructing a novel paradigm that uniquely defines the
   molecular basis of the interface between PXR-mediated gene activation,

Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{8991-8997}},

Abstract = {{Detection of specific DNA sequences is important to molecular biology
   research and clinical diagnostics. To improve the sensitivity of
   surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy (SERS), a variety of
   signal amplification methods has been developed, including
   Raman-active-dye, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, molecular
   beacon, SERS-active substrates, and SERS-tag. However, the combination
   of rolling circle amplification (RCA) with SERS for nucleic acid
   detection has not been reported. Herein, we describe a new approach for
   nucleic acid detection by the combination of RCA reaction with SERS.
   Because of the binding of abundance repeated sequences of RCA products
   with gold nanoparticle (Au NP) and Rox-modified detection probes, SERS
   signal is significantly amplified and the detection limit of 10.0 pM
   might be achieved. The sensitivity of RCA-based SERS has increased by as
   much as 3 orders of magnitude as compared to PCR-based SERS and is also
   comparable with or even exceeds that of both RCA-based electrochemical
   and RCA-based fluorescent methods. This RCA-based SERS might
   discriminate perfect matched target DNA from 1-base mismatched DNA with
   high selectivity. The high sensitivity and selectivity of RCA-based SERS
   makes it a potential tool for early diagnosis of gene-related disease
   and also offers a great promise for multiplexed assays with DNA
   microarrays.}},

Abstract = {{In order to gain a sufficient wear resistance for applications, the
   biomimetic non-smooth units in concave were fabricated on the surfaces
   of 20CrMnTi steel using a biomimetic laser remelting technology. The
   diameter and distribution of the concaves were optimized using
   orthogonal experiment. The microstructures of the biomimetic non-smooth
   units were examined. The anti-wear behaviors were investigated by the
   rolling wear test with lubricant. The results of wear tests indicated
   that the biomimetic surfaces exhibit a higher anti-wear ability than the
   smooth surfaces. The biomimetic surface with concaves of 250 mu m in
   diameter and transverse distance of 270 mu m and longitudinal distance
   of 400 mu m exhibits the best anti-wear property. The enhancement of
   wear resistance can be mainly attributed to the action of biomimetic
   non-smooth units and the super fined microstructure and hardness in the
   biomimetic unit zones.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation of reliability for intra-level voltage-breakdown in the
   45 nm generation node has become an increasingly important issue with
   the introduction of porous low-k dielectrics. The dominant failure
   mechanism for lower voltage ramping-up to dielectric breakdown and
   higher leakage current was that more electrons easily transported
   through the percolation path in intra-level porous low-k
   interconnections damaged from HF corrosion. An optimal ultraviolet
   curing process and a less NH3 plasma pretreatment on porous low-k
   dielectrics before the SiCN capping layer are developed to improve
   performance in both of these cases. The stiff configuration of the
   reconstruction of Si-O network structures and less HF corrosion is
   expected to have high tolerance to electrical failure. As a result, the
   proposed model of this failure facilitates the understanding of the
   reliability issue for Cu/porous low-k interconnections in back-end of
   line (BEOL) beyond 45 nm nodes. (C) 2009 Elsevier BM. All rights

   syndrome (OHSS) is complete avoidance of gonadotropin ovarian
   stimulation. It could be argued that in vitro maturation (IVM) of
   oocytes represents the most effective strategy to prevent OHSS. IVM has
   been an established treatment option in many centers worldwide for over
   a decade. The use of IVM and natural cycle in vitro fertilization (IVF)
   combined with IVM can result in clinical pregnancy rates that compare to
   those obtained with conventional IVF. The obstetric and perinatal
   outcomes of IVM pregnancies are similar to those conceived from
   stimulated IVF or spontaneous conceptions. To date, more than a thousand
   healthy infants have been born without an increase in fetal
   abnormalities. Although IVM may not replace standard IVF, it plays an
   increasingly important role in assisted reproductive technology,
   especially in the settings of high responders and those patients at risk
   of OHSS.}},

Abstract = {{We related the refractive index change in ion-implanted LiNbO3 crystals
   to the lattice damage ratio using a quadratic polynomial relationship.
   We used this relationship to calculate the refractive index profiles of
   z-cut LiNbO3 crystals implanted with oxygen ions using different
   energies, fluences, and annealing treatments. A highly damaged surface
   layer with a decreased refractive index was caused by electronic
   excitations in LiNbO3 crystals implanted with 4.0 MeV oxygen ions at a
   fluence of 2x10(15) ions/cm(2), which buried the optical modes inside
   the crystals. This relationship was also used for the estimation of the
   lattice damage in ion-implanted LiNbO3 crystals. It could make a quick
   estimate which was basically agree with the measured damage level. (C)

Title = {{Actin-Free Gc-Globulin after Minimal Access and Conventional Anterior
   Lumbar Surgery}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Background. Minimally invasive total knee or hip replacement has been
   increasingly adopted in recent years. However, literature indicates that
   minimally invasive joint arthroplasty may not always reduce pain or
   tissue trauma. We hypothesized that the tissue damage would be reduced
   in minimal access surgery (MAS) than the conventional open surgery (OS)
   for anterior lumbar disorders through quantifying measurement of serum
   actin-free Gc-globulin (M-Gc), myoglobin (MG), and total creatine kinase
   (CK).
   Materials and Methods. This prospective study enrolled 23 patients,
   including 10 who underwent MAS and thirteen who underwent conventional
   OS. Blood samples for Al-Gc, MG, and CK were taken simultaneously before
   surgery and then at intervals of 12, 24, 48, 72, 120, and 168 h
   thereafter.
   Results. All serum level changes in Af-Gc, MG, and CK were significantly
   lower in the MAS than in the OS group. A significant negative
   correlation was noted between changes in Af-Gc and MG levels (P =
   0.012), and a significant positive correlation was noted between changes
   in CK and MG levels (P < 0.001). However, at 12 h postop, CK level was
   transiently higher in MAS group than the OS group.
   Conclusions. The changes of Af-Gc, MG, and CK levels indicate that MAS
   is less tissue invasive than OS. Further, Al-Gc proved to be a more
   sensitive marker than MG or CK in response to surgical trauma. The
   transiently higher CK level at 12 h postop in MAS patients may indicate
   that a more soft tissue manipulation is required in MAS than the OS
   patients for the initial surgical approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Unexpectedly High Copy Number of Random Integration but Low Frequency of
   Persistent Expression of the Sleeping Beauty Transposase After Trans
   Delivery in Primary Human T Cells}},
Journal = {{HUMAN GENE THERAPY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We have shown that the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system can
   mediate stable expression of both reporter and therapeutic genes in
   human primary T cells and that trans delivery (i.e., transposon and
   transposase are on separate plasmids) is at least 3-fold more efficient
   than cis delivery. One concern about trans delivery is the potential for
   integration of the transposase-encoding sequence into the cell genome
   with the possibility of continued expression, transposon remobilization,
   and insertional mutagenesis. To address this concern, human peripheral
   blood lymphocytes were nucleofected with transposase plasmid and a DsRed
   transposon. Eighty-eight stable DsRed(+) T cell clones were generated
   and found to be negative for the transposase-encoding sequence by PCR
   analysis of genomic DNA. Genomic PCR was positive for transposase in 5
   of 15 bulk T cell populations that were similarly transfected and
   selected for transgene expression where copy numbers were unexpectedly
   high (0.007-0.047 per cell) by quantitative PCR. Transposase-positive
   bulk T cells lacked transposase plasmid demonstrated by Hirt (episomal)
   extracted DNA and showed no detectable transposase by Southern
   hybridization, Western blot, and quantitative RT-PCR analyses.
   Cytogenetic and array comparative genomic hybridization analyses of the
   only identified transposase-positive clone (O56; 0.867 copies per cell)
   showed no chromosomal abnormality or tumor formation in nude mice
   although transposon remobilization was detected. Our data suggest that
   SB delivery via plasmid in T cells should be carried out with caution
   because of unexpectedly high copy numbers of randomly integrated SB
   transposase.}},

Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3205-3212}},

Abstract = {{Ambrosia beetles, dominant wood degraders in the tropics, create tunnels
   in dead trees and employ gardens of symbiotic fungi to extract nutrients
   from wood. Specificity of the beetle-fungus relationship has rarely been
   examined, and simple vertical transmission of a specific fungal cultivar
   by each beetle species is often assumed in literature. We report
   repeated evolution of fungal crop stealing, termed mycocleptism, among
   ambrosia beetles. The mycocleptic species seek brood galleries of other
   species, and exploit their established fungal gardens by tunneling
   through the ambient mycelium-laden wood. Instead of carrying their own
   fungal sybmbionts, mycocleptae depend on adopting the fungal assemblages
   of their host species, as shown by an analysis of fungal DNA from beetle
   galleries. The evidence for widespread horizontal exchange of fungi
   between beetles challenges the traditional concept of ambrosia fungi as
   species-specific symbionts. Fungus stealing appears to be an
   evolutionarily successful strategy. It evolved independently in several
   beetle clades, two of which have radiated, and at least one case was
   accompanied by a loss of the beetles' fungus-transporting organs. We
   demonstrate this using the first robust phylogeny of one of the world's
   largest group of ambrosia beetles, Xyleborini.}},

Abstract = {{Scrupulosity, the obsessional fear of thinking or behaving immorally or
   against one's religious beliefs, is a form of obsessive-compulsive
   disorder that has been relatively understudied to date. Treating
   religious patients with scrupulosity raises a number of unique clinical
   challenges for many clinicians. For example, how does one distinguish
   normal beliefs from pathological scrupulosity? How does one adapt
   exposures to a religious patient whose fears are related to sinning? How
   far should one go in exposures in such cases? How and when does one
   include clergy in treatment? We address these issues and report a case
   example of the successful treatment of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish woman
   using the treatment principles that we recommend for religious
   individuals with scrupulosity.}},

Abstract = {{Four short core samples were collected from the creek, estuarine regions
   of southeast (SE) coast of India affected by the 2004 Asian Tsunami. The
   study is aimed to signify the importance of ostracoda species in
   identifying major natural events (e.g. Tsunamis) in the coastal regions.
   The presence of many marine ostracoda species in the beach areas and the
   comparative studies with earlier reports from SE coast indicate that
   these species were brought by the high-energy tsunami waves. The
   depositional feature of ostracoda species in the beach and estuarine
   region also infers on the nature and force of tsunami waves in a
   particular region. The results clearly support that microfossils can be
   used to identify the major natural events close to coastal regions.}},

Title = {{Evolution of dust temperature of galaxies through cosmic time as seen by

Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{We study the dust properties of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1 less
   than or similar to z less than or similar to 2.8 observed by the
   Herschel Space Observatory in the field of the Great Observatories
   Origins Deep Survey-North as part of the PACS Extragalactic Probe (PEP)
   and Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) key programmes.
   Infrared (IR) luminosity (L-IR) and dust temperature (T-dust) of
   galaxies are derived from the spectral energy distribution fit of the
   far-IR (FIR) flux densities obtained with the PACS and SPIRE instruments
   onboard Herschel. As a reference sample, we also obtain IR luminosities
   and dust temperatures of local galaxies at z < 0.1 using AKARI and IRAS
   data in the field of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We compare the
   L-IR-T-dust relation between the two samples and find that the median
   T-dust of Herschel-selected galaxies at z greater than or similar to 0.5
   with L-IR greater than or similar to 5 x 10(10) L-circle dot appears to
   be 2-5 K colder than that of AKARI-selected local galaxies with similar
   luminosities, and the dispersion in T-dust for high-z galaxies increases
   with L-IR due to the existence of cold galaxies that are not seen among
   local galaxies. We show that this large dispersion of the L-IR-T-dust
   relation can bridge the gap between local star-forming galaxies and
   high-z submillimetre galaxies (SMGs). We also find that three SMGs with
   very low T-dust (less than or similar to 20 K) covered in this study
   have close neighbouring sources with similar 24-mu m brightness, which
   could lead to an overestimation of FIR/(sub) millimetre fluxes of the
   SMGs.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic contrast imaging techniques are considered the standard of care
   for the radiological diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in
   cirrhosis. However, the accuracy of radiological diagnosis depends
   largely on the degree of arterial hypervascularization, which increases
   with tumor size. Owing to the interplay and prognostic relevance of
   tumor vascularization and cell differentation, we asked ourselves
   whether tumor grade also affects the outcome of radiological diagnosis.
   Sixty-two HCCs (47 of which measured 1-2 cm) were consecutively detected
   in 59 patients with compensated cirrhosis under surveillance with
   ultrasound and confirmed by way of echo-guided biopsy and concurrent
   investigations with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CE-US), computed
   tomography (CT), and gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Tumor
   cell differentiation was evaluated using Edmondson-Steiner criteria in
   liver cores of 0.9-5.0 cm (median 1.6 cm). Eighteen (29\%) HCCs were
   grade I (1.5 cm), 28 (45\%) were grade II (1.5 cm), 16 (26\%) were grade
   III (1.8 cm), and none were grade IV. Contrast wash-in and wash-out were
   concurrently demonstrated in 21 (34\%) tumors by way of CE-US, including
   three (16\%) grade I and 18 (41\%) grade II-III (P = 0.08); in 32 (52\%)
   tumors by way of CT, including three (16\%) grade I and 29 (66\%) grade
   II-III (P = 0.0006); and 28 (47\%) tumors by way of MRI, including three
   grade I (16\%) and 25 (57\%) grade II-III (P = 0.01). Among 1- to 2-cm
   tumors, the radiological diagnosis was achieved in two of 16 grade I and
   17of 31 grade II-III tumors (P = 0.006). Conclusion: Tumor grade, a
   relevant predictor of disease severity, influences the accuracy of
   dynamic contrast techniques in the diagnosis of HCC. (HEPATOLOGY

Abstract = {{Some rheological properties of banana puree were investigated.
   Experimental data was fitted to Hahn, Weltman and Figoni-Shoemaker
   equations in order to quantify the thixotropic behavior. Thixotropy
   measurements were carried out in a range between 5 and 75 degrees C and
   applying shear rates of 10 and 20 s(-1), finding that, in all cases, the
   Figoni-Shoemaker relationship was the best one to model the time
   dependency response.
   The flow behavior was well fitted by the Herschel-Bulkley model in a
   range between Sand 75 degrees C, and between 12 and 22 degrees Brix,
   obtaining that consistency coefficient decreased with temperature and
   increased with soluble solids content, flow behavior index decreased
   with soluble solids content, and apparent viscosity decreased with
   temperature and increased with soluble solids content. Adjusting the
   variation of apparent viscosity with temperature by means of an
   Arrhenius-type equation, the activation energy was obtained for
   different soluble solids content.}},

Title = {{Cost-Effectiveness of a Chemoprophylactic Intervention with Single Dose
   Rifampicin in Contacts of New Leprosy Patients}},
Journal = {{PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Background: With 249,007 new leprosy patients detected globally in 2008,
   it remains necessary to develop new and effective interventions to
   interrupt the transmission of M. leprae. We assessed the economic
   benefits of single dose rifampicin (SDR) for contacts as
   chemoprophylactic intervention in the control of leprosy.
   Methods: We conducted a single centre, double blind, cluster randomised,
   placebo controlled trial in northwest Bangladesh between 2002 and 2007,
   including 21,711 close contacts of 1,037 patients with newly diagnosed
   leprosy. We gave a single dose of rifampicin or placebo to close
   contacts, with follow-up for four years. The main outcome measure was
   the development of clinical leprosy. We assessed the cost effectiveness
   by calculating the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) between
   the standard multidrug therapy (MDT) program with the additional
   chemoprophylaxis intervention versus the standard MDT program only. The
   ICER was expressed in US dollars per prevented leprosy case.
   Findings: Chemoprophylaxis with SDR for preventing leprosy among
   contacts of leprosy patients is cost-effective at all contact levels and
   thereby a cost-effective prevention strategy. In total, \$6,009
   incremental cost was invested and 38 incremental leprosy cases were
   prevented, resulting in an ICER of \$158 per one additional prevented
   leprosy case. It was the most cost-effective in neighbours of neighbours
   and social contacts (ICER \$214), slightly less cost-effective in next
   door neighbours (ICER \$497) and least cost-effective among household
   contacts (ICER \$856).
   Conclusion: Chemoprophylaxis with single dose rifampicin given to
   contacts of newly diagnosed leprosy patients is a cost-effective
   intervention strategy. Implementation studies are necessary to establish
   whether this intervention is acceptable and feasible in other leprosy
   endemic areas of the world.}},

   greater cognitive elaboration and a more complex reflexive process

   identification with characters predicted the incidental impact of a full

Abstract = {{Background: Crohn's disease (CD) affects Health Related Quality of Life
   (HRQoL) especially in patients with clinical activity but their impact
   over the disease during periods of remission has not been sufficiently
   studied.
   Objective: To evaluate HRQoL in CD patients in remission and to identify
   socio-demographic and clinical factors related.
   Methods: We included patients with CD in remission for at least 6
   months, defined as a CDAI < 150 and a CRP < 5 mg/L. Socio-demographic
   and clinical parameters were recorded. HRQoL was evaluated with Short
   Form 36 Questionnaire (SF-36) and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease
   Questionnaire (IBDQ). Results were analyzed using multiple regressions
   with a confidence interval of 95\%.
   Results: Nine two patients ((X) over bar = 37 +/- 11.4 years, 52.2\%
   men) were consecutively included. Two patients failed to fill correctly
   the questionnaire and were excluded. Scores on the SF-36 were lower than
   in the general population of similar age and sex. The most affected
   dimension in the SF-36 was General Health (47.98 +/- 19.58) and the IBDQ
   Systemic Symptoms (5.15 +/- 1.27). Age, colonic location and previous
   surgery was related with worse HRQoL, while higher educational status,
   more time since diagnosis, steroid-resistance and inflammatory behavior,
   was associated with better HRQoL.
   Conclusions: Despite being in remission, CD patients had affected their
   HRQoL, so we must continue working to achieve improvement in HRQL of
   these patients during these periods of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{The spectra of the cyclotron resonance of holes in the InGaAs/GaAs
   selectively doped heterostructures with quantum wells are studied in
   pulsed magnetic fields as high as 50 T at 4.2 K. The previously observed
   effect of the inverted (compared with the results of the single-particle
   calculation of the Landau levels) ratio of the spectral weight of two
   split components of the line of the cyclotron resonance, which is
   attributed to the effects of the exchange interaction of holes, is
   confirmed. It is found that the ratios of intensities of the components
   of the line of the cyclotron resonance profoundly differ on the
   ascending and descending branches of the magnetic field pulse, which may
   be associated with a long time of the spin relaxation of holes between
   the two lowest Landau levels, which constitute tens of milliseconds.}},

   of partial hepatectomies for liver metastases from non-small cell lung
   cancer leading to different outcomes. A review of the literature
   suggests that although early reports of similar procedures were not

Abstract = {{Background. Double outlet left ventricle (DOLV) is a rare cardiac
   malformation in which both great arteries originate from the
   morphological left ventricle. There are limited data regarding the
   anatomical spectrum, characteristics and outcomes of DOLV.
   Methods. All patients with DOLV between 1960 and 2008 were identified.
   Patients' presentation, anatomy, surgical history, and outcomes were
   recorded. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to describe time-related
   survival and freedom from surgical intervention.
   Results. There were 19 patients with DOLV during the study period, 14 of
   whom were male (74\%). Median age at presentation was 2 days (birth-5.5
   years). The most prominent associated cardiac morphologies (in addition
   to DOLV) were atrial septal defects (14, 74\%), ventricular septal
   defects (13, 68\%), right ventricular hypoplasia (12, 63\%), and patent
   ductus arteriosus (15, 80\%). At presentation, nine patients (47\%) were
   cyanosed, nine (42\%) had cardiomegaly, and all had some degree of right
   ventricular dysfunction. Of the 19 patients, seven underwent
   biventricular repairs, nine underwent univentricular palliations, one
   had only palliative care, and two were seen for consultation only. There
   were six deaths in this series, five were cardiac in nature (one due to
   genetic syndrome). Five-year survival after presentation for both
   biventricular and univentricular repairs was 70-75\% (P = 0.80). Most
   surviving patients had residual cardiac abnormalities at last follow-up
   despite surgical repair.
   Discussion. DOLV is a rare cardiac malformation associated with high
   mortality and guarded outcomes from residual lesions.}},

Abstract = {{To overcome agency problems, public sector reforms started to introduce
   businesslike incentive structures to motivate public officials. By
   neglecting internal behavioral incentives, however, these reforms often
   do not reach their stated goals. This research analyzes the governance
   structure of Benedictine monasteries to gain new insights into solving
   agency problems in public institutions. A comparison is useful because
   members of both organizational forms, public organizations and
   monasteries, see themselves as responsible participants in their
   community and claim to serve the public good. This research studies
   monastic governance from an economic perspective. Benedictine
   monasteries in Baden-Wurttemberg, Bavaria, and German-speaking
   Switzerland have an average lifetime of almost 500 years, and only a
   quarter of them broke up because of agency problems. The authors argue
   that they were able to survive for centuries because of an appropriate
   governance structure, relying strongly on the intrinsic motivation of
   the members and internal control mechanisms. This governance approach
   differs in several aspects from current public sector reforms.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: There has been a rapid increase in the number of
   endovascular procedures performed for peripheral artery disease, and
   especially aorto-iliac occlusive disease (AIOD). Results from
   single-center reports suggest a benefit for endovascular procedures;
   however, these benefits may not reflect general practice. We used a
   population-based analysis to determine predictors of clinical and
   economic outcomes following open and endovascular procedures for
   inpatients with AIOD.
   Methods: All patients with MOD who underwent open and endovascular
   procedures in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide
   Inpatient Sample, 2004 to 2007, were identified. Independent patient-
   and provider-related characteristics were analyzed. Clinical outcomes
   included complications and mortality; economic outcomes included length
   of stay (LOS) and cost (2007 dollars). Outcomes were compared
   using)(chi(2), ANOVA, and multivariate regression analysis.
   Results: Four thousand, one hundred nineteen patients with MOD were
   identified. Endovascular procedures increased by 18\%. Patients who
   underwent endovascular procedures were more likely to be >= 65 years of
   age (46\% vs 37\%), female (54\% vs 49\%), and in the highest quartile
   of household income (20\% vs 16\%), all P <= .05. Endovascular patients
   were more likely to be non-elective (41\% vs 20\%), in the highest
   comorbidity index group (8\% vs 5\%), and with iliac artery disease
   (67\% vs 33\%), all P <= .05. In bivariate analysis, endovascular
   procedures were associated with lower complication rates (16\% vs 25\%),
   shorter LOS (2.2 vs 5.8 days), and lower hospital costs (\$13,661 vs
   \$17,161), all P < multivariate analysis, endovascular procedures had
   significantly lower complication rates and cost, and shorter LOS.
   Conclusions: Endovascular procedures have superior short-term clinical
   and economic outcomes compared with open procedures for the treatment of
   MOD in the inpatient setting.}},

Volume = {{90}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background. The congenital heart disease population is aging. We
   hypothesized that changes in rates of congenital, valvular, and
   noncongenital surgical operations in congenital heart patients varied
   with age and disease severity over the last two decades.
   Methods. We performed time trend analysis using a Quebec congenital
   heart disease database constructed from administrative data. We included
   congenital heart patients of all ages having cardiac surgical
   operations. Heart lesions were classified as ``severe{''} and
   ``other.{''} Cardiac surgical operations were grouped as congenital,
   valvular (including aortic), and noncongenital (arrhythmia surgery,
   coronary artery bypass grafting, and cardiac transplants). An adapted
   Aristotle score was developed to classify procedures based on surgical
   risk. Yearly surgical rates were measured as surgical operations per
   1,000 person-years and analyzed over time using Poisson regression
   models stratified by age, lesion severity, and cardiac surgery category.
   Results. From 1988 to 2005 we followed 71,979 patients for 1,009,430
   person-years. We identified 17,444 cardiac surgical operations. There
   was a 31\% increase in volumes and a 5\% increase in surgical rates over
   time. In children, congenital surgical operations remained constant,
   accounting for 80\% of all surgical operations. In adults, valvular
   operations were the most common type of surgical operations, increasing
   from 42\% to 63\% of all procedures over time. Rates of valvular
   operations increased significantly in all adult subgroups and in
   children with severe lesions.
   Conclusions. The need for valvular interventions has increased in the
   last two decades in congenital heart disease patients. These findings
   should be taken into account when allocating resources that will
   optimize outcomes for this growing population. (Ann Thorac Surg

Abstract = {{In this work, Web-based metrics that compute the semantic similarity
   between words or terms are presented and compared with the state of the
   art. Starting from the fundamental assumption that similarity of context
   implies similarity of meaning, relevant Web documents are downloaded via
   a Web search engine and the contextual information of words of interest
   is compared (context-based similarity metrics). The proposed algorithms
   work automatically, do not require any human-annotated knowledge
   resources, e.g., ontologies, and can be generalized and applied to
   different languages. Context-based metrics are evaluated both on the
   Charles-Miller data set and on a medical term data set. It is shown that
   context-based similarity metrics significantly outperform
   co-occurrence-based metrics, in terms of correlation with human
   judgment, for both tasks. In addition, the proposed unsupervised
   context-based similarity computation algorithms are shown to be
   competitive with the state-of-the-art supervised semantic similarity
   algorithms that employ language-specific knowledge resources.
   Specifically, context-based metrics achieve correlation scores of up to
   0.88 and 0.74 for the Charles-Miller and medical data sets,
   respectively. The effect of stop word filtering is also investigated for
   word and term similarity computation. Finally, the performance of
   context-based term similarity metrics is evaluated as a function of the
   number of Web documents used and for various feature weighting schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Recent published data has shown that metastatic involvement
   of the prelaryngeal or Delphian lymph node (DLN), the highest of the
   central (level VI) cervical lymph nodes, is highly predictive of
   advanced nodal disease in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). The aims of
   this study were to determine the diagnostic accuracy of all the level VI
   cervical nodes in PTC and to determine which node group, if any, is the
   most accurate in predicting lateral node (N1b) disease.
   Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. Data were obtained from
   the University of Sydney Endocrine Surgical Unit Database and through a
   review of the histopathology records. The study cohort was composed of
   177 consecutive patients with a final diagnosis of PTC who underwent
   total thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection, spanning the period from
   May 2001 to December 2006.
   Results: Of the 177 patients with PTC, 86 had the DLN removed, 51 had a
   pretracheal node removed and 76 had the paratracheal group removed. DLN,
   paratracheal and pretracheal node disease was present in 21\%, 39\% and
   46\%, respectively. Lateral node (N1b) disease was present in 35\%.
   Paratracheal node involvement was mildly predictive of further disease
   with patients 1.7 times more likely to have lateral node involvement
   (sensitivity = 55\%, specificity = 68\%). Pretracheal node involvement
   was moderately predictive of further disease with patients three times
   more likely to have lateral node involvement (sensitivity = 72\%,
   specificity = 74\%). DLN involvement was highly predictive of further
   node involvement with patients nine times more likely to have lateral
   node disease (sensitivity = 53\%, specificity = 94\%) and 40 times more
   likely to have any nodal disease (sensitivity = 41\%, specificity =
   100\%).
   Conclusion: This is the first study to examine the diagnostic accuracy
   of all level VI lymph nodes in PTC. While, metastatic involvement of all
   central nodal groups is indicative of further disease, the DLN is the
   most accurate predictor.}},

Abstract = {{beta-1,3-glucan is a major component of fungal cell walls with various
   biological activities, including effects on the production of
   inflammatory mediators in vivo and in vitro. However, few reports have
   examined its influence on the fungal cell itself. In this study, the
   influences of beta-1,3-glucan on the growth and cell wall structure of
   fungi was examined. Aspergillus fumigatus was cultured with a synthetic
   medium, C-limiting medium, in the presence or absence of
   beta-1,3-glucan. Hyphal growth was promoted in liquid and solid-cultures
   by adding beta-1,3-glucan. Glucose and dextran did not induce growth.
   The influence on cell wall structure of the beta-glucan-added cultures
   was examined by enzymolysis and NMR spectroscopy and the amount of
   beta-1,3-glucan found to be changed. beta-1,3-glucan has been widely
   detected in the environment. In this study, it was demonstrated that
   beta-1,3-glucan causes promotion of the growth, and a change in the cell
   wall architecture, of Aspergillus. Unregulated distribution of
   beta-1,3-glucan would be strongly related to the incidence of infectious
   diseases and allergy caused by Aspergillus spp.}},

Abstract = {{The fluorescence and phosphorescence quantum yields (Phi) of standard
   solutions have been re-evaluated based on an absolute method using an
   integrating sphere equipped with a multichannel spectrometer. We have
   examined in detail the Phi value of ruthenium(II) tris(2,2'-bipyridine)
   complex which have been often used as the standards in the determination
   of quantum yields of transition-metal complexes. This revealed that the
   Phi values for {[}Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) were 0.063 in deaerated H2O, 0.040 in
   aerated H2O, 0.095 in deaerated CH3CN. and 0.018 in aerated CH3CN,
   respectively, which are significantly higher than the previously
   accepted values.
   We have also examined the technical aspects in the determination of
   absolute emission quantum yields for lanthanide complexes and those of
   organic crystals of anthracene. For the accurate determination for
   lanthanide complexes, special care must be taken in the spectroscopic
   measurements because of their narrow absorption and emission bands. For
   organic crystals, the fluorescence quantum yields are reduced due to
   reabsorption, chemical impurities and structural defects. Our
   observations for highly purified anthracene crystals revealed that the
   lower limit value of Phi was 0.64. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by

   Green-Naghdi equations. Its mathematical interest is that it allows a
   control of the rotational part of the (vertically averaged) horizontal
   velocity, which is not the case for the usual Green-Naghdi equations.
   Using this property, we show that the solution of these new equations
   can be constructed by a standard Picard iterative scheme so that there
   is no loss of regularity of the solution with respect to the initial
   condition. Finally, we prove that the new Green-Naghdi equations
   conserve the almost irrotationality of the vertically averaged

Abstract = {{Antibiotics are universally prescribed drugs. Because they exert
   selective pressure and because of the innate bacterial ability for
   adaptation, even the appropriate clinical use of these potentially
   life-preserving agents inevitably fosters the development and spread of
   resistance by a variety of microorganisms. Inappropriate use has
   accelerated and increased the magnitude of a problem that is now
   considered a public health crisis. For Gram-positive pathogens some
   compounds offer limited hope, but for Gram-negative organisms no new
   drugs with radically increased spectra are available for clinical
   trials. Patients with serious infections due to multiresistant organisms
   are experiencing adverse, sometimes fatal, clinical outcomes. Use of
   multiple drugs increases side effects and exposes additional susceptible
   bacteria to selective pressure. There is evidence that the appropriate
   use of currently available antibiotics can be associated with a
   reduction of the spread of resistance. Antibiotic stewardship programmes
   and the antibiotic `care bundle' approach can be effective measures to
   lengthen the useful life of antibiotics and can be implemented in most
   clinical situations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. and the International

Abstract = {{P>Gene duplications represent an important class of evolutionary events
   that is likely to have contributed to the unique human phenotype in the
   short evolutionary time since the human-chimpanzee divergence. With the
   availability of both human and chimpanzee genome drafts in high coverage
   re-sequencing assemblies and the high annotation quality of most human
   genes, it should now be possible to identify all human lineage-specific
   gene duplication events (human inparalogues) and a few pioneering
   studies have attempted to do that. However, the different levels of
   coverage in the human and chimpanzee's genomes assemblies, and the
   differing levels of gene annotation, have led to problematic assumptions
   and oversimplifications in the algorithms and the datasets used to
   detect human lineage-specific gene duplications. In this study, we have
   developed a set of bioinformatic tools to overcome a number of the
   conceptual problems that are prevalent in previous studies and have
   collected a reliable and representative set of human inparalogues.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a geometric phase gate in a decoherence-free subspace with
   trapped ions. The quantum information is encoded in the Zeeman sublevels
   of the ground state and two physical qubits to make up one logical qubit
   with ultra-long coherence time. Single- and two-qubit operations
   together with the transport and splitting of linear ion crystals allow
   for a robust and decoherence-free scalable quantum processor. For the
   ease of the phase gate realization we employ one Raman laser field on
   four ions simultaneously, i.e. no tight focus for addressing. The
   decoherence-free subspace is left neither during gate operations nor
   during the transport of quantum information. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2010}},

Abstract = {{Alcohols are important high volatility industrial chemicals, and when
   present in low concentrations require highly selective separation
   techniques. This paper investigates the kinetics of the adsorption of
   water, methanol, and butanol vapors on natural clinoptilolite based on
   experimental data obtained from laboratory-scale equipment under
   constant saturated vapor pressure conditions at ambient temperature. In
   order to determine the corresponding mass transfer and diffusion
   coefficients of the adsorbed components in the zeolite particles, the
   kinetic curves have been investigated using two simple models - the
   linear driving force model (LDFM) as well as the particle diffusion
   model. The equilibrium and the kinetic parameters can also be determined
   from the experimental values of the statistical moments of the kinetic
   curves. Two main results have been obtained from this study. At the
   experimental conditions, the overall rates of adsorption of both
   methanol and water vapors are nearly equal, and they are of the same
   order of magnitude to the macro-(meso)-pore and intracrystalline
   diffusion rates predicted for the biporous clinoptilolite structure. In
   contrast, the diffusion of butanol vapors is much slower in the zeolite
   particles and particle crystals, where the intracrystalline mass
   transfer resistance plays a dominant role, even for the largest
   particles studied. The simple LDFM predictions exhibit very good
   correlation to the experimental data for all adsorptive components and
   particle sizes, despite the biporous zeolite structure. This model can
   be used to provide an acceptable and quick interpretation of adsorption
   rate curves, even at nonlinear equilibrium conditions. (C) 2009 Curtin

Abstract = {{Treatment algorithms in pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)
   are derived from clinical trials in adult populations and from clinical
   practice, but experience m children is limited In this retrospective
   cohort study, we analyzed outcomes in a previously identified cohort of
   86 consecutive children with PAH treated with bosentan as part of their
   treatment regimen All children with idiopathic PAH or heritable PAH and
   PAH associated with congenital heart disease or connective tissue
   disease who started bosentan treatment from May 2001 to April 2003 in 2
   tertiary pediatric referral centers were followed, with data collection
   ending August 2006 Eighty-six children (37 male, 49 female) 11 +/- 5
   years of age with idiopathic/heritable PAH (n = 36), PAH associated with
   congenital heart disease (n = 48), or PAH associated with connective
   tissue disease (n = 2) received bosentan as monotherapy (n = 42) or as
   an add-on to pre-existing continuous intravenous epoprostenol or
   subcutaneous treprostinil (n = 44) Median observation period was 39
   months (range 2 to 60) Thirty-four patients (40\%) received >= 1
   additional PAH-specific therapy during follow-up At end of data
   collection, 25 patients (29\%) remained on bosentan, 43 (50\%) had
   stopped bosentan, 11 (13\%) had died while on bosentan, and 7 were lost
   to follow-up At 4 years, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of disease
   progression in patients while on bosentan was 54\% (7 patients at risk)
   with a survival estimate of 82\% (16 patients at risk) Risk factors
   significantly associated with survival were World Health Organization
   functional class and indexed pulmonary vascular resistance In
   conclusion, outcome in children with PAH managed with current treatment

Abstract = {{The Japanese method of inquest, which depends mostly on external

   and suicides as death by disease. We conducted computed tomography (CT)
   scans of 80 cases for which police concluded death by disease or natural
   causes based on police investigations into the circumstances and results
   from external examinations. The cause of death was clearly determined by
   CT scan in 17 of 80 cases. Ten cases underwent autopsy after the police
   suspected criminality based on results of the CT examinations. The
   results suggest CT scan may be a tool for preventing a number of
   overlooked crimes and accidents in Japan. However, it cannot be a
   perfect tool for discerning between death by disease and other causes of
   death without cooperation from the investigative agencies and subsequent

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to determine the AA digestibility and energy
   concentration of a specialized high-protein corn distillers dried grains
   (HPC-DDG) product and a high-protein sorghum dried distillers grains
   with solubles (HPS-DDGS) product. Six growing barrows (BW = 22.7 kg)
   were surgically fitted with T-cannulas at the terminal ileum and
   allotted randomly to 3 treatments in a crossover design with 3 periods.
   The treatment diets were 1) 67\% HPC-DDG and 2) 50\% HPS-DDGS as the
   sole protein sources, and 3) an N-free diet for determining basal
   endogenous AA loss. All diets contained 0.25\% chromic oxide as an inert
   marker. Digesta and fecal samples were collected and analyzed for AA and
   energy concentrations. After chemical analysis, standardized and
   apparent ileal digestible (SID and AID, respectively) AA and GE were
   determined for each coproduct. The DE, ME, and NE values for HPC-DDG and
   HPS-DDGS also were calculated. The chemical composition of HPC-DDG and
   HPS-DDGS on a DM basis was 40.8\% CP, 5.4\% fat, 22.9\% ADF, 36.6\% NDF,
   0.04\% Ca, and 0.42\% P and 48.2\% CP, 3.1\% fat, 17.5\% ADF, 20.4\%
   NDF, 0.13\% Ca, and 0.82\% P, respectively. The DM content of HPC-DDG
   and HPS-DDGS was 89.50 and 91.88\%, respectively. Analyzed AA content of
   HPC-DDG was greater than that of traditional corn DDGS. The Lys content
   of HPC-DDG was 1.36\% ( DM basis), resulting in a Lys-to-CP ratio of
   3.2\%. In HPS-DDGS, most AA were present in greater proportions than in
   HPC-DDG or conventional sorghum DDGS. The HPS-DDGS Lys content was 1.7\%
   (DM basis), equivalent to a Lys-toCP ratio of 3.5\%. In HPC-DDG, the AID
   for Lys, Met, Thr, and Trp were 65.9 +/- 1.7, 87.0 +/- 1.9, 72.8 +/-
   3.4, and 76.2\% +/- 3.5, respectively, and SID values were 67.8 +/- 1.7,
   87.5 +/- 1.9, 75.0 +/- 3.5, and 78.6 +/- 3.7\%, respectively. For
   HPS-DDGS, the AID for Lys, Met, Thr, and Trp were 51.9 +/- 5.3, 73.0 +/-
   3.1, 60.6 +/- 5.3, and 71.7 +/- 3.4\%, respectively, and SID values were
   53.7 +/- 4.9, 73.8 +/- 3.0, 63.0 +/- 4.9, and 73.8 +/- 3.0\%,
   respectively. The GE, DE, and calculated ME and NE values were 5,293,
   3,703 +/- 121, 3,426 +/- 121, and 2,131 +/- 88 kcal/kg of DM,
   respectively, for HPC-DDG and 5,108, 3,878, 3,549, and 2,256 kcal/ kg of
   DM, respectively, for HPSDDGS. Results indicate that both coproducts are
   well suited for use in swine diets and that actual AA digestibility
   values and calculated energy concentrations can now be used in swine
   diet formulation.}},

   measured and adjusted for intracranial volume. We used a new method of
   pooling cerebrospinal fluid A beta 42 and Pittsburgh compound B positron
   emission tomography measures to produce equivalent measures of brain A
   beta load from either source and analysed the results using multiple
   imputation methods. We performed our analyses in two phases. First, we
   grouped our subjects into those who were `amyloid positive' (n = 165,
   with the assumption that Alzheimer's pathology is dominant in this
   group) and those who were `amyloid negative' (n = 53). In the second
   phase, we included all 218 subjects with mild cognitive impairment to
   evaluate the biomarkers in a sample that we assumed to contain a full
   spectrum of expected pathologies. In a Kaplan-Meier analysis, amyloid
   positive subjects with mild cognitive impairment were much more likely
   to progress to dementia within 2 years than amyloid negative subjects
   with mild cognitive impairment (50 versus 19\%). Among amyloid positive
   subjects with mild cognitive impairment only, hippocampal atrophy
   predicted shorter time-to-progression (P < 0.001) while A beta load did
   not (P = 0.44). In contrast, when all 218 subjects with mild cognitive
   impairment were combined (amyloid positive and negative), hippocampal
   atrophy and A beta load predicted shorter time-to-progression with
   comparable power (hazard ratio for an inter-quartile difference of 2.6
   for both); however, the risk profile was linear throughout the range of
   hippocampal atrophy values but reached a ceiling at higher values of
   brain A beta load. Our results are consistent with a model of
   Alzheimer's disease in which A beta deposition initiates the
   pathological cascade but is not the direct cause of cognitive impairment
   as evidenced by the fact that A beta load severity is decoupled from
   risk of progression at high levels. In contrast, hippocampal atrophy
   indicates how far along the neurodegenerative path one is, and hence how
   close to progressing to dementia. Possible explanations for our finding
   that many subjects with mild cognitive impairment have intermediate
   levels of A beta load include: (i) individual subjects may reach an A
   beta load plateau at varying absolute levels; (ii) some subjects may be
   more biologically susceptible to A beta than others; and (iii) subjects
   with mild cognitive impairment with intermediate levels of A beta may
   represent individuals with Alzheimer's disease co-existent with other
   pathologies.}},

Abstract = {{The success in gene therapy relies strongly on new efficient gene
   delivery vectors. Nonviral vectors based on lipids and polymers
   constitute an important alternative to the viral vectors. However, the
   key problem with these vectors is the poor structural control of their
   DNA complexes. In the present work, following new design we synthesized
   unsymmetrical bolaamphiphiles, molecules bearing neutral sugar (gluconic
   acid) and dicationic ornithine head groups connected by different long
   hydrophobic spacers. Within this design, a positively charged headgroup
   is expected to bind DNA, the hydrophobic spacer is to drive the
   formation of a monolayer membrane shell around DNA, while the neutral
   group is to be exposed outside of the complex. Our fluorescence and gel
   electrophoresis data showed that self-assembly of bolas and their
   interaction with DNA depend strongly on the bola structure. The size of
   bola/DNA complexes (bolaplexes) estimated from dynamic light scattering
   data was similar to 100 nm at low N/P (cationic nitrogen/DNA phosphate
   molar ratio), while at higher N/Ps it was significantly larger due to
   neutralization of their surface charge. Atomic force microscopy studies
   revealed nanostructural rod-shaped or spherical morphology of the
   bolaplexes. Transfection efficiency of the bolaplexes in vitro was
   significant when either DOPE or chloroquine were used as helping agents,
   suggesting that the key barrier for their internalization is the
   endosomal escape. Finally, all bolas showed low cytotoxicity (cell
   viability >80\%). The present results show that bolas are prospective
   candidates for construction of nonviral gene delivery vectors. We
   believe that further optimization of polar head groups and a hydrophobic
   spacer in the bolas will lead to vectors with controlled small size and
   high transfection efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The rate at which liquids can be added to a vertical well, the lateral
   zone of impact of the well, and the liquids volume needed to wet the
   waste within the zone of impact of the well are the key inputs needed to
   design a vertical well system. This paper presents design charts that
   can be used to estimate these inputs as a function of municipal solid
   waste properties (porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and anisotropy
   ratio), well dimensions (radius and screen length), and injection
   pressure. SEEP/W modeling was conducted to estimate the key design
   inputs for a range of conditions practically encountered for a vertical
   well installed in landfilled waste. The flow rate, lateral zone of
   impact of a well, liquids volume added, and injection pressure were
   normalized with the waste properties and well dimensions to formulate
   dimensionless variables. A series of design charts were created to
   present dimensionless steady-state flow rate, lateral zone of impact,
   and the dimensionless liquid volume needed to reach a steady-state
   condition, as a function of dimensionless input variables. By using
   dimensionless variables formulated for this work, these charts permit
   the user to estimate the steady-state design variables described above
   for a wide range of configurations and conditions beyond those simulated
   without the need for further modeling. The results of the study suggest
   that the lateral extent of the well can be estimated using Darcy's
   equation and assuming saturated unit-gradient vertical flow regime below
   the well bottom. An example problem is presented to illustrate the use
   of the design charts. The scenario described in the example problem was
   also modeled with SEEP/W, and the results were compared with those
   obtained from the design charts to demonstrate the validity of design
   charts for scenarios other than those used for the development of the
   design charts. The methodology presented in this paper should be thought
   of as a means to provide a set of bounds that an engineer can use along
   with their judgment in the design of a system for a specific site. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective: This study examined posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a
   potential moderating variable in the relationship between social support
   and elevated suicide risk in a sample of treatment-seeking Iraq and
   Afghanistan War Veterans. Method: As part of routine care, self-reported
   marital status, satisfaction with social networks, PTSD, and recent
   suicidality were assessed in Veterans (N = 431) referred for mental
   health services at a large Veteran Affairs Medical Center. Logistic
   regression analyses were conducted using this cross-sectional data
   sample to test predictions of diminished influence of social support on
   suicide risk in Veterans reporting PTSD. Results: Thirteen percent of
   Veterans were classified as being at elevated risk for suicide. Married
   Veterans were less likely to be at elevated suicide risk relative to
   unmarried Veterans and Veterans reporting greater satisfaction with
   their social networks were less likely to be at elevated risk relative
   to Veterans reporting lower satisfaction. Satisfaction with social
   networks was protective for suicide risk in PTSD and non-PTSD cases, but
   was significantly less protective for veterans reporting PTSD.
   Conclusions: Veterans who are married and Veterans who report greater
   satisfaction with social networks are less likely to endorse suicidal
   thoughts or behaviors suggestive of elevated suicide risk. However, the
   presence of PTSD may diminish the protective influence of social
   networks among treatment-seeking Veterans. Depression and Anxiety

   of HPV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in
   two groups of patients using betel quid with tobacco, those with OSMF (n
   = 12) and those with OSCC (n = 62). Methods: DNA was extracted from all
   the samples and viral genome was examined by PCR/DNA sequencing.
   HPV-positive samples were analyzed separately for the high-risk types
   HPV 16 and 18. Results: HPV DNA, HSV DNA, and EBV DNA were detected in
   11 (91\%), 1 (8\%), and 3 (25\%) of the 12 samples from patients with
   OSMF compared with 15 (24\%), 3 (5\%), and 18 (29\%), respectively, from
   62 patients with OSCC. HPV 16 and 18 DNA was detected in 8/12 (67\%) in
   the OSMF group and 10/62 (16\%) in the OSCC group. The difference
   between presence of HPV DNA in OSMF and OSCC groups was statistically
   significant, while the difference between HSV and EBV DNA content in

   Methods: A 13.5 year-old girl presented with a unilateral posterior
   crossbite, noticeable facial asymmetry, anterior crossbite and
   displacement of the mandible on closure. She had no history of head
   injury or significant medical problems and her parents rejected surgical
   correction. A removable appliance was used to correct the crossbite

   diesel. The oil samples were analyzed using GC/MS in order to find out
   their composition. The physical parameters and the composition of the
   parent oil and its fractions support the resemblance of the samples with
   the standard fuel oils. The light fractions best match with gasoline,
   the middle fractions match with kerosene and the heavier fractions match
   with diesel oil in almost all of the characteristic properties. (c) 2010

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the relationship between the stress ratio and
   the fabric of frictional material under three-dimensional stress. The
   spatial distribution function of the contact normal was derived to
   describe the heterogeneous distribution of the micro-structural
   architecture. Discrete element simulations were conducted using an
   assembly consisting of 10,000 spherical particles. Sixteen stress probe
   experiments were simulated under both axi-symmetric stress and
   plane-strain conditions. The numerical results show that a change in the
   direction of the stress probe does not significantly affect the
   evolution of the fabric structure in the vertical plane. Regardless of
   whether the material is subjected to axi-symmetric stress or plane
   strain, the degree of fabric anisotropy shows a unique relationship with
   the stress ratio. The modified stress ratio, as theoretically derived
   from a micromechanics formulation, is able to separately measure
   micro-structures in the vertical and horizontal planes. The distribution
   function proposed in this study generally performs well in estimating
   the heterogeneous distribution of the contact normal. A higher-order
   distribution function is required to improve the predictability of the
   contact normal distribution for increasing stress-ratio paths. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Objective : This study was designed to validate the cell trafficking
   efficiency of the in vivo bioluminescence image (BLI) study in the
   setting of transplantation of the luciferase expressing bone
   marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC), which were delivered at
   each different time after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
   (MCAO) in a mouse model.
   Methods : Transplanting donor BMSC were prepared by primary cell culture
   from transgenic mouse expressing luciferase (LUC). Transient focal
   infarcts were induced in 4-6-week-old male nude mice. The experiment
   mice were divided into five groups by the time of MSC transplantation :
   1) sham-operation group, 2) 2-h group, 3) 1-day group, 4) 3-day group,
   and 5) 1- week group. BLI for detection of spatial distribution of
   transplanted MSC was performed by detecting emitted photons. Migration
   of the transplanted cells to the infarcted area was confirmed by
   histological examinations. Differences between groups were evaluated by
   paired t-test.
   Results : A focal spot of bioluminescence was observed at the injection
   site on the next day after transplantation by signal intensity of
   bioluminescence. After 4 weeks, the mean signal intensities of 2-h,
   1-day, 3-day, and 1-week group were 2.6 x 10(7) +/- 7.4 x 10(6), 6.1 x
   10(6) +/- 1.2 x 10(6), 1.7 x 10(6) +/- 4.4 x 10(5), and 8.9 x 10(6) +/-
   9.5 x 10(5), respectively. The 2-h group showed significantly higher
   signal intensity (p < 0.01). The engrafted BMSC showed around the
   infarct border zones on immunohistochemical examination. The counts of
   LUC-positive cells revealed the highest number in the 2-h group, in
   agreement with the results of BLI experiments (p < 0.01).
   Conclusion : In this study, the results suggested that the transplanted
   BMSC migrated to the infarct border zone in BLI study and the higher
   signal intensity of LUC-positive cells seen in 2 hrs after MSC
   transplantation in MCAO mouse model. In addition, noninvasive imaging in
   real time is an ideal method for tracking stem cell transplantation.
   This method can be widely applied to various research fields of cell
   transplantation therapy.}},

Abstract = {{The electric solar wind sail (E-sail) is a space propulsion concept that
   uses the natural solar wind dynamic pressure for producing spacecraft
   thrust. In its baseline form, the E-sail consists of a number of long,
   thin, conducting, and centrifugally stretched tethers, which are kept in
   a high positive potential by an onboard electron gun. The concept gains
   its efficiency from the fact that the effective sail area, i.e., the
   potential structure of the tethers, can be millions of times larger than
   the physical area of the thin tethers wires, which offsets the fact that
   the dynamic pressure of the solar wind is very weak. Indeed, according
   to the most recent published estimates, an E-sail of 1 N thrust and 100
   kg mass could be built in the rather near future, providing a
   revolutionary level of propulsive performance (specific acceleration)
   for travel in the solar system. Here we give a review of the ongoing
   technical development work of the E-sail, covering tether construction,
   overall mechanical design alternatives, guidance and navigation
   strategies, and dynamical and orbital simulations. (C) 2010 American

Abstract = {{The effects of dry and wet oxidation treatments of activated carbon (AC)
   on the surface chemistry and porous structure are studied. Using cherry
   stones (CS), AC was first prepared by carbonization at 900 degrees C for
   2 h in N-2 and activation at 850 degrees C for 2 h in CO2. Then, the
   resulting AC was oxidized in O-2(air) or O-3 atmosphere and with HNO3
   and H2O2 solutions. The acidic-basic surface sites were analyzed by
   FT-IR spectroscopy, Boehm method, and pH of the point of zero charge
   (pH(pzc)) and the porous structure by N-2 adsorption and mercury
   porosimetry. It has been found that the oxidizing agent, under specific
   reaction conditions, rather than whether it was a gas or a solute in
   aqueous solution, is the main factor that controls the changes produced
   in the surface chemistry and porous structure of AC. O-3 and HNO3 are
   the most effective oxidants to form acidic oxygen surface groups.
   However, the content of basic groups decreases for the four oxidants,
   the effect being much stronger for HNO3. A microporosity reduction is
   also observed, which is more important for O-2(air) and especially for
   HNO3 than for O-3 and H2O2. The percentage of microporosity loss is as
   high as 43.3 for HNO3. Mesoporosity significantly develops, whereas
   macroporosity usually remains practically unchanged. Dry oxidation of AC
   at 100 degrees C in O-3 has proved to be the most promising method to
   increase the content of acidic oxygen surface groups in the material
   without greatly decreasing the content of basic sites and microporosity
   and with a significant mesoporosity development. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

   N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-bromobenzylamine (dsp4) starting treatment at
   3 months of age. Norepinephrine transporter immunolabelling demonstrated
   severe loss of locus ceruleus neurons and loss of cortical
   norepinephrine transporter starting as early as 4.5 months of age and
   aggravating over time. Of note, dsp4-treated transgenic mice showed
   elevated amyloid beta levels and impaired spatial memory performance at
   6.5 months of age compared to control-treated APP/PS1 transgenic mice,
   indicating an accelerating effect on cerebral amyloidosis and cognitive
   deficits. Likewise, norepinephrine-depletion increased neuroinflammation
   compared to transgenic controls as verified by macrophage inflammatory
   protein-1 alpha and -1 beta gene expression analysis. Exploratory
   activity and memory retention was compromised by age in APP/PSI
   transgenic mice and further aggravated by induced noradrenergic
   deficiency. In contrast, novel object recognition was not influenced by
   norepinephrine deficiency, but by the APP/PS1 transgene at 12 months.
   Overall, our data indicate that early loss of noradrenergic innervation
   promotes amyloid deposition and modulates the activation state of
   inflammatory cells. This in turn could have had impact on the
   acceleration of cognitive deficits observed over time. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Early rebleeding after coiling of a ruptured intracranial
   aneurysm (IA) may cause disability or death. The incidence and
   predictors of early rebleeding have previously been sparsely
   investigated.
   Purpose: To assess the incidence and risk factors of early rebleeding
   after coiling of a ruptured IA and to analyze the outcome of the
   patients suffering early rehemorrhage.
   Material and Methods: The data of 194 consecutive acutely (within 3
   days) coiled patients with saccular ruptured IAs were analyzed. Age,
   gender, hypertension, aneurysm multiplicity, Hunt et Hess (HH) grade,
   intracerebral hematoma (ICH), intraventricular hematoma (IVH), external
   ventricular drainage (EVD), aneurysm location and size, and the grade of
   the initial aneurysm occlusion were tested to find the risk factors for
   early rebleeding. The outcome of the patients suffering rehemorrhage was
   verified.
   Results: Early rebleeding after coiling occurred in 7 patients out of
   194 (3.6\%). The presence of an ICH at admission and HH grade 3-5 before
   coiling were significant risk factors for rebleeding. An early
   rehemorrhage appeared as an enlargement of the initial ICH in all of
   these patients. Six of seven patients had good outcome (Glasgow Outcome
   Scale, GOS, 3-5). Logistic regression analysis did not find any other
   statistically significant risk factors.
   Conclusion: The incidence of early rebleeding after acutely coiled
   ruptured IA was 3.6\%. Risk factors for post-procedural rehemorrhage
   were the presence of ICH on the initial CT and HH grade 3-5 before
   coiling. Early rebleeding appeared exclusively as an enlargement of the
   initial ICH and not an increased amount of blood in the subarachnoid
   space.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing the heat generated in traditional electronics is a chief
   motivation for the development of spin-based electronics, called
   spintronics(1). Spin-based transistors that do not strictly rely on the
   raising or lowering of electrostatic barriers can overcome scaling
   limits in charge-based transistors(2). Spin transport in semiconductors
   might also lead to dissipation-less information transfer with pure spin
   currents(3). Despite these thermodynamic advantages, little experimental
   literature exists on the thermal aspects of spin transport in solids. A
   recent and surprising exception was the discovery of the spin-Seebeck
   effect, reported as a measurement of a redistribution of spins along the
   length of a sample of permalloy (NiFe) induced by a temperature
   gradient(4). This macroscopic spatial distribution of spins is,
   surprisingly, many orders of magnitude larger than the spin diffusion
   length, which has generated strong interest in the thermal aspects of
   spin transport(5). Here, the spin-Seebeck effect is observed in a
   ferromagnetic semiconductor, GaMnAs, which allows flexible design of the
   magnetization directions, a larger spin polarization, and measurements
   across the magnetic phase transition. This effect is observed even in
   the absence of longitudinal charge transport. The spatial distribution
   of spin currents is maintained across electrical breaks, highlighting
   the local nature of this thermally driven effect.}},

Abstract = {{Sows suffering from clinical signs of disease (e.g. lameness, wounds and
   shoulder ulcers) are often involuntarily culled, affecting the farmer's
   economy and the welfare of the animals. In order to investigate the
   interrelationships between clinical signs of individual pregnant
   group-housed sows, we performed an explanatory factor analysis to
   identify factors describing the patterns of variation of clinical signs.
   Moreover, we investigated how these emerging factors affected the
   probability of a sow to be either (i) euthanized, (ii) suddenly dead,
   (iii) sent to slaughter due to clinical signs of disease such as claw
   lesions or wounds or (iv) involuntarily culled (representing a pool of
   sows that were either euthanized, dead or sent to slaughter due to
   disease). Data from 2.989 pregnant sows in group-housing systems from 33
   sow herds were included in the study. A thorough clinical examination
   was performed for each sow by using a protocol including 16 different
   clinical signs. Farmers recorded all cuttings and deaths and the reasons
   for these actions in a 3-month period after the clinical examination.
   Among the observed sows, 4.2\% were involuntarily culled during the
   3-month period. From the explanatory factor analysis, we identified
   three factors describing the underlying structure of the 16 clinical
   variables. We interpreted the factors as `pressure marks', `wounds' and
   `lameness' Logistic analyses were performed to investigate the effect of
   the three factors and the parity number of each sow on the four
   outcomes: (i) euthanized, (ii) suddenly dead, (iii) sent to slaughter
   due to clinical signs of disease and (iv) involuntarily culled. The
   analyses showed that `lameness' significantly increased the risk of sows
   to be involuntarily culled (P = 0.016) or sent to slaughter due to
   clinical signs of disease (P = 0.026). Lameness is generally considered
   to be an important welfare problem in sows, which could explain the
   increased risk seen in this study. By contrast `pressure marks' and
   `wounds' did not have any significant effect on the four outcomes (P >
   0.05).}},

Abstract = {{Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and obesity may cause
   adverse pregnancy outcomes for mothers and offspring. We have set up a
   research programme to identify predictors for GDM and fetal growth in a
   multiethnic population in Oslo to improve the identification of high
   risk pregnancies and reduce adverse short and long-term outcomes for
   mothers and offspring. Aims: To present the rationale, methods, study
   population and participation rates. Methods: Population-based cohort
   study of pregnant women attending the Child Health Clinics (CHC) in
   Groruddalen, Oslo, and their offspring. Questionnaire data, blood
   pressure, anthropometric measurements, and fasting blood and urine
   samples are collected (gestational weeks 8-20 and 28, and 12 weeks
   postpartum) and an oral glucose tolerance test (28 weeks). Physical
   activity is measured, three ultrasound measurements are performed and
   paternal questionnaire data collected. Routine hospital data are
   available for all mothers and offspring. Umbilical venous blood and
   placentas are collected, sampled, and stored and neonatal anthropometric
   measurements performed. Ethnicity is self-reported country of birth.
   Results: 823 women were included, 59\% of non-Western origin. The
   participation rate was 74\% (64-83\% in main ethnic groups), mean age
   29.8 years (95\% CI 29.5-30.1) and median parity 1 (inter-quartile range
   1). The cohort is representative for women attending the CHC with
   respect to ethnicity and age. A slight selection towards lower parity
   (South Asians) and age (Africans) was found. Few were lost to follow-up.
   Conclusions: Unique information is collected from a representative group
   of multiethnic women to address important public health problems and
   mechanisms of disease. Participation rates are high in all ethnic
   groups.}},

Abstract = {{Early and accurate differentiation between infectious and non-infectious
   fever is vitally important in the intensive care unit (ICU). In the
   present study, patients admitted to the medical ICU were screened daily
   from August 2008 to February 2009. Within 24 hr after the development of
   fever (>38.3 degrees C), serum was collected for the measurement of the
   procalcitonin (PCT) and high mobility group B 1 levels. Simplified Acute
   Physiology Score (SAPS) II and Acute Physiology And Chronic Health
   Evaluation (APACHE) III scores were also analyzed. Sixty-three patients
   developed fever among 448 consecutive patients (14.1\%). Fever was
   caused by either infectious (84.1\%) or non-infectious processes
   (15.9\%). Patients with fever due to infectious causes showed higher
   values of serum PCT (7.8+/-10.2 vs 0.5+/-0.2 ng/mL, P=0.026), SAPS II
   (12.0+/-3.8 vs 7.6+/-2.7, P=0.006), and APACHE III (48+/-20 vs
   28.7+/-13.3, P=0.039) than those with non-infectious fever. In receiver
   operating characteristic curve analysis, the area under the curve was
   0.726 (95\% CI; 0.587-0.865) for PCT, 0.759 (95\% CI; 0.597-0.922) for
   SAPS II, and 0.715 (95\% CI; 0.550-0.880) for APACHE III. Serum PCT,
   SAPS II, and APACHE III are useful in the differentiation between
   infectious and non-infectious fever in the ICU.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the static structural test of 1.5-ton test WIG
   (Wing-In-Ground effect) craft designed and built to verify its
   aero/hydro-dynamic and structural design characteristics prior to the
   design of full scale 20-passenger WIG craft. The test WIG craft is
   scaled down from its full scale WIG craft by 1/2 and built using
   pre-preg carbon/epoxy composites for the majority of structural parts
   with metallic materials for fittings used at wings to hull connections.
   To initiate the test, the finite element (FE) models of the test WIG
   craft are developed and, based on their results, the details of applied
   load range, strain/deflection gauge types and locations, load
   application methods and data acquisition system specifications are
   determined. The test is performed with respect to main wings to hull
   connection part first and then vertical tail wing to hull connection
   part and, finally, horizontal tail wing to vertical tail wing/hull
   connection part. Both the test and FE model results are compared with
   respect to stresses and deflections and the comparison shows good
   correlation between them which implies satisfactory design and building
   of 1.5-ton test WIG craft. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Occupational exposure limits (OELs) are used as an important tool to
   protect workers from adverse chemical exposures and its detrimental
   effects on their health. The Ministry of Labor (MOL) can establish and
   publish OELs based on the Industrial Safety and Health Act in Korea. The
   first set of OELs was announced by the MOL in 1986. At that time, it was
   identical to the Threshold Limit Values of the American Conference of
   Governmental Industrial Hygienists. Until 2006, none the first OELs
   except for those of three chemicals (asbestos, benzene, and
   2-bromopropane) were updated during the last twenty years. The Hazardous
   Agents Review Committee established under the MOL selected 126 chemicals
   from 698 chemicals covered by OELs using several criteria. From 2005 to
   2006, the MOL provided research funds for academic institutions and
   toxicological laboratories to gather the evidence documenting the need
   to revise the outdated OELs. Finally, the MOL notified the revised OELs
   for 126 chemicals from 2007 to 2008. The revised OELs of 58 substances
   from among these chemicals were lowered to equal or less than half the
   value of the original OELs. This is the most substantial change in the
   history of OEL revisions in Korea. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in renal
   allograft recipients with functioning graft. Our study aimed to
   determine the incidence and the risk factors of cardiovascular disease
   after renal transplantation in Korea. We retrospectively analyzed 430
   adult recipients who underwent kidney transplantation between January
   1997 and February 2007. CVD was defined as a composite outcome of
   ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular accident and peripheral vascular
   disease. Mean age of recipients was 40.0+/-11.8 yr. Mean duration of
   follow-up was 72+/-39 months. The cumulative incidence of CVD after
   renal transplantation was 2.4\% at 5 yr, 5.4\% at 10 yr and 11.4\% at 12
   yr. Multivariate analysis revealed that recipient's age, diabetes
   mellitus and duration of dialysis before transplantation were associated
   with post-transplant CVD (hazard ratio 1.843 {[}95\% CI, 1.005-3.381],
   3.846 {[}95\% CI, 1.025-14.432] and 3.394 {[}95\% CI, 1.728-6.665]
   respectively). In conclusion, old age, duration of dialysis and diabetes
   mellitus are important risk factors for post-transplant CVD, although
   the incidence of post-renal transplant CVD is lower in Korea than that
   in western countries.}},

   nanoparticle surface was partially capped by poly(vinylpyrolidone) (PVP)

   TEM. The fluorescence properties of
   poly{[}2-methoxy-5(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV)/ZnO
   nanocomposites with different mass ratios were studied by steady-state
   and time-resolved spectroscopy. The results indicate that the
   surface-modified ZnO nanoparticles are more effective to quench the
   emission of MEH-PPV by charge transfer process than the non-capped ZnO.
   The more effective charge transfer in MEH-PPV/ZnO-capped is attributed
   to the better dispersion of the nanoparticles in MEH-PPV matrix and THF

   Weber, 2007). In this paper, quantized Progressive Second Price (PSP)
   auction algorithms are presented for competitive electricity systems,
   especially for short-run electric power markets. In Jia and Caines
   (2008, 2010), two quantized PSP auction algorithms were introduced and
   analyzed for demand markets, which are called, respectively, the
   Aggressive-Defensive Quantized PSP (ADQ-PSP) algorithm and the
   Unique-limit Quantized PSP (UQ-PSP) algorithm. Here we first present an
   algorithm combined with ADQ-PSP and UQ-PSP features, and apply it to a
   double power auction system where competition on both power generators
   and energy service providers (and/or large users) is considered. Double
   auctions are formulated in this work as two single-sided quantized
   auctions which depend upon joint market quantities and price
   constraints. The extended algorithm inherits the performance properties
   of ADQ-PSP and UQ-PSP in terms of both the social welfare maximization
   and the rapid convergence rate.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal expansion effect of silicon nanowires (SiNW) in {[}100],

   contraction effect due to the lowest energy of the bending vibration
   mode which has a negative effect on the coefficient of thermal expansion
   (CTE). The CTE in {[}110] direction is distinctly larger than the other
   two growth directions because of the anisotropy of the bending mode in
   SiNW. Our study reveals that CTE decreases with an increase of the

   proposed early since it can make use of mature lithography technology
   however the quality factor was increased greatly only after the thermal
   reflow process was introduced and single molecule measurement was then
   realized. The biosensor using microring has simpler mode structure and
   materials such as polymer silicon nitride and silicon on insulator had
   been used for sensor fabrication. As a 3 dimension expansion sensor
   using microtube can combine the optical channel and fluidic channel,

   cell lymphoma cells}},
Journal = {{RADIATION ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The microRNA-17-92 (miRNA-17-92) cluster, at chromosome 13q31-q32, also
   known as oncomir-1, consists of seven miRNAs that are transcribed as a
   polycistronic unit. Over-expression of miRNA-17-92 has been observed in
   lymphomas and other solid tumors. Whether miRNA-17-92 expression affects
   the response of tumor cells to radiotherapy is not addressed so far. In
   the present study, we studied the effects of miRNA-17-92 on the
   radiosensitivity of human mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells Z138c.
   Over-expression of miRNA-17-92 significantly increased survival cell
   number, cell proliferation and decreased cell death of human MCL cells
   after different doses of radiation. Immunoblot analysis showed that
   phosphatase and tension homolog (PTEN) and PHLPP2 was down-modulated and
   pAkt activity was enhanced in MCL cells after over-expressing
   miRNA-17-92 after irradiation. These findings are the first direct
   evidence that over-expression of miRNA-17-92 cluster significantly
   increases the radioresistance of human MCL cells, which offers a novel
   target molecule for improving the radiotherapy of MCL in clinic.}},

Abstract = {{The lowest reaction pathway or one of the favored possible paths in the
   CVD process of preparing boron carbides with BCl3-C3H6(propene)-H-2
   precursors was searched theoretically, which involves 95 transition
   states and 103 intermediates. The geometries of the species were
   optimized by employing the B3PW91/6-311G(d,p) method. The transition
   states as well as their linked intermediates were confirmed with
   frequency and the intrinsic reaction coordinates analyses. The energy
   barriers and the reaction energies were evaluated with the accurate
   model chemistry method at G3(MP2) level after a non-dynamical electronic
   correlation detection. The heat capacities and entropies were obtained
   with statistical thermodynamics, and the heat capacities were fitted
   into analytical equations. The Gibbs free energies at 298.15 K for all
   of the reaction steps were reported. The energies at any temperature
   could be derived classically by using the analytical heat capacities.
   All the possible elementary reactions, including both direct
   decomposition and the radical attacking dissociations, for each reaction
   step were examined, and the one with the lowest energy or energy barrier
   was further studied in the next step. It was found that there are 19
   reaction steps in the lowest path to produce the final BC3 cluster
   including two steps of initializing the reaction chain of producing H
   and Cl radicals. The highest energy in the lowest reaction pathway is
   215.1 kJ/mol at 298.15 K and that for 1,200 K is 275.1 kJ/mol. The
   results are comparable with the most recent experimental observation of
   the apparent activation energy 208.7 kJ/mol.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies of hyporheic zone focused largely on the net mass
   transfer of solutes between stream and streambed. Solute transport
   within the bed has attracted less attention. In this study, we combined
   flume experiments and numerical simulations to examine solute transport
   processes in a streambed with periodic bedforms. Solute originating from
   the stream was subjected to advective transport driven by pore water
   circulation due to current-bedform interactions as well as hydrodynamic
   dispersion in the porous bed. The experimental and numerical results
   showed that advection played a dominant role at the early stage of
   solute transport, which took place in the hyporheic zone. Downward
   solute transfer to the deep ambient flow zone was controlled by
   transverse dispersion at the later stage when the elapsed time exceeded
   the advective transport characteristic time t(c) (= L/u(c) with L being
   the bedform length and u(c) the characteristic pore water velocity). The
   advection-based pumping exchange model was found to predict reasonably
   well solute transfer between the overlying water and streambed at the
   early stage but its performance deteriorated at the later stage. With
   dispersion neglected, the pumping exchange model underestimated the
   long-term rate and total mass of solute transfer from the overlying
   water to the bed. Therefore both advective and dispersive transport
   components are essential for quantification of hyporheic exchange
   processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Human melanocytes are not simply pigment-producing cells. It may be part
   of the inflammatory response, during which the pigmentary system may
   produce more melanin or suppress melanization. Toll-like receptors
   (TLRs) have been implicated in both innate host defense against
   pathogens and inflammatory response. Therefore, it may be possible that
   activation of TLRs in melanocytes may play a role in the modulation of
   melanogenesis. In this study, we investigated whether normal human
   melanocytes expressed TLRs and analyzed pigmentation changes upon TLR
   stimulation. The expression of TLR1 similar to 10 mRNA in cultured human
   melanocyte was analyzed using RT-PCR, Western blotting and
   immunocytochemistry. Human melanocytes constitutively express mRNA and
   protein for TLR2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 10. Stimulation of TLR1/2 and 4 with
   Pam3CSK4 and lipopolysaccharide induced pigmentation of melanocytes.
   Activation of TLR5 and 7 with flagellin and imiquimod treatments reduced
   pigmentation of melanocytes and zebrafish. In summary, the results
   provided evidence for TLRs expression in normal human melanocytes. It is
   speculated that a response of melanocyte to TLR ligands may play a role
   in the pigmentary change in the skin. (Ann Dermatol 22(4) 486 similar to

Abstract = {{Overexpression of MDR1 in breast cancer remains a major cause for the
   failure of chemotherapy. In the present report, we find UHRF1 plays an
   important role in inhibiting MDR1 promoter activity by directly binding
   to the MDR1 promoter. Knockdown of UHRF1 activates MDR1 promoter
   activity and expression, attenuates the binding of UHRF1 and HDAC1 to
   the MDR1 promoter. Overexpression of UHRF1 in NCI/ADR-RES cells can
   induce deacetylation of histones H3 and H4 on the MDR1 promoter, which
   is facilitated by recruitment of HDAC1 to the MDR1 promoter. Loss of
   histone acetylation is accompanied by loss of binding of the key

Abstract = {{In this study a central composite design (CCD) was employed to evaluate
   the combined effects of pH hardness and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   on the toxicity of a mixture of Cu(II) and Cr(VI) toward Daphnia magna
   Overall the results showed that increases in pH hardness and DOC
   concentration led to decreased mixture toxicity of Cu(II) and Cr(VI) by
   reducing the concentrations of toxic species such as Cu2+ and HCrO4- In
   addition empirical models for the prediction of 24 h and 48-h
   mortalities of D magna were developed and validated by using three
   different sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) Because the DOMs had
   different Cu(II)-binding capacities the empirical models were revised
   using the ligand concentration of DOMs instead of the DOC concentration
   however the prediction capability of these models did not differ
   significantly These results suggest that it is not likely that the
   chemical property of DOM is important for prediction of the mixture
   toxicity of Cu(II) and Cr(VI) toward D magna when the ligand
   concentration of DOMs greatly exceed the Cu(II) concentration (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Diffuse-type gastric carcinoma is characterized by rapid progression and
   poor prognosis. High expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta
   and thick stromal fibrosis are observed in this type of gastric
   carcinoma. We have previously shown that disruption of TGF-beta
   signaling via introduction of a dominant negative form of the TGF-beta
   type II receptor (dnT beta RII) into diffuse-type gastric cancer cell
   lines, including OCUM-2MLN, caused accelerated tumor growth through
   induction of tumor angiogenesis in vivo. In the present study, we show
   that TGF-beta induces upregulation of expression of tissue inhibitor of
   metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2) in the OCUM-2MLN cell line in vitro, and
   that expression of TIMP2 is repressed by dnT beta RII expression in
   vivo. Transplantation of the OCUM-2MLN cells to nude mice exhibited
   accelerated tumor growth in response to dnT beta RII expression, which
   was completely abolished when TIMP2 was coexpressed with dnT beta RII.
   Although the blood vessel density of TIMP2-expressing tumors was only
   slightly decreased, the degree of hypoxia in tumor tissues was
   significantly increased and pericytes covering tumor vasculature were
   decreased by TIMP2 expression in OCUM-2MLN cells, suggesting that the
   function of tumor vasculatures was repressed by TIMP2 and consequently
   tumor growth was reduced. These findings provide evidence that one of
   the mechanisms of the increase in angiogenesis in diffuse-type gastric
   carcinoma is the downregulation of the anti-angiogenic protein TIMP2.

Abstract = {{Background Peer smoking provides a socially reinforcing context of
   friends' encouragement and approval that contributes to smoking
   behavior. Twin studies show correlations and interactions between peer
   substance use and genetic liability for substance use. However, none
   examined specific genes. Here we test the hypothesis that the nicotinic
   receptor genes CHRNA5 (rs16969968), CHRNA3 (rs578776), CHRNB3
   (rs13277254) and CHRND (rs12466358) modify the risk for nicotine
   dependence associated with peer smoking. Methods Cases of current
   nicotine dependence {[}Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) >=
   4] and smoking-exposed (smoked 100+ cigarettes life-time), but
   non-dependent controls (life-time FTND = 0) came from the Collaborative
   Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence (n = 2038). Peer smoking was
   assessed retrospectively for grades 9-12. Results Peer smoking and the
   four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with
   nicotine dependence. A statistically significant interaction was found
   between peer smoking and rs16969968 (P = 0.0077). Overall risk of
   nicotine dependence was highest for the rs16969968 AA genotype. However,
   variance in nicotine dependence attributable to peer smoking was
   substantially lower among those with the AA genotype at rs16969968 than
   the lower-risk genotypes: AA = 2.5\%, GA/AG = 11.2\%, GG = 14.2\%; P <=
   0.004. Conclusions Peer smoking had a substantially lower effect on
   nicotine dependence among those with the high-risk AA genotype at the
   functional SNP rs16969968 (CHRNA5) than among those with lower-risk
   genotypes. Such results highlight the possibility that given drug
   exposure those with specific genetic risks may be less affected by
   social contexts and intervention strategies focused upon social factors
   could have less influence on those at highest genetic risk.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the level and content of exposure to fine
   particles (PM2.5) among persons who attend fireworks displays and those
   who live nearby. An evaluation of the levels of PM2.5 and their
   elemental content was carried out during the nine launches of the 2007
   Montreal International Fireworks Competition. For each event, a
   prediction of the location of the firework plume was obtained from the
   Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) of the Meteorological Service of
   Canada. PM2.5 was measured continuously with a photometer (Sidepak (TM),
   TSI) within the predicted plume location ({''}predicted sites{''}), and
   integrated samples were collected using portable personal samplers. An
   additional sampler was located on a nearby roof ({''}fixed site{''}).
   The elemental composition of the collected PM2.5 samples from the
   ``predicted sites{''} was determined using both a non-destructive energy
   dispersive ED-XRF method and an ICP-MS method with a near-total
   microwave-assisted acid digestion. The elemental composition of the
   ``fixed site{''} samples was determined by the ICP-MS with the
   near-total digestion method. The highest PM2.5 levels reached nearly 10
   000 mu g m(-3), roughly 1000 times background levels. Elements such as
   K, Cl, Al, Mg and Ti were markedly higher in plume-exposed filters. This
   study shows that 1) persons in the plume and in close proximity to the
   launch site may be exposed to extremely high levels of PM2.5 for the
   duration of the display and, 2) that the plume contains specific
   elements for which little is known of their acute cardio-respiratory
   toxicity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In assessing the safety of engineering systems in the context of
   quantitative risk analysis one of the most important consequence types
   concerns the loss of life due to accidents and disasters. In this paper,
   a general approach for loss of life estimation is proposed which
   includes three elements: (1) the assessment of physical effects
   associated with the event; (2) determination of the number of exposed
   persons (taking into account warning and evacuation); and (3)
   determination of mortality amongst the population exposed. The typical
   characteristics of and modelling approaches for these three elements are
   discussed. This paper focuses on ``small probability-large
   consequences{''} events within the engineering domain. It is
   demonstrated how the proposed approach can be applied to various case
   studies, such as tunnel fires, earthquakes and flood events. (C) 2010

   NS-398), anti-angiogenic agents (thalidomide, SU5416 and ZD6474), a
   vasoactive agent (xanthinol nicotinate), botulinum toxin and carbogen
   breathing. Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI, intrinsic
   susceptibility-weighted (BOLD) MRI and electronic paramagnetic resonance
   (EPR) oximetry all reflect tumor microenvironment hemodynamic variables
   that are known to influence tumor response. Eight MR-derived parameters
   (markers) were tested for their ability to predict therapeutic outcome
   (factor of increase in regrowth delay) in experimental tumor models (TLT
   and FSaII) after radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy with
   cyclophosphamide, namely tumor pO(2) and O-2 consumption rate (using EPR
   oximetry); tumor blood flow and permeability, i.e. V-p, K-trans, K-ep
   and percentage of perfused vessels (using DCE-MRI); and BOLD signal
   intensity and R{*}(2) (using functional MRI). This multi-modal
   comparison of co-treatment efficacy points out the limitations of each
   MR marker and identifies in vivo pO(2) as a relevant endpoint for
   radiation therapy. DCE parameters (V-p and K-ep) were identified as a
   relevant endpoints for cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in our tumor
   models. This study helps qualify relevant imaging endpoints in the
   preclinical setting of cancer therapy. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) as a weight-loss
   nutraceutical continues to be debatable, suggesting that there may be
   value in exploring the physiological effects of the lesser-known
   isomers. The effects of the minor isomer, trans-8, cis-10 (t8,c10)-CLA,
   in the form of an equimolar mixture with the cis-9, trans-11 (c9,t11)
   isomer, on body weight and body composition, circulating glucose and
   lipid concentrations, and liver weights were studied in sixty male
   Syrian golden hamsters. Animals were randomised to receive for 28d a
   semi-purified, hypercholesterolaemic diet (5\% dietary fat and 0.25\%
   cholesterol) supplemented at the 2\% level with either the t8, c10 +
   c9,t11-CLA mixture, c9,t11-CLA or trans-10, cis-12 (t10,c12)-CLA
   replacing lard and safflower-seed oil (control). Results show that
   compared with control, the t8, c10 + c9,t11-CLA mixture and
   t10,c12-CLA-fed animals had lower (P < 0.0001) fat mass following
   supplementation. Animals consuming t10,c12-CLA also possessed higher
   lean mass compared with control and c9,t11-CLA groups (P < 0.001).
   However, the livers of these animals were larger (P < 0.0001) compared
   with those in the control and other CLA groups. Body weights of the
   hamsters did not differ across the experimental groups. CLA treatments
   had no effect on serum glucose or lipid profile, except for inducing
   higher (P < 0.05) non-HDL-cholesterol concentration with t10,c12-CLA
   compared with the c9,t11 isomer. Overall, these results indicate that in
   male hamsters fed a hypercholesterolaemic diet, the t8,c10 + c9,t11-CLA
   mixture does not have an impact on blood lipid profile, but is able to
   effectively reduce fat mass, without incurring an accompanying liver
   enlargement.}},

Abstract = {{Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB)
   signaling pathways control Schwann cells during axonal regeneration in
   an injured peripheral nervous system. We investigated whether a
   persistent supply of recombinant NRG1 to the injury site could improve
   axonal growth and recovery of sensory and motor functions in rats during
   nerve regeneration. We generated a recombinant adenovirus expressing a
   secreted form of EGF-like domain from Heregulin beta (sHRG beta E-Ad).
   This virus, sHRG beta E-Ad allowed for the secretion of 30-50 ng of
   small sHRG beta E peptides per 10(7-8) virus particle outside cells and
   was able to phosphorylate ErbB receptors. Transduction of the
   concentrated sHRG beta E-Ad into an axotomy model of sciatic nerve
   damage caused an effective promotion of nerve regeneration, as shown by
   histological features of the axons and Schwann cells, as well as
   increased expression of neurofilaments, GAP43 and S100 in the distal
   stump of the injury site. This result is consistent with longer axon
   lengths and thicker calibers observed in the sHRG beta E-Ad treated
   animals. Furthermore, sensory and motor functions were significantly
   improved in sHRG beta E-Ad treated animals when evaluated by a
   behavioral test. These results suggest a therapeutic potential for sHRG
   beta E-Ad in treatment of peripheral nerve injury.}},

Abstract = {{A combination of an alkyd resin with a melamine-formaldehyde resin gives
   a cured enamel film with the flexibility of the alkyd constituent and
   the high chemical resistance and hardness of the melamine resin at the
   same time. The melamine resin is a minor constituent and plays the role
   of a crosslinking agent. In this paper, alkyd resins of high hydroxyl
   numbers based on trimethylolpropane, ricinoleic acid and phthalic
   anhydride were synthesized. Two alkyds having 30 and 40 mass\% of
   ricinoleic acid were formulated by calculation on alkyd constant. Alkyds
   were characterized by FTIR and by the determination of acid and hydroxyl
   numbers. Then synthesized alkyds were made into baking enamels by mixing
   with melamine-formaldehyde resins (weight ratio of 70:30 based on dried
   mass). Two types of commercial melamine resins were used:
   threeisobutoxymethyl melamine-formaldehyde resin (TIMMF) and
   hexamethoxymethyl melamine resin (HMMMF). Prepared alkyd/melamine resin
   mixtures were cured in a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) under
   non-isothermal mode. Apparent degree of curing as a function of
   temperature was calculated from the curing enthalpies. Kinetic
   parameters of curing were calculated using Freeman-Carroll method. TIMMF
   resin is more reactive with synthesized alkyds than HMMMF resin which
   was expected. Alkyd resin with 30 mass\% of ricinoleic acid is slightly
   more reactive than alkyd with 40 mass\% of ricinoleic acid, probably
   because it has the high contents of free hydroxyl and acid groups. The
   gel content, T(g), thermal stability, hardness, elasticity and impact
   resistance of coated films cured at 150 degrees C for 60 min were
   measured. Cured films show good thermal stability since the onset of
   films thermal degradation determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
   is observed at temperatures ranging from 281 to 329 degrees C. Films
   based on alkyd 30 are more thermally stable than those based on alkyd
   40, with the same melamine resin. The type of alkyd resin has no
   significant effect on the gel content and the hardness of film. The
   hardness of cured film increases with the increase of T(g). The values
   of the film elasticities are satisfied for all prepared samples and are
   independent on the type of alkyd or melamine resin. The impact
   resistances of coated films are very high.}},

Abstract = {{The motility of the worm nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is investigated
   in shallow, wet granular media as a function of particle size dispersity
   and area density (phi). Surprisingly, we find that the nematode's
   propulsion speed is enhanced by the presence of particles in a fluid and
   is nearly independent of area density. The undulation speed, often used
   to differentiate locomotion gaits, is significantly affected by the bulk
   material properties of wet mono-and polydisperse granular media for phi
   >= 0.55. This difference is characterized by a change in the nematode's
   waveform from swimming to crawling in dense polydisperse media only.
   This change highlights the organism's adaptability to subtle differences

Abstract = {{Colour polymorphism has often been described among individuals of
   deceptive orchid species, and several studies have investigated
   reproductive success variations among colour morphs. However, whether
   colour morphs differed in other traits has received little attention in
   previous studies. Here, we report the case of a tropical deceptive
   orchid in Reunion Island that exhibits three different colour varieties.
   We investigated patterns of trait variation among colour varieties and
   found significant differences in floral and inflorescence morphology.
   Interestingly, we found that most populations included only individuals
   of a single variety, and that strong differences exist among varieties
   in spatial distribution and flowering phenology. This situation differs
   from previously reported cases of floral polymorphism in deceptive
   orchids where colour morphs co-occur and flower in the same populations.
   The spatio-temporal variation in flowering suggests that colour
   varieties have independent reproductive ecologies and are adapted to
   local conditions. We propose that potential variations in pollinator
   species abundance or diversity and the co-occurrence of nectar-producing
   species in the community may have driven the adaptation of each variety
   to its current pollination niche.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetational and depositional environmental changes were interpreted
   from a trench in ca. 10 000 cal BP sediments in the Pyeongtaek wetland,
   Korea, based on palynomorph and grain size analysis. From ca. 10
   400-8000 cal BP, cool, dry, temperate conditions encouraged
   Quercus-dominated deciduous broadleaved forest, with conifers and
   cool-tolerant birch prevailing on hills and in mountainous areas as
   postglacial warming began. Halophytic Chenopodiaceae pollen and marine
   dinoflagellates indicate the depositional environment was an intertidal
   flat. Conditions became warm and wet between ca. 8000 and ca. 6000 cal
   BP: areas still contained Quercus-dominated deciduous broadleaved forest
   but with decreased conifers and cool-tolerant birch. The absence of
   marine dinoflagellates and abundant meso- to hypersaline salt marshes of
   Gramineae, with a later increase of mesosaline Cyperaceae marshes,
   indicate a transition from intertidal flat to freshwater swamp. From ca.
   6000 to ca. 4500 cal BP, Quercus-dominated forests were replaced by
   mixed conifer-deciduous broadleaved forests under climatic
   deterioration. Aquatic genera and freshwater algae indicate that the
   study area completely changed to freshwater swamp. The directional
   sequence in relative abundance of taxa (maximum percentage of pollen of
   Chenopodiaceae followed by Gramineae, Cyperaceae, and aquatics) suggests
   a gradational pattern indicative of marked environmental dines typical
   of intertidal habitats. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper discusses how to maximize the drive force produced by an
   upwind sail. It aims to provide a better understanding of the behavior
   of this force as a function of the heel angle of the yacht and the wind
   speed. It also discusses the corresponding optimal spanwise loading
   distributions. An extended lifting line code, based on Weissinger's
   method, is developed to analyze the performance of an isolated mainsail
   in upwind conditions. It is extended to account for the heel angle of
   the yacht via effective angle theory, and an image sail is used to model
   the influence of the sea surface. Profile drag is modeled using
   experimental data. The extended lifting line code is validated against
   wind-tunnel measurements and data from the literature. A second code is
   then used to optimize the spanwise loading on a mainsail such that the
   drive force is maximized. Constraints are implemented to ensure positive
   circulation over the entire span and to limit the sectional loading to
   realistic values. Finally, the extended lifting line code is inverted to
   calculate the twist distribution necessary to produce the desired,
   optimized loading distribution for a given sail planform. The calculated
   twist distribution is found to be realistic and achievable.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental contaminants can disrupt interactions between aquatic

   two aspects the importance of lateral line in the predator and whether
   the absence of light modifies predation rates and the effect of a sub
   lethal concentration of fenitrothion on both predator and prey Eels were
   tested under two sensory conditions (lateral line intact and lateral
   line blocked by cobalt chloride) in dark conditions Predation rates were
   evaluated using different treatments that combined predator and prey
   exposed or not to insecticide Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and
   butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities were also measured in muscle
   samples of eels and tadpoles to explore whether fenitrothion affects
   predator and prey differentially Marbled swamp eels were more efficient
   in feeding on tadpoles during the night than during the day showing that
   lateral line makes an important contribution to prey detection and
   capture Regarding pesticide effects short-term (6 h) exposure to an
   ecologically relevant fenitrothion dose of 2 5 mg L-1 altered the
   predator-prey relationship by changing prey behaviour reducing prey
   detection and therefore increasing tadpole survival At this
   concentration the outcome of the predator-prey relationship appears
   biased in favor of the exposed tadpoles which were released from
   predation risk despite their altered behaviour and the higher inhibition
   percentages of tail BChE (70\%) and AChE (51\%) than in control
   individuals Our study involving these model species and agrochemicals
   demonstrates that fenitrothion affected the outcome of a predator-prey

   native amphibians to investigate the nature of the mechanisms

Title = {{Effects of Groundwater Development on Uranium: Central Valley,

Abstract = {{Uranium (U) concentrations in groundwater in several parts of the
   eastern San Joaquin Valley, California, have exceeded federal and state
   drinking water standards during the last 20 years. The San Joaquin
   Valley is located within the Central Valley of California and is one of
   the most productive agricultural areas in the world. Increased
   irrigation and pumping associated with agricultural and urban
   development during the last 100 years have changed the chemistry and
   magnitude of groundwater recharge, and increased the rate of downward
   groundwater movement. Strong correlations between U and bicarbonate
   suggest that U is leached from shallow sediments by high bicarbonate
   water, consistent with findings of previous work in Modesto, California.
   Summer irrigation of crops in agricultural areas and, to lesser extent,
   of landscape plants and grasses in urban areas, has increased Pco(2)
   concentrations in the soil zone and caused higher temperature and
   salinity of groundwater recharge. Coupled with groundwater pumping, this
   process, as evidenced by increasing bicarbonate concentrations in
   groundwater over the last 100 years, has caused shallow, young
   groundwater with high U concentrations to migrate to deeper parts of the
   groundwater system that are tapped by public-supply wells. Continued
   downward migration of U-affected groundwater and expansion of urban
   centers into agricultural areas will likely be associated with increased
   U concentrations in public-supply wells. The results from this study
   illustrate the potential long-term effects of groundwater development
   and irrigation-supported agriculture on water quality in arid and
   semiarid regions around the world.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Metabolic syndrome is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular
   disease. SHRSP.Z-Leprfa/IzmDmcr (SHRSP fatty) rat, established as a new
   rat model of metabolic syndrome, spontaneously develops obesity, severe
   hypertension and shows hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia and
   abnormal glucose tolerance. Using SHRSP fatty rats, we examined whether
   or not oxidative stress was correlated with vascular dysfunction in
   small and large calibre coronary arteries in ex vivo beating hearts,
   isolated mesenteric arteries and aortas in comparison with normal rats,
   Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Vasodilation of coronary arteries was
   determined by microangiography of the Langendorff heart.
   2. Compared with WKY, acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside
   (SNP)-induced relaxations were impaired in the coronary arteries of
   SHRSP fatty rats. The mesenteric arteries and aorta of SHRSP fatty rats
   showed impaired relaxation responses to ACh and SNP, decreased
   3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) production, and reduced soluble guanylyl
   cyclase protein expression. Superoxide release, angiotensin II and
   3-nitrotyrosine contents were increased.
   3. SHRSP fatty rats were orally administered olmesartan, an angiotensin
   II receptor type 1 (AT(1)) antagonist, and amlodipine, a calcium channel
   blocker, at doses of 5 and 8 mg/kg per day, respectively, for 8 weeks.
   Both olmesartan and amlodipine reduced blood pressure, but only
   olmesartan prevented the development of abnormal vascular and
   biochemical parameters in the SHRSP fatty rats.
   4. The results showed that in the SHRSP fatty rats, the impaired nitric
   oxide- and cGMP-mediated relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells were
   linked to AT(1) receptor-induced oxidative-nitrative stress, which
   occurred concurrently with severe hypertension and metabolic
   abnormalities in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. PET with a novel tracer, L-{[}3-F-18]-alpha-methyl tyrosine
   (F-18-FMT), has been studied in lung cancer. We evaluated 18F-FMT PET
   for therapy response in comparison with F-18-FDG PET.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Eighteen patients with lung cancer underwent PET
   studies with F-18-FMT and FDG before and after chemoradiotherapy. Uptake
   of tracers was measured by standardized uptake value (SUV) in the
   primary tumor and the mediastinal lymph node. The ratio of the lymph
   node maximum SUV (SUVmax) to that of the primary tumor and the SUVmax of
   the primary tumor itself were correlated with the survival time
   estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Metabolic response, as determined by
   the changes in the tracer uptake, was compared with Response Evaluation
   Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) for therapy response.
   RESULTS. Agreement of therapeutic response evaluated by RECIST was noted
   in 10 (56\%) of 18 patients evaluated with FDG PET and in 16 (89\%) of
   18 patients evaluated with F-18-FMT PET (p = 0.025). In nine patients
   with partial response, partial metabolic response was observed in eight
   (89\%) by use of FDG PET and in nine (100\%) by use of F-18-FMT PET. In
   nine patients with stable disease, stable metabolic disease was observed
   in two (22\%) by use of FDG PET and in seven (78\%) by use of F-18-FMT
   PET (p = 0.056). Fluorine-18-FMT PET revealed that the prognosis of the
   group with a lymph node-to-primary tumor SUVmax ratio greater than or
   equal to 1 was significantly better than that in the group with a ratio
   of less than 1.
   CONCLUSION. Fluorine-18-FMT is a promising PET tracer for monitoring
   response to chemoradiotherapy and for predicting the prognosis of
   patients with lung cancer.}},

Abstract = {{AC losses in a superconductor strip are numerically evaluated by means
   of a finite element method formulated with a current vector potential.
   The expressions of AC losses in an infinite slab that corresponds to a
   simple model of infinitely stacked strips are also derived
   theoretically. It is assumed that the voltage-current characteristics of
   the superconductors are represented by Bean's critical state model. The
   typical operation pattern of a Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage
   (SMES) coil with direct and alternating transport currents in an
   external AC magnetic field is taken into account as the electromagnetic
   environment for both the single strip and the infinite slab. By using
   the obtained results of AC losses, the influences of the transport
   currents on the total losses are discussed quantitatively. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{A number of conflicting claims have been advanced regarding the role of
   the left inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobe and posterior
   middle temporal gyrus in action recognition, driven in part by an
   ongoing debate about the capacities of putative mirror systems that
   match observed and planned actions. We report data from 43 left
   hemisphere stroke patients in two action recognition tasks in which they
   heard and saw an action word ('hammering') and selected from two
   videoclips the one corresponding to the word. In the spatial recognition
   task, foils contained errors of body posture or movement
   amplitude/timing. In the semantic recognition task, foils were
   semantically related (sawing). Participants also performed a
   comprehension control task requiring matching of the same verbs to
   objects (hammer). Using regression analyses controlling for both the
   comprehension control task and lesion volume, we demonstrated that
   performance in the semantic gesture recognition task was predicted by
   per cent damage to the posterior temporal lobe, whereas the spatial
   gesture recognition task was predicted by per cent damage to the
   inferior parietal lobule. A whole-brain voxel-based lesion
   symptom-mapping analysis suggested that the semantic and spatial gesture
   recognition tasks were associated with lesioned voxels in the posterior
   middle temporal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule, respectively. The
   posterior middle temporal gyrus appears to serve as a central node in
   the association of actions and meanings. The inferior parietal lobule,
   held to be a homologue of the monkey parietal mirror neuron system, is
   critical for encoding object-related postures and movements, a
   relatively circumscribed aspect of gesture recognition. The inferior
   frontal gyrus, on the other hand, was not predictive of performance in
   any task, suggesting that previous claims regarding its role in action
   recognition may require refinement.}},

Abstract = {{An expert work group with 7 members was formed under the cosponsorship
   of 5 U.S. federal agencies to identify common data elements for research
   related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The work group reviewed
   both previous and contemporary measurement standardization efforts for
   PTSD research and engaged in a series of electronic and live discussions
   to address a set of predefined aims. Eight construct domains relevant to
   PTSD were identified: (1) traditional demographics, (2) exposure to
   stressors and trauma, (3) potential stress moderators, (4) trauma
   assessment, (5) PTSD screening, (6) PTSD symptoms and diagnosis, (7)
   PTSD-related functioning and disability, and (8) mental health history.
   Measures assigned to the core data elements category have relatively low
   time-and-effort costs in order to make them potentially applicable
   across a wide range of studies for which PTSD is a relevant condition.
   Measures assigned to the supplemental data elements category have
   greater costs but generally demonstrate stronger psychometric
   performance and provide more extensive information. Accordingly,
   measures designated as supplemental are recommended instead of or in
   addition to corresponding core measures whenever resources and study
   design allow. The work group offered 4 caveats that highlight potential
   limitations and emphasize the voluntary nature of standardization for
   PTSD-related measurement.}},

Abstract = {{A reliable and practical CYP3A induction assay with cryopreserved human
   hepatocytes in a 96-well format was developed. Various 96-well plates
   with different basement membrane were evaluated using prototypical
   inducers, rifampicin, phenytoin, and carbamazepine. Thin-layer (TL)
   Matrigel was found to yield the highest basal and induced levels of
   CYP3A activity as determined by testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation.
   Concentration-dependent CYP3A induction of rifampicin was reproducible
   with the EC(50) values of 0.36 +/- 0.28 mu M from four batches of human
   hepatocytes using the 96-well plate with TL Matrigel. The rank order of
   induction potency for nine inducers or noninducers at a concentration of
   10 mu M were well comparable among the multiple donors, by expressing
   the results as percentage of change compared with the positive control,
   10 mu M rifampicin. Cotreatment of avasimibe or efavirenz with 10 mu M
   rifampicin was found to reduce CYP3A activities induced by rifampicin at
   a lower rate than treatment with rifampicin alone, whereas treatment
   with phenobarbital and carbamazepine had no effect. From a comparison of
   induced CYP3A activities and gene expression levels, there were
   compounds that would cause induction of CYP3A4 mRNA but not activity,
   presumably due to their inhibitory effect on CYP3A activity. The
   cotreatment assay of test compound with rifampicin allows us to exclude
   the false-negative results caused by the cytotoxicity and/or the
   mechanism-based inactivation, when the drug candidate's ability for
   CYP3A induction is evaluating the enzyme activity. This 96-well plate
   assay, which is robust, reproducible, and convenient, has demonstrated
   the paramount applicability to the early drug discovery stage.}},

Abstract = {{Human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) proviral load (VL) is an
   important determinant of viral pathogenesis and malignant evolution.
   Although VL has been quantified by in-house real-time quantifiable
   polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technology, little is known about the
   harmonization among different VL assay systems. We evaluated intra- and
   inter-laboratory variability of VL measured at six laboratories using
   the same DNA samples seropositive for HTLV-1 in a two-step manner. The
   first study measured 60 samples by original in-house assays, finding
   that the median intra- and inter-laboratory coefficient of variation
   (CV) was 44.9\% (range, 25.4-71.8\%) and 59.9\% (34.2-93.4\%),
   respectively. The inter-laboratory correlation coefficients ranged from
   0.760 to 0.875, indicating that VL were measured with good precision in
   each laboratory, but inter-laboratory regression slopes differed from
   0.399 to 2.206, indicating that VL were measured with a wide variation
   between laboratories. To examine the effect of standardization of
   reference materials (RM) on the VL variability, we performed a second
   study using only 20 samples by substituting RM for plasmid including the
   HTLV-1 pX region. The median inter-laboratory CV for raw pX copy number
   was reduced significantly from 66.9\% to 35.7\%, whereas the median CV
   for the internal control remained almost unchanged, resulting in no
   improvement in inter-laboratory CV for VL. This indicates that each
   in-house assay system worked well with good precision, but standardizing
   RM alone was insufficient for harmonization. The relevant choice of not
   only RM, but also internal control genes for data normalization is
   expected to be realistic to standardize HTLV-1 VL measurement. (Cancer
   Sci 2010; 101: 2361-2367).}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To measure intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation 6 and 24 hours
   after phacoemulsification in patients with glaucoma and to investigate
   the efficacy of brimonidine tartrate 0.2\% in preventing IOP rise on the
   first postoperative day following cataract surgery.
   METHODS. In this prospective randomized single-masked study, 86 eyes of
   78 patients with well-controlled open-angle glaucoma were scheduled for
   phacoemulsification surgery. Patients were randomly assigned into 2
   groups. Group A received 1 drop of brimonidine tartrate 0.2\% and group
   B, which served as a control group, received 1 drop of artificial tears.
   Intraocular pressure was measured at baseline, before surgery, and 6 and
   24 hours postoperatively.
   RESULTS. Within each group, we found a statistically significant
   difference in IOP between baseline and 6 hours postoperatively (p<0.01)
   and between 6 and 24 hours (p<0.01). There was no statistically
   significant difference between baseline IOP and 24-hour values.
   Comparing the 2 groups, there was no statistically significant
   difference in preoperative and 24-hour postoperative IOP. Six hours
   after surgery, the mean IOP in the brimonidine group was 18.52 +/- 4.58
   mmHg, compared with 20.86 +/- 3.79 mmHg in the control group. Treatment
   with brimonidine tartrate 0.2\% significantly reduced postoperative IOP
   elevation 6 hours following cataract extraction (p=0.009).
   CONCLUSIONS. Patients with medically well-controlled glaucoma may
   experience a substantial increase in IOP shortly after
   phacoemulsification surgery. Instillation of brimonidine tartrate 0.2\%,
   although it significantly reduced IOP elevation following cataract
   operation, did not completely prevent IOP spikes.}},

Abstract = {{Ante- and postpartum antioxidative/oxidative profiles in blood plasma of
   cows with and without retained placental membranes (RFM) were
   investigated. Twenty-two healthy pregnant cows were included in the
   study. Seven animals out of 22 suffered from obtained at 4, 3, 2, 1
   weeks and 5 days antepartum (a.p.), at parturition and 1, 3, and 5 weeks
   postpartum. The following antioxidative parameters were measured using
   spectrophotometric methods: total antioxidant activity (TAC),
   beta-carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, and ceruloplasmin. The oxidative
   profile was based on the content of intermediates and end products of
   lipid and protein peroxidative processes which were measured by
   spectrophotometric and spectrofluorimetric methods. The examined
   parameters revealed a dynamic profile within the experimental period.
   The highest antioxidant and oxidant activity was noted at 2 and 1 week
   a.p. with a drop towards parturition suggesting the presence of
   oxidative stress during this time period and an apparent appropriate
   metabolic response of the macroorganism. Except for TAC and vitamin A,
   the contents of oxidative and antioxidative blood constituents did not
   differ between cows with and without RFM. A TAC and vitamin A by time
   interaction indicated higher antepartal concentrations of TAC and
   vitamin A in cows without RFM than in cows with RFM suggesting a
   possible role of antioxidative/oxidative imbalances in the aetiology of
   RFM. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an innovative design methodology is proposed for
   production by azeotropic distillation using self-heat recuperation
   technology to reduce energy consumption Based on this design
   methodology, the heat of the distillate and condenser in each
   distillation column is recovered by compressors and exchanged with the
   heat of the corresponding feed and reboiler Hence, a larger amount of
   heat, which consists of the sensible heat and latent heat of the process
   streams, is circulated within the process than that in a conventional
   azeotropic distillation process by the heat exchanger, leading to a
   significant reduction in the process energy required Process simulation
   results for bioethanol production show that the azeotropic distillation
   process resulting from the proposed design methodology achieves a large
   reduction in energy compared to a conventional azeotropic distillation
   process}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To analyze the number of surgeries performed in outpatient
   surgical center at a university hospital and to assess its financial
   viability during and after the interruption of the Cataract National
   Campaign in 2006.
   Methods: Retrospective analytical study between 2005 and 2009 at the
   Clinical Hospital of the University of Sao Paulo (HC-FMUSP) which
   evaluated the economic viability of the outpatient surgical center, the
   number of cataract surgeries performed and the number of surgeons
   present daily in that unit.
   Results: It would be necessary to perform at least 400 procedures
   monthly to ensure the financial viability of the outpatient surgical
   center. This number was lower than the expected in the years of 2008 and
   2009 (average of 370.6 and 390.1 surgeries respectively). The number of
   cataract fellows decreased from 13 in 2005 to 3 in 2009.
   Conclusion: The main factor for the reduction in the number of cataract
   surgeries performed in the outpatient surgical center after 2006 was the
   difficulty of access of the population to the hospital due to
   restrictions on the development of screening projects. The increased use
   of the operating rooms by other clinics and the decrease in the
   admission of new surgeons, made the outpatient surgical center
   appropriate and viable for the new political-economic reality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines host governments' motivation for restricting
   ownership shares of multinational firms (MNFs) in foreign direct
   investment (FDI) projects. An MNF with a productivity advantage is
   willing to invest in a host country. The host government wants to
   capture the MNF's surplus yet cannot observe it due to the MNF's private
   information about its firm-specific advantage. In contrast, a joint
   venture (JV) partner might observe this surplus depending on its
   ownership share. The host government can alleviate its informational
   constraints by using ownership restrictions to force a JV. This calls
   into question the wisdom of calls for `liberalizing' FDI flows by the
   wholesale elimination of domestic JV requirements. We show that the
   optimal mechanism involves ownership restrictions that decrease as the
   size of the MNF's firm-specific advantage increases. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Despite the rather large literature concerning emotional intelligence,
   the vast majority of studies concerning development and validation of
   emotional intelligence scales have been done in the Western countries.
   Hence, a major limitation in this literature is its decidedly Western
   focus. The aim of this research was to assess the psychometric
   properties of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test
   (MSCEIT) in a cross-cultural comparative context involving the
   collectivist Pakistani (Eastern culture) and the individualist French
   (Western culture) students. With the exception of significant mean
   differences on the MSCEIT scores between two cultures, the results
   concerning the validity of the MSCEIT generalized nicely across both
   cultures. The results from multisample analysis revealed that the MSCEIT
   has the property of factorial invariance across both cultures, including
   invariance of factor loadings, unique variances, and factor variance.
   For both Pakistani and French students, the MSCEIT scores were
   distinguishable from the Big Five personality dimensions, self-report
   emotional intelligence measures, and cognitive intelligence.
   Furthermore, in both cultures, the MSCEIT scores failed to demonstrate
   incremental validity against well-being measures, after controlling for
   cognitive intelligence and the Big Five personality dimensions. Finally,
   within each sample, females significantly scored higher than males on
   the MSCEIT total scores.}},

Abstract = {{Reaching out to pick up an object seems a trivial matter, but selecting
   the appropriate hand configuration requires a series of complex
   computations that process the object's dimensions, orientation and
   environment. A current debate in motor control concerns how and when the
   motor system responds to unexpected changes in the visual and spatial
   properties of objects to be grasped. In the current experiment, visual
   manipulations that increased either target size, distractor proximity or
   hand size were applied gradually and continuously throughout reach to
   grasp movements. All manipulations were associated with early and
   continuous modifications of the grasping component, but only an increase
   in hand size affected transport characteristics. This suggests that
   visual information of both the object and the effector are continuously
   processed in movement computations, in keeping with models of motor
   control that posit high weighting for online sensory feedback. (C) 2010

   different crystallization behavior depending on the Zr/Ti ratio. With
   increasing film thickness, the average grain size of Pb(Zr1-x Ti (x)
   )O-3 increases. An unusually large grain size of 1-3 mu m together with
   a strong (001)/(100) preferred orientation were observed for the
   heterolayered PZ(70)T(30), whereby Pb(Zr0.7Ti0.3)O-3 was used as the
   seeding layer, for film as thin as 150 nm. The film microstructure is
   refined drastically when the stacking sequence is changed, i.e., when
   Pb(Zr0.3Ti0.7)O-3 is employed as the seeding layer. Thermal treatment of
   the PZ(70)T(30) seeding layer also plays an important function in the
   microstructure development of the heterolayered PZ(70)T(30) film. The
   formation of the large-grained film is correlated to the lowered
   nucleation energy of crystallizing Pb(Zr0.7Ti0.3)O-3 by the top
   Pb(Zr0.3Ti0.7)O-3. The Pb(Zr0.3Ti0.7)O-3 layer facilitated the
   nucleation and crystallization of the Pb(Zr0.7Ti0.3)O-3 amorphous
   seeding layer, whereby the overall microstructure of the heterolayered
   thin film was dictated by the Pb(Zr0.7Ti0.3)O-3 seeding layer leading to
   the growth of larger PZT grains.}},

Abstract = {{Background Biopsy tissue can be obtained through a fine needle, a wider
   coring needle, or through an open surgical incision. Though much
   literature exists regarding the diagnostic yield of these techniques
   individually, none compare accuracy of diagnosis in the same mass.
   Questions/purposes We asked how the diagnostic accuracy of fine-needle
   aspiration, core biopsy, and open surgical biopsy compare in regard to
   identifying malignancy, establishing the exact diagnosis, and guiding
   the appropriate treatment of soft tissue masses.
   Patients and Methods We prospectively studied 57 patients with palpable
   extremity soft tissue masses, performing fine-needle aspiration,
   followed by core biopsy, followed by surgical biopsy of the same mass.
   Results Open surgical biopsy was 100\% accurate on all accounts. With
   regard to determining malignancy, fineneedle aspiration and core biopsy
   had 79.17\% and 79.2\% sensitivity, 72.7\% and 81.8\% specificity,
   67.9\% and 76\% positive predictive value, 82.8\% and 84.4\% negative
   predictive value, and an overall accuracy of 75.4\% and 80.7\%,
   respectively. In regard to determining exact diagnosis, fineneedle
   aspiration had a 33.3\% accuracy and core biopsy had a 45.6\% accuracy.
   With regard to eventual treatment, fine-needle aspiration was 38.6\%
   accurate and core biopsy was 49.1\% accurate.
   Conclusions In soft tissue mass diagnosis, core biopsy is more accurate
   than fine-needle aspiration on all accounts, and open biopsy is more
   accurate than both in determining malignancy, establishing the exact
   diagnosis, and the guiding appropriate treatment.}},

Abstract = {{A complex treatment of agricultural waste including the following major
   steps: anaerobic fermentation of suitable waste, cogeneration of the
   obtained biogas and growth of microalgae consuming the CO2 from biogas
   and flue gas was verified under field conditions in a pilot-scale
   photobioreactor. The growth kinetics of microalgae Chlorella sp.
   consuming mixture of air and carbon dioxide (2\% (v/v) of CO2), or flue
   gas (8-10\% (v/v) of CO2) was investigated. The results obtained in the
   pilot photobioreactor were compared with results previously measured in
   laboratory photobioreactors. The field tests were performed in a
   pilot-scale outdoor solar-bubbled photobioreactor located at a biogas
   station. The pilot-scale photobioreactor was in the shape of a flat and
   narrow vertical prism with a volume of 300 L. The microalgae growth
   rates were correlated with empirical formulas. Laboratory analyses of
   the produced microalgae confirmed that it meets the strict EU criteria

   from cogeneration therefore was not found to be detrimental to the
   quality of microalgal biomass, and may be used in these types of

Abstract = {{Motivation: Finding functionally analogous enzymes based on the local

   use templates of local structures to search for analogous sites, but

   Results: The automatic selection of atoms so that site matches can be
   discriminated from mismatches. The algorithm provides not only good
   predictions, but also some insights into which atoms are important for
   the prediction. Our experimental results suggest that the metric
   learning automatically provides more effective templates than those

Abstract = {{Pulmonary fibrosis is a common feature of a large group of lung
   diseases. The molecular mechanisms underlying pulmonary fibrosis and the
   key macromolecules involved are not fully understood yet. In an effort
   to better understand aspects of pulmonary fibrosis, the established
   bleomycin injection model in mice was used and the focus of the present
   study was on integrin-linked kinase (ILK) expression. ILK is an
   intracellular protein involved in the regulation of integrin-mediated
   processes. In fibrosis, ILK has been examined in the kidney and in the
   liver where it mediates epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
   hepatic stellate cell activation, respectively. However, information on
   ILK's involvement in lung fibrosis is missing. In order to examine ILK's
   role in pulmonary fibrosis, we used both an in vivo and an in vitro
   approach. In vivo, the bleomycin model was used in order to examine
   ILK's expression and localization in the fibrotic lung. In vitro,
   transforming growth factor-beta 1 was used to induce fibrotic
   characteristics and EMT in alveolar epithelial cells. ILK's role in
   alveolar EMT was studied by siRNA. Our results demonstrate that in the
   animal model used, ILK exhibits a decrease in expression at early stages
   of the fibrotic process and that a specific subset of fibroblasts is
   expressing ILK. The in vitro experiments suggested that ILK is not
   directly involved in E-cadherin downregulation and initiation of EMT (as
   is the case in renal fibrosis) but is involved in upregulation of
   vimentin. These results suggest that ILK is involved in lung fibrosis in
   a tissue-specific manner and raise the possibility to use it as a
   specific therapeutic target for lung fibrosis in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Background: A high surgical technique is required for laparoscopic
   anterior resection using single-incision laparoscopic surgery such as
   multiport surgery. We report a novel surgical technique of umbilical
   incision laparoscopic surgery with one assist port which could be
   performed like conventional multiport surgery. Methods: With the patient
   in the lithotomy position, a 3-cm longitudinal skin incision is made at
   the umbilicus and carried down to the peritoneum. A 12-mm and two 5-mm
   trocars are placed through the incision. Another 12-mm trocar is placed
   for the insertion of laparoscopic coagulation shears and a stapler in
   the right lower quadrant. After surgery, the trocar in the right lower
   quadrant is removed and a drain is replaced through the insertion site.
   The operator mainly uses two trocars, a 5-mm trocar placed at the
   umbilicus and a 12-mm trocar in the right lower quadrant, making it like
   conventional laparoscopic surgery. Results: The median operation time
   was 195 (range 180-205) min, intraoperative blood loss was 20 (range
   0-60) ml, and none of the 3 patients had any complications
   postoperatively. Conclusion: As opposed to surgery with only three
   ports, so-called single-incision laparoscopic surgery, this operation
   can be performed much more comfortably if another port is inserted in
   the right lower quadrant. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{Background: Kawasaki disease (KD) causes systemic vasculitis and
   coronary aneurysms. It frequently results in electrocardiographic (ECG)
   abnormalities of short duration. Cardiac sequelae persist beyond the
   acute stage in a few patients. There are many areas to be investigated
   concerning the effects on the vascular system of patients suffering from
   KD and its sequelae.
   Methods: The cumulative incidences of KD and its cardiac sequelae were
   calculated in birth-year cohorts, using data obtained from KD nationwide
   surveys. The results were compared with the prevalence of ECG
   abnormalities detected in cardiac examinations conducted at primary and
   secondary schools for each birth-year cohort. This comparison allowed
   observation of relationships in these trends for each birth-year cohort.
   Results: The cumulative incidence of late-stage cardiac sequelae
   gradually declined. However, there were increases in the cumulative
   incidence of ECG abnormalities and in the cumulative incidences of KD
   and acute-stage cardiac disorders related to KD.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that even among children without late
   cardiac sequelae, KD can have a persistent effect on the cardiovascular
   system. It thus appears necessary to extend clinical observation of
   children with a history of KD, even if they developed only acute-stage
   cardiac lesions.}},

Abstract = {{CuS flower-like microspheres with the diameter of about 3 similar to 4
   mu m constructed by nanoflakes with thickness of about 30 similar to 40
   nm have been successfully synthesized by a simple wet chemical method.
   In this reaction system, Poly(ethylene glycol) 200 (PEG 200) was used as
   solvent, CuCl2 center dot 2H(2)O as cuprum source, and thioacetamide
   (TAA) as sulfur source. The products were characterized by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and
   high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in detail. The
   XRD patterns revealed that the products were pure hexagonal phase of
   CuS. Experiments with various parameters indicated that the reaction
   temperature and molar ratio of CuCl2 center dot 2H(2)O to thioacetamide
   had strong effects on the sizes and morphologies of CuS crystals. A
   possible growth mechanism on the formation of CuS microspheres was
   proposed. The PEG 200 acted as solvent, complexing agent, and soft
   template in this synthesis. Furthermore, optical studies of the products
   including UV Vis absorption spectrum and photoluminescence spectrum have
   also been carried out.}},

Abstract = {{The magnetic dipole transitions between the vector mesons B{*} (c) and

   B{*} (c) (2S), B (c) (3S), B{*} (c) (3S) etc., the binding states of (c
   (b) over bar) system) of the B (c) family are interesting. The
   `hyperfine' splitting due to spin-spin interaction is an important topic
   for understanding the spin-spin interaction and the spectrum of the the
   (c (b) over bar) binding system. The knowledge about the magnetic dipole
   transitions is also very useful for identifying the vector boson B{*}
   (c) mesons experimentally, whose masses are just slightly above the
   masses of their relevant pseudoscalar mesons B (c) . Considering the
   possibility to observe the vector mesons via the transitions at Z (0)
   factory and the potential use of the theoretical estimate on the
   transitions, we fucus our efforts on calculating the magnetic dipole
   transitions, i.e. a precise calculation of the rates for the transitions
   such as decays B{*} (c) -> B (c) gamma and B{*} (c) -> B (c) e (+) e
   (-), and particularly work in the Bethe-Salpeter framework. As a typical

Abstract = {{Objective. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes as well as heme
   oxygenase 1 gene (HMOX1) encode enzymes that detoxify carcinogens and
   protect against oxidative stress. This study was undertaken to examine
   the impact of gene-smoking interactions on susceptibility to rheumatoid
   arthritis (RA).
   Methods. Caucasian patients with RA and matched control subjects (n =
   549 each) were selected from the Nurses' Health Study. Genotyping of the
   patients' blood by TaqMan and BioTrove assays identified homozygous
   deletions at the M1 and T1 loci of GST (GSTM1-null and GSTT1-null,
   respectively) as well as alleles for GSTP1 (rs1695) and HMOX1
   (rs2071746). In addition, the effect of gene-smoking interactions on the
   risk of all RA and RA serologic phenotypes was studied in separate
   logistic models that were adjusted for co-variates. Multiplicative
   interactions were assessed by including a product term in a logistic
   model, and additive interactions were assessed using the attributable
   proportion (AP) due to interaction. For replication of the results,
   analyses revealing significant interactions were repeated in an
   independent case-control cohort from the Epidemiological Investigation
   of Rheumatoid Arthritis study.
   Results. For the risk of all RA, multiplicative (P = 0.05) and additive
   (AP = 0.53, P = 0.0005) interactions between the GSTT1-null polymorphism
   and smoking and multiplicative interactions (P = 0.05) between HMOX1 and
   smoking were observed. For the risk of seropositive RA, multiplicative
   (P = 0.01) and additive (AP = 0.62, P < 0.0001) interactions between
   GSTT1-null and smoking and additive interactions (AP = 0.41, P = 0.03)
   between HMOX1 and smoking were observed. After correction for multiple
   comparisons, the additive interactions between GSTT1-null and smoking
   remained significant. The M1-null and P1 variants of GST did not show
   significant interactions, and no associations with seronegative RA were
   observed. In replication analyses, significant multiplicative
   interactions (P = 0.04) and additive interactions (AP = 0.32, P = 0.02)
   were observed between GSTT1-null and smoking in the risk of
   anti-citrullinated protein antibody-positive RA.
   Conclusion. Significant gene-environment interactions between the
   GSTT1-null polymorphism and heavy smoking were observed when assessing
   the risk of RA. Future studies are needed to assess the impact of these
   interactions on RA prediction.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we derive an algorithm for estimating the location of
   events which cause burst errors, such as packet collisions and multipath
   fades in wireless packets. Effective localization algorithms have a
   range of applications, and could lead to network performance
   improvements through techniques such as error control coding and
   cross-layer design between the physical and medium access control
   layers. Given that a collision or fade occurs in a packet, the algorithm
   finds the maximum-likelihood estimate of the start time and duration of
   the collision or fade. Due to the computational complexity of this
   optimal estimate, we also derive an efficient sub-optimal algorithm
   which decouples the estimation of the collision or fade duration from
   the estimation of its starting position within the packet of interest.
   Both algorithms are able to isolate collision locations within the
   packet when the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough for the link to
   operate at a BER of similar to 10(-6) in the absence of collision. An
   extension to M-QAM demonstrates similar effectiveness for constellation
   sizes up to 128.}},

Abstract = {{The application of Chinese steamed bun starter dough (CSB-SD) in
   breadmaking was investigated. The activation of CSB-SD to activate the
   growth of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and to increase the number of
   yeast, prior to making bread, was conducted by mixing CSB-SD with wheat
   flour and water and then incubating for 24 h. Wheat flour was then
   substituted by this activated CSB-SD (aCSB-SD) at 10\%, 30\%, and 50\%
   (w/w) to make bread. Dough and bread properties were studied comparing
   to the control (without aCSB-SD). From the farinograph results, a high
   aCSB-SD substitution level resulted in a less stability in dough with a
   higher degree of softening. Extensigraph results suggested that after
   aging, all the substituted dough yielded a greater resistance to
   extension with lower extensibility values than the control.
   Substitutions with 30\% and 50\% (w/w) aCSB-SD significantly increased
   the total CO2 gas generation. Scanning electron microscopy SEM images of
   the 30\% and 50\% (w/w) substituted dough showed a well-developed gluten
   matrix. The 50\% (w/w) substituted breads obtained a greater risen
   volume, finer crumb grain, and retained more softness after 5-d storage
   than the control. In addition, both the 30\% and 50\% (w/w) substituted
   breads showed a slightly increased mold stability, as compared to the
   0\% and 10\% (w/w) substituted breads.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Autism spectrum disorders are often idiopathic. Studies have
   suggested associations between immune response and these disorders. We
   explored associations between parental autoimmune disorders and
   children's diagnosis of autism by linking Swedish registries.
   Methods: Data for each participant were linked across 3 Swedish
   registries. The study includes 1227 cases and 25 matched controls for
   each case (30,693 controls with parental linkage). Parental diagnoses
   comprised 19 autoimmune disorders. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) using
   multivariable conditional logistic regression.
   Results: Parental autoimmune disorder was weakly associated with autism
   spectrum disorders in offspring (maternal OR = 1.6 {[}95\% confidence
   interval = 1.1-2.2]; paternal OR = 1.4 {[}1.0-2.0]). Several maternal
   autoimmune diseases were correlated with autism. For both parents,
   rheumatic fever was associated with autism spectrum disorders.
   Conclusions: These data support previously reported associations between
   parental autoimmune disorders and autism spectrum disorders. Parental
   autoimmune disorders may represent a critical pathway that warrants more
   detailed investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of
   non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States. Historically, radiation
   therapy (RT) was the primary treatment for patients with localized
   disease. Several randomized trials have demonstrated that the addition
   of systemic therapy improves outcomes. Additional randomized trials have
   shown that the combination of RT and systemic therapy is superior to
   systemic therapy alone. The role of RT in advanced-stage DLBCL has not
   been firmly established, but some prospective phase III trials, as well
   as retrospective studies, suggest a benefit for advanced disease also.
   For patients with relapsed or primary refractory disease, autologous
   stem cell transplantation is the treatment of choice. Here too,
   consolidation RT appears to improve outcomes compared with autologous
   stem cell transplant alone. Finally, for patients with advanced DLBCL
   who are no longer responsive to systemic therapy, RT may provide rapid
   and durable palliation of local lymphoma-related symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Background. - Cetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody selective for
   epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). It is increasingly used in
   epithelial cancer, often in combination with radiotherapy or
   chemotherapeutic agents, since it induces a broad range of cellular
   responses that enhance tumour sensitivity to these therapies. However it
   can cause numerous adverse effects, the most common being acneiform
   eruption on the face and trunk, which is generally bilateral and
   symmetric.
   Patients and methods. - Herein we present the first case of unilateral
   cetuximab-induced acneiform eruption in facial palsy.
   Discussion. - To our knowledge the medical literature contains no other
   such cases. Our hypothesis is that lymphoedema associated with facial
   palsy reduces lymphatic drainage, promoting the deposition of cetuximab
   on EGFR and persistence of local signs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

   it is necessary to identify who the restrained and secluded patients
   are. The aim of the present study was to determine which demographic and
   clinical groups of psychiatric inpatients are at risk of being
   restrained/secluded, and whether there have been changes in the
   restrained/secluded patients' profiles over a 15-year period in Finland.
   A structured postal survey concerning the demographic and clinical
   information of restrained/secluded patients was completed in all Finnish
   psychiatric hospitals during a predetermined week in 1990, 1991, 1994,
   1998, and 2004. The National Hospital Discharge Register was used to
   gather information on all psychiatric inpatients during the study weeks.
   Out of the variables studied (age, gender, main diagnosis, phase of
   hospital stay), only the main diagnosis and the phase of hospital stay
   were independent risk factors for restraint/seclusion, and remained
   constant over time. The age profile of the restrained/secluded patients
   was unstable over time and the risk of being restrained/secluded was not
   associated with gender.
   Restraint and seclusion is used mainly among the acute and the most
   disturbed patients. Therefore, in order to reduce the use of restraint
   and seclusion, resources should be targeted especially to these groups.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Controversy exists about the appropriate criteria for a
   diagnosis of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
   Objective: To examine the structure and symptoms most predictive of
   DSM-IV adult ADHD.
   Design: The data are from clinical interviews in enriched subsamples of
   the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (n=131) and a survey of a
   large managed health care plan (n=214). The physician-administered Adult
   ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale (ACDS) was used to assess childhood ADHD
   and expanded symptoms of current adult ADHD. Analyses examined the
   stability of symptoms from childhood to adulthood, the structure of
   adult ADHD, and the adult symptoms most predictive of current clinical
   diagnoses.
   Setting: The ACDS was administered telephonically by clinical research
   interviewers with extensive experience in the diagnosis and treatment of
   adult ADHD.
   Participants: An enriched sample of community respondents.
   Main Outcome Measure: Diagnoses of DSM-IV/ACDS adult ADHD.
   Results: Almost half of the respondents (45.7\%) who had childhood ADHD
   continued to meet the full DSM-IV criteria for current adult ADHD, with
   94.9\% of these patients having current attention-deficit disorder and
   34.6\% having current hyperactivity disorder. Adult persistence was much
   greater for inattention than for hyperactivity/impulsivity. Additional
   respondents met the full criteria for current adult ADHD despite not
   having met the full childhood criteria. A 3-factor structure of adult
   symptoms included executive functioning (EF), inattention/hyperactivity,
   and impulsivity. Stepwise logistic regression found EF problems to be
   the most consistent and discriminating predictors of adult DSM-IV/ACDS
   ADHD.
   Conclusions: These findings document the greater persistence of
   inattentive than of hyperactive/impulsive childhood symptoms of ADHD in
   adulthood but also show that inattention is not specific to ADHD because
   it is strongly associated with other adult mental disorders. In
   comparison, EF problems are more specific and consistently important
   predictors of DSM-IV adult ADHD despite not being in the DSM-IV,
   suggesting that the number of EF symptoms should be increased in the
   DSM-V/ICD-11.}},

Abstract = {{Catheter ablation is of growing importance in patients with an ischemic
   cardiomyopathy and recurrent episodes of ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
   Most ablation strategies in these patients are based on the detection of
   areas of scar and border zones to normal myocardium. However, the
   mapping criteria for identifying these areas have not been validated
   sufficiently so far. Therefore, we have performed a comparison between
   electroanatomical bipolar voltage maps obtained during substrate-based
   VT ablation procedures and {[}18 F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose PET studies
   performed prior to these procedures.
   Seven patients suffering from severe coronary artery disease and
   repetitive ventricular tachycardias were enrolled in this study. In all
   patients, there was a history of myocardial infarction and the left
   ventricular function was severely impaired. A FDG PET was performed at
   least 1 day prior to the ablation procedure in all patients. Then, a
   substrate-based VT ablation procedure was performed using the CARTO
   system (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA). Finally, the FDG PET
   images and the bipolar voltage maps were compared in all patients.
   The ablation procedures could be performed successfully in all patients
   and 1-5 monomorphic VTs could be eliminated in each patient. There were
   no major complications. At 1-year follow-up, five out of seven patients
   (71.4\%) remained free from any arrhythmia recurrence. In all patients,
   there were extensive areas of scar and adjacent low-voltage areas could
   be identified in the CARTO bipolar voltage maps. In areas commonly
   defined as ``dense scar{''} (bipolar voltage amplitude < 0.5 mV), the
   mean FDG uptake was 43.1\% (SD +/- 18.2\%) indicating predominantly scar
   tissue. In the so-called low-voltage border zones the mean FDG uptake
   ranged between 49.5\% {[}(SD +/- 15.8\%); > 0.5-1 mV] and 60.1\% {[}(SD
   +/- 14.8\%); > 1-1.5 mV], thereby indicating the presence of
   predominantly viable myocardium. In areas with a bipolar voltage
   amplitude > 1.5 mV the presence of viable myocardium was confirmed by a
   mean FDG uptake of approximately 60\%.
   The results of our study demonstrate that there is a significant amount
   of viable myocardium in the low-voltage border zones of scars frequently
   targeted as ablation sites. Therefore, RF current delivery in these
   areas should be restricted to the minimum assumed to be necessary for
   successful catheter ablation because extensive RF applications might
   result in a further deterioration of the left ventricular function.
   Larger studies are needed to validate our results and to develop more
   reliable criteria for distinguishing areas of scar from viable
   myocardium in CARTO bipolar voltage maps.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a suitable framework for consolidating knowledge and
   providing a useful starting point to undertake conservation of the last
   remnants of Butea monosperma forest. A survey was conducted to assess
   the status of a reportedly unexplored B. monosperma forest in a narrow
   strip of land along the northeastern region of Pakistan in order to
   conserve the remaining remnants. A preliminary reconnaissance survey on
   the basis of land use divides the narrow stretch of land, with
   concentration of remnants into four zones. The remnants were further
   evaluated for in situ conservation by a scoring system based on
   vegetation analysis and quality of habitat. Low value was assigned to
   those criteria which had negative impact and high to those which had
   positive impact on performance of B. monosperma and its long-term
   survival. Additional information, pertaining to decline, trends of
   change in the land use, and the underlying socioeconomic processes, was
   also made. Information from the study area indicated that, in the past
   two decades, the decline and conversion of the remaining B. monosperma
   forest to agriculture and forestry has been intensified. The vegetation
   analysis revealed that all remnants are broadly B. monosperma-Adhatoda
   vasica, bispecies association. The scoring system ranked the remnants
   into four classes. Two forests from the intact remnant class and one
   from the mildly degraded class were recommended for in situ
   conservation. Keeping in view the deteriorating status of the highly
   ranked remnants across the landscape and the degree of alteration it is
   undergoing, they were assigned the conservation status category of
   ``critical.{''} An approach suggested for their immediate conservation
   was to fence them, with open access to the local people for sustainable
   resource use. In situ conservation of these benchmarks would help in
   further understanding the ecological, evolutionary, and structural
   features of this unique biogeographic ecotone and its affinities with
   the adjacent ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Silk fibers from Bombyx mori silkworm was degummed with different
   concentration of citric acid, and the physical properties and fine
   structure were investigated to elucidate the effects of citric acid
   treatment. The silk sericin removal percentage was almost 100\% after
   degumming with 30\% citric acid which resulted in a total weight loss of
   25.4\% in the silk fibers. The surface morphology of silk fiber degummed
   with citric acid was very smooth and fine, showed perfect degumming like
   traditional soap-alkali method. The tensile strength of silk fiber was
   increased after degumming with citric acid (507 MPa), where as the
   traditional soap-alkali method causes to decrease the strength about
   half of the control silk fiber (250 MPa). The molecular conformation
   estimated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and the crystalline
   structure evaluated from X-ray diffraction curve stayed unchanged
   regardless of the degumming with citric acid and soap. The dye uptake
   percentage of silk fiber degummed with citric acid decreased slightly,
   about 4.2\%. On the other hand, the dye uptake percentage of silk
   degummed with soap was higher which indicates the disordering of the
   molecular orientation of the laterally ordered structure, accompanied
   with the partial hydrolysis of silk fibroin molecules by the alkali
   action of soap. The thermal properties were greatly enhanced by soap and
   citric acid degumming agents. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis showed
   silk degummed with citric acid is more stable in higher temperature than
   that of soap. With heating at above 300 degrees C, the silk degummed
   with citric acid shows an increase in storage modulus and an onset of
   tan (5 peaks at 325 degrees C and the melt flow of the sample was
   inhibited. The degumming of silk fibers with citric acid is safe and the
   results obtained are quite promising as a basis for possible future
   industrial application. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Risk of Intraoperative Hypotension with Loop Diuretics: A Randomized
   Controlled Trial}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: There is growing concern regarding the safety of blood
   pressure-lowering medications administered during the perioperative
   period. Whether loop diuretics also induce intraoperative hypotension is
   uncertain. Our objective was to compare the effects of continuing or
   withholding furosemide on the day of noncardiac elective surgery on
   intraoperative hypotension among chronic users of furosemide.
   METHODS: A double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial was
   conducted at 3 North American university centers between September 2000
   and December 2006. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1: 1 ratio
   to receive either furosemide or placebo on the day of surgery. The
   primary outcome was risk of developing intraoperative hypotension. A
   priori secondary outcomes included risk of heart failure; composite
   cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, stroke or
   transient ischemic attack, or death); and change in renal function and
   electrolytes.
   RESULTS: Of the 212 patients enrolled, 193 patients underwent surgery.
   There was no significant difference in risk of developing intraoperative
   hypotension between the furosemide (49\%) and placebo (51.9\%) groups
   (relative risk {[}RR], 0.95; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 0.72-1.24;
   P = .78). The intraoperative administration of vasopressors and fluids
   were similar between both groups. The risk of developing postoperative
   cardiovascular events was not significantly different between those
   randomized to furosemide (4.8\%) or placebo (2.8\%) (RR, 1.73; 95\% CI,
   0.42-7.06; P = .49). There was no significant difference in renal
   function or electrolytes between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSION: Among elective, noncardiac surgeries in patients chronically
   treated with furosemide, the administration of furosemide on the day of
   surgery did not significantly increase the risk for intraoperative
   hypotension. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. The American

Abstract = {{We describe a miniaturized fluid array device for high-throughput
   cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS), aiming to match the throughput and
   scale of gene discovery. Current practice of using E. coli cells for
   production of recombinant proteins is difficult and cost-prohibitive to
   implement in a high-throughput format. As more and more new genes are
   being identified, there is a considerable need to have high-throughput
   methods to produce a large number of proteins for studying structures
   and functions of the corresponding genes. The device consists of 96
   units and each unit is for expression of one protein; thus up to 96
   proteins can be produced simultaneously. The function of the fluid array
   was demonstrated by expression of a variety of proteins, with more than
   two orders of magnitude reduction in reagent consumption compared with a
   commercially available CFPS instrument. The protein expression yield in
   the device was up to 87 times higher for beta-glucoronidase than that in
   a conventional microplate. The concentration of beta-galactosidase
   expressed in the device was determined at 5.5 mu g/mu L. The feasibility
   of using the device for drug screening was demonstrated by measuring the
   inhibitory effects of mock drug compounds on synthesized beta-lactamase
   without the need for harvesting proteins, which enabled us to reduce the
   analysis time from days to hours. (C) 2010 American Institute of

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an enhanced multimodal personal authentication
   system for mobile device security. The proposed approach fuses
   information obtained from face, teeth and voice modalities to improve
   performance. To integrate three modalities, we employ various fusion
   techniques such as the weighted-summation rule, K-NN, Fisher and
   Gaussian classifiers, and we then evaluate the authentication
   performance of the proposed system. The performance is evaluated on a
   database consisting of 1000 biometric traits that correspond to the
   face, teeth and voice modalities of 50 persons, i.e., 20 biometric
   traits per individual, in which these biometric traits are
   simultaneously collected by a smart-phone device. The experiment results
   integrating the three modalities showed the error rates of 1.64\%,
   4.70\%, 3.06\% and 1.98\% for the weighted-summation rule, K-NN, Fisher
   and Gaussian classifier, respectively, and that the weight-summation
   rule outperformed the other classification approaches. In contrast, the
   error rates regarding a single modality were 5.09\%, 7.75\% and 8.98\%
   for face, teeth, and voice modalities, respectively. From these results,
   we confirmed that the proposed method achieved a significant performance
   improvement over the methods using a single modality, and the results
   showed that the proposed method was very effective through various
   fusion experiments.(1)}},

Abstract = {{A new fuel cell stack design is described using an anion exchange
   membrane (AEM) fuel cell and a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell
   in series with a single fuel tank servicing both anodes in a passive
   direct methanol fuel cell configuration. The anionic-cationic bi-cell
   stack has alkaline and acid fuel cells in series (twice the voltage),
   one fuel tank, and simplified water management. The series connection
   between the two cells involves shorting the cathode of the anionic cell
   to the anode of the acidic cell. It is shown that these two electrodes
   are at essentially the same potential which avoids an undesired
   potential difference and resulting loss in current between the two
   electrodes. Further, the complimentary direction of water transport in
   the two kinds of fuel cells simplifies water management at both the
   anodes and cathodes. The effect of ionomer content on the AEM electrode
   potential and the activity of methanol oxidation were investigated. The
   individual performance of AEM and PEM fuel cells were evaluated. The
   effect of ion-exchange capacity in the alkaline electrodes was studied.
   A fuel wicking material in the methanol fuel tank was used to provide
   orientation-independent operation. The open circuit potential of the
   bi-cell was 1.36V with 2.0 M methanol fuel and air at room temperature.

Abstract = {{Fluorinated acrylates and methacrylates radiolyzed at 77 K polymerize

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to investigate potential relationship between

   the socio-demographic factors and health-related behaviors, height, and
   weight. To measure degree of depression, the Korean version of the
   Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (CES-D) was used.
   Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression analyses were
   performed to examine the degree of association between obesity and
   depression. Compared to normal-weight women, overweight women had a
   lower adjusted odds ratio (OR) for depression (OR= 0.65, 95\% confidence
   interval 0.46 to 0.97). Underweight (1.42, 0.83 to 2.44) and obese women
   (BMI = 30) had higher ORs for depression (1.47, 0.64 to 3.36), but these
   were insignificant. Compared to normal-weight men, obese men had higher
   crude ORs (1.94, 1.03 to 3.62) and adjusted ORs (1.77, 0.89 to 3.53) for
   depression, while underweight and overweight men showed no significant

Title = {{Tumor Size and Age Predict the Risk of Malignancy in Hurthle Cell
   Neoplasm of the Thyroid and Can Therefore Guide the Extent of Initial
   Thyroid Surgery}},
Journal = {{THYROID}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{20}},

Pages = {{1229-1234}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: The majority of patients having a diagnosis of Hurthle cell
   neoplasm (HCN) on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a thyroid nodule have
   a diagnostic thyroid lobectomy to make the final diagnosis. If the
   nodule is malignant, they require a completion thyroidectomy. The
   objective of this study was to devise a simple clinical scheme capable
   of predicting malignancy in patients with cytologic diagnosis of HCN
   and, therefore, guide the extent of initial thyroid surgery.
   Methods: A total of 57 patients who underwent thyroid surgery after an
   FNA diagnosis of HCN were retrospectively studied. The patients were
   examined for clinical features, preoperative imaging studies, and
   pathology reports. The risk of malignancy was calculated using a
   multiple logistic regression model.
   Results: The overall rate of malignancy in patients with HCN was 46\%
   (26/57). The predictors of malignancy based on multiple logistic
   regression analysis were tumor size >1.5 cm (odds ratio {[}95\%
   confidence interval] 8.0 {[}1.9-33.4]) and patient age >45 years (odds
   ratio {[}95\% confidence interval] 2.3 {[}0.6-8.6]). In patients with
   nodules larger than 1.5 cm, the predicted probability of malignancy was
   greater in patients over 45 years than in younger patients (65\% for >45
   years vs. 44\% for <= 45 years). In patients with a nodule 1.5 cm or
   less, the probability of malignancy was relatively low and not
   significantly different between the two age categories (18\% for >45
   years vs. 10\% for <= 45 years).
   Conclusions: This study suggests that tumor size and age can be
   integrated into decision making for patients with an FNA diagnosis of
   HCN to facilitate patient selection for surgical referral and,
   particularly, to determine in which patients a thyroidectomy rather than
   a lobectomy should be the initial surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable communication over delay-constrained multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) block-fading channels with discrete inputs and
   mismatched (imperfect) channel state information at the transmitter

   variables, whose variances decay as a power of the signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR). A special focus is placed on the large-SNR decay of the error and
   outage probabilities when power control with long-term power constraints
   is used. Without explicitly characterizing the corresponding power
   allocation algorithms, we derive the outage exponent as a function of
   the system parameters, including the CSIT noise variance exponent and
   the exponent of the peak power constraint. It is shown that CSIT, even
   if noisy, is always beneficial and leads to important gains in terms of
   exponents.}},

Abstract = {{Tuffs, classified as weak rock to hard soil with respect to their

   found between chemical weathering index, average porosity and fractal
   parameters based on the slake durability test results. The shapes of the
   tuff particles before and after the slaking test were investigated using
   the fractal dimension method to explain numerically the variations of
   the surface characteristics of the test samples due to weathering. Two
   fractal parameters are proposed for the second and fifth cycles of the
   slake durability test. The study has shown that for assessing the

Abstract = {{Simulations and measurements are presented for an all-metal flared-notch
   array element in both single and dual-polarization configurations. The
   ultrawideband radiator exhibits an operational bandwidth of 12:1 for
   broadside scan and 8:1 bandwidth at a 45-degree scan in all planes,
   maintaining active VSWR<2. The feed consists of a direct
   coax-to-slot-line transition that mounts directly into the base of the
   radiator. The all-metal flared-notches are machined from common metal
   stock and fed via SMA coaxial connectors. No soldering is required for
   any part of the design-including the feed-and assembly is simple and
   modular. The array parts are machined using a high-precision wire-EDM
   cutting technology, ensuring that measurements (in the 700 MHz-9 GHz
   range) are repeatable and give close agreement with theory, even through
   multiple assembly cycles of the modular construction system. This paper
   presents results for a 32-element linear array of horizontal elements
   and also an 8 x 8 planar array of dual-polarized elements, comparing
   measurements with full-wave simulations of the complete finite array

Abstract = {{The operation and emissions of a four cylinder, passenger car
   common-rail diesel engine operating with two different fuels was
   investigated on the basis of exhaust-stream and in-cylinder soot
   measurements, as well as a thermodynamic analysis of the combustion
   process. The two fuels considered were a standard diesel fuel and a
   synthetic diesel (fuel two) with a lower aromatic content, evaporation
   temperature, and cetane number than the standard diesel. The
   exhaust-stream soot emissions, measured using a filter smoke number
   system, as well as a photo-acoustic soot sensor (AVL Micro Soot Sensor),
   were lower with the second fuel throughout the entire engine operating
   map. To elucidate the cause of the reduced exhaust-stream soot
   emissions, the in-cylinder soot temperature and the KL factor
   (proportional to concentration) were measured using miniature,
   three-color pyrometers mounted in the glow plug bores. Using the maximum
   KL factor value to quantify the soot formation process, it was seen that
   for all operating points, less soot was formed in the combustion chamber
   using the second fuel. The oxidation of the soot, however, was not
   strongly influenced by the fuel, as the relative oxidized soot fraction
   was not significantly different for the two fuels. The reduced soot
   formation of fuel two was attributed to the lower aromatic content of
   the fuel. The soot cloud temperatures for operation with the two fuels
   were not seen differ significantly. Similar correlations between the
   cylinder-out soot emissions, characterized using the pyrometers, and the
   exhaust-stream soot emissions were seen for both fuels. The combustion
   process itself was only seen to differ between the two fuels to a much
   lesser degree than the soot formation process. The predominant
   differences were seen as higher maximum fuel conversion rates during
   premixed combustion at several operating points, when fuel two was used.
   This was attributed to the lower evaporation temperatures and
   longer,ignition delays (characterized by the lower cetane number)
   leading to larger premixed combustion fractions. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{We assess the urbanization impacts on the heavy rainfall climatology
   during the Indian summer monsoon. While a number of studies have
   identified the impact of urbanization on local precipitation, a
   large-scale assessment has been lacking. This relation between
   urbanization and Indian monsoon rainfall changes is investigated by
   analyzing in situ and satellite-based precipitation and population
   datasets. Using a long-term daily rainfall dataset and high-resolution
   gridded analysis of human population, this study showed a significantly
   increasing trend in the frequency of heavy rainfall climatology over
   urban regions of India during the monsoon season. Urban regions
   experience less occurrences of light rainfall and significantly higher
   occurrences of intense precipitation compared to nonurban regions. Very
   heavy and extreme rainfall events showed increased trends over both
   urban and rural areas, but the trends over urban areas were larger and
   statistically more significant. Our analysis suggests that there is
   adequate statistical basis to conclude that the observed increasing
   trend in the frequency of heavy rainfall events over Indian monsoon
   region is more likely to be over regions where the pace of urbanization
   is faster. Moreover, rainfall measurements from satellites also indicate
   that urban areas are more (less) likely to experience heavier (lighter)
   precipitation rates compared to those in nonurban areas. While the
   mechanisms causing this enhancement in rainfall remain to be studied,
   the results provide the evidence that the increase in the heavy rainfall
   climatology over the Indian monsoon region is a signature of
   urban-induced rainfall anomaly. Copyright (C) 2009 Royal Meteorological

Abstract = {{Spherical Si solar cells (diameter of 1 mm) with a reflector cup
   (diameter of 2.2 mm) were used with 1-bit Delta Sigma-modulated
   illumination from white LEDs to provide optical wireless digital-sound
   transmission. The solar cells have a high directivity with regard to
   incident light, thus largely eliminating the environmental noise from
   fluorescent lighting. An optical wireless transmission system consists
   of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter contains a
   battery-operated lamp with 50 white LEDs and a 1-bit Delta Sigma
   modulator that controls the current to the lamp. The receiver consists
   of just a spherical-solar-cell module and an earphone. In the
   experiment, the transmitter converted a 1-kHz analog signal into digital
   pulses at a sampling frequency of 1 MHz and sent the digital data over a
   distance of 50 cm at an illumination of 70 lx. The measured output
   spectrum of the receiver showed that it recreated a sinusoidal waveform
   with little distortion. Even under fluorescent lighting with an
   illumination of 200 lx, the measured spectrum showed that a sinusoidal
   waveform with a signal-to-peak-noise ratio of 25 dB was obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Endothelial lipase (EL) is a new member of triacylglycerol
   lipase family that has been shown to decrease high-density lipoprotein
   (HDL) cholesterol levels leading to increased risk of atherosclerosis.
   Its expression is increased during inflammation and by inflammatory
   cytokines. Sulforaphane (SFN) is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate
   present in cruciferous vegetables that has antioxidant and
   anti-inflammatory effects. Nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B is one of the
   molecular targets for SFN-mediated protective effects. Our aim was
   therefore to assess whether SFN could impact on EL expression via
   modulation of NF-kappa B pathway.
   Methods and results: Quantitative PCR and Western blot results
   demonstrated that SFN inhibited tumor necrosis factor
   (TNF)-alpha-mediated induction of EL in human umbilical vein endothelial
   cells (HUVEC). Lentiviral transduction of HUVEC with mutated form of I
   kappa B-alpha(I kappa BM) as well as silencing of NF-kappa B subunit p65
   using RNA interference revealed that TNF-alpha-mediated induction of EL
   is mediated through NF-kappa B pathway. In addition, a total of five
   NF-kappa B binding sites were found in LIPG gene, which encodes EL. SFN
   inhibited binding of NF-kappa B to these sites analyzed by chromatin
   immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay
   (EMSA). SFN also inhibited TNF-alpha mediated phosphorylation of I kappa
   B kinase (IKK) 1/2 and I kappa B-alpha.
   Conclusions: Collectively, these results indicate that SFN inhibits EL
   expression via inhibition of NF-kappa B which may have a beneficial
   effect on HDL cholesterol levels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

   Classification and fertility status of organically managed fields across
   Saskatchewan, Canada. Can. J. Soil Sci. 90: 667-678. Records from 60
   organically managed fields across Saskatchewan were obtained from 39
   farmers. The records contained details of 6 yr of management practices
   applied to each field and details about the general farm operation under
   which the individual fields were managed. In addition, soil samples were
   collected from each field and analysed for available N, P, K and S, pH,
   electrical conductivity (EC) and soil organic carbon. Soil nutrient
   availability is reported by soil zone. Using information from the
   management questionnaire, the 60 fields were classified into four
   distinct management systems, Perennial, Summerfallow, Cereal, and
   Diverse, and soil nutrient availability examined according to management
   system. Despite classification of four systems, only the Perennial and
   Diverse systems had a functionally (and statistically) significant
   effect on selected soil properties. Inclusion of alfalfa in rotation
   (Perennial system) acidified the soil and reduced availability of P and
   K relative to the Diverse system. According to soil test results, fields
   in all of the systems and across all soil zones were apparently
   deficient in available P, deficient to marginally deficient in available
   N and marginally deficient in available S. Available K levels were
   generally optimal. Information from this study provides a baseline for
   fertility of soils under organic production across Saskatchewan. The
   overall low levels of available P, N and S identified in this study
   raise questions about the long-term sustainability of these organic
   systems, as well as the suitability of traditional soil testing for
   accurately assessing the soil fertility potential of organically managed
   soils.}},

Abstract = {{Endothelial cells establish an instructive vascular niche that
   reconstitutes haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) through
   release of specific paracrine growth factors, known as angiocrine
   factors. However, the mechanism by which endothelial cells balance the
   rate of proliferation and lineage-specific differentiation of HSPCs is
   unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Akt activation in endothelial cells,
   through recruitment of mTOR, but not the FoxO pathway, upregulates
   specific angiocrine factors that support expansion of CD34-F1t3-KLS
   HSPCs with long-term haematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) repopulation
   capacity. Conversely, co-activation of Akt-stimulated endothelial cells
   with p42/44 MAPK shifts the balance towards maintenance and
   differentiation of the HSPCs. Selective activation of Akt1 in the
   endothelial cells of adult mice increased the number of colony forming
   units in the spleen and CD34-F1t3- KLS HSPCs with LT-HSC activity in the
   bone marrow, accelerating haematopoietic recovery. Therefore, the
   activation state of endothelial cells modulates reconstitution of HSPCs
   through the modulation of angiocrine factors, with Akt mTOR-activated
   endothelial cells supporting the self-renewal of LT-HSCs and expansion
   of HSPCs, whereas MAPK co-activation favours maintenance and
   lineagespecific differentiation of HSPCs.}},

Abstract = {{Despite considerable data published on cognitive and behavioral
   disabilities in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD),
   relatively little information is available on behavioral or
   pharmacological interventions for alcohol-affected children. The main
   goals of this article, therefore, are to summarize published
   intervention studies of FASD and to present a neurodevelopmental
   framework, based on recent findings from a number of disciplines, for
   designing new therapies for alcohol-affected children. This framework
   assumes a neuroconstructionist view, which posits that reciprocal
   interactions between neural activity and the brain's hardware lead to
   the progressive formation of intra- and interregional neural
   connections. In this view, behavioral interventions can be
   conceptualized as a series of guided experiences that are designed to
   produce neural activation. Based on evidence from cognitive
   neuroscience, it is hypothesized that specific interventions targeting
   executive attention and self-regulation may produce greater
   generalizable results than those aimed at domain-specific skills in
   children with FASD. In view of reciprocal interactions between
   environmental effects and neural structures, the proposed framework
   suggests that the maximum effects of interventions can eventually be
   achieved by optimally combining behavioral methods and
   cognition-enhancing drugs. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To calculate the degradation time-dependent formation of water-soluble
   PLGA oligomers and to evaluate the relation between calculated oligomer
   formation and actual erosion of a PLGA-based delivery system. A proper
   model of the erosion process would be expected to facilitate forecasting
   of drug release profiles from PLGA matrices due to the close
   relationship of erosional mass loss and drug release described in the
   literature.
   The molecular weight distribution (MWD), degradation and erosion
   behaviour of PLGA were characterized by gel permeation chromatography.
   PLGA was characterized by a lognormal distribution of mass fractions of
   individual molecular weights. Implementation of the pseudo-first-order
   reaction kinetics into the MWD function facilitated calculating the
   formation of water-soluble oligomers during degradation. The calculated
   soluble oligomer formation agreed excellently with measured erosional
   mass loss of a PLGA matrix in aqueous buffer, which suggested that the
   bulk erosion process was solely controlled by the kinetic of the
   formation of soluble oligomers and thus solubility-controlled and not
   diffusion-limited as conventionally assumed.
   The accurately calculated formation of soluble PLGA oligomers was in
   excellent agreement with the actual erosional mass loss of a PLGA
   matrix, suggesting that bulk erosion of PLGA represents a
   degradation-controlled dissolution process.}},

   vertex and at a point on stress singularity lines for various material
   properties are determined using eigenanalysis. The stress distribution
   on an interface and the intensity of stress singularity at the vertex
   are investigated using BEM. It is shown that the order of stress
   singularity at the vertex in the joints can be reduced by slanting a
   side surface so as to decrease the angle between the interface and the
   side surface. The results of BEM analysis reveal that the distribution
   of stress on the interface is influenced by the slanted side surface.
   Finally, the 3D intensities of the singularity for stress components
   which are continuous at the interface are newly defined and determined

Abstract = {{Women not only start fewer, but also different businesses than men. Our
   paper scrutinizes gender differences in start-up size. The decision
   about start-up size is modeled as a sequential process along four
   dimensions: (1) extent of self-employment, (2) industry choice, (3) the
   number of hired workers and team partners, and (4) financing demand.
   Using individual-level data from the KfW Start-up Monitor, a large-scale
   population survey on start-up activity in Germany, we estimate the
   different stages of the sequential process. When controlling for a broad
   set of socio-demographic characteristics of the entrepreneur, gender
   differences prevail with respect to the extent of self-employment, the
   choice of industry, and the decision to hire employees. Yet there is no
   direct gender effect with respect to start-up financing. Financing
   demand is driven by the predetermined dimensioning of the start-up
   project rather than by personal characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{As planning for sustainable municipal solid waste management has to
   address several inter-connected issues such as landfill capacity,
   environmental impacts and financial expenditure, it becomes increasingly
   necessary to understand the dynamic nature of their interactions. A
   system dynamics approach designed here attempts to address some of these
   issues by fitting a model framework for Newark urban region in the US,
   and running a forecast simulation. The dynamic system developed in this
   study incorporates the complexity of the waste generation and management
   process to some extent which is achieved through a combination of
   simpler sub-processes that are linked together to form a whole. The
   impact of decision options on the generation of waste in the city, on
   the remaining landfill capacity of the state, and on the economic cost
   or benefit actualized by different waste processing options are explored
   through this approach, providing valuable insights into the urban
   waste-management process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One of the important goals of the NURESIM project is to assess and
   improve the simulation capability of the three-dimensional two-fluid
   codes for prediction of local boiling flow processes. The boiling flow
   is strongly affected by local mechanisms in the turbulent boundary layer
   near the heated wall. Wall-to-fluid transfer models for boiling flow
   with the emphasis on near-wall treatment are being addressed in the
   paper. Since the computational grid of the 3D two-fluid models is too
   coarse to resolve the variable gradients in the near-wall region, the
   use of wall functions is a common approach to model the liquid velocity
   and temperature profile adjacent to the heated wall.
   The wall function model for momentum, based on the surface roughness
   analogy has been discussed and implemented in the NEPTUNE\_CFD code. The
   model has been validated on several upward boiling flow experiments,
   differing in the geometry, working fluid and operating conditions. The
   simulations with the new wall function model show an improved prediction
   of flow parameters over the boiling boundary layer. Furthermore, a wall
   function model for the energy equation, based on enhanced two-phase wall
   friction has been derived and validated. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A quadratic parallel manipulator refers to a parallel manipulator with a
   quadratic characteristic polynomial. This paper revisits the forward
   displacement analysis (FDA) of a quadratic spherical parallel
   manipulator: the Agile Eye. An alternative formulation of the kinematic

   Agile Eye is then dealt with. After an alternative solution to the FDA
   has been presented, a formula is revealed that produces a unique current
   solution to the FDA for a given set of inputs. A regular cube in the
   input-space, which is singularity free, is also proposed for the Agile
   Eye. This work will facilitate the control of the Agile Eye.

Abstract = {{Poor pharmacokinetic profiles are often the underlying reason for the
   failure of novel protein drugs to reach clinical translation. Current
   passive half-life improvement methods focus on increasing the apparent
   hydrodynamic radius of the drug. We sought to develop an active method
   to increase the circulation half-life of proteins by binding to
   erythrocytes in blood. Screening a naive phage-displayed peptide library
   against whole mouse erythrocytes yielded a 12 amino acid peptide (ERY1)
   that binds the erythrocyte surface with high specificity.
   ERY1-displaying phage bind mouse and rat erythrocytes 95-fold higher
   than wild-type phage and exhibit negligible binding to mouse leukocytes,
   as determined by flow cytometry. Affinity experiments with soluble
   peptide revealed the extracellular domain of glycophorin-A as the
   membrane protein ligand. When expressed as an N-terminal fusion to
   maltose-binding protein and administered intravenously, the
   erythrocyte-binding variant exhibits a 3.2- to 6.3-fold increase in
   circulation half-life, 2.15-fold decrease in clearance, and 1.67-fold
   increase in bioavailability as compared to the wild-type protein. The
   peptide fails to induce ERY1-reactive immunoglobulin production,
   furthering the potential of the concept in therapeutic design, although
   this sequence does not bind human erythrocytes. We conclude that
   engineering erythrocyte affinity into proteins effectively increases
   their circulation half-life, thereby offering a solution to improve
   pharmacokinetic profiles of the numerous therapeutic protein drugs in
   clinical development.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce the Jacobi coordinates adopted to the advanced theoretical
   analysis of the relativistic Celestial Mechanics of the Earth-Moon
   system. Theoretical derivation utilizes the relativistic resolutions on
   reference frames adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU)
   in 2000. The resolutions assume that the Solar System is isolated and
   space-time is asymptotically flat at infinity and the primary reference
   frame covers the entire space-time, has its origin at the Solar System
   barycenter (SSB) with spatial axes stretching up to infinity. The SSB
   frame is not rotating with respect to a set of distant quasars that are
   assumed to be at rest on the sky forming the International Celestial
   Reference Frame (ICRF). The second reference frame has its origin at the
   Earth-Moon barycenter (EMB). The EMB frame is locally inertial and is
   not rotating dynamically in the sense that equation of motion of a test
   particle moving with respect to the EMB frame, does not contain the
   Coriolis and centripetal forces. Two other local frames-geocentric and
   selenocentric-have their origins at the center of mass of Earth and Moon
   respectively and do not rotate dynamically. Each local frame is subject
   to the geodetic precession both with respect to other local frames and
   with respect to the ICRF because of their relative motion with respect
   to each other. Theoretical advantage of the dynamically non-rotating
   local frames is in a more simple mathematical description of the metric
   tensor and relative equations of motion of the Moon with respect to
   Earth. Each local frame can be converted to kinematically non-rotating
   one after alignment with the axes of ICRF by applying the matrix of the
   relativistic precession as recommended by the IAU resolutions. The set
   of one global and three local frames is introduced in order to decouple
   physical effects of gravity from the gauge-dependent effects in the
   equations of relative motion of the Moon with respect to Earth.}},

Abstract = {{Drainage patterns of dural venous sinuses at confluens sinuum are
   variable and clinically significant. It has been generally investigated
   in adults; however, we thought that neonatal cadaver study might be more
   informative in views of embryological and clinical. A total of 33 skull
   bases of neonatal cadavers were resected to identify termination
   patterns of lateral sinus (LS), superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and
   occipital sinus (OS) at the confluens sinuum. Termination patterns of
   these sinuses were classified into six types: the SSS showed continuity
   with right transverse sinus (TS) (with OSs) (30.3\%) (Type I); or
   multiple OSs (21.2\%) (Type II). The SSS continued with left TS (with
   OSs) (12.1\% (Type Ill); or with multiple OSs (6.1\%) (Type IV). The SSS
   shows continuity with both TS (9.1\%) (Type V). SSS symmetrically
   bifurcated, the confluens sinuum has a large OS (21.2\%) (Type VI).
   Understanding of the cerebral venous drainage and large variation of the
   posterior fossa dural sinuses is crucially important for planning
   surgical intervention to some tumors in the neck which may require
   ligation of the internal jugular vein.}},

   activities in the hepatic tissue showed an increase. Glutathione and
   glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase levels showed a decrease, but
   thiobarbituric acid reactive substances level showed an increase in both
   serum and liver tissue. Serum and liver proteins decreased in serum and
   liver tissue. A significant decrease in blood parameters (hemoglobin,
   hematocrit, as well as red and white blood cells) and serum glucose
   occurred. Histopathological results showed that diethyl maleate induced
   a hoop of edema in the hepatic periportal area; while T. majus methyl
   alcohol extract or vitamin E prior to diethyl maleate injection shift
   blood and liver toxicity induced by diethyl maleate towards normal
   values and preserved hepatic lobular architecture. In conclusion,
   pre-treatment with either T. majus methyl alcohol extract or vitamin E
   provide protection against blood and liver toxicity induced by diethyl
   maleate in rats, these results were confirmed by histological
   examinations.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-It would be essential to clinicians, familial
   aneurysm study groups, and aneurysm families to understand the genetic
   basis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but there are no large
   population-based heritability estimates assessing the relative
   contribution of genetic and environmental factors to SAH.
   Methods-We constructed the largest twin cohort to date, the
   population-based Nordic Twin Cohort, which comprised 79 644 complete
   twin pairs of Danish, Finnish, and Swedish origin. The Nordic Twin
   Cohort was followed up for 6.01 million person-years using nationwide
   cause-of-death and hospitalization registries.
   Results-One hundred eighty-eight fatal and 321 nonfatal SAH cases were
   recorded in the Nordic Twin Cohort. Thus, SAH incidence was 8.47 cases
   per 100 000 follow-up years. Data for pairwise analyses were available
   for a total of 504 SAH cases, of which 6 were concordant (5 monozygotic
   and 1 opposite sex) and 492 discordant twin pairs for SAH. The
   concordance for SAH in monozygotic twins was 3.1\% compared with 0.27\%
   in dizygotic twins, suggesting at most a modest role for genetic factors
   in the etiology of SAH. The population-based probability estimate for
   SAH in dizygotic siblings of a patient with SAH is 0.54\%, and only 1 of
   185 full siblings experience familial SAH. The corresponding risk of SAH
   in monozygotic twins is 5.9\%. Model-fitting, which was based on the
   comparison of the few monozygotic and dizygotic pairs, suggested that
   the estimated heritability of SAH is 41\%.
   Conclusions-SAH appears to be mainly of nongenetic origin, and familial
   SAHs can mostly be attributed to environmental risk factors. (Stroke.

Abstract = {{In gamma-ray spectra, acquired in the absence of the sample, peaks occur
   which belong to the spectrometer background. When samples are measured,
   which contain radionuclides that appear in the background also and have
   activities near the detection level, the background contributes
   substantially to the peak areas. In the extreme case, when the
   contribution of the sample is much smaller than the contribution of the
   background, the peak area attributed to the radionuclide within a sample
   has the same probability of being positive or negative. Therefore, to
   interpret the results obtained from measurements of low-activity
   samples, the performance of the spectrum analysis procedure near the
   detection level must be known. To test the performance of the spectrum
   analysis procedure at low activities, the spectrometer background
   spectra were analyzed as if they had been water samples, prepared as dry
   residue obtained by evaporation of 50 L of water. The probabilities for
   false positives together with their decision thresholds are given for
   radionuclides appearing in the background spectra. For some of the
   radionuclides that do not appear in the background spectra,
   probabilities for false detection are given as well.}},

Abstract = {{Previously unpublished U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) investigations
   conducted over a 40-plus year period examined the influence of calcium
   chloride (CaCl(2)) addition rate and mixing temperature on the sulfate
   resistance of concrete. Herein, those data are analyzed and compared
   with predictions from an existing model, as well as with results from
   accelerated tests performed in parallel by the USBR to better understand
   the individual and combined effects of these parameters. Because CaCl(2)
   is more likely to be used during lower temperature construction, the
   combined effects of these parameters are important to consider The
   addition of 1\% calcium chloride by weight of cement can significantly
   decrease the sulfate resistance of samples made using Type V and II
   cements. Mixing and initially curing at 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F)
   resulted in significantly lower sulfate resistance than when mixing at
   4.4 degrees C (40 degrees F). Within the ranges considered, both the
   initial curing temperature and the CaCl(2) addition appear equally
   important to sulfate expansion. Together, these results indicate that
   higher overall heat generation during the early hydration reactions can
   significantly decrease the long-term sulfate resistance of concrete.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the importance of quantitative disease resistance during a
   plant's life, little is known about the molecular basis of this type of
   host pathogen interaction, because most of the genes underlying
   resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are unknown. To identify genes
   contributing to resistance QTLs in rice, we analyzed the colocalization
   of a set of characterized rice defense-responsive genes and resistance
   QTLs against different pathogens. We also examined the expression
   patterns of these genes in response to pathogen infection in the parents
   of the mapping populations, based on the strategy of validation and
   functional analysis of the QTLs. The results suggest that
   defense-responsive genes are important resources of resistance QTLs in
   rice. OsWRKY45-1 is the gene contributing to a major resistance QTL.
   NRR, OsGH3-1, and OsGLP members on chromosome 8 contribute alone or
   collectively to different minor resistance QTLs. These genes function in
   a basal resistance pathway or in major disease resistance gene-mediated
   race-specific pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Patients diagnosed with pulmonary embolism should be
   considered for treatment on an outpatient basis; however, this practise
   is not accepted in many centers. Objectives: Review the safety and
   efficacy of ambulatory management of patients with pulmonary embolism at
   our institution. Patients/Methods: This was a retrospective single
   center cohort study of consecutive patients diagnosed with idiopathic or
   secondary pulmonary embolism between January 2003 and January 2008 at
   the London Health Sciences Centre in London, Ontario, Canada. Patients
   were eligible for outpatient management of pulmonary embolism if they
   were hemodynamically stable, did not require oxygen therapy, did not
   require parenteral narcotics for pain management, and were not felt to
   be high risk for a major hemorrhage. Patients were assessed at 3 months
   for thrombosis recurrence and major bleeding episodes. Results: Six
   hundred and thirty-nine patients were included in the study, of which
   314 (49.1\%; 95\% CI 45.2, 53.1) were managed as outpatients; among
   these there were three (0.95\%; 95\% CI, 0.25, 3) thrombotic recurrences
   and three hemorrhagic events. There were nine deaths (2.9\%; 95\% CI,
   1.4, 5.6), all due to underlying cancer and all occurring after the
   first 7 days of treatment. Conclusions: Outpatient management of
   uncomplicated pulmonary embolism seems safe and effective in the absence
   of other indications for hospital admission.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic state of superconductor Rh17S15 has been investigated by
   Rh-103 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and specific heat measurements.
   We have identified the observed NMR lines corresponding to four
   inequivalent Rh sites in the cubic unit cell and obtained the
   site-selective information of each site. The spin-lattice relaxation
   rate 1/T-1 indicates that the 4d electrons from the Rh 24m site are the
   most responsible for the large electronic specific heat coefficient
   gamma. This conclusion is supported by the energy band calculation.
   Considering the experimental results and the band calculation, we
   concluded that the gamma value is enhanced because of the electron
   correlations of Rh 4d bands. In the superconducting state, an
   exponential decrease of both 1/T-1 and the electron specific heat are
   observed, revealing the isotropic superconducting gap with 2
   Delta/k(B)T(c) = 4.0. In addition, the decrease of the spin part of the
   Knight shift indicates the spin-singlet Cooper pair formation. These
   results demonstrate that Rh17S15 is an s-wave superconductor with
   enhanced effective electron mass.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The widespread use of primary coronary intervention (PCI)
   has significantly improved the prognosis of men presenting with acute
   coronary syndromes, but the cardiovascular event rate among women has
   either levelled off or increased. The purpose of the present prospective
   study was to compare the clinical outcome of women and men presenting
   with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary PCI
   with concomitant usage of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors.
   Methods: Between January 2006 and December 2007, 297 consecutive
   patients presenting with STEMI were prospectively included in this
   single center investigation. Overall, 82 (27.6\%) women and 215 (72.4\%)
   men were treated by PCI with additional bare metal stent implantation
   and a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor.
   Results: Women were significantly older (65 -/+ 10 vs 60 +/- 12 years, p
   = 0.04), presented with a smaller reference luminal diameter (2.83 +/-
   0.51 vs 2.94 +/- 0.43, p = 0.03) and had a higher prevalence of
   hypertension (68\% vs 53\%, p = 0.025) and obesity (30\% vs 18\%, p =
   0.03). The incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE, defined as
   death, re-myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization and
   coronary artery bypass graft) during long-term follow-up was similar in
   women and men (20\% vs 26\%, p = 0.29). Age, C-reactive protein,
   platelet count and cardiogenic shock were identified as independent
   predictors for MACE, whereas gender was not predictive.
   Conclusions: In this study, female gender did not emerge as an
   independent predictor for MACE, but women presenting with STEMI had a
   higher cardiovascular risk profile; this emphasizes the need for a more
   extensive therapeutic strategy. Combination therapy with primary PCI and
   GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors might mitigate gender-related differences in
   clinical outcomes. (Cardiol J 2010; 17,6: 580-586)}},

Abstract = {{While petroleum industry studies have indicated low benzene exposure
   potential for refinery workers, most provide limited data for assessing
   job or task-related benzene exposures. This study characterizes job and
   task-specific airborne benzene concentrations and variability over time
   for the ExxonMobil refinery in Joliet, Illinois from 1977 to 2006. A
   database of 2289 industrial hygiene air samples, including 1145 non-task
   (>= 180 min) personal samples and 480 task-related (<180 min) personal
   samples, were analyzed. Samples were grouped by operational status, job,
   and task. Benzene concentrations were determined for each job category
   and task bin, with additional analyses conducted to determine whether
   benzene concentrations changed over time. The results indicate that the
   benzene concentrations for non-task and task samples were relatively
   low. For all non-task samples, the arithmetic mean benzene concentration
   was 0.12 part per million (ppm). The most frequently sampled workers
   (process technicians during routine operations) had an arithmetic mean
   benzene concentration of 0.038 ppm. The most frequently sampled task bin
   (blinding and breaking) had an arithmetic mean benzene concentration of
   1.0 ppm. This study provides benzene air concentration data that can be
   used in combination with job histories to reconstruct historical benzene
   exposures for workers at the Joliet Refinery over the past 30 years.}},

Abstract = {{Background: HPV16 E6/E7 oncoproteins are critical for cervical
   carcinogenesis. The corresponding oncogenes are also detected in head
   and neck cancer, but in lung cancer their presence is strongly debated.
   PCR-based detection protocols amplify different target sequences.
   Objectives: To examine the frequency of different length HPV16 E7
   segments in lung carcinomas.
   Study design: We designed four different amplification schemes for the
   detection of overlapping segments of the HPV16 E7 ORF, all suitable for
   specific HPV detection in cervical carcinoma. In two schemes, the entire
   E7 ORF was targeted while in the remaining schemes internal, smaller
   sequences were targeted. In total, 76 specimens were used; 29 lung
   carcinoma specimens, 16 non-cancerous lung tissue specimens from the
   same patients and 31 bronchial washings from different lung cancer
   patients.
   Results: Amplification of the entire HPV16 E7 ORF, using two protocols,
   demonstrated the absence of the specific HPV16 E7 sequences (74 samples
   either tested negative by the first PCR protocol or false positive by
   the second, based on sequencing or AvaII or PvuII digestion). However,
   both schemes targeting smaller E7 segments revealed the frequent
   presence of HPV16 E7 sequences in lung carcinoma specimens (14/23
   positive by either scheme).
   Conclusions: HPV16 E7 sequences are frequently observed in lung
   carcinomas. Decreasing the size of PCR-target sequences increases the
   detection frequency, possibly indicating the presence of incomplete
   viral ORFs. Restriction endonuclease analysis is critical for verifying
   the reliability of the detection of these sequences. (C) 2010 Published

Abstract = {{Alcohol use is common and consumption during pregnancy has been shown to
   lead to a myriad of physical and neurologic abnormalities commonly
   referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Substance addiction,
   which includes alcohol, has been shown to involve the major nicotinic
   acetylcholine receptor subunit CHRNA5. Using human embryonic stem cells
   as a model of early human development, we show that low concentrations
   of ethanol (20 mM) can alter the expression of CHRNA5. Changes in CHRNA5
   expression is linked to altered GABA and NMDA receptor expression, as
   well as abnormal development of the frontal cortex. These results
   suggest that alcohol exposure can alter early neurologic development,
   which may favor addiction and other developmental abnormalities in
   unborn children. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This report describes two cases of marked bone loss (osteopenia)
   occurring in a 9-week-old German shepherd puppy and in a 6-month-old
   tiger In both cases the animals were fed a diet which was exclusively
   boneless meat The diets in both cases contained approximately 40 mg of
   calcium and 1000 mg of phosphorus per pound resulting in both calcium
   deficiency and phosphorus excess, resulting in a phosphorus-to-calcium
   ratio of 25 1, well beyond the amounts known to cause marked loss of
   bone experimentally This has been termed nutritional secondary
   hyperparathyroichsm (NSH) Both animals presented with severe bone pain,
   difficulty in ambulation, and difficulty in chewing food Radiographs
   showed marked osteopenia and spontaneous fractures Both responded
   clinically and radiographically to calcium supplementation and a diet
   with an appropriate phosphorus-to-calcium ratio The importance of
   calcium and phosphorus in the human diet is briefly discussed (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Proteomic profiling of serum is a powerful technique to identify
   differentially expressed proteins that can serve as biomarkers
   predictive of disease onset. In this study, we utilized two-dimensional
   (2D) gel analysis followed by matrix-assisted-laser
   desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis to
   identify putative serum biomarkers for autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D)
   in biobreeding diabetes resistant (BBDR) rats induced to express the
   disease. Treatment with toll-like receptor 3 ligand,
   polyinosinic:polycytidilic acid (pIC), plus infection with Kilham rat
   virus (KRV), a rat parvovirus, results in nearly 100\% of young BBDR
   rats becoming diabetic within 11-21 d. Sera collected from prediabetic
   rats at early time points following treatment with pIC + KRV were
   analyzed by 2D gel electrophoresis and compared with sera from control
   rats treated with phosphate-buffered saline, pIC alone or pIC + H1, a
   non-diabetogenic parvovirus. None of the latter three control treatments
   precipitates T1D. 2D gel analysis revealed that haptoglobin, an acute
   phase and hemoglobin scavenger protein, was differentially expressed in
   the sera of rats treated with pIC + KRV relative to control groups.
   These results were confirmed by Western blot and enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay studies, which further validated haptoglobin levels
   as being differentially increased in the sera of pIC + KRV-treated rats
   relative to controls during the first week following infection. Early
   elevations in serum haptoglobin were also observed in LEW1.WR1 rats that
   became diabetic following infection with rat cytomegalovirus. The
   identification and validation of haptoglobin as a putative serum
   biomarker for autoimmune T1D in rats now affords us the opportunity to
   test the validity of this protein as a biomarker for human T1D,
   particularly in those situations where viral infection is believed to
   precede the onset of disease.}},

Abstract = {{Our study aimed to compare the effect of fenofibrate on hemostasis
   between patients with isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and
   isolated mixed dyslipidemia and to examine the action of this agent on
   glucose and lipid metabolism. Twenty-two IFG and 23 mixed dyslipidemic
   patients were treated for 90 days with micronized fenofibrate (267
   mg/day) and were compared with 22 age-, sex- and weight-matched control
   subjects without lipid and glucose metabolism abnormalities. The lipid
   profile, fasting and 2-h post-glucose challenge glucose levels, HOMA and
   glycated hemoglobin as well as the plasma levels/activities of
   fibrinogen, factor VII and PAI-1 were determined at the beginning and
   after 30 and 90 days of treatment. Compared to the control subjects,
   mixed dyslipidemic and IFG patients exhibited increased plasma levels of
   fibrinogen and PAI-1 as well as increased factor VII activity.
   Fibrinogen, factor VIE and PAI-1 were higher in mixed dyslipidemic than
   IFG subjects. Not only did fenofibrate improve plasma lipids, but it
   also increased glucose sensitivity and normalized the IFG- and mixed
   dyslipidemia-induced changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis. Our study
   shows that IFG is associated with abnormal hemostasis, which is
   disturbed to a lesser extent in IFG than in mixed dyslipidemia.
   Fenofibrate seems to produce a complex beneficial effect on hemostasis
   in this group of patients.}},

Volume = {{42}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Because of the contrastive differences in environment and species
   composition climatic amelioration may affect alpine vegetation
   differently between fellfield and snowbed communities To test this
   prediction, the effects of warming on plant growth and vegetation
   structure were studied in two fellfield and two snowbed communities in
   northern Japan over 7 years using open-top-chambers (OTCs) OTCs
   increased the temperature by 1 1-1 8 degrees C, but the effects on
   snowmelt time and soil moisture were small Vegetation height and canopy
   volume increased substantially at both fellfield sites as a result of
   the use of OTCs Deciduous shrubs increased substantially at the lower
   fellfield and grammoids increased at the upper fellfield In contrast,
   the responses of snowbed plants to OTCs were not significant Because
   snowbed plants are snow covered until mid-summer, climatic amelioration
   during the snow-free period may influence plant growth only slightly if
   the snow-free period does not change Species richness and diversity were
   not changed by OTCs at any of the sites, indicating that the effect of
   warming alone may not be strong enough to change the species composition
   and diversity over several years These results indicate significant
   variation in the response among alpine communities to warming}},

Abstract = {{The pulsed DC hollow cathode discharge has been studied in the low
   pressure plasma jet sputtering system by means of cylindrical Langmuir
   probe. Measurements have been performed in pure Ar with the flow rate of
   30 sccm. The repetition frequency of the pulses of 1 kHz has been chosen
   with the pulse width 100 us (duty cycle 10\%) and 50 mu s (duty cycle 5
   \%) and the amplitude of the pulses was approximately 400 V. The average
   discharge current varied between 150 and 250 mA. To obtain better
   stability of the discharge a 3.8 k Omega resistor was connected across
   the pulse switch. Consequently, there was a weak continuous DC discharge
   on the background of the pulsed discharge. From the probe
   characteristics the plasma and floating potential, electron density and
   electron temperature have been evaluated. Their dependences on the
   pressure (in the range of several Pa) and on the radial distance from
   the central axis of the system are presented. Temporal resolution of the
   measurements is 0.5 mu s. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Abstract = {{During the past years, the topic sensitive skin became one of the most
   important fields in dermatology. The tremendous interest is based on
   several studies showing that about 50\% of the population declares to
   have sensitive skin. The human thermoreceptor hTRPV1 was previously
   identified to contribute to this skin condition while facilitating
   neurogenic inflammation leading to hyperalgesia. Furthermore, skin
   sensitivity towards capsaicin, a natural activator of TRPV1, was shown
   to correlate with sensitive skin. In a screening campaign based on
   recombinant HEK293-cells stably transfected with hTRPV1, the selective
   antagonist trans-4-tert-butylcyclohexanol was identified. This
   antagonist is able to inhibit capsaicin-induced hTRPV1 activation with
   an IC50 value of 34 +/- 5 mu m tested in HEK293-cells as well as in
   electrophysiological recordings performed in oocytes expressing hTRPV1.
   Strikingly, in a clinical study with 30 women using topical treatment
   with o/w emulsions containing 31.6 ppm capsaicin, we were able to show
   that 0.4\% of this inhibitor significantly reduces capsaicin-induced
   burning (P < 0.0001) in vivo. Thus trans-4-tert-butylcyclohexanol has
   the potential as a novel bioactive for the treatment of sensitive skin.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, scale interaction between synoptic eddies and
   low-frequency flow is investigated. It is demonstrated here that there
   is a general rule, the ``left-hand rule{''}, that describes synoptic
   eddy feedback onto low-frequency flow. The rule is that low-frequency
   anomalies systematically stir and deform the transient eddies in such a
   way that the irrotational eddy-vorticity fluxes are directed
   preferentially about 90A degrees toward the left-hand side of the
   low-frequency flow; thus this eddy feedback plays a positive role in
   maintaining and prolonging low-frequency flow under the stormy
   atmosphere. Similarly, we show that the irrotational eddy-temperature
   and moisture fluxes are also directed preferentially about 90A degrees
   toward the left-hand side of the low-frequency flow in the northern
   hemisphere. The eddy-temperature fluxes and their vertical structure
   play a positive role in reinforcing the low-frequency flow in the low
   levels. The moisture fluxes play a role in enhancing low-frequency flow
   by providing eddy-induced moisture convergence and divergence.}},

Abstract = {{Determining what factors explain the distribution of non-native invasive
   plants that can spread in forest-dominated landscapes could advance
   understanding of the invasion process and identify forest areas most
   susceptible to invasion. We conducted roadside surveys to determine the
   presence and abundance of 15 non-native plant species known to invade
   forests in western North Carolina, USA. Generalized linear models were
   used to examine how contemporary and historic land use, landscape
   context, and topography influenced presence and abundance of the species
   at local and regional scales. The most commonly encountered species were
   Microstegium vimineum, Rosa multiflora, Lonicera japonica, Celastrus
   orbiculatus, Ligustrum sinense, and Dioscorea oppositifolia. At the
   regional scale, distance to city center was the most important
   explanatory variable, with species more likely present and more abundant
   in watersheds closer to Asheville, NC. Many focal species were also more
   common in watersheds at lower elevation and with less forest cover. At
   the local scale, elevation was important for explaining the species'
   presence, but forest cover and land-use history were more important for
   explaining their abundance. In general, species were more common in
   plots with less forest cover and more area reforested since the 1940s.
   Our results underscore the importance of considering both the
   contemporary landscape and historic land use to understand plant
   invasion in forest-dominated landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{The fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) hair test, a biomarker of excessive
   alcohol exposure, has demonstrated its potential for use in fetal
   alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) diagnosis. FASD may be compounded by
   polydrug exposure. Our objective was to determine the likelihood of
   positive FAEE test among parents testing positive for other drugs of
   abuse. Samples submitted for FAEE hair analysis by Children's Aid
   Societies between October 2005 and May 2007, also concurrently tested
   for cocaine, cannabinoids, opiates, methamphetamine, amphetamine,
   benzodiazepines, methadone, and/or oxycodone, were included in our
   analysis. Subjects consisted of parents suspected of using excessive
   amounts of alcohol. Parents testing positive for drugs of abuse had a
   significantly increased risk for testing positive for high FAEE. Mothers
   testing positive for heavy chronic alcohol use were found to have a
   threefold increased risk of testing positive for cocaine (odds ratio =
   3.26, 1.1-9.7). Our results suggest that parents abusing stimulants are
   at risk of high alcohol exposure, which put their unborn children at
   risk for FASD. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   A heuristic weighting function that enables decreasing the location
   errors is Introduced Also the detailed performance analysis of the

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient and a limited resource, yet
   excess P is applied to agricultural land and can cause environmental
   problems in areas with intensive animal farming. In this study, the
   fertilizing effects of P in several animal manure-based products
   (including thermal treatment) were tested after application to two
   agricultural soil types (Jyndvad soil: clay 5.1\%, silt 4.1\%, sand
   88.9\%, organic matter 2.1\%, total C 1.2\% soil dry matter (DM), total
   P 266 mg kg(-1) soil DM, pH 6.3; Ronhave soil: clay 15.4\%, silt 32.6\%,
   sand 49.6\%, organic matter 2.3\%, Total C 1.3\% soil DM, total P 488 mg
   kg(-1) soil DM, pH 6.6). The first-year effect of P application was
   tested in a spring barley crop (Hordeum vulgare L) and residual P
   effects were tested in a perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L) crop the
   following year. Untreated ash from thermally gasified animal manure
   biogas residue (GA) and a corresponding neutralized acid extract of the
   ash (ExL) in liquid form were the products in focus. Other products in
   use were: pelletized pig manure biogas residue (PEL), incinerated PEL
   (IA), anaerobically digested pig slurry (DS), dried ExL, dried fraction
   of separated pig slurry (SS), thermally gasified SS (GAs), thermally
   gasified poultry manure (GAp), crushed triple super phosphate (TSP) and
   disodium phosphate (DSP) was used as reference P fertilizer. For
   application of 20 kg P ha(-1) mineral P fertilizer replacement value
   (RV) in the second year in the sandy soil was 76\% and 99\% for GA, 79\%
   and 123\% for IA, 95\% and 155\% for PEL, 94\% and 73\% for ExL, 55\%
   and 15\% for ExD, 64\% and 82\% for SS, 104\% and 109\% for DS, 60\% and
   95\% for GAp, 73\% and 111\% for GAs, where the first value is based on
   barley DM yield and the second on barley total P uptake. Tripling the GA
   application rate to 60 kg P ha(-1) in both soils had no significant
   effect on barley DM yield and P uptake. The overall efficiency for
   liquid fertilizers was much higher than for solid ones and relative
   effectiveness (RE) of ExL was comparable to RE of DSP. Despite the low P
   level in soils, the ryegrass crop grew very well on both soils in the
   second year, and there was no detectable residual effect of the
   treatments on grass yield and P uptake. In conclusion, untreated ash and
   solid manures used in this study were not suitable as starter P
   fertilizer, but could be used to maintain the level of available P in
   soil, as there were indications that ash/manure P contributed
   significantly to plant P uptake during the growing season of barley. (c)

Abstract = {{Ferritic stainless steels can be attractive bipolar plate materials of
   proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), provided that the stainless
   steels show sufficient corrosion resistance, for instance, by
   eliminating interstitial elements such as carbon and nitrogen. In the
   present study, thus, ferritic stainless steels (19Cr2Mo and 22Cr2Mo)
   with extra low interstitials (ELI) are evaluated to determine the
   required level of chromium content to apply them for PEMFC bipolar
   plates. In a simulated PEMFC environment (0.05 M SO42- (pH 3.3)+2 ppm F-
   solution at 353 K), the 22Cr2Mo stainless steel showed lower current
   density during the polarization in comparison with the 19Cr2Mo one. The
   polarization behavior of the 22Cr2Mo stainless steel resembles that of
   the type 316 one (17Cr12Ni2Mo). Similar values of interfacial contact
   resistance (ICR) are observed for both ferritic stainless steels. The
   22Cr2Mo stainless steel bipolar plate is found to be stable throughout
   the cell operation, while the 19Cr2Mo stainless steel corroded within
   1000 h. After the cell operation, the 22Cr2Mo stainless steel retains
   the chromium enriched passive film, while the chromium enriched surface
   film is not found for the 19Cr2Mo one, showing iron oxide/hydroxide
   based film. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis of the membrane electrode
   assemblies (MEAs) after the cell operation indicates that the 22Cr2Mo
   stainless steel was less contaminated with iron species. The above
   results suggest that the 22Cr2Mo stainless steel can be applicable to
   bipolar plates for PEMFC, especially 22 mass\% of chromium content in
   ferritic stainless steel with ELI system is, at least, demanded to
   ensure stable cell performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In the present study, we describe the purification and characterization
   of a metalloprotease `trimarin' from Trimeresurus malabaricus snake
   venom. Trimarin is a single-chain basic protein, with a molecular mass
   of 29.6 kDa. Trimarin showed proteolytic activity towards casein and
   fibrinogen, which was irreversibly inhibited by EDTA and
   1,10-phenanthroline. The metal ion associated with trimarin was found to
   be Zn2+. Trimarin exhibited pharmacological activities including
   hemorrhage, myotoxicity, procoagulant and factor Xa-like activities. The
   hemorrhage and myotoxicity correlated with degradation of extracellular
   protein components type-IV collagen and fibronectin. Myotoxicity due to
   muscle tissue necrosis was substantiated with increased serum CK
   activity. Trimarin showed procoagulant activity with reduced
   re-calcification time of citrated human plasma. Trimarin shortened the
   activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT),
   suggesting its involvement in common pathway of blood coagulation.
   Trimarin coagulated the citrated human plasma in the absence of CaCl2,
   but it was lacking thrombin like activity as it did not clot the
   purified fibrinogen. Remarkably, the enzyme clotted the factor X
   deficient human plasma, suggesting that trimarin has factor Xa-like
   activity. Thus, trimarin may play a key role in the pathophysiological
   conditions that occur during T. malabaricus envenomation, and may be
   used as a biological tool to explore many facets of hemostasis. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Invasive alien species cause considerable economic and environmental
   damage. Nevertheless which species should be targeted first and exact
   control strategies are controversial matters. As no categorization of
   the impact of alien bird species is available so far, we adopted an
   impact scoring system for mammals to birds and scored the impact of the
   alien birds established in Europe. We investigated 26 established alien
   birds in Europe and compiled all known impact data for these species.
   The species with highest environmental impact were the Canada goose
   (Branta canadensis), sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus) and ruddy
   duck (Oxyura jamaicensis). The most severe impact on economy was exerted
   again by the Canada goose. Also the ring-necked parakeet (Psittacula
   krameri) and monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) had high impact in this
   category. Combining these potential impact data with the current
   distribution generates a list of alien birds with highest actual impact.
   These two values can be used to prioritise preventive and control
   measures. In comparison to birds, mammals in general have higher
   potential and actual impact in Europe, but some bird species reach
   impact values as high as some of the worst mammal species. Still, these
   bird species - in contrast to mammals with high impact - are hardly
   targeted by control programmes. This study shows that there is no
   scientific reason for this. With the here presented scoring system we
   offer a decision tool to practitioners which supports them in finding an
   appropriate reaction to invasive birds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A non-woven cross-lapper machine uses the pulley block structure to pull
   the pulley bracket, which folds out the required web thickness and width
   of the non-woven products by the reciprocating motion of the pulleys.
   The system needs to move back and forth at a stable constant speed, and
   be able to stop at the precise position of the re-entry point when
   reciprocating. This paper deals with the modeling and control of the
   current new horizontal type cross-lapper machine. The Lagrange's
   equation is applied to derive the non-linear dynamic equation of the
   system. In the controller design, this study first obtains the transfer
   function of the high-order linearization system. Then, the approximation
   criterion is used to obtain the corresponding low-order system transfer
   function, so that the analysis and design effort is reduced. Both the
   realizable proportional and integral control, and pole-placement design
   through state feedback, are applied for the control system design. The
   performances of the designed controllers are verified through computer
   simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films were synthesized by pulsed laser deposition
   (PLD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 100 degrees C on glass, and
   their structural, electrical, and optical properties were compared
   before and after 300 degrees C post-deposition annealing in argon,
   vacuum, and air. The room temperature photoluminescence (PL) of the ALD
   films grown at 100 degrees C was characterized by a broad, defect
   emission band peaking at 605 nm, which decreased in intensity after
   annealing. In contrast, the PL of the PLD films was dominated by 385 nm
   emission, and luminescence at 425 nm was also observed. The PL intensity
   of these films increased after annealing. The data suggest that overall
   electrical and photoluminescent characteristics of the ALD films are
   determined by the relative zinc interstitial and oxygen vacancy
   concentrations which vary with annealing treatment. The electro-optical
   properties of the PLD films are determined by Zn interstitials. The
   potential impact of the observed absorption and emission bands on
   optoelectronic applications is discussed. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a single-beam optical tweezer integrated with
   a planar curved diffraction grating for microbead manipulation Various
   curvatures of the surface micromachined planar curved grating are
   systematically investigated. The planar curved grating was fabricated
   using multiuser micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) processes
   (MUMPs). The angular separation and the number of diffracted orders were
   determined. Experiment results indicated that the diffraction patterns
   and curvature of the planar curved grating are closely related. As the
   curvature of the planar curved grating increases, the vertical
   diffraction angle increases, resulting in the strip patterns of the
   planar curved grating A single-beam optical tweezer integrated with a
   planar curved diffraction grating was developed. We demonstrate a
   technique for creating multiple optical traps from a single laser beam
   using the developed planar curved grating. The strip patterns of the
   planar curved grating that resulted from diffraction were used to trap
   one row of polystyrene beads. (C) 2010 The Japan Society of Applied

Abstract = {{Kum-Ming Kuo and Keryea Soong (2010) Post-settlement survival of
   reef-coral juveniles in southern Taiwan. Zoological Studies 49(6):
   724-734. Studies of spatiotemporal settlement patterns of reef corals
   suggest uneven distributions through space and time. Whether the
   patterns reflect adaptations of early benthic stages or non-adaptive
   result from processes preceding settlement are not always clear. They,
   however, may be distinguished by testing how well newly settled
   juveniles survive in different places and times of the critical initial
   post-settlement period. Herein, we compared the survival of young coral
   that had settled in different seasons and in different habitats.
   Artificial settling plates were deployed at 2 mo intervals in southern
   Taiwan, and the fate of each naturally settled coral spat was monitored
   at 2 mo intervals for at least 1 yr after settlement, in 1998-2000.
   Spats of Pocilloporidae and Porites spp. constituted the majority of
   coral recruits. Pocilloporids exhibited significant seasonal variations
   in settlement densities, but poritids showed no such pattern. The
   probability of pocilloporids surviving an additional 2 mo increased from
   similar to 60\% at 2 mo old to virtually 100\% at 22 mo old. In Porites,
   the 2 mo survival rates were > 90\% in all age groups. Survivorship of
   pocilloporids and poritids was higher for those that settled in the dry
   season (Nov., Jan., and Mar.) than those that settled in the wet season
   (May, July, and Sept.), but no corresponding higher settlement rates
   were found for either taxon in the dry season. Recruits of both taxa
   showed greater survivorship when settled on younger than on older
   plates; however, only pocilloporids preferred young plates for
   settlement. Spat densities and survivorship rates were both higher at
   the margins than in the center of plates for both taxa. Thus, the
   settlement season was not related to higher post-recruitment survival,
   but spatial variation at settlement was, at least for these 2 taxa.

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Pituitary melanotrope cells of the amphibian Xenopus laevis are
   neuroendocrine cells regulating the animal's skin color adaptation
   through secretion of alpha-melanophore-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH).
   To fulfill this function optimally, the melanotrope cell undergoes
   plastic changes in structure and secretory activity in response to
   changed background light conditions. Xenopus melanotrope cells display
   Ca2+ oscillations that are thought to drive alpha-MSH secretion and gene
   expression. They also produce brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
   which stimulates in an autocrine way the biosynthesis of the alpha-MSH
   precursor, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). We have used this physiological
   adaptation mechanism as a model to investigate the role of BDNF in the
   regulation of Ca2+ kinetics and Ca2+-dependent gene expression. By
   dynamic video imaging of isolated cultured melanotropes we demonstrated
   that BDNF caused a dose-dependent increase in Ca2+ oscillation frequency
   up to 64.7 +/- 2.3\% of control level. BDNF also induced a transient
   Ca2+ peak in Ca2+-free medium, which was absent when calcium stores were
   blocked by thapsigargin and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, indicating
   that BDNF stimulates acute release of Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive
   intracellular Ca2+ stores. Moreover, we show that thapsigargin inhibits
   the expression of 8DNF transcript IV (by 61.1 +/- 28.8\%) but does not
   affect POMC transcript. We conclude that BDNF mobilizes Ca2+ from
   IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores and propose the possibility that
   the resulting Ca2+ oscillations selectively stimulate expression of the
   BDNF gene. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we extend the latent segmentation approach to the
   Kuhn-Tucker (KT) model. The proposed approach models heterogeneity in
   preferences for recreational behavior, using a utility theoretical
   framework to simultaneously model participation and site selection
   decisions. Estimation of the latent segmentation KT model with standard
   maximum likelihood techniques is numerically difficult because of the
   large number of parameters in the segment membership functions and the
   utility function for each latent segment. To address this problem, we
   propose the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the
   model. In the empirical section, we implement the EM latent segmentation
   KT approach to analyze a Southern California beach recreation data set.
   Our empirical analysis suggests that three groups exist in the sample.
   Using the model to analyze two hypothetical beach management policy
   scenarios illustrates different welfare impacts across groups. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{We evaluated the ability of six polyphenols isolated from the roots of
   Glycyrrhiza uralensis to inactivate rotaviruses, specially G5P{[}7] and
   G8P{[}7]. Upon finding that all polyphenols possessed anti-rotavirus
   activity, we evaluated whether these properties were attributable to
   direct inhibition of the binding of rotavirus to cells and/or to
   inhibition of viral replication. Using the virucidal assay, we found
   that all six compounds directly inhibited rotavirus binding, with
   activity being dependent on the type of virus. The 50\% effective
   inhibitory concentrations (EC50) of the six compounds were 18.7-69.5 mu
   M against G5P{[}7] and 14.7-88.1 mu M against G8P{[}7], respectively.
   Five of the six compounds inhibited hemagglutination activity. Moreover,
   the CPE inhibition assay showed that five compounds inhibited viral
   replication with EC50 values of 12.1-24.0 mu M against G5P{[}7] and
   12.0-42.0 mu M against G8P{[}7], respectively. RT-PCR showed that the
   compounds suppressed viral RNA synthesis in TF-104 cells. Interestingly,
   the anti-rotavirus activities of four compounds were attributable to
   inhibition of both viral absorption and viral replication. These results
   suggest that compounds isolated from the roots of G. uralensis may be
   potent anti-rotavirus agents in vivo, acting by inhibiting both viral
   absorption and viral replication. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Building period formulas in seismic design code are evaluated with over
   800 apparent building periods from 191 building stations and 67
   earthquake events. The evaluation is carried out with the formulas in
   ASCE 7-05 for steel and RC moment-resisting frames, shear wall
   buildings, braced frames, and other structural types. Qualitative
   comparison of measured periods and periods calculated from the code
   formulas shows that the formula for steel moment-resisting frames
   generally predicts well the lower bound of the measured periods for all
   building heights. But the differences between the periods from code
   formula and measured periods of low- to-medium rise buildings are
   relatively high. In addition, the periods of essential buildings
   designed with the importance factor are about 40\% shorter than the
   periods of non-essential buildings. The code formula for RC
   moment-resisting frames describes well the lower bound of measured
   periods. The formula for braced frames accurately predicts the lower
   bound periods of low-to-medium rise buildings. The formula for shear
   wall buildings overestimates periods for all building heights. For
   buildings that are classified as other structural types, the measured
   building periods can be much shorter than the periods calculated with
   the code formula. Based on these observations, it is suggested to use
   C(r) factor of 0.015 for shear walls and other structural types.

Abstract = {{The coupling-from-the-past (CFTP) algorithm of Propp and Wilson permits
   one to sample exactly from the stationary distribution of an ergodic
   Markov chain. By using it n times independently, we obtain an
   independent sample from that distribution. A more representative sample
   can be obtained by creating negative dependence between these n
   replicates; other authors have already proposed to do this via
   antithetic variates, Latin hypercube sampling, and randomized
   quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC). We study a new, often more effective, way of
   combining CFTP with RQMC, based on the array-RQMC algorithm. We provide
   numerical illustrations for Markov chains with both finite and
   continuous state spaces, and compare with the RQMC combinations proposed

Abstract = {{This is the first paper of a series presenting the Spheroids
   Panchromatic Investigation in Different Environmental Regions (SPIDER).
   The sample of spheroids consists of 5080 bright (M-r < -20) early-type
   galaxies (ETGs), in the redshift range of 0.05 to 0.095, with optical
   (griz) photometry and spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
   Data Release 6 (SDSS-DR6) and near-infrared (YJHK) photometry from the
   UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey-Large Area Survey (UKIDSS-LAS) (DR4). We
   describe how homogeneous photometric parameters (galaxy colours and
   structural parameters) are derived using grizYJHK wavebands. We find no
   systematic steepening of the colour-magnitude relation when probing the
   baseline from g - r to g - K, implying that internal colour gradients
   drive most of the mass-metallicity relation in ETGs. As far as
   structural parameters are concerned we find that the mean effective
   radius of ETGs smoothly decreases, by 30 per cent, from g through K,
   while no significant dependence on waveband is detected for the axial
   ratio, Sersic index and a(4) parameters. Furthermore, velocity
   dispersions are remeasured for all the ETGs using starlight and compared
   to those obtained by SDSS. The velocity dispersions are rederived using
   a combination of simple stellar population models as templates, hence
   accounting for the kinematics of different galaxy stellar components. We
   compare our (2dphot) measurements of total magnitude, effective radius
   and mean surface brightness with those obtained as part of the SDSS
   pipeline (photo). Significant differences are found and reported,
   including comparisons with a third and independent part. A full
   characterization of the sample completeness in all wavebands is
   presented, establishing the limits of application of the characteristic
   parameters presented here for the analysis of the global scaling
   relations of ETGs.}},

   the relative contribution of this type of confabulation, which we refer
   to as Habits Confabulation (HC), to confabulations produced by 10 mild
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 8 confabulating amnesics (CA) of
   various etiologies On the Confabulation Battery (Dalla Barba 1993a,

   of various kinds of semantic and episodic information patients produced
   a total of 424 confabulation HC accounted for 42\% and 62\% of
   confabulations in AD patients and CA, respectively This result indicates
   that regardless the clinical diagnosis the brain pathology or their

   to provide map users with a profounder use experience. The paper reviews
   previous studies and describes the sonic map implementations

Abstract = {{Pathogen sensing by the inflammasome activates inflammatory caspases
   that mediate inflammation and cell death. Caspase-12 antagonizes the
   inflammasome and NF-kappa B and is associated with susceptibility to
   bacterial sepsis. A single-nucleotide polymorphism ((TC)-C-125) in human
   Casp12 restricts its expression to Africa, Southeast Asia, and South
   America. Here, we investigated the role of caspase-12 in the control of
   parasite replication and pathogenesis in malaria and report that
   caspase-12 dampened parasite clearance in blood-stage malaria and
   modulated susceptibility to cerebral malaria. This response was
   independent of the caspase-1 inflammasome, as casp1(-/-) mice were
   indistinguishable from wild-type animals in response to malaria, but
   dependent on enhanced NF-kappa B activation. Mechanistically, caspase-12
   competed with NEMO for association with I kappa B kinase-alpha/beta,
   effectively preventing the formation of the I kappa B kinase complex and
   inhibiting downstream transcriptional activation by NF-kappa B. Systemic
   inhibition of NF-kappa B or Ab neutralization of IFN-gamma reversed the
   increased resistance of casp12(-/-) mice to blood-stage malaria
   infection. The Journal of Immunology, 2010, 185: 5495-5502.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objective: Despite numerous hypotheses regarding the
   action of laser light, the use of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in
   ischemic reperfusion (I/R) injury is still being verified. The present
   study investigates the effects of low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) on
   I/R injury of the musculus gracilis in rats.
   Materials and Methods: I/R injury of the musculus gracilis flap was
   induced in male adult Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 84). Rats were subdivided
   depending on treatment into four subgroups: (1) healthy group, (2) I/R
   injury without irradiation, (3) R group irradiated only during
   reperfusion after injury, and (4) IR group irradiated during ischemia
   and reperfusion injury. LLLT (AlGaInP; lambda = 670 nm; 4 J/cm(2); 40
   mW/cm(2)) was applied to the injured muscle four times daily until
   euthanasia.
   Results: Lactate dehydrogenase (LD) levels were significantly lower
   (P<0.05) in the irradiated groups during the first 12-120 hours, while
   the lower creatine kinase (CK) level reached statistical significance
   only at 24 hours in the irradiated group when compared to the control
   group. The number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the gracilis muscle
   was significantly lower in the treated group only on the second day
   (P<0.0001). The lowered percentage of necrosis in the muscle tissue was
   statistically significant after 6 and 10 days of treatment (P<0.0001),
   while lower atrophy and higher neovascularization were observed at 614
   days of irradiation (P<0.05). There was no statistically significant
   difference between the group irradiated only during reperfusion and that
   irradiated during ischemia and reperfusion.
   Conclusion: LLLT confers a protective effect against early inflammatory
   tissue response, further atrophy, and necrosis of the muscle and it
   stimulates neovascularization after I/R injury. Lasers Surg. Med.

Title = {{Resistance to Brand Switching When a Radically New Brand Is Introduced:
   A Social Identity Theory Perspective}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MARKETING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{128-146}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{There has been little research on how market disruptions affect customer
   brand relationships and how firms can sustain brand loyalty when
   disruptions occur. Drawing from social identity theory and the brand
   loyalty literature, the authors propose a conceptual framework to
   examine these issues in a specific market disruption, namely, the
   introduction of a radically new brand. The framework focuses on the
   time-varying effects of customers' identification with and perceived
   value of the incumbent relative to the new brand on switching behavior.
   The authors divert from the conventional economic perspective of
   treating brand switching as functional utility maximization to propose
   that brand switching can also result from customers' social mobility
   between brand identities. The results from longitudinal data of 679
   customers during the launch of the iPhone in Spain show that both
   relative customer brand identification and relative perceived value of
   the incumbent inhibit switching behavior, but their effects vary over
   time. Relative customer brand identification with the incumbent
   apparently exerts a stronger longitudinal restraint on switching
   behavior than relative perceived value of the incumbent. The study has
   important strategic implications for devising customer relationship
   strategies and brand investment.}},

Title = {{HIV-1 Induces DCIR Expression in CD4(+) T Cells}},
Journal = {{PLOS PATHOGENS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The C-type lectin receptor DCIR, which has been shown very recently to
   act as an attachment factor for HIV-1 in dendritic cells, is expressed
   predominantly on antigen-presenting cells. However, this concept was
   recently challenged by the discovery that DCIR can also be detected in
   CD4(+) T cells found in the synovial tissue from rheumatoid arthritis
   (RA) patients. Given that RA and HIV-1 infections share common features
   such as a chronic inflammatory condition and polyclonal immune
   hyperactivation status, we hypothesized that HIV-1 could promote DCIR
   expression in CD4(+) T cells. We report here that HIV-1 drives DCIR
   expression in human primary CD4(+) T cells isolated from patients (from
   both aviremic/treated and viremic/treatment naive persons) and cells
   acutely infected in vitro (seen in both virus-infected and uninfected
   cells). Soluble factors produced by virus-infected cells are responsible
   for the noticed DCIR up-regulation on uninfected cells. Infection
   studies with Vpr-or Nef-deleted viruses revealed that these two viral
   genes are not contributing to the mechanism of DCIR induction that is
   seen following acute infection of CD4(+) T cells with HIV-1. Moreover,
   we report that DCIR is linked to caspase-dependent (induced by a
   mitochondria-mediated generation of free radicals) and -independent
   intrinsic apoptotic pathways (involving the death effector AIF).
   Finally, we demonstrate that the higher surface expression of DCIR in
   CD4(+) T cells is accompanied by an enhancement of virus
   attachment/entry, replication and transfer. This study shows for the
   first time that HIV-1 induces DCIR membrane expression in CD4(+) T
   cells, a process that might promote virus dissemination throughout the
   infected organism.}},

   An almost complete stylonurid, Pagea plotnicki sp. nov., is recognized

   evidence that Stylonurus and Pagea are sister-taxa. Also, a smaller
   incomplete rhenopterid assigned to Leiopterella tetliei gen. et sp.
   nov., is characterized by its broad turbinate carapace and lack of
   cuticular sculpture. This assemblage provides the first Canadian record
   of Pagea, and the youngest occurrence of a rhenopterid outside the

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose:
   Recently, intraocular lenses (IOLs) that possess an aspheric design,
   compensating for the spherical aberration (SA) of the cornea, have been
   developed. We designed this study to compare a group of patients who had
   undergone bilateral cataract surgery and had received one spherical IOL
   and one aspheric IOL, to assess their ocular preference.
   Methods:
   Patients were recruited from those who had undergone bilateral cataract
   surgery during the preceding six months (32 patients). Types of aspheric
   IOLs, which were used included: Tecnis ZA9003, AcrysofIQ SN60WF and
   Akreos Adapt AO. Contrast acuity was measured using a CSV-1000CVA
   instrument and spherical aberration (SA) was measured using a Zywave
   aberrometer. Patients also answered a brief questionnaire, designed to
   determine whether they could detect any difference between their
   spherical and aspheric IOLs and whether they had an ocular preference.
   Results:
   No differences were found between spherical and aspheric IOLs in
   contrast acuity. Total ocular spherical aberration was greater among
   eyes with spherical IOLs compared with aspheric IOLs (t = 6.67; p <
   0.0001). Patients' ocular preference was unrelated to the presence of an
   aspheric IOL or the amount of spherical aberration, but was associated
   with the level of ametropia and visual acuity.
   Conclusions:
   We were unable to find any impact on a patient's subjective visual
   quality from a reduction of spherical aberration by the presence of an
   aspheric IOL. Ocular preference was determined by level of visual acuity
   and degree of ametropia post-operatively.}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) patients typically suffer from motor disorders
   but mild to severe cognitive deficits can also be present.
   Neuropathology of PD primarily involves loss of dopaminergic neurons in
   the substantia nigra, pars compacta, although more widespread pathology
   from the brainstem to the cerebral cortex occurs at different stages of
   the disease. Cognitive deficits in PD are thought to involve the
   cerebral cortex, and imaging studies have identified the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as a possible site for some of the symptoms.
   GABAergic neurons in the cerebral cortex play a key role in the
   modulation of pyramidal neurons and alterations in muscimol binding to
   GABA(A) receptors have been reported in Brodmann area 9 (BA9) of the
   prefrontal cortex in PD patients (Nishino et al., 1988). In order to
   further assess the likelihood that GABAergic activity is altered in the
   prefrontal cortex in PD, gene expression of the 67 kilodalton isoform of
   the GABA-synthesizing enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67 encoded
   by the GAD1 gene), was examined in BA9 of post-mortem brains from 19
   patients and 20 controls using isotopic in situ hybridization
   histochemistry. GAD67 mRNA labeling was examined and quantified on X-ray
   films and emulsion radioautographs. We show that GAD67 mRNA labeling is
   significantly lower in PD compared to control cases. Analysis of
   emulsion radioautographs indicates that GAD67 mRNA labeling is decreased
   in individual neurons and is not paralleled by a decrease in the number
   of GAD67 mRNA-labeled neurons. Analysis of expression data from a
   microarray study performed in 29 control and 33 PD samples from BA9
   confirms that GAD67 expression is decreased in PD. Another finding from
   the microarray study is a negative relationship between GAD67 mRNA
   expression and age at death. Altogether, the results support the
   possibility that GABAergic neurotransmission is impaired in the DLPFC in
   PD, an effect that may be involved in some of the behavioral deficits
   associated with the disease. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fabricating domain reversal directly induced by femtosecond laser is a
   novel and promising method to induce micron-period or even
   submicron-period inverted domain structure for it averts the domain
   spreading and mergence which is hard to avoid by traditional
   electric-field poling method. In this paper, the domain reversal process
   in lithium niobate crystal by irradiation of femtosecond pulses whose
   spatial and temporal distributions are taken into consideration is
   numerically simulated in the framework of Fahy's model. The simulation
   results manifest the domain inversion window theory and predict the
   threshold reversal fluence. The experiment to form domain reversal via
   direct illumination with femtosecond laser in Y-cut lithium niobate
   samples was conducted at room temperature. The multi-ring-like
   structures on the processed samples tally with the inversion window
   theory and the calculated threshold reversal fluence is well within the
   scope obtained by simulation, which serves as a corroborative evidence
   to prove the domain reversals can be formed by direct irradiation with
   femtosecond laser in lithium niobate.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cephalocranial disproportion describes a state of volume
   mismatch between brain size and intracranial space. Nonsyndromic
   single-suture craniosynostosis patients can present with symptoms from
   elevated intracranial pressure because of inadequate or delayed
   treatment. The purpose of this study was to present five sagittal
   synostosis children with symptomatic cephalocranial disproportion
   treated with cranial vault distraction osteogenesis.
   Methods: Asymmetric transverse internal distraction osteogenesis was
   performed to preferentially expand the posterior cranium. A wider base
   plate, pivot screw, anterior hinge plate, and flexible drive rod were
   applied to minimize device failure while accomplishing lateral rotation
   of parietal bones. A distraction protocol was developed and produced
   consistent results.
   Results: Two girls and three boys underwent distraction for sagittal
   synostosis between 2002 and 2006. Average age at surgery was 5.8 years.
   All had resolution or amelioration of preoperative symptoms. Average
   operating room time for distractor placement was 2.5 hours (152 minutes)
   and average hospital stay was 2.8 days. The average distracted distance
   was 14.4 mm. Average operating room time for distractor removal was 1.1
   hours (69 minutes) and average hospital stay was 1.6 days. No
   perioperative complications occurred. Average follow-up period was 4.2
   years, with no recurrence of symptoms.
   Conclusions: Symptomatic cephalocranial disproportion can present in
   older children with craniosynostosis. Asymmetric transverse distraction
   of the posterior cranial vault is a safe and effective treatment
   modality for this population. (Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 126: 1677, 2010.)}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify changes in the oral
   environment with clinical, salivary and bacterial risk markers after
   placement of fixed orthodontic appliances on permanent dentition.
   Material and Methods: With ethical approval, we used different
   techniques to analyzed clinical, salivary and bacterial risk markers in
   34 patients (mean age, 16.7 +/- 5.2 years), 14 males and 20 females;
   before starting orthodontic treatment and 1 month after. Clinical risk
   markers (decayed, missing, and filled surfaces {[}DMFS], O'Leary's
   plaque index, and plaque pH); salivary markers (unstimulated and
   stimulated saliva flow rate, buffer capacity, pH, and occult blood in
   saliva) and bacterial counts (Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus).
   Data were analyzed by paired t-test and chi(2) test.
   Results: This study showed that orthodontic appliances increased the
   stimulated salivary flow rate (p=0.0001), buffer capacity (p=0.0359),
   salivary pH (p=0.0246) and occult blood in saliva (p=0.0305). Bacterial
   levels increased slightly after 1 month of treatment, without
   statistical significance. Between genders, initially we observed
   differences in: stimulated saliva (p=0.0019), buffer capacity (p=0.0381)
   and plaque pH (p=0.0430); after treatment the unstimulated saliva
   (p=0.0026) showed differences.
   Conclusions: Orthodontic treatment changes the oral environmental
   factors, promotes an increase in stimulated flow rate, buffer capacity
   and salivary pH, which augment the anti caries activity of saliva. In
   contrast, increased occult blood indicated more gingival inflammation,
   apparently because augmented the retentive plaque surfaces and the
   difficult to maintain a good oral hygiene, rinsed the bleeding in saliva
   by periodontal damage.}},

Abstract = {{Due to anthropogenic actions, species have become endangered or have
   been driven to the verge of extinction, requiring conservation plans to
   be developed and implemented. These plans include measures to protect
   and enhance remaining populations and to reintroduce populations within
   the native ranges. However, future habitat suitability in the face of
   climate change is rarely assessed, despite the fact that it could
   compromise conservation opportunities. It is attempted to carry this
   task out for the critically endangered European Atlantic sturgeon
   (Acipenser sturio). Species presence/absence was documented for 196
   basins between 1750 and 1850 over the Western Palearctic. A predictive
   distribution model was established from this database using Boosted
   Regression Trees (BRT) and a pool of relevant environmental variables.
   Projections were performed at two time-steps, 2050 and 2100, using the
   HadCM3 Global Climate Model (GCM) and the A2 and A1FI emissions
   scenarios. The BRT model incorporated two general climatic descriptors,
   summer precipitation and annual air temperature, average slope served as
   a topographic predictor, and marine provinces as a macroecological
   variable. The statistical model performance allowed projections with the
   predictive deviance being 29 +/- 2.80 and the Area Under the Curve (AUC)
   being 0.86 +/- 0.02. The results obtained are in accordance with the
   species thermal preferences and with its hydrological habitat
   requirements. Most of the former sturgeon distribution range was
   assessed as being strongly affected by climate change, especially basins
   along the southern limit of its range. On this basis, proposals to
   integrate the climate change dimension into conservation strategy are
   discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aim Injury-induced anergy is one of the key factors
   contributing to trauma victims' high susceptibility to sepsis This group
   of patients is mostly of young age and it is therefore essential to be
   able to predict as accurately as possible the development of septic
   complications, so appropriate treatment could be provided The aim of
   this study was to assess kinetics of interleukin (IL) -6 and -10,
   phospholipase A(2)-II and C-reactive protein (CRP) in severely
   traumatized patients and explore the possibilities for early detection
   of potentially septic patients Methods This prospective study included
   65 traumatized patients with injury seventy score (ISS) > 18, requiring
   treatment at surgical intensive care units, divided Into two groups 24
   patients without sepsis and 41 patients with sepsis C-reactive protein,
   IL-6 and -10 and phospholipase A(2) group II, were determined within the
   first 24 hours, and on the second, third and seventh day of
   hospitalization Results Mean values of IL-6 and phospholipase A(2)-II in
   the patients with and without sepsis did not show a statistically
   significant difference on any assessed time points In the septic
   patients with ISS 29-35 and > 35 on the days two and seven a
   statistically significantly lower level of IL-10 was found, compared
   with those without sepsis and with the same ISS C-reactive protein
   levels were significantly higher in septic patients with ISS 18-28 on
   the first day On the second, third and seventh day CRP levels were
   significantly lower in the groups of septic patients with ISS 29-35 and
   > 35, than in those with the same ISS but without sepsis Conclusion Mean
   levels of CRP on the first day after the injury may be useful predictor
   of sepsis development in traumatized patients with ISS score 18-28 Mean
   levels of CRP on the days two, three and seven after the injury may be a
   useful predictor of sepsis development in traumatized patients with ISS
   score more than 28 Mean levels of IL-10 on the second and seventh day
   after the injury may be a useful predictor of sepsis development in
   traumatized patients with ISS score > 28}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider an initial-boundary value problem for the
   Korteweg-de Vries equation on the positive quarter-plane. The normalised
   Korteweg-de Vries equation considered is given by
   u(tau) + uu(x) + u(xx x) = 0, 0 < x < infinity, tau > 0,
   where x and tau represent dimensionless distance and time, respectively.
   In particular, we consider the case when the initial and boundary
   conditions are given by u(x, 0) = u(i) for 0 < x < infinity and u(0,
   tau) = u(b) for tau > 0, respectively. Here, the initial value u(i) > 0
   and we restrict attention to values of the boundary value, u(b), for
   which u(b) < u(i). We consider the three cases (u(i) > 0, u(b) < 0),
   (u(i) > 0, u(b) = 0) and (u(i) > 0, 0 < u(b) < u(i)). In each case, the
   method of matched asymptotic coordinate expansions is used to obtain the
   large-tau asymptotic structure of the solution to this problem, which
   exhibits the formation of an expansion wave solution.}},

Abstract = {{Exercise impacts the cellular response and behavioral recovery following
   stroke, but has not been widely investigated in aged animals. We tested
   the hypothesis that gentle post-stroke exercise could enhance recovery
   of somatosensory function and influence survival and phenotype of newly
   generated cells in the pen-infarct region after focal cortical ischemia
   in aged rats. Focal stroke was induced in the forelimb area of the
   sensorimotor cortex in 18-month old male rats using the vasoconstrictor
   endothelin-1. Beginning 1 week after stroke or sham surgery, half of the
   animals walked 100-300 m daily, 5 days per week. Bromodeoxyuridine
   (BrdU) was administered on days 6-8 post-stroke in order to label
   proliferating cells, the survival and phenotype of which were examined 4
   weeks later using confocal microscopy. Post-stroke exercise enhanced
   recovery of somatosensory function as measured by the Adhesive Removal
   Test. Stroke, but not exercise, increased the number of BrdU+ cells in
   the pen-infarct region. In aged rats, mild post-stroke exercise enhances
   recovery of somatosensation, but has little effect on survival and
   phenotype of cells born in response to ischemia. Our results underscore
   the need for further study of clinically relevant post-stroke exercise
   regimens. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The perception of takyrs as clayey mineral soils extremely poor in humus
   and occurring in deserts was supported by micromorphological studies
   with the first ones being performed by I. I. Feofarova for the takyrs in
   Western Turkmenia. However, in the fundamental monograph of 1956, there
   were abundant data on the contribution of biota (primarily of algae and
   invertebrates) to the takyr formation. The importance of the biota was
   emphasized by N.I. Bazilevich, who was an active participant in terrain
   and analytical investigations of Western Turkmenia takyrs. The
   micromorphological analysis, along with the studies of the chemical and
   mineralogical properties of the algal takyr on the Kopet-Dag piedmont
   plain, made it possible to introduce some corrections to the concepts
   concerning the mechanisms of takyr development; the contribution of
   blue-green algae, microorganisms, and zooplankton was shown to be
   prominent. The available information on the properties and ecology of
   blue-green algae enabled the authors to interpret both their own data
   and the micromorphological descriptions made by I.I. Feofarova in the
   1950s. The uppermost subhorizons are proposed to be regarded as the soil
   miniprofiles, whose properties are strongly affected by the activity of
   aquatic and terrestrial microorganisms, rather than the sedimentation
   strata.}},

Title = {{Bioturbation, short-lived radioisotopes, and the tracer-dependence of

Abstract = {{Bioturbation refers to the mixing of sediment particles resulting from
   benthic faunal activity. It is the dominant particle mixing process in
   most marine sediments and exerts an important control on diagenetic
   processes. In models, bioturbation is usually treated as a diffusive
   process where the biodiffusion coefficient (D-b) characterizes the
   biological mixing intensity. Biodiffusion coefficients are classically
   computed by fitting a diffusive model to vertical profiles of
   particle-bound radioisotopes. One peculiar observation is
   tracer-dependence: D-b values from short-lived tracers tend to be larger
   than those obtained from long-lived tracers from the same site. Recent
   theoretical work, based on random walk theory and Lattice Automaton
   Bioturbation Simulations (LABS), has suggested that this
   tracer-dependence is simply a model artifact and has concluded that the
   biodiffusion model is not applicable to the short observational time
   scales associated with short-lived radioisotopes. Here we have compiled
   a global dataset of D-b values obtained from different radiotracers to
   assess tracer-dependence from a data perspective. Tracer-dependence is
   significant in low-mixing environments like slope and deep-sea
   sediments, but is not present in intensely mixed coastal areas.
   Tracer-dependence is absent when the number of mixing events is larger
   than 20, or the potential length scale is greater than 0.5 cm. Roughly
   this comes down to tracer-derived D-b values greater than 2 cm(2)
   yr(-1). This condition is met for 68\%, 50\%, and 8\% of published D-b
   values obtained from coastal, continental slope, and abyssal
   environments, respectively. These results show that short-lived
   radioisotopes are suitable to quantify biodiffusion mixing in
   sedimentary environments featuring intense bioturbation. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Lying behavior in dairy cattle can provide insight into how cows
   interact with their environment. Although lying behavior is a useful
   indicator of cow comfort, it can be time consuming to measure. In
   response to these time constraints, using data loggers to automate
   behavioral recording has become increasingly common. We tested the
   accuracy of the Onset Pendant G data logger (Onset Computer Corporation,
   Bourne, MA) for measuring lying behavior in dairy cattle (n = 24 cows;
   12 in each of 2 experiments). Cows wore the logger on the lateral
   (experiment 1) or medial (experiment 2) side of the hind leg above the
   metatarsophalangeal joint. Loggers recorded behavior at 4 sampling
   intervals (6, 30, 60, and 300 s) for at least 1.5 d. Data were smoothed
   using 3 editing methods to examine the effects of short, potentially
   erroneous readings. For this purpose, Microsoft Excel macros (Microsoft
   Corp., Redmond, WA) converted readings (i.e., lying events bordered by
   standing or vice versa) occurring singly or in consecutive runs of <= 2
   or <= 6. Behavior was simultaneously recorded with digital video
   equipment. The logger accurately measured lying and standing. For
   example, predictability, sensitivity, and specificity were >99\% using
   30-s sampling and the single-event filter compared with continuously
   scored video recordings. The 6- and 30-s sampling intervals were
   comparable for all aspects of lying behavior when short events were
   filtered from the data set. Estimates of lying time generated from the
   300-s interval unfiltered regimen were positively related (R-2 >= 0.99)
   to estimates of lying time from video, but this sampling regimen
   overestimated the number of lying bouts. This is likely because short
   standing and lying bouts were missed (12 and 34\% of lying and standing
   bouts were <300 s in experiment 1 and 2, respectively). In summary, the
   data logger accurately measured all aspects of lying behavior when the
   sampling interval was <= 30 s and when short readings of lying and
   standing were filtered from the data set.}},

Abstract = {{The similarities and contrasts between native and non-native
   identification of multi-speaker Mandarin tones in quiet and in noise
   were explored in a perception experiment. Mandarin tone materials
   produced by three male and three female speakers were presented with
   five levels of signal-to-noise ratios (quiet, 0, -5, -10, and -15 dB) in
   two presentation formats (blocked by speaker and mixed across speakers)
   to listeners with various Mandarin experience (native, first-year,
   second-year, third-year, and fourth-year students). Stimuli blocked by
   speaker yielded higher accuracy and shorter reaction time. The
   additional demand of processing mixed-speaker stimuli, however, did not
   compromise non-native performance more than native performance. Noise
   expectedly compromised identification performance, although it did not
   compromise non-native identification more than native identification.
   Native listeners expectedly outperformed non-native listeners, although
   identification performance did not vary systematically as a function of
   duration of Mandarin experience. It is speculated that sources of
   variability in speech would affect non-native more than native tone

Abstract = {{Sensitive biomarkers are lacking in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
   Muscle ultrasound (MUS) can quantify muscle thickness and echointensity

   patients had serial unilateral MUS examination of biceps, wrist flexors,
   and tibialis anterior over 6 months. The rates of change of muscle
   thickness and El were determined. Muscle thickness declined at a mean
   rate of -0.663 mm/month (P = 0.0014), greatest in biceps. Muscle
   thickness correlated moderately with ALSFRS-R, grip dynamometry, and
   body weight. There was no change in El. MUS can quantify the rate of
   reduction in muscle thickness in ALS patients. The lack of strong
   correlation between muscle thickness and standard ALS measures may
   reflect limited sensitivity in these conventional measures. The rate of
   change of muscle thickness merits further study as a potential biomarker
   in ALS, particularly when considering biceps brachii as a candidate.

Abstract = {{Race and ethnicity are influential in estimating glomerular filtration
   rate (GFR). We aimed to find the Korean coefficients for the
   Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equations and to
   obtain novel proper estimation equations. Reference GFR was measured by
   systemic inulin clearance. Serum creatinine (SCr) values were measured
   by the alkaline picrate Jaffe kinetic method, then, recalibrated to CX3
   analyzer and to isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS). The Korean
   coefficients for the 4 and 6 variable MDRD and IDMS MDRD study equations
   based on the SCr recalibrated to CX3 and to IDMS were 0.73989/0.74254
   and 0.99096/0.9554, respectively. Coefficients for the 4 and 6 variable
   MDRD equations based on the SCr measured by Jaffe method were 1.09825
   and 1.04334, respectively. The modified equations showed better
   performances than the original equations. The novel 4 variable equations
   for Korean based on the SCr measured and recalibrated to IDMS were
   107.904xSCr(-1.009)xage(-0.02) (x0.667, if woman) and
   87.832xSCr(-0.882)xage(0.01) (x0.653, if woman), respectively. Modified
   estimations of the MDRD and IDMS MDRD study equations with ethnic
   coefficients and the novel equations improve the performance of GFR
   estimation for the overall renal function.}},

Abstract = {{Genomic imprints-parental allele-specific DNA methylation marks at the
   differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of imprinted genes-are erased
   and reestablished in germ cells according to the individual's sex.
   Imprint establishment at paternally methylated germ line DMRs occurs in
   fetal male germ cells. In prospermatogonia, the two unmethylated alleles
   exhibit different rates of de novo methylation at the H19/Igf2
   imprinting control region (ICR) depending on parental origin. We
   investigated the nature of this epigenetic memory using bisulfite
   sequencing and allele-specific ChIP-SNuPE assays. We found that the
   chromatin composition in fetal germ cells was biased at the ICR between
   the two alleles with the maternally inherited allele exhibiting more
   H3K4me3 and less H3K9me3 than the paternally inherited allele. We
   determined genetically that the chromatin bias, and also the delayed
   methylation establishment in the maternal allele, depended on functional
   CTCF insulator binding sites in the ICR. Our data suggest that, in
   primordial germ cells, maternally inherited allele-specific CTCF binding
   sets up allele-specific chromatin differences at the ICR. The erasure of
   these allele-specific chromatin marks is not complete before the process
   of de novo methylation imprint establishment begins. CTCF-dependent
   allele-specific chromatin composition imposes a maternal allele-specific
   delay on de novo methylation imprint establishment at the H19/Igf2 ICR
   in prospermatogonia.}},

Abstract = {{The objective was to determine whether alterations of histone
   acetylation status in donor cells affected inter-generic SCNT
   (igSCNT)-cloned embryo development. Leopard cat cells were treated with
   trichostatin A (TSA; a histone deacetylase inhibitor) for 48 h, and then
   donor cells were transferred into enucleated oocytes from domestic cats.
   Compared to non-treated cells, the acetylated histone 3 at lysine 9
   (AcH3K9) and histone 4 at lysine 5 (AcH4K5) in the TSA group increased
   for up to 48 h (P < 0.05). The AcH3K9 signal ratios of igSCNT group was
   higher than control group 3 h after activation (P < 0.05). Treatment
   with TSA significantly increased total cell number of blastocysts (109.1
   +/- 6.9 vs. 71.8 +/- 2.9, mean +/- SEM), with no significant effects on
   rates of cleavage or blastocyst development (71.1 +/- 2.8 vs. 67.6 +/-
   2.9 and 12.2 +/- 2.6 vs. 11.0 +/- 2.6, respectively). When igSCNT cloned
   embryos were transferred into a domestic cat oviduct and recovered after
   8 d, blastocyst development rates and total cell numbers were greater in
   the TSA-igSCNT group (20.7 +/- 3.0\% and 2847.6 +/- 37.2) than in the
   control igSCNT group (5.7 +/- 2.2\% and 652.1 +/- 17.6, P < 0.05).
   Average total cell numbers of blastocysts were approximately 4.4-fold
   higher in the TSA-igSCNT group (2847.6 +/- 37.2, n = 10) than in the
   control group (652.1 17.6, n = 8; P < 0.05), but were similar to
   2.9-fold lower than in vivo cat blastocysts produced by intrauterine
   insemination (8203.8 +/- 29.6, n = 5; P < 0.001). Enhanced histone
   acetylation levels of donor cells improved in vivo developmental
   competence and quality of inter-generic cloned embryos; however, fewer
   cells in blastocysts derived from igSCNT than blastocysts produced by
   insemination may reduce development potential following intergeneric
   cloning (none of the cloned embryos were maintained to term). (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Contamination by heavy metals and sex hormones in a water environment is
   an important health issue. In this study, we investigated the estrogenic
   effects of cadmium (Cd) administration alone and in combination with
   17beta-estradiol (E2) on the hepatocytes of male Bullfrog (Rana
   catesbeiana). Their vitellogenin (VTG) expression and reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) were analyzed upon exposure to Cd alone or to both Cd and
   E2. Our results suggest that the VTG levels induced by the co-treatment
   of 100 nM E2 and 100 nM CdCl2 were significantly higher than those
   induced by 100 nM E2 alone (p < 0.05), and were comparable to
   vitellogenin induction observed with 1 mu M E2. A similar result was
   observed by western blot analysis in the culture medium of hepatocytes.
   Meanwhile, Cd (but not E2) increased the ROS levels. These results
   suggest that Cd has a cooperative effect with E2 in the induction of
   VTG, thus acting as an estrogenic disruptor. Cd also causes oxidative
   stress that occurs with the enhanced vitellogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{In the offering of broadband wireless services a common objective for a
   service provider (carrier) is to choose a resource allocation policy for
   multiple service classes that maximizes profit. However, when doing so
   the policy may not be utility-optimal. This causes users to decrease
   their consumption, which leads to a decrease of profit for service
   providers. Therefore, a service provider should choose a
   Pareto-efficient resource allocation policy so that both the profit of
   the service provider and the utility of the users can be optimally
   balanced. In this paper, we develop a framework for finding the
   necessary and sufficient condition for Pareto-efficiency, derive the
   Pareto-efficient resource allocation policies and propose an efficient
   solution for achieving it in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate how clinical features
   such as sex, age, etiologic factors, and presenting symptoms of
   odontogenic sinusitis are differentiated from other types of sinusitis.
   Also, this study was designed to find methods for reducing the incidence
   of odontogenic sinusitis. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart
   analysis was completed on twenty-seven patients with odontogenic
   sinusitis. They were all treated at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital between
   February 2006 and August 2008. The study protocol and informed consent
   forms were approved by the institutional review boards for human beings
   at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital. Results: Ten patients (37.0\%) had dental
   implant related complications and 8 (29.6\%) had dental extraction
   related complications. Unilateral purulent nasal discharge was the most
   common symptom (66.7\%). The therapeutic modality included transnasal
   endoscopic sinus surgery in 19 (70.4\%) patients, and a Caldwell-Luc
   operation in two (7.4\%) patients. Conclusion: In our study, there was
   no significant difference in the incidence between genders. The average
   age of the patients was 42.9 years. The incidence was highest in the
   fourth decade. There were no significant differences between the
   symptoms of odontogenic sinusitis and that of other types of sinusitis.
   However, almost all of the patients with odontogenic sinusitis had
   unilateral symptoms. latrogenic causes, which include dental implants
   and dental extractions, were the most common etiologic factors related
   to the development of odontogenic sinusitis. Therefore, a preoperative
   consultation between a rhinologist and a dentist prior to the dental
   procedure should be able to reduce the incidence of odontogenic
   sinusitis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents low-power radio-frequency identification (RFID)
   technology for intelligent healthcare systems. With attention to
   power-efficient communication in the body sensor network, RF power
   transfer was estimated and the required low-power ICs, which are
   important in the development of a healthcare system with miniaturization
   and system integration, are discussed based on the RFID platform. To
   analyze the power transformation, this paper adopts a 915-MHz
   industrial, scientific, and medical RF with a radiation power of 70 mW
   to estimate the power loss under the 1-m communication distance between
   an RFID reader (bioinformation node) and a transponder (biosignal
   acquisition nodes). The low-power ICs of the transponder will be
   implemented in the TSMC 0.18-mu m CMOS process. The simulation result
   reveals that the transponder's IC can fit in with the link budget of the
   UHF RFID system.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose an efficient cooperation scheme to increase
   transmission throughput in a 60GHz 3D HD (high definition) video
   transmission system. A 3D HD video transmission system usually requires
   high transmission throughput with low power consumption. The proposed
   cooperation scheme achieves high transmission speed by reducing the data
   size using a relay and low transmission power by using path diversity.
   The efficiency of the scheme is demonstrated both analytically and by
   Monte-Carlo simulations in environments varying the number of relays.
   The proposed scheme has increased costs in terms of computational
   complexity at the relay and the destination.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Chemokines and their receptors are important players in
   tumorigenesis by facilitating tumor proliferation and metastasis. Little
   is known about the possible function of chemokine receptors in relation
   to the development and progression of malignant cutaneous tumors.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the chemokine receptor
   CCR3 expression pattern and the protein expression level in selected
   malignant cutaneous tumors. Methods: Four types of cell lines (G361,
   A431, SK-MEL-2, SK-MEL-24) were analyzed, using Western blotting, for
   the expression of CCR3 protein. Immunohistochemical staining for CCR3
   was done on 36 skin cancer tissue samples that included 16 squamous cell
   carcinomas (SCCs), 16 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), 16 malignant
   melanomas (MMs) and 6 normal tissue samples. Results: Western blot
   analysis showed that CCR3 protein was more expressed in the MM cell
   lines (G361, SK-MEL-2, SK-MEL-24) than that in the SCC cell line (A431),
   and the immunohistochemical analysis showed that CCR3 protein was
   overexpressed in MM and SCC, it was mildly expressed in BCC and it was
   hardly expressed in normal tissue. Conclusion: This study demonstrated
   via immunochemistry that CCR3 was more expressed in MM, followed by SCC
   and BCC. The existence of CCR3 protein may enhance the tumorigenic
   potential of malignant cutaneous tumors. (Ann Dermatol 22(4) 412 similar

Abstract = {{Loss of Productivity due to Depression among Korean Employees: Young-Mi
   LEE. Department of Nursing, Hanbuk University, Korea-Objectives: The aim
   of this study was to investigate the difference in productivity between
   those who are depressed and those who are not. Methods: A
   cross-sectional study of depressive and non-depressive employees at a
   workplace was performed. Data was collected between April and June 2008
   through self-reported questionnaires including the Stanford Presenteeism
   Scale. One thousand employees participated in this study. Inappropriate
   responses including missing data or non-relevant responses were
   excluded. Finally, data of 612 subjects was analyzed using the SPSS
   program. Results: The productivity of employees with depression was
   lower than that of employees without depression. The difference in
   productivity loss due to impaired presenteeism was significantly
   different between the two groups, but the productivity loss due to
   absenteeism was not. Conclusions: From the results of this study, we can
   deduce that depression among employees leads to productivity loss.
   Therefore, we must consider the management of depression in the
   workplace and improve the activities of occupational nurses and doctors
   during the mental health screening of employees. (J Occup Health 2010;

Abstract = {{Archaeologists commonly utilize spatial technologies to determine the
   occurrence probability of archaeological sites over large areas. Heavily
   forested areas of the northern Great Lakes have proven to be especially
   difficult places to carry out archaeological surveys. In this study,
   paleoshoreline mapping and site location analysis was used to develop a
   predictive model to identify likely prehistoric site locations from the
   Archaic Period in the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. Field survey
   efforts targeted locations where modeling efforts indicated high site
   probability, discovering 23 new prehistoric sites within this National
   Lakeshore. Based on associations with Nipissing Phase (mid-Holocene age)
   paleoshorelines, the presence of distinct lithic artifact technologies,
   paired with limited radiometric dating, the newly found sites are
   thought to be Late Archaic in cultural affiliation. Analysis of site
   settings indicates a preference for lagoon, barrier, and estuarine
   environments. The application of these spatial technologies demonstrates
   a targeted yet successful approach to field archaeology with limited
   field time and expansive areas. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{When individuals in a population can acquire traits through learning,
   each individual may express a certain number of distinct cultural
   traits. These traits may have been either invented by the individual
   himself or acquired from others in the population. Here, we develop a
   game theoretic model for the accumulation of cultural traits through
   individual and social learning. We explore how the rates of innovation,
   decay, and transmission of cultural traits affect the evolutionary
   stable (ES) levels of individual and social learning and the number of
   cultural traits expressed by an individual when cultural dynamics are at
   a steady-state. We explore the evolution of these phenotypes in both
   panmictic and structured population settings. Our results suggest that
   in panmictic populations, the ES level of learning and number of traits
   tend to be independent of the social transmission rate of cultural
   traits and is mainly affected by the innovation and decay rates. By
   contrast, in structured populations, where interactions occur between
   relatives, the ES level of learning and the number of traits per
   individual can be increased (relative to the panmictic case) and may
   then markedly depend on the transmission rate of cultural traits. This
   suggests that kin selection may be one additional solution to Rogers's
   paradox of nonadaptive culture.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we investigated how midazolam and D-cycloserine regulate
   the tonic activity and/or phasic reactivity of brain neurotransmitter
   systems to fear-evoking stimuli in rats with varying intensities of a
   fear response We used a new animal model composed of high (HR) and low
   (LR) anxiety rats selected according to their behaviour in the
   contextual fear test (i e the duration of a freezing response was used
   as a discriminating variable) In these rats we examined the effects of
   both drugs on the release of glutamate and GABA in the basolateral
   amygdala (BLA) during the first extinction trial of a conditioned fear
   test The results showed that administration of D-cycloserine (15 mg/kg 1
   p) significantly enhanced the inhibition of an aversive context-induced
   freezing response observed during the extinction session in HR and LR
   rats In contrast midazolam (0 75 mg/kg i p) accelerated the attenuation
   of fear responses only in HR rats The less anxious behaviour of LR
   animals given saline was accompanied by elevated basal levels of
   glutamate in the BLA in comparison with HR rats and a stronger elevation
   of GABA in response to contextual fear In HR animals the pretreatment of
   rats with D-cycloserine and midazolam significantly increased the local
   concentration of GABA and inhibited the expression of contextual fear
   These findings suggest that animals more vulnerable to stress have
   innate deficits in brain systems that control the activity of the BLA
   mediating the central effect of stress These results contribute to our
   understanding of observed individual differences in the effects of
   anxiolytic drugs among patients with anxiety disorders (C) 2010

Abstract = {{A novel silica/ceria nano composite abrasive was synthesized by
   homogeneous precipitation using carbamide, ammonium ceric nitrate and
   silica. The abrasive was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time-of-flight secondary ion mass
   spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   respectively. Then, the chemical mechanical polishing performances of
   the composite abrasive on hard disk substrate with nickel-phosphorous
   plated were investigated. Atomic force microscopy images show that the
   prepared abrasive gives much lower topographical variations than before
   polishing. The average waviness (Wa) of the polished hard substrate
   surface can be reduced from 15.5 angstrom before polishing to 8.36
   angstrom, and the average of roughness (Ra) can be reduced from 14 A
   before polishing to 4.80 angstrom. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Corporate partnerships with professional sport leagues are growing
   rapidly. How can we assess the value of such partnerships? Using an
   event study method, this research examined the economic effects of
   corporate partnerships with six professional sport organizations (NFL,
   MLB, NBA, NASCAR, NHL, and PGA). Three new interesting results were
   found. (1) Though a partnering firm experiences a net-of-market increase
   in shareholders' value of 2.93\% from a new corporate partnership with a
   professional sport league at the two-day window (0, + 1), renewals of
   corporate partnerships induced a significant net-of-market decrease of
   1.12\% during the same window of time. (2) Cross-sectional analysis
   revealed that superior performing firms as well as firms with higher
   institutional and moderate managerial ownership benefitted more than the
   average, and (3) the integrations of the partnerships with other
   business strategies elicited different responses from the investment
   community. Overall, a strategic implication was that marketing-focused
   partnerships in financially sound, well-managed firms contributed the
   most to enhancement in shareholders' wealth.}},

Abstract = {{Diaphragmatic plication is usually obtained by suturing the entire dome,
   which can be laborious when an anterior approach is used. The same
   result can be obtained by anchoring the redundant diaphragm to the
   anterior costal arch maneuver, which resembles the action of reefing the
   mainsail on the boom of a sailboat. Radiologic results have been
   analyzed from a series of 10 consecutive patients who underwent
   mediastinal surgery with phrenic nerve section. One week after surgery,
   no patient had an eventrated diaphragm on lateral chest roentgenogram.
   No lower lobe atelectasis was recorded in the series until discharge.
   This technique represents an alternative to classic diaphragmatic
   plication with three main advantages: (1) it does not require suturing
   of the posterior part of the dome, which can be difficult to reach when
   an anterior approach (sternotomy or hemi-clam-shell) is used; (2) the
   presence of three sequential steps, which progressively increases
   diaphragmatic stretching and permits adjusting the tension of the dome;
   and (3) the possibility of standard plication is not precluded. (Ann

   alongside others in different levels or years of the nursing program
   have not been explored. BSN students (N = 48) were placed in
   intraprofessional teams (i.e., one student from each nursing level) to
   manage acute pediatric and adult simulation scenarios. Students were
   instructed to manage the clinical scenario based on their level of
   clinical competence and education. Following debriefing, students
   responded to a satisfaction survey regarding their simulation
   experiences and their perceptions of learning within an
   intraprofessional nursing team. Project results suggest that
   intraprofessional educational experiences provide rich learning
   opportunities for both third-year and fourth-year nursing students. In

Journal = {{CLINICAL PHYSIOLOGY AND FUNCTIONAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{473-479}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{P>Background:
   Plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are closely related to
   symptoms in left ventricle (LV) systolic heart failure, although marked
   regarding heterogeneity levels among subjects are reported.
   Aims:
   To assess the influence of right ventricle on plasma BNP in the patients
   with different grades of its overload secondary to severe mitral valve
   stenosis (MVS).
   Methods:
   Plasma BNP was evaluated in MVS patients (n = 27) before valve
   replacement and during follow-up (FUV) 401 +/- 42 days after operation.
   Results:
   Initial examination showed severe MVS (0.9 +/- 0.2 cm2), left atrial
   enlargement (LAI 30 +/- 4.5 mm m-2), right ventricle diastolic
   dilatation (RVDI 16 +/- 3.6 mm m-2), normal LV size/function and
   elevated BNP levels (166 +/- 137 pg ml-1). FUV examination revealed a
   significant reduction in LAI (27 +/- 2.2 mm m-2), RVDI (14 +/- 1.6 mm
   m-2) and BNP levels (80 +/- 35 pg ml-1). The regression analysis of the
   initial parameters found RVDI to be the strongest predictor (R2 = 0.61;
   P < 0.0001) for BNP level, whereas RVDI reduction was the strongest
   factor for BNP decrease (R2 = 0.65; P < 0.0001) during FUV.
   Conclusions:
   Right ventricle should be taken into account as a potential important
   source of plasma BNP owing to the fact that LV size and function are
   well preserved in MVS patients. RVDI determines BNP plasma levels
   whereas after MVS removal, the RVDI reduction predicts BNP level
   decrease.}},

Abstract = {{Research has shown that the major gains in the reduction of factory
   downtime come from reliability engineering rather than from just
   improving maintenance practices In particular, a focus on defect
   elimination is essential in order to improve plant reliability and
   factory uptime In 2004, Mackay Sugar implemented a Citect Ampla Downtime
   monitoring system in order to better record and analyse plant downtime
   In conjunction with the Asset Management Group (AMG) from Transfield
   Services, Mackay Sugar also introduced a program of undertaking Roof
   Cause Analysis (RCA) investigations on all major plant failures The
   outcomes of the RCA investigations resulted in actions to revise the
   maintenance strategy or policy for that failure mode or where
   appropriate, to eliminate the defect by other means such as redesign
   This paper describes the issues which were addressed during the roll-out
   of this initiative It concludes by discussing the results obtained with
   factory plant availability through the use of this methodology over the
   past six seasons}},

Abstract = {{We compiled details of over 8000 assessments of protected area
   management effectiveness across the world and developed a method for
   analyzing results across diverse assessment methodologies and
   indicators. Data was compiled and analyzed for over 4000 of these sites.
   Management of these protected areas varied from weak to effective, with
   about 40\% showing major deficiencies. About 14\% of the surveyed areas
   showed significant deficiencies across many management effectiveness
   indicators and hence lacked basic requirements to operate effectively.
   Strongest management factors recorded on average related to
   establishment of protected areas (legal establishment, design,
   legislation and boundary marking) and to effectiveness of governance;
   while the weakest aspects of management included community benefit
   programs, resourcing (funding reliability and adequacy, staff numbers
   and facility and equipment maintenance) and management effectiveness
   evaluation. Estimations of management outcomes, including both
   environmental values conservation and impact on communities, were
   positive. We conclude that in spite of inadequate funding and management
   process, there are indications that protected areas are contributing to
   biodiversity conservation and community well-being.}},

Title = {{Simvastatin attenuates hypomyelination induced by hypoxia-ischemia in

Abstract = {{Objectives: Simvastatin, the most widely used cholesterol-lowering drug,
   has been reported to protect the adult brain from ischemia.
   Nevertheless, little is known about its action on developing brain after
   stroke. Although a few reports have found recently that simvastatin
   displays anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis properties and improves
   the cognitive and morphological consequences in the neonatal rats after
   hypoxia-ischemia (HI) damage, to our best knowledge, there has been no
   study of the effect of it on myelin formation after neonatal brain
   damage. Therefore, we investigated whether simvastatin could promote the
   myelination of oligodendrocytes in the neonatal rats after HI and
   explored the possible role of microglial responses in this process.
   Methods: Postnatal day 7 Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to HI. White
   matter integrity and myelination were evaluated by the densitometry of
   myelin basic protein (MBP) immunostaining. OX-42 immunoreactivity and
   nissl staining were used for identifying microglial responses and the
   structure changes of white matter and adjacent gray matter after HI.
   Simvastatin was administrated prophylactically to rats.
   Results: HI induced serious hypomyelination especially in external and
   internal capsules 3 and 7 days after HI, accompanying with microglial
   activation remarkably. Simvastatin treatment greatly increased the
   densities of MBP immunostaining, inhibited microglial activation and
   reduced the numbers of pyknotic cells and neuronal loss.
   Discussion: The present study shows that simvastatin treatment in
   neonatal rats attenuates HI-induced developing oligodendrocytes injury
   and hypomyelination. Its anti-inflammatory properties via suppression of
   microglial activation are likely to contribute to this action. It
   provides experimental evidence to support the neuroprotective effects of
   statins in neonatal ischemic stroke.}},

Abstract = {{As the product of the wear process, the wear particles record the rich
   information to reflect the state of the equipment's inner abrasion.
   Analysis of the wear particles in lubricating or hydraulic oils becomes
   one important branch of diagnosing the wear states of machine parts.
   Extracting characteristic parameter is an indispensable means to analyse
   wear particles. In this paper, a method to extract the characteristic
   parameters of the wear particle boundary based on chaos theory has been
   discussed. The concept of boundary wave has been firstly conducted, and
   then based on the Shannon entropy and the theory of phase
   reconstruction, the concept and the arithmetic of the singular entropy
   have been conducted. It has been shown that the boundary wave of the
   wear particles is characterised as chaos, so the singular entropy can be
   used to describe the complexity of the boundary of the wear particles.
   Therefore the singular entropy can be considered as one of the
   characteristic parameters of the wear particles.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we apply temperature, precipitation, and other data from
   66 Chinese meteorological stations including Xining and Lhasa to analyze
   the extreme climate events and their impacting factors over the

   spatial and temporal features of extreme climate events and their
   long-term changes over five climate zones of alpine grassland meadow and
   desert areas
   Results show that, during the past decades, the changes in climate over
   the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau present trends towards warm and wet conditions
   These changes in temperature and precipitation are evident in both
   seasonal means and extreme events, and the changes in precipitation are
   apparent in both precipitation amount and number of precipitation days
   Clearly, warm and wet events Increase, but cold and dry events decrease
   over the plateau region Features of the warming climate are relatively
   consistent in spatial and seasonal distributions, with the most
   significant changes in winter and autumn and at nighttime Northern
   Qinghai exhibits the greatest and most significant decrease in the
   frequency of extremely low-temperature events However, the wetting trend
   shows more distinctive spatial features and is more seasonally dependent
   While the trends in both precipitation amount and the number of
   precipitation days are positive in all climate zones for winter and
   spring, both positive and insignificant negative trends appear in summer
   and autumn The largest decrease in the frequency of severely dry events
   is found over southeastern Tibet and western Sichuan}},

Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Drosophila Little imaginal discs (Lid) is a recently described member of
   the JmjC domain class of histone demethylases that specifically targets
   trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3). To understand its
   biological function, we have utilized a series of Lid deletions and
   point mutations to assess the role that each domain plays in histone
   demethylation, in animal viability, and in cell growth mediated by the
   transcription factor dMyc. Strikingly, we find that lid mutants are
   rescued to adulthood by either wildtype or enzymatically inactive Lid
   expressed under the control of its endogenous promoter, demonstrating
   that Lid's demethylase activity is not essential for development. In
   contrast, ubiquitous expression of UAS-Lid transgenes lacking its JmjN,
   C-terminal PHD domain, and C5HC2 zinc finger were unable to rescue lid
   homozygous mutants, indicating that these domains carry out Lid's
   essential developmental functions. Although Lid-dependent demethylase
   activity is not essential, dynamic removal of H3K4me3 may still be an
   important component of development, as we have observed a genetic
   interaction between lid and another H3K4me3 demethylase, dKDM2. We also
   show that Lid's essential C-terminal PHD finger binds specifically to
   di- and trimethylated H3K4 and that this activity is required for Lid to
   function in dMyc-induced cell growth. Taken together, our findings
   highlight the importance of Lid function in the regulated removal and
   recognition of H3K4me3 during development.}},

Abstract = {{The export concentrations of acetone desorption from activated carbon at
   different temperatures, vacuum degrees, and saturated adsorption
   capacities were measured. The results showed that the greater the
   desorption vacuum degree and the initial adsorption capacity, the
   smaller the desorption rate. Given the adsorbent microporous capillary
   effect and the mass transfer in the process of desorption, the
   concentration curve reflects three phases, which are the
   vacuum-concentrated phase, fast attenuation phase, and slow attenuation
   phase. Through theoretical analysis and a coupled model of the
   desorption process, numerical simulation of the acetone desorption from
   activated carbon was carried out. Experimental and theoretical analysis
   showed that small temperature changes were caused by desorption;
   therefore, the change of the mass transfer coefficient and concentration
   caused by the temperature change is also small. In different desorption
   phases, a coupled effect on the mass transfer coefficients have
   different influences on the concentration curve. For the same initial
   adsorption capacity, the greater the partial pressure of the acetone,
   the larger the mass transfer coefficient. Obtaining the mass transfer
   coefficient and axial dispersion coefficient by sections can make the
   numerical results coincide well with the experimental data, and the
   axial diffusion coefficient should not be ignored in vacuum desorption.}},

   selects a CKLS model with GARCH-EPD errors as the best model. This model
   best captures the volatility clustering and extreme tail returns of the
   swaps during the crisis. Prior to November 2007, only four months ahead

Abstract = {{An unbalanced temporal pulse-shaping (TPS) system for chirped microwave
   waveform generation is proposed and demonstrated. The proposed system
   consists of an ultrashort pulsed source, a Mach-Zehnder modulator and
   two dispersive elements. The dispersions of the two dispersive elements
   are opposite in sign, but not identical in magnitude. The entire system
   is equivalent to a conventional balanced TPS system with two
   complementary dispersive elements for real-time Fourier transformation
   and a third dispersive element to achieve a second real-time Fourier
   transformation. The key contribution of this work is that the
   third-order dispersion of the dispersive elements is considered, which
   leads to the generation of a frequency-chirped microwave waveform. A
   theoretical analysis is performed in which a mathematical model that
   relates the second-and third-order dispersion of the dispersive elements
   and the chirp rate of the generated microwave waveform is developed. The
   theoretical model is then verified by numerical simulations and an
   experiment. A chirped microwave waveform with different chirp rates of
   -0.0535 and 0.715 GHz/ns by tuning the third-order dispersion using a
   tunable chirped fiber Bragg grating is experimentally demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Nanohole arrays in an Ag film were used as a substrate for
   surface-enhanced Raman scattering in the optical range. Extraordinary
   optical transmission and local field enhancement in Ag nanohole arrays
   were theoretically simulated using three-dimensional finite difference
   time domain method. The periodicity of the holes was adjusted to control
   the transmission intensity and electric field intensity. The calculation
   results show that the peak position of transmission red-shifts as the
   periodicity increases, while the peak intensity decreases linearly. The
   electric field is localized in a very small region at the edges of the
   holes, which means the surface-enhanced Raman scattering originates only
   from a small number of molecules located in the edge regions. The
   electric field intensity changes with the excitation wavelength in a
   similar trend to the transmission intensity. Both the electric field
   intensity and transmission intensity reach their maximum value at the
   frequency of surface plasmon resonance. The structure that gives
   resonant transmission provides the maximum surface-enhanced Raman
   scattering signal. Controllable and predictable surface-enhanced Raman
   scattering can be produced by using this novel nanostructure. The
   structure can be optimized to get the maximum surface-enhanced Raman
   scattering signal at a certain excitation wavelength through numerical
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Ganoderma sinensis fungal immunomodulatory protein (FIP-gsi) was a new

   immunomodulatory activity was examined by inducing cytokine genes
   expression. The results showed that the recombinant FIP-gsi protein
   could be expressed in E. coli and got the yield of about 25\% of the
   soluble form in the total soluble protein. The FIP-gsi protein was
   composed of 111 amino acids, and the sequence of homologous rate was
   88.6\% with FIP-glu (LZ-8). Furthermore, it could enhance the levels of

Abstract = {{A novel tri-layer composite membrane consisting of the active layer
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard (R) 184) and dual support layers of
   high porosity polyethylene (PE) and high mechanical stiffness perforated
   metal was investigated for the separation of 1-butanol from aqueous
   solution by means of pervaporation. The experimental data show that
   total flux and separation factor are both increased by placing a layer
   of hydrophobic PE between the PDMS and the metal support. The
   enhancement is especially obvious at low temperatures. With the feed
   solution of 2\% 1-butanol at 37 degrees C, the PDMS/PE/Brass support
   composite membrane confers a total flux of 132 g/h/m(2) and a separation
   factor of 32. With the increase of the PDMS thickness, the separation
   factor increases as the total flux declines. It is suggested that while
   the water flux remains stable, the 1-butanol flux has linear
   relationship with respect to the feed concentration of 1-butanol. The
   overall mass transfer coefficient for butanol was determined to be
   6.9E-7 m/s using the resistance-in-series model. Using a semi-empirical
   Sherwood number correlation, the mass transfer coefficient of 1-butanol
   through the liquid side boundary layer was estimated to be 25.5E-7 m/s.
   This is more than 3 times higher than the overall mass transfer
   coefficient, indicating that the membrane dominates the mass transfer of
   the pervaporation process. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury-induced oxidative stress plays an
   important role in the functional impairment of the bladder following
   acute bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) via induction of apoptosis. The
   purpose of this study was to investigate the time course of the bladder
   apoptosis, and apoptosis related molecular changes in the early stage of
   acute BOO. Twelve-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into
   control, acute BOO only (I), and acute BOO plus subsequent emptying
   (I/R) for 30, 60, 120 min, 3 days and 2 weeks. We examined the extent of
   bladder apoptosis, expression of Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD),
   Bcl-2, Bax, caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) in the bladder.
   Bladder apoptosis was significantly increased in the I/R group at 30,
   60, and 120 min following bladder emptying. BOO plus subsequent emptying
   for 30, 60, 120 min showed significant decrease in MnSOD and Bcl-2
   expression, and significant increase in caspase 3, Bax expression, and
   amounts of PAR. These results indicate that bladder apoptosis, induced
   by acute BOO and subsequent emptying, is associated with decreased MnSOD
   expression, increased PARP activity and imbalance in apoptosis pathways.}},

   wavelength-division-multiplexed millimeter-wave-band radio-on-fiber
   system, and define carrier-to-carrier rate (CCR) to evaluate the scheme
   performance. Firstly, we experimentally generated a super-continuum
   source (SCS) with 20-dB width of more than 260 nm around 1550 nm by
   coupling a femto-second pulses lauched by the semiconductor mode-locked
   laser into two passages of 5-m-long high nonlinear photonic crystal
   fibers (PCFs) with opposite dispersion value. Secondly, we used a
   sampled fiber Bragg grating (SFBG) to filter spectrum, and the results
   showed that spectrum was sliced into 20 channels with -0.3-0.3 dB Peak
   fluctuation. Moreover, each two adjacent channels can be filtered out as
   one of radio-frequency carriers, and the amplitude differences of two
   sub-carriers in wavelength-division-multiplexed millimeter-wave-band
   radio-on-fiber system are tiny to ensure optimal CCR.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium dioxide nanotubes (TiNTs) were fabricated from commercial P25
   TiO2 powders via alkali hydrothermal transformation. Dye-sensitized
   solar cells (DSCs) were constructed by application of TiNTs and P25
   nanoparticles with various weight percentages. The influence of the TiNT
   concentration on the performance of DSCs was investigated
   systematically. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
   technique was employed to quantify the recombination resistance,
   electron lifetime and time constant in DSCs both under illumination and
   in the dark. The DSC based on TiNT/P25 hybrids showed a better
   photovoltaic performance than the cell purely made of TiO2
   nanoparticles. The open-voltage (V-oc), fill factor (FF) and efficiency
   (eta) continuously increased with the TiO2 nanotube concentration from 0
   to 50 wt\%, which was correlated with the suppression of the electron
   recombination as found out from EIS studies. Respectable photovoltaic
   performance of ca. 7.41\% under the light intensity of 100 mW cm(-2) (AM
   1.5G) was achieved for DSCs using 90 wt\% TiO2 nanotubes incorporated in
   TiO2 electrodes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the heterogeneous fixed fleet vehicle routing problem
   (HFFVRP), in which the fleet is composed of a fixed number of vehicles
   with different capacities, fixed costs, and variable costs. Given the
   fleet composition, the HFFVRP is to determine a vehicle scheduling
   strategy with the objective of minimizing the total transportation cost.
   We propose a multistart adaptive memory programming (MAMP) and path
   relinking algorithm to solve this problem. Through the search memory.
   MAMP at each iteration constructs multiple provisional solutions, which
   are further improved by a modified tabu search. As an intensification
   strategy, path relinking is integrated to enhance the performance of
   MAMP. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate and demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

   from sham operation were quantified using an improved two-dimensional
   16-BAC/SDS-PAGE and identified by LC-MS/MS. Several proteins were
   further confirmed by cICAT labeling quantitative strategy. A total of 47
   proteins were identified including known and novel proteins involved in
   angiogenesis or liver regeneration, such as inducible nitric oxide

Abstract = {{Experimental tests and theoretical analyses were conducted to
   investigate the critical velocity together with the backlayering length
   in tunnel fires. The experiments were performed in two longitudinally
   ventilated model tunnels. The proposed correlations for critical
   velocity are found to comply well with experimental data in both
   tunnels. The critical Froude number and the critical Richardson number
   were analyzed using the experimental data. The backlayering length was
   related to the ratio of longitudinal ventilation velocity to critical
   velocity. Experimental data show that the relation between the ratio of
   ventilation velocity to critical velocity and the dimensionless
   backlayering length follows an exponential relation. A correlation based
   on experimental data to predict the backlayering length is proposed.
   Further, comparison of experimental data of critical velocity and
   backlayering length with results from large-scale tests shows that there
   is a good agreement in both scales. The effect of accident vehicle
   obstruction on critical velocity and backlayering length was also
   analyzed. Experimental data show that the decrease in rate of critical
   velocity due to obstruction is slightly greater than the ratio of
   cross-sectional area of the model vehicle to tunnel cross-sectional
   area, and the backlayering length with an accident vehicle set inside
   the tunnel gets smaller. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The cultures of Liangzhu (5200-4300 BP), Qujialing (5100-4500 BP) and
   Shijiahe (4600-4000 BP) are representative of Chinese civilization in
   the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Nevertheless, limited
   data is available on the rise and fall of pre-historical cultures in
   relation to environment in the Yangtze region. In this study, pollen,
   phytolith and microfossil charcoal extracted from sedimentary profiles
   and cultural layers at the archaeological sites of Liangzhu and
   Qujialing were employed to clarify the relationship between
   vegetation-climate and human cultures in archaeological context during
   Late Holocene in the middle and lower Yangtze River. The results suggest
   that forest was widely distributed under a warm and humid climate before
   the appearance of the Liangzhu culture and Qujialing culture (more than
   5200 BP) in the two sites. During the Liangzhu, Qujialing and Shijiahe
   periods, virgin forest was damaged and secondary pine forest was
   expanded due to intensified agriculture. Palaeoecological records show
   the widespread rice cultivation during these phases, which might have
   provided steady food supply and hence laid a solid basis for the onset
   of the Chinese civilization. The civilizations of Liangzhu, Qujialing
   and Shijiahe collapsed at about 4300 BP, 4500 BP and 4000 BP
   respectively. Mixed sub-tropical evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved
   forest was restored rapidly following the collapse of Liangzhu
   civilization, implying warm and humid climate remained predominant
   throughout the time in the Liangzhu region. By contrast, the forest was
   not restored after the collapse of the Shijahe civilization: instead
   grassland vegetation developed, which is attributable to the
   over-exploitation of early humans and the ensuing dry climate. The
   warmer and more humid climate in the Liangzhu region seemed to have led
   to more stable and complex forest ecosystems, which were effective on
   standing against human impact and climate change. Soil erosion due to
   deforestation was also more frequent in Qujialing than Liangzhu, which
   must have further limited forest regeneration. Since 3700 BP, the
   climate became dry and forest declined in the two sites. During the
   Warring States period (2425-2171 BP), human disturbances, indicated by
   high percentages of Gramineae pollen and microfossil charcoal, were
   intensive, although the climate was not as warm and humid as
   mid-Holocene. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims. Vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) has
   been demonstrated to stimulate the growth of lymphatic vascular
   endothelium. The purpose of this study is to determine whether VEGF-C
   associated with computed tomography (CT) has a relationship with lymph
   node metastasis in bladder transitional cell carcinoma (BTCC).
   Methods. One hundred twenty seven cases of BTCC were studied: first,
   both plain and enhanced CT scans of abdomen and pelvis were performed
   preoperatively; second, VEGF-C protein expressions in tumor cells were
   tested by immunohistochemistry postoperatively; and finally, detailed
   pathological findings for lymph node metastasis were recorded.
   Results. VEGF-C expressions in tumor bladder cells were significantly
   higher than those in normal bladder epithelium. In the group of
   BTCC-positive, VEGF-C was significantly correlated with lymph node
   metastasis (p <0.01). Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of VEGF-C in
   the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis of bladder carcinoma were 87.0,
   67.9, and 74.8\%, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of
   CT were 47.8, 80.2, and 68.5\%, respectively. When VEGF-C visually
   correlated with CT scan in the detection of lymph node metastasis,
   sensitivity was 91.3\%; specificity was 84.0\% and accuracy was 86.6\%.
   Conclusions. Positive VEGF-C was significantly correlated with lymph
   node metastasis of bladder carcinoma. VEGF-C expression in biopsy
   specimens may be beneficial in predicting pelvic lymph nodes. It can
   improve accuracy when combined with CT. (C) 2010 IMSS. Published by

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper was to investigate the sensitivity of the
   structural responses and bone fractures of the ribs to mesh density
   cortical thickness and material properties so as to provide guidelines
   for the development of finite element (FE) thorax models used in impact
   biomechanics Subject-specific FE models of the second fourth sixth and
   tenth ribs were developed to reproduce dynamic failure experiments
   Sensitivity studies were then conducted to quantify the effects of
   variations in mesh density cortical thickness and material parameters on
   the model-predicted reaction force-displacement relationship cortical
   strains and bone fracture locations for all four ribs Overall it was
   demonstrated that rib FE models consisting of 2000-3000 trabecular
   hexahedral elements (weighted element length 2-3 mm) and associated
   quadrilateral cortical shell elements with variable thickness more
   closely predicted the rib structural responses and bone fracture
   force-failure displacement relationships observed in the experiments
   (except the fracture locations) compared to models with constant
   cortical thickness Further increases in mesh density Increased
   computational cost but did not markedly improve model predictions A +/-
   30\% change in the major material parameters of cortical bone lead to a
   -16 7 to 33 3\% change in fracture displacement and -22 5 to +19 1\%
   change in the fracture force The results in this study suggest that
   human rib structural responses can be modeled in an accurate and
   computationally efficient way using (a) a coarse mesh of 2000-3000 solid
   elements (b) cortical shells elements with variable thickness
   distribution and (c) a rate-dependent elastic-plastic material model (C)

Abstract = {{We consider a scenario in which primordial scalar perturbations are
   generated when complex conformal scalar field rolls down its negative
   quartic potential. Initially, these are the perturbations of the phase
   of this field; they are converted into the adiabatic perturbations at a
   later stage. A potentially dangerous feature of this scenario is the
   existence of perturbations in the radial field direction, which have red
   power spectrum. We show, however, that to the linear order in the small
   parameter - the quartic self-coupling - the infrared effects are
   completely harmless, as they can be absorbed into field redefinition. We
   then evaluate the statistical anisotropy inherent in the model due to
   the existence of the long-ranged radial perturbations. To the linear
   order in the quartic self-coupling the statistical anisotropy is free of
   the infrared effects. The latter show up at the quadratic order in the
   self-coupling and result in the mild (logarithmic) enhancement of the
   corresponding contribution to the statistical anisotropy. The resulting
   statistical anisotropy is a combination of a larger term which, however,
   decays as momentum increases, and a smaller term which is independent of
   momentum.}},

Abstract = {{The visibility of environmental problems and the increasing awareness of
   associated consequences have made environmental issues salient in
   Zambia. The purpose of this study was to investigate correlations
   between the social and psychological influences affecting college
   students in Zambia, and the behaviours perceived by them to be
   appropriately environmentally friendly. The underlying social and
   psychological factors that would determine individuals' attitudinal
   responses toward appropriate environmental behaviour were assessed. The
   study attempted to measure behavioural tendencies towards environmental
   conservation. Behaviour involving energy and water conservation (EW) was
   consistently rated as the most important, and appropriate category of
   environmental behaviour, whereas social and political action (SP) was
   viewed as the least favourable behaviour according to the respondents in
   Zambia. The respondents who were older in the graduate level of the
   study and had frequently contact with environmental education activities
   and courses were more likely to hold positive behavioural tendencies
   toward environmental conservation in general.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Among individuals with ischemic heart disease, young women
   with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) represent an extreme phenotype
   associated with an excess mortality risk. Although women younger than 55
   years of age account for less than 5\% of hospitalized AMI events,
   almost 16 000 deaths are reported annually in this group, making heart
   disease a leading killer of young women. Despite a higher risk of
   mortality compared with similarly aged men, young women have been the
   subject of few studies.
   Methods and Results-Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of
   Young AMI Patients (VIRGO) is a large, observational study of the
   presentation, treatment, and outcomes of young women and men with AMI.
   VIRGO will enroll 2000 women, 18 to 55 years of age, with AMI and a
   comparison cohort of 1000 men with AMI from more than 100 participating
   hospitals. The aims of the study are to determine sex differences in the
   distribution and prognostic importance of biological, demographic,
   clinical, and psychosocial risk factors; to determine whether there are
   sex differences in the quality of care received by young AMI patients;
   and to determine how these factors contribute to sex differences in
   outcomes (including mortality, hospitalization, and health status).
   Blood serum and DNA for consenting participants will be stored for
   future studies.
   Conclusions-VIRGO will seek to identify novel and prognostic factors
   that contribute to outcomes in this young AMI population. Results from
   the study will be used to develop clinically useful risk-stratification
   models for young AMI patients, explain sex differences in outcomes, and
   identify targets for intervention. (Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes.

Abstract = {{The treatment options for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
   who have failed DNA hypomethylating agents are limited. In this study,
   we set out to investigate the efficacy of low dose clofarabine in 10
   patients with MDS (four intermediate-2/high risk disease) who had failed
   5-azacytidine. The median age was 73 years (range 65-78) and median
   cycles of clofarabine received were 2 (range 1-4). Nine patients were
   evaluable for response. An overall response rate of 44\% was observed
   (one CR, one PR, and two HI). All responders had low risk disease. The
   median duration of response was 12 months (range 6.5-15.5). Although the
   doses of clofarabine administered were only 12.5-25\% of that used in
   other studies, significant hematologic toxicities were observed. Severe
   and prolonged pancytopenia occurred in all 10 patients. One patient who
   had a history of thrombocytopenic gastrointestinal bleed died due to an
   intracranial bleed despite aggressive platelet support. Low dose
   clofarabine may, therefore, induce response, but with significant
   toxicities, in patients with low risk MDS who fail 5-azacytidine. Future
   work involving a larger patient population is needed to establish the
   role of low dose clofarabine in low risk MDS.</.}},

Abstract = {{Sex differences exist in autonomic control of the cardiovascular system.
   This study was designed to directly test sex or female menstrual
   phase-related differences in alpha-adrenergic control of blood flow
   during exercise. We hypothesized that women would exhibit reduced
   alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction compared with men during exercise; in
   addition, women would constrict less during the early luteal than the
   early follicular phase of the female menses. Young men (n = 10) were
   studied once and women (n = 9) studied twice, once during the early
   follicular phase and once during the early luteal phase of female
   menses. We measured forearm blood flow (FBF; Doppler ultrasound of the
   brachial artery) during rest and steady-state dynamic exercise (15 and
   30\% of maximal voluntary contraction, 20 contractions/min). A brachial
   artery catheter was inserted for the local administration of

   conductance (FVC)] were similar between all groups. At rest, infusion of
   PE or CL decreased FVC in all groups (40-60\% reduction).
   Vasoconstriction to PE was abolished in all groups at 15 and 30\%
   exercise intensity. Vasoconstriction to CL was reduced at 15\% and
   abolished at 30\% intensity in all groups; women had less CL-induced
   constriction during the early luteal than early follicular phase (P <
   0.017, 15\% intensity). These results indicate that vasodilator
   responses to forearm exercise are comparable between men and women and
   are achieved through similar paths of alpha-adrenergic vascular control
   at moderate intensities; this control may differ at low intensities
   specific to the female menstrual phase.}},

Abstract = {{The free-milling ore characteristics of the Fort Knox gold deposit are
   ideal for studying gold and silver behaviors in various processing
   circuits without serious interference of sulfide minerals and other
   refractory factors. A galvanic effect leads to faster silver dissolution
   than gold dissolution and, as a result, the Au/Ag solution concentration
   ratio increases through the leach circuit. In the CIP circuit, Au
   adsorption is more effective than Ag adsorption. The Au/Ag solution
   concentration ratio decreases from 10.0 to 1.0 as the slurry advances
   from CIP tank \#1 to CIP tank \#5, while Au/Ag ratio in the carbon
   increases from 3.2 to 15.3, as the carbon advances from CIP tank \#5 to
   CIP tank \#1. Silver is stripped more effectively than gold from the
   loaded carbon. The Au/Ag ratio in solution reaches 2.0 in the first
   75,700 L of strip solution that pass through the loaded carbon; as the
   stripping process continues, the Au/Ag ratio in the strip solution
   increases. In the electrowinning circuit, the Au/Ag ratio in the spent
   electrowinning solution is significantly lower than that in the
   electrowinning feed, indicating that Au is more rapidly deposited onto
   the cathode than Ag.}},

Abstract = {{Background Richardson's syndrome (RS) and progressive supranuclear
   palsy-parkinsonism (PSP-P) are the most common subtypes of PSP syndrome.
   The clinical features, responses to levodopa, and progression are
   relatively different but overlap. Determining whether combined molecular
   imaging studies of dopamine transporter and D2 receptor are helpful for
   further differentiation of these two subtypes is important.
   Methods Ten patients with PSP (six suffering from RS and four from
   PSP-P) were studied. We also enrolled 10 patients with Parkinson's
   disease (PD) as disease control and seven healthy individuals as normal
   controls. Each individual underwent two sets of single photon emission
   computer tomography imaging,

   Technetium (Tc-99m-TRODAT-1) dopamine transporter (DAT) and
   I-123-iodobenzamide D2 receptor. The specific uptake ratio was
   calculated as (basal ganglia counts-occipital cortex counts)/occipital
   cortex counts.
   Results In DAT scan, the mean striatal uptake was reduced in the RS
   group compared with that in the PSP-P group, although it did not reach
   statistical significance. The putamen-to-caudate nucleus ratios were
   significantly different between PD and all PSP patients (P < 0.001), but
   no difference in putamen-to-caudate ratios was found between the RS and
   PSP-P groups. In the I-123 iodobenzamide scan, striatal uptake was
   significantly reduced in the RS group (-22.62\%, P = 0.022); on the
   contrary, it was mildly increased in the PSP-P group.
   Conclusion The studies showed different alterations of DAT and D2
   receptor function between the RS and PSP-P groups. Different DAT imaging
   might be helpful to distinguish PSP-P from PD in the early stage. Nucl

Abstract = {{Organizations are increasingly implementing process-improvement
   techniques like Six Sigma, total quality management, lean, and business
   process re-engineering to improve organizational performance. These
   techniques are part of a process management system that includes the
   organizational infrastructure to support the improvement techniques. The
   knowledge-based view of a firm argues that organizational knowledge is
   the source of competitive advantage. To the extent that the process
   management system enables knowledge creation it should be a source of
   competitive advantage. This study investigates the underlying framework
   and factors of a process management system that lead to organizational
   knowledge creation. Prior studies have considered knowledge creation in
   process improvement, but none have considered the role of the process
   management system. Specifically, the study uses the case study method to
   investigate multiple levels (organization level and project level) of
   two firms using Six Sigma as their chosen process management system.
   Analysis of the cases reveals that the leadership creates a supportive
   infrastructure enabling process-improvement techniques to effectively
   create organizational knowledge. Interestingly, focusing on
   decision-making tools and methods may not be effective without
   developing a supportive infrastructure. The proposed framework provides
   a basis for organizational leaders to think about how to design and
   implement a process management system to better enable knowledge
   creation in organizations.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding speciation in pelagic marine organisms is difficult due to
   poor knowledge of their systematics and distribution. This paper
   examines the systematics of the squid genus Pterygioteuthis and its
   distribution and speciation in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. A
   morphology-based phylogenetic analysis identifies two clades: the P.
   giardi group (P. giardi giardi and P. giardi hoylei) and the P. gemmata
   group (P. gemmata and P. microlampas). Based on its morphological and
   biogeographic differences from P. giardi giardi, the subspecies P.
   giardi hoylei (fide Nesis, 1987) is elevated to species status and a
   neotype designated. Also, to clarify taxonomic issues in the P. gemmata
   group, a neotype is designated for P. microlampas Berry, 1913. These
   strictly pelagic taxa have distinct distributions; P. hoylei is the only
   pyroteuthid to occur in the relatively isolated eastern tropical Pacific
   (ETP), while P. giardi inhabits the temperate north and south Pacific
   (excluding the ETP) and the Atlantic. Pterygioteuthis microlampas is
   known only from off the Hawaiian Islands and New Zealand, while P.
   gemmata extends throughout the temperate Pacific (excluding the ETP) and
   Atlantic. This study represents the first detailed cladistic analysis of
   Pyroteuthidae and generates new hypotheses regarding speciation in the
   open ocean.}},

Abstract = {{The hallmarks of hyperthermia and its pleotropic effects are in favour
   of its combined use with chemotherapy. Preclinical research reveals that
   for heat killing and synergistic effects the thermal dose is most
   critical. Thermal enhancement of drug cytotoxicity is accompanied by
   cellular death and necrosis. Hereby, temperature application rate as
   well as sequence and time interval are important for both in vitro and
   in vivo thermal sensitizations of tumour cells. The positive results of
   phase II/III trials have definitely established hyperthermia in
   combination with chemotherapy as a novel clinical modality for the
   treatment of cancer. Hyperthermia targets the action of chemotherapy
   within the heated tumour. In specific clinical settings hyperthermia has
   proven its value and deserves a greater focus and investigation in other
   malignancies. To further define the role of hyperthermia in multimodal
   treatment, tumour patients should be included into randomized trials.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the evolution of advection upstream splitting
   method(AUSM) schemes The main ingredients that have led to the
   development of modern computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods have
   been reviewed, thus the ideas behind AUSM First and foremost is the
   concept of upwinding Second, the use of Riemann problem in constructing
   the numerical flux in the finite-volume setting Third, the necessity of
   including all physical processes, as characterised by the linear
   (convection) and nonlinear (acoustic) fields Fourth, the realisation of
   separating the flux into convection and pressure fluxes The rest of this
   review briefly outlines the technical evolution of AUSM and more details

   Response to Japanese Encephalitis Vaccination}},
Journal = {{PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A new commercial anti-Japanese encephalitis virus IgM and IgG indirect
   immunofluorescence test (IIFT) was evaluated for the detection of the
   humoral immune response after Japanese encephalitis vaccination. The IgM
   IIFT was compared to two IgM capture ELISAs and the IgG IIFT was
   analysed in comparison to a plaque reduction neutralization test
   (PRNT50) and an IgG ELISA. Moreover, the course of the immune reaction
   after vaccination with an inactivated JEV vaccine was examined. For the
   present study 300 serum samples from different blood withdrawals from
   100 persons vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis were used. For the
   IgM evaluation, altogether 78 PRNT50 positive samples taken 7 to 56 days
   after vaccination and 78 PRNT50 negative sera were analyzed with the
   Euroimmun anti-JEV IgM IIFT, the Panbio Japanese Encephalitis Dengue IgM
   Combo ELISA and the InBios JE Detect IgM capture ELISA. For the IgG
   evaluation, 100 sera taken 56 days after vaccination and 100
   corresponding sera taken before vaccination were tested in the PRNT50,
   the Euroimmun anti-JEV IgG IIFT, and the InBios JE Detect IgG ELISA. The
   Euroimmun IgM IIFT showed in comparison to the Panbio ELISA a
   specificity of 95\% and a sensitivity of 86\%. With respect to the
   InBios ELISA, the values were 100\% and 83.9\%, respectively. The
   analysis of the Euroimmun IgG IIFT performance and the PRNT50 results
   demonstrated a specificity of 100\% and a sensitivity of 93.8\%, whereas
   it was not possible to detect more than 6.6\% of the PRNT50 positive
   sera as positive with the InBios JE Detect IgG ELISA. Thus, the IIFT is
   a valuable alternative to the established methods in detecting anti-JEV
   antibodies after vaccination in travellers and it might prove useful for
   the diagnosis of acutely infected persons.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructures of multiferrolc materials have drawn increasing interest
   due to the enhanced magnetoelectric coupling and potential for next
   generation multifunctional devices Most of these structures are
   typically prepared by thin film evaporation approaches Herein, however,
   we report a novel sol-gel based process to synthesize epitaxial
   BaTiO3-CoFe2O4 nanocomposite thin films via phase separation and
   enhanced heterogeneous nucleation The magnetoelectric coupling effect is
   investigated by examining the temperature-dependent magnetization of the
   the composite film, which manifests as a sharp and significant drop (>
   50\%) of the magnetization at the vicinity of a BaTiO3 ferroelectric
   phase transition We propose that the phase transition in BaTiO3 is
   mediated by the tensile strain due to intimate coupling to CoFe2O4
   phase, which has rarely been reported before The siginificant coupling
   effect is attributed to the small substrate clamping, and the large
   areal distribution of intimate heteroepitaxial interfaces between the
   three-dimensionally distributed ferroelectric and magnetic
   nanostructured phases}},

Abstract = {{The linguistic relativity hypothesis proposes that speakers of different
   languages perceive and conceptualize the world differently, but do their
   brains reflect these differences? In English, most nouns do not provide
   linguistic clues to their categories, whereas most Mandarin Chinese
   nouns provide explicit category information, either morphologically (e
   g, the morpheme ``vehicle{''} che1 (sic) in the noun ``train{''}
   huo3che1 (sic)) or orthographically (e g, the radical ``bug{''} chong2
   (sic) in the character for the noun ``butterfly{''} hu2dre2 (sic)). When
   asked to judge the membership of atypical (e g, train) vs typical (e.g.,
   car) pictorial exemplars of a category (e g, vehicle), English speakers
   (N = 26) showed larger N300 and N400 event-related potential (ERP)
   component differences, whereas Mandarin speakers (N = 27) showed no such
   differences. Further investigation with Mandarin speakers only (N = 22)
   found that it was the morphologically transparent items that did not
   show a typicality effect, whereas orthographically transparent items
   elicited moderate N300 and N400 effects In a follow-up study with
   English speakers only (N = 25), morphologically transparent items also
   showed different patterns of N300 and N400 activation than
   nontransparent items even for English speakers Together, these results
   demonstrate that even for pictorial stimuli, how and whether category
   information is embedded in object names affects the extent to which
   typicality is used in category judgments, as shown in N300 and N400

Abstract = {{Using the pseudopotential plane-wave method under the density functional
   theory (DFT), the electronic properties of BaCu2S2 in alpha and beta
   phases are calculated. The result shows that the bottom conduction band
   is mainly made of Ba 5d state, while the upper valence band is formed by
   S 3p and Cu 4d states, but both of them for beta-BaCu2S2 are wider than
   those for alpha-BaCu2S2. The electron and hole effective masses for
   BaCu2S2 are also analyzed in detail. It is found that beta-BaCu2S2 has
   very small hole effective masses, which implies that beta-BaCu2S2 may
   possess a high hole mobility. Moreover, its hole effective masses are
   extremely anisotropic along ab plane and c axis. These properties are
   helpful to enhance its Seebeck coefficient, and means that beta-BaCu2S2
   could be a good candidate of thermoelectric materials. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Lotus root beverage is commonly made from raw lotus root
   (RLR). However, RLR production is strictly limited, because it is prone
   to decomposition and browning after its short harvest season. In this
   study an innovative beverage was prepared from full lotus root powder
   (FLRP) as a substitute for RLR in an attempt to solve this problem.
   RESULTS: The components of FLRP basically corresponded to those of RLR,
   but there was some loss of heat-labile compounds. Using differential
   scanning calorimetry, a gelatinisation temperature range of 57.08-67.80
   degrees C was determined for FLRP with an average particle size
   distribution of 70 mu m. The optimal conditions for enzymatic treatment
   of FLRP beverage were determined by response surface methodology as an
   enzyme concentration of 2.2 g kg(-1) at 53 degrees C for 86 min.
   Turbidity decreased from 1082 to 280 nephelometric turbidity units
   following enzymolysis. Properties of FLRP beverage were also studied and
   a qualitative comparison of flavour compounds between RLR and FLRP
   beverages was made by electronic nose.
   CONCLUSION: Basic flavour compounds were consistent and flavour radar
   plots had approximately the same shape, area and proportion when all
   ingredients were identical apart from FLRP and RLR. Therefore, in terms
   of flavour, FLRP beverage appears to be a feasible substitute for RLR
   beverage. (c) 2010 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen exchange may occur at carboxyl groups catalyzed by acid. The
   reaction, however, takes at least several days at room temperature. The
   long-time exchanging reaction often prevents its application from

   microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis was developed. After being dissolved
   in O-16/O-18 (1:1) water containing 2.5\% formic acid, protein samples
   were exposed to microwave irradiation. LC-MS/MS analysis of the resulted
   peptide mixtures indicated that oxygen in the carboxyl groups from
   glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and the C-terminal residues could be
   efficiently exchanged with O-18 within less than 1.5 min. The rate of
   back exchange was so slow that no detectable back exchange could be
   found during the HPLC run.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic reconnection changes the magnetic field topology and powers

   which has been the subject of considerable theoretical and numerical
   modeling over the last 50 years, yet direct, unambiguous observational
   verification has been absent. In this Letter, we show a bright sheet
   structure of global length (>0.25 R-circle dot) and macroscopic width
   ((5-10) x 10(3) km) distinctly above the cusp-shaped flaring loop,
   imaged during the flare rising phase in EUV. The sheet formed due to the
   stretch of a transequatorial loop system and was accompanied by various
   reconnection signatures. This unique event provides a comprehensive view
   of the reconnection geometry and dynamics in the solar corona.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop methods to monitor prostate intrafraction motion
   during fixed-gantry intensity-modulated radiotherapy using MV treatment
   beam imaging together with minimal kV imaging for a failure detection
   strategy that ensures prompt detection when target displacement exceeds
   a preset threshold.
   Methods and Materials: Real-time two-dimensional (2D) marker position in
   the MV image plane was obtained by analyzing cine-MV images. The
   marker's in-line movement, and thus its time-varying three-dimensional
   (3D) position, was estimated by combining the 2D projection data with a
   previously established correlative relationship between the directional
   components of prostate motion. A confirmation request for more accurate
   localization using MV-kV triangulation was triggered when the estimated
   prostate displacement based on the cine-MV data was greater than 3 mm.
   An interventional action alert followed on positive MV-kV confirmation.
   To demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method,
   simulation studies of conventional-fraction intensity-modulated
   radiotherapy sessions were done using 536 Calypso-measured prostate
   trajectories from 17 radiotherapy patients.
   Results: A technique for intrafraction prostate motion management has
   been developed. The technique, using ``freely available{''} cine-MV
   images and minimum on-board kV imaging (on average 2.5 images/fraction),
   successfully limited 3D prostate movement to within a range of 3 mm
   relative to the MV beam for 99.4\% of the total treatment time. On
   average, only approximately one intervention/fraction was needed to
   achieve this level of accuracy.
   Conclusion: Instead of seeking to accurately and continuously localize
   the prostate target as existing motion tracking systems do, the present
   technique effectively uses cine-MV data to provide a clinically valuable
   way to minimize kV usage, while maintaining high targeting accuracy. (C)

Abstract = {{Two cDNAs specific for P450 genes, CYP6AE28 and CYP6AE30, have been
   isolated from the rice leaf folder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee
   (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Both cDNA-predicted proteins have 504 amino
   acid residues in length, but with molecular masses of 60177 Dalton for
   CYP6AE28 and 60020 Dalton for CYP6AE30, and theoretical pI values of
   8.49 for CYP6AE28 and 8.56 for CYP6AE30, respectively. Both putative
   proteins contain the conserved structural and functional domains
   characteristic of all CYP6 members. CYP6AE28 and CYP6AE30 show 52\%
   amino acid identity to each other; both of them have 49-56\% identities
   with CYP6AE1, Cyp6ae12, and CYP6AE14. Phylogenetic analysis showed that
   the two P450s are grouped in the lineage containing some of the CYP6AE
   members, CYP6B P450s and CYP321A1. The transcripts of CYP6AE28 and
   CYP6AE30 were found to be induced in response to TKM-6, a rice variety
   with high resistance to C. medinalis. The results suggest that the two
   P450s may play important roles in adaptation to the host plant rice.
   This is the first report of P450 genes cloned in C. medinalis.}},

Abstract = {{Drug carriers are generally introduced into the body intravenously and
   directly exposed to endothelial cells. Silica nanoparticles could be
   promising delivery vehicles for drug targeting or gene therapy. However,
   few studies have been undertaken to determine the biological behavior of
   silica nanoparticles on endothelial cells. Here we measured reactive
   oxygen species (ROS) generation, apoptosis and necrosis, proinflammatory
   and prothrombic properties and the levels of the apoptotic signaling
   proteins and the transcription factors in human umbilical vein
   endothelial cells (HUVECs) after exposure to silica nanoparticles of
   different concentrations (25, 50, 100, and 200 mu g/mL) for 24 h. The
   results showed that silica nanoparticles, ranging from 50 mu g/mL to 200
   mu g/mL, markedly induced ROS production, mitochondrial depolarization
   and apoptosis in HUVECs. At the highest concentration, the necrotic
   rate, LDH leakage, the expression of CD54 and CD62E, and the release of
   TF, IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 were significantly increased. Silica
   nanoparticles also activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (INK), c-Jun, p53,
   caspase-3 and NF-kappa B, increased Bax expression and suppressed Bcl-2
   protein. Moreover, inhibition of ROS attenuated silica
   nanoparticles-induced apoptosis and inflammation and the activation of
   JNK, c-Jun, p53 and NF-kappa B. In summary, our findings demonstrated
   that silica nanoparticles could induce dysfunction of endothelial cells
   through oxidative stress via JNK, p53 and NF-kappa B pathways,
   suggesting that exposure to silica nanoparticles may be a significant
   risk for the development of cardiovascular diseases such as
   atherosclerosis and thrombus. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Introgression between genetically modified (GM) crops and wild relatives
   is considered to potentially modify the genetic background of the wild
   species. The emergence of volunteer-like feral populations through
   backcross of hybrids to the crop is also a concern. The progeny of
   spontaneous hybrids between mutant herbicide-resistant oilseed rape
   (Brassica napus) and wild B. juncea was obtained. Parents, F-2 and BC1
   to B. napus were planted together in the field so as to study their
   performance. The chromosome number of BC1 followed a Normal
   distribution. Mendelian ratio of the herbicide-resistance gene was
   found. The F-2 produced less seeds than B. napus, and BC1 had
   intermediate production. Herbicide-resistant BC1 were not different of
   their susceptible counterparts for plant weight, seed weight and seed
   number, but most of them exhibited B. napus morphology and larger
   flowers than the susceptible BC1. They displayed an important genetic
   variability allowing further adaptation and propagation of the
   herbicide-resistance gene. Pollen flow to susceptible plants within the
   mixed stand was observed. As a consequence, the resistant BC1 produced
   with B. napus pollen could frequently occur and easily establish as a
   false feral crop population within fields and along roadsides. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Simulation of frost formation process on cold surface is carried out
   based on fractal theory combined with phase change dynamics. Before
   frosting, the phenomena of vapor condensation, droplet growth and frozen
   on cold plate are successfully simulated based on phase change dynamics
   and then a fractal simulation of the frost formation and growth process
   over the frozen droplets is carried out based on diffusion limited
   aggregation (DLA) model. The simulation results accord well with the
   experimental results. The time when the condensation droplets are
   present and frozen on the surface during simulation process is nearly
   the same as the experimental result. Before the droplets are frozen, the
   trend that the surface contact radius of the droplet varies with
   condensation time is similar to actual one. The simulation results also
   show that the thickness, of frost layer is nearly equal to the measured
   value. By that means, the feasibility of this method of simulating the
   frost formation is verified and the new attempt made to foster the
   combination between fractal theory and phase change dynamics is of great
   significance. This study also provids a foundational theory work for a
   more reasonable and accurate frosting process model.}},

   surface. These sites are the tiny cavities of the rough surface
   resulting from the softening and swelling effect of an alcohol, such as
   isopropyl alcohol, on the polymer surface under microwave irradiation.
   The roughness of the polymer surface is an important factor for the
   effective immobilization. In addition, ionic liquid can induce low
   temperature surface anatase crystallization of immobilized titanium
   dioxide in a short time. From the field emission scanning electron
   microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy observation, the TiO2
   particles could be effectively immobilized on the PMMA substrate. Raman
   spectra analysis data showed that the immobilized TiO2 was anatase
   phase. The experimental data also shows that the immobilized TiO2
   prepared by this novel method has good immobilization stability and
   photocatalytic water treatment performance.}},

Abstract = {{The electromagnetic form factors of the Xi baryons and the semileptonic
   decay process Xi(c) -> Xi e(+)nu(e) are investigated in the frame work
   of the light-cone QCD sum rule method with Ioffe-type interpolating
   currents. Our estimates on the magnetic moments are mu(Xi)0 = -(1.75 +/-
   0.21)mu(N) and mu(Xi)- = -(1.01 +/- 0.11)mu(N). The decay width of the
   semileptonic process is expected to be Gamma(Xi(c) -> Xi e(+)nu(e)) =
   (6.17(-2.48)(+2.24)) x 10(-14) GeV. The results show that the adoption

Abstract = {{It was the aim of the study to analyze stress distribution in tooth and
   restoration by occlusal load of Class I. Comparative analysis was used
   to evaluate effects of four kinds of cement bases on the stresses in
   resin composite restorations. The elastic moduli and Poisson's ratios of
   the three kinds of restorative materials were tested. Micro-CT was used
   to scan the first mandibular molar, and the three-dimensional finite
   element model of the tooth with class I cavity was built by ABAQUS.
   Occlusive load of 250N was applied on the model. Then von Mises stresses
   distribution in the enamel, dentin, resin composite and bases were
   analyzed by occlusive loading of different cement bases. As single-layer
   base, the maximum von Mises stresses of the enamel and the dentin of the
   Dycal base were much lower than those of the VIT base. As double-layer
   base, the maximum von Mises stresses of the enamel and the dentin of VIT
   and Dycal were much higher than those of VIT and Ultra-blend plus.
   Cement bases should have a high elastic modulus in order to reduce the
   stress of the enamel and the dentin. The present study would help
   clinicians to make an informed choice of the cement bases to avoid the
   fracture of tooth or restoration. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{In 2002, Biham et al proposed an enhanced differential-linear
   cryptanalysis, where a differential characteristic with probability p (0
   < p <= ) can be combined with a linear characteristic to form a
   differential-linear distinguisher In this paper, we firstly introduce
   the concept of differential-linear hull and the method of cryptanalysis
   by using differential-linear hull, an extension to the enhanced
   differential-linear cryptanalysis, in which a differential
   characteristic can be combined with multiple linear characteristics to
   derive a differential-linear distinguisher Furthermore, we introduce a
   technique about how to search for differential-linear hull based on a
   differential-linear characteristic for SPN and Feistel block ciphers As
   a demonstration, this extension is applied to describe a
   differential-linear distinguisher for 4-round Serpent, and then the best
   known key recovery attack on 6-round Serpent is presented based on the
   differential-linear distinguisher In fact, our work is a new attempt to
   propose the idea of differential-linear hull and introduce a new
   cryptanalytic method for block ciphers by using differential-linear hull
   This new cryptanalytic method may be helpful to analyze a variety of
   block ciphers including SPN and Feistel schemes which could be adopted
   as the fundamental cryptographic components in the security solutions
   for future computer science}},

Abstract = {{Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease causing great morbidity and
   mortality in the Western world. To increase the anti-inflammatory action
   and decrease adverse effects of glucocorticoids (PLP), a nanomedicinal
   liposomal formulation of this drug (L-PLP) was developed and
   intravenously applied at a dose of 15 mg/kg PLP to a rabbit model of
   atherosclerosis. Since atherosclerosis is a systemic disease, emerging
   imaging modalities for assessing atherosclerotic plaque are being
   developed. F-18-Fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography and
   dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, methods commonly
   used in oncology, were applied to longitudinally assess therapeutic
   efficacy. Significant anti-inflammatory effects were observed as early
   as 2 days that lasted up to at least 7 days after administration of a
   single dose of L-PLP. No significant changes were found for the free PLP
   treated animals. These findings were corroborated by immunohistochemical
   analysis of macrophage density in the vessel wall. In conclusion, this
   study evaluates a powerful two-pronged strategy for efficient treatment
   of atherosclerosis that includes nanomedical therapy of atherosclerotic
   plaques and the application of noninvasive and clinically approved
   imaging techniques to monitor delivery and therapeutic responses.
   Importantly, we demonstrate unprecedented rapid anti-inflammatory
   effects in atherosclerotic lesions after the nanomedical therapy.}},

Title = {{Comparing Prostate Specific Antigen Triggers for Intervention in Men
   With Stable Prostate Cancer on Active Surveillance}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We determined the proportion of men with nonprogressive
   prostate cancer on active surveillance who had a trigger for treatment
   using various measures of prostate specific antigen kinetics.
   Materials and Methods: A prospective phase II study of patients with
   favorable clinical parameters (stage T1b-T2b N0M0, Gleason sum 7 or
   less, prostate specific antigen 15 ng/ml or less) on active surveillance
   was initiated in 1995. Those patients considered at high risk for
   progression were offered radical intervention. The remaining patients
   were closely monitored and formed the cohort for this study. We
   calculated the proportion and frequency of patients who had a trigger
   for treatment based on the various prostate specific antigen triggers
   (prostate specific antigen doubling time, prostate specific antigen
   velocity, prostate specific antigen threshold).
   Results: Of 450 patients followed on surveillance 305 remained on active
   surveillance without definitive intervention. None of these 305 patients
   have died of prostate cancer or have had symptomatic metastatic disease
   develop. Median followup was 6.8 years. The proportion of patients who
   would have had a trigger for treatment ranged from 14\% to 42\% for the
   threshold triggers, 37\% to 50\% for the prostate specific antigen
   doubling time triggers and 42\% to 84\% for the velocity triggers.
   Conclusions: Almost all of the prostate specific antigen triggers
   examined in this study would have led to high rates of trigger for
   treatment. More work is needed to identify a trigger that better strikes
   the balance between recommending treatment for patients at high risk for
   progression and minimizing treatment for those at low risk for
   progression.}},

Abstract = {{Localization of a specific subset of maternal mRNAs to the vegetal
   cortex of Xenopus oocytes is important for the regulation of germ layer
   formation and germ cell development. It is driven by vegetal
   localization complexes that are formed with the corresponding signal
   sequences in the untranslated regions of the mRNAs and with a number of
   different so-called localization proteins. In the context of the present
   study, we incorporated tagged variants of the known localization protein
   Vg1RBP into vegetal localization complexes by means of oocyte
   microinjection. Immunoprecipitation of the corresponding RNPs allowed
   for the identification of novel Vg1RBP-associated proteins, such as the
   embryonic poly( A) binding protein, the Y-box RNA-packaging protein 2B
   and the oocyte-specific version of the elongation factor 1 alpha
   (42Sp50). Incorporation of 42Sp50 into localization RNPs could be
   confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of Vg1RBP and Staufen1 with
   myc-tagged 42Sp50. Furthermore, myc-42Sp50 was found to co-sediment with
   the same two proteins in large, RNAse-sensitive complexes, as well as to
   associate specifically with several vegetally localizing mRNAs but not
   with nonlocalized control RNAs. Finally, oocyte microinjection
   experiments reveal that 42Sp50 is a protein that shuttles between the
   nucleus and cytoplasm. Taken together, these observations provide
   evidence for a novel function of 42Sp50 in the context of vegetal mRNA
   transport in Xenopus oocytes.}},

Title = {{Serum phosphate level in burn patients}},
Journal = {{BURNS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1112-1115}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Despite plasma phosphate imbalance being rare, it is a
   relatively common finding in certain subsets of burn patients. It may
   occur due to the burn itself or as a result of the treatment. Severe
   hypophosphataemia (<1.0 mg dl(-1)) is associated with a significant
   morbidity and a fourfold increase in mortality. In this study, the
   relation between serum phosphate level and the total body surface area
   (TBSA) of the burn was compared.
   Methods: According to the percentage of TBSA of the burn, the patients
   (n = 155) were divided into three groups: group A with 20-29\% TBSA
   burns, group B with 30-39\% and group C with more than 40\% TBSA burns
   (62, 48 and 45 patients, respectively).
   Analysis of variance (ANOVA)-repeated measure was used to detect any
   statistically significant difference in the three post-burn time-points
   of 3rd, 6th and 9th days and the mean score of the serum phosphate level
   between the three groups. Results: The incidence of hypophosphataemia at
   9th post-burn day in the three groups was 6.1\%, 32.4\% and 73.5\%,
   respectively. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) between mean
   serum phosphate levels of groups A and C, B and C and A and B as well.
   We found significant differences between the three post-burn follow-up
   time stages.
   Discussion: We have shown that hypophosphataemia, defined as mean serum
   phosphate levels below 3.0 mg dl(-1), was very common following burn,
   based on 75.6\% of patients with more than 40\% burn at the 3rd
   post-burn day. As the percentage of TBSA of burn increases, the
   incidence of hypophosphataemia significantly increases. We suggest that
   phosphate level be routinely measured after a major burn, especially in
   patients with a complicated course, so that appropriate replacement
   therapy may be started in a timely manner. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and

Abstract = {{Background: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an active stimulator of bone
   marrow osteoblasts; it is involved in the niche organization, ie the
   bone marrow microenvironment which controls the turnover and the fate of
   endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). PTH stimulates EPC production; this
   action can be measured by counting the number of circulating CD34+
   cells.
   Methods: This observational cross-sectional study aimed to verify this
   effect in 3 groups of hemodialysis patients with different serum PTH
   levels. The first group consisted of 11 patients affected by secondary
   hyperparathyroidism (SHPTH group, serum PTH levels > 500 pg/ml); the
   second group consisted of 10 patients with serum PTH levels between 150
   and 500 pg/ml (TargetPTH group); the third group consisted of 10
   patients with serum PTH levels below the treatment target after
   parathyroidectomy (PTx group, serum PTH levels <150 pg/ml). Serum PTH,
   calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), alkaline phosphatases (ALP), urea
   nitrogen, albumin and hemoglobin were measured. Flow cytofluorimetry
   with CD45+ sequential gating was effected; therefore, CD34+ cells could
   be analyzed.
   Results: The SHPTH group showed significantly higher values of serum
   PTH, P and ALP (respectively, p<0.0001, p<0.033 and p<0.0001), and
   significantly lower values of circulating CD34+ cells (both in absolute
   and percent terms) in the SHPTH and in the TargetPTH groups (for both,
   p<0.0001). Two models of multiple regression analysis built with
   circulating CD34+ cells (expressed as percentage in the first one and as
   absolute values in the second one) as dependent variables showed that
   only serum PTH and P values were inversely associated with both.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that an inverse relationship exists in
   uremic patients among circulating CD34+ cells and serum P and PTH
   levels. The count of circulating CD34+ cells might represent a novel
   biomarker for the assessment of the cardiovascular risk for dialysis
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution tomographic images obtained from crosshole geophysical
   measurements have the potential to provide valuable information about
   the geostatistical properties of unsaturated-zone hydrologic-state
   variables such as moisture content. Under drained or quasi-steady-state
   conditions, the moisture content will reflect the variation of the
   physical properties of the subsurface, which determine the flow patterns
   in the unsaturated zone. Deterministic least-squares inversion of
   crosshole ground-penetrating- radar (GPR) traveltimes result in smooth,
   minimum-variance estimates of the subsurface radar wave velocity
   structure, which may diminish the utility of these images for
   geostatistical inference. We have used a linearized stochastic inversion
   technique to infer the geostatistical properties of the subsurface radar
   wave velocity distribution using crosshole GPR traveltimes directly.
   Expanding on a previous study, we have determined that it is possible to
   obtain estimates of global variance and mean velocity values of the
   subsurface as well as the correlation lengths describing the subsurface
   velocity structures. Accurate estimation of the global variance is
   crucial if stochastic realizations of the subsurface are used to
   evaluate the uncertainty of the inversion estimate. We have explored the
   full potential of the geostatistical inference method using several
   synthetic models of varying correlation structures and have tested the
   influence of different assumptions concerning the choice of covariance
   function and data noise level. In addition, we have tested the
   methodology on traveltime data collected at a field site in Denmark.
   There, inferred correlation structures indicate that structural
   differences exist between two areas located approximately 10 m apart, an
   observation confirmed by a GPR reflection profile. Furthermore, the
   inferred values of the subsurface global variance and the mean velocity
   have been corroborated with moisture-content measurements, obtained
   gravimetrically from samples collected at the field site.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In breast cancer, vascular endothelial growth factor C,
   transforming growth factor beta, placental growth factor, and fibroblast
   growth factor (acidic and basic) promote angiogenesis and metastases. We
   tested the hypothesis that a propofol-paravertebral anesthetic (PPA)
   technique would attenuate postoperative changes in these angiogenic
   factors to a greater extent than balanced general anesthesia (GA) and
   morphine analgesia in women undergoing surgery for primary breast
   cancer.
   Method: Forty women with primary breast cancer undergoing surgical
   excision were randomized to receive either standard GA or PPA technique.
   Venous blood was sampled before and at 24 h after surgery and serum
   analyzed. The primary endpoint was a preoperative versus postoperative
   change in vascular endothelial growth factor C and transforming growth
   factor beta concentrations.
   Results: Using a visual analog scale (median {[}25-75\% interquartile
   range]), PPA patients (1 {[}0-2]) had less pain at 2 h (P = 0.02) than
   did GA patients (3 {[}2-5]). The mean postoperative change in vascular
   endothelial growth factor C concentrations among GA patients was 733
   versus 27 pg/ml for PPA patients (difference, 706 {[}97.5\% CI,
   280-1,130] pg/ml, P = 0.001). In contrast, the mean postoperative change
   in transforming growth factor beta concentration among GA patients was
   -163 versus 146 pg/ml for PPA patients (difference, 309 {[}97.5\% CI,
   -474 to -143] pg/ml, P = 0.005). Concentrations of placental growth
   factor and fibroblast growth factor, both acidic and basic, were
   undetectable in serum.
   Conclusion: Anesthetic technique influences serum concentrations of
   factors associated with angiogenesis in primary breast cancer surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic communication through whistles is well developed in dolphins.
   However, little is known on how dolphins are using whistles because
   localizing the sound source is not an easy task. In the present study,
   the hyperbola method was used to localize the sound source using a
   two-hydrophone array. A combined visual and acoustic method was used to
   determine the identity of the whistling dolphin. In an aquarium in
   Mexico City where two adult bottlenose dolphins were housed we recorded
   946 whistles during 22 days. We found that a dolphin was located along
   the calculated hyperbola for 72.9\% of the whistles, but only for 60.3\%
   of the whistles could we determine the identity of the whistling
   dolphin. However, sometimes it was possible to use other cues to
   identify the whistling dolphin. It could be the animal that performed a
   behavior named ``observation{''} at the time whistling occurred or, when
   a whistle was only recorded on one channel, the whistling dolphin could
   be the animal located closest to the hydrophone that captured the
   whistle. Using these cues, 15.4\% of the whistles were further ascribed
   to either dolphin to obtain an overall identification efficiency of
   75.7\%. Our results show that a very simple and inexpensive acoustic
   setup can lead to a reasonable number of identifications of the captive
   whistling dolphin: this is the first study to report such a high rate of
   whistles identified to the free swimming, captive dolphin that produced
   them. Therefore, we have a data set with which we can investigate how
   dolphins are using whistles. This method can be applied in other aquaria
   where a small number of dolphins is housed; though, the actual
   efficiency of this method will depend on how often dolphins spend time
   next to each other and on the reverberation conditions of the pool. (C)

Abstract = {{Products derived from bamboo EMAL pyrolysis were investigated by means
   of pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and the
   effects of temperature and catalyst (sodium chloride, permutite) on the
   yields of pyrolysis products were probed in detail. The results showed
   that thermal degradation of EMAL mainly occurred at the temperature
   range from 250 degrees C to 600 degrees C, and both the temperature and
   catalyst in EMAL pyrolysis were important factors in the formation or
   inhibition of products. The products that derived from
   p-hydroxyphenylpropanoid, guaiacylpropanoid, and syringylpropanoid of
   lignin units by pyrolytic reactions were classified as the heterocycle
   (2,3-dihydrobenzofuran), phenols, a small quantity of acetic acid and
   furans, etc. With an increase of pyrolysis temperature, the amount
   fraction of 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (DHBF) decreased from 66.26\% to
   19.15\%. Moreover, when the additive catalyst increased from 5\% to
   20\%, permutite catalyst improved in the formation of DHBF from 19.15\%
   to 24.19\%, whereas NaCl catalyst was effective to inhibit the
   production of DHBF from 19.15\% to 13.08\%. Permutite promoted the
   production of coke from EMAL pyrolysis, conversely, NaCl had an
   inhibiting effect on the generation of coke. And NaCl catalyst had a
   significant catalytic effect on raising or reducing of the product
   yields in bamboo lignin pyrolysis. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{132}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, algorithms have been developed to help automate the
   production of dynamic system models. Part of this effort has been the
   development of algorithms that use modeling metrics for generating
   minimum complexity models with realization preserving structure and
   parameters. Existing algorithms, add or remove ideal compliant elements
   from a model, and consequently do not equally emphasize the contribution
   of the other fundamental physical phenomena, i.e., ideal inertial or
   resistive elements, to the overall system behavior. Furthermore, these
   algorithms have only been developed for linear or linearized models,
   leaving the automated production of models of nonlinear systems
   unresolved. Other model reduction techniques suffer from similar
   limitations due to linearity or the requirement that the reduced models
   be realization preserving. This paper presents a new modeling metric,
   activity, which is based on energy. This metric is used to order the
   importance of all energy elements in a system model. The ranking of the
   energy elements provides the relative importance of the model parameters
   and this information is used as a basis to reduce the size of the model
   and as a type of parameter sensitivity information for system design.
   The metric is implemented in an automated modeling algorithm called
   model order reduction algorithm ( MORA) that can automatically generate
   a hierarchical series of reduced models that are realization preserving
   based on choosing the energy threshold below which energy elements are
   not included in the model. Finally, MORA is applied to a nonlinear
   quarter car model to illustrate that energy elements with low activity
   can be eliminated from the model resulting in a reduced order model,
   with physically meaningful parameters, which also accurately predicts
   the behavior of the full model. The activity metric appears to be a
   valuable metric for automating the reduction of nonlinear system
   models-providing in the process models that provide better insight and
   may be more numerically efficient. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4002473]}},

Abstract = {{The work presented in this paper deals with the development of a
   solution for structural masonry walls to be used in zones with different

   of traditional cavity walls. A key concern on modern construction is
   sustainability, particularly with respect to energy efficient buildings,
   as energy consumption of buildings represents a significant share of the
   total consumption of energy. The novel clay masonry unit proposed here
   ensures an appropriate thermal and mechanical performance. Besides the
   description of the optimization process to obtain a proper thermal
   performance, the paper addresses mechanical validation based on a set of
   experimental tests carried out on units and masonry walls under uniaxial
   compressive loading. Additionally, a set of in-plane cyclic tests were
   carried out on masonry walls in order to assess the performance of the
   system under seismic loading. The results indicate that the proposed
   masonry unit leads to adequate thermal and mechanical behavior. (C) 2010

   to reconstruct relationships among all genera and nearly all
   wood-warbler species, based on a matrix of mitochondrial DNA (5840
   nucleotides) and nuclear DNA (6 loci, 4602 nucleotides) characters. The
   resulting phylogenetic hypotheses provide a highly congruent picture of
   wood-warbler relationships, and indicate that the traditional generic
   classification of these birds recognizes many non-monophyletic groups.
   We recommend a revised taxonomy in which each of 14 genera (Seiurus,
   Helmitheros, Mniotilta, Limnothlypis, Protonotaria, Parkesia, Vermivora,
   Oreothlypis, Geothlypis, Setophaga, Myioborus, Cardellina, Basileuterus,
   Myiothlypis) corresponds to a well-supported clade; these nomenclatural
   changes also involve subsuming a number of well-known, traditional
   wood-warbler genera (Catharopeza, Dendroica, Ergaticus, Euthlypis,
   Leucopeza, Oporornis, Parula, Phaeothlypis, Wilsonia). We provide a
   summary phylogenetic hypothesis that will be broadly applicable to
   investigations of the historical biogeography, processes of
   diversification, and evolution of trait variation in this well studied
   avian group. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Chromatographic separation was achieved with a C8 column using a mobile
   phase of methanol: 1\% acetic acid (50-50, v/v) with a flow rate of 1.0
   ml/min. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 0.1-4.0 mu
   g/ml (r(2) > 0.99) and the lower limit of quantification was 0.1 mu
   g/ml. The method was validated for sensitivity, accuracy, precision,
   recovery and stability. The method was used to determine the
   concentration-time profiles of actarit in the plasma following oral
   administration of 100 mg actarit tablets.}},

Abstract = {{We study a spline-based likelihood method for the partly linear model
   with monotonicity constraints. We use monotone B-splines to approximate
   the monotone nonparametric function and apply the generalized Rosen
   algorithm to compute the estimators jointly. We show that the spline
   estimator of the nonparametric component achieves the possible optimal
   rate of convergence under the smooth assumption and that the estimator
   of the regression parameter is asymptotically normal and efficient.
   Moreover, a spline-based semiparametric likelihood ratio test is
   established to make inference of the regression parameter. Also an
   observed profile information method to consistently estimate the
   standard error of the spline estimator of the regression parameter is
   proposed. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the finite sample
   performance of the proposed method. The method is illustrated by an air
   pollution study. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Approaching the earthquake, we observed clear variations in the seismic
   wave propagation properties. The elastic properties of rocks in the

Abstract = {{Aim: The goal of this research was to develop and preliminarily test a
   novel technology and instrumentation that could help to significantly
   increase the diagnostic yield of current colon cancer screening
   procedures. This technology is based on a combined fluorescence optical
   coherence tomography (OCT) imaging, and topical delivery of a
   cancer-targeting agent. Materials \& methods: Gold colloid-adsorbed
   poly(epsilon-caprolactone) microparticles were labeled with a
   near-infrared dye, and functionalized with argentine glycine aspartic
   acid (RGD peptide) to effectively target cancer tissue, and enhance
   fluorescence-imaging contrast. The RGD peptide recognizes the
   alpha,beta(3)-integrin receptor, which is overexpressed by epithelial
   cancer cells. OCT was used under fluorescence guidance to visualize
   tissue morphology and, thus, to serve as a confirmatory tool for cancer
   presence. Results: A preliminary testing of this technology on human
   colon cancer cell lines, a mouse model of colon cancer, as well as human
   colon tissue specimens, was performed. Strong binding of microparticles
   to cancer cells and no binding to cells that do not significantly
   express integrins, such as mouse fibroblasts, was observed. Preferential
   binding to cancer tissue was also observed. Strong fluorescence signals
   were obtained from cancer tissue, owing to the efficient binding of the
   contrast agent. OCT imaging was capable of revealing clear differences
   between normal and cancer tissue. Conclusion: A dual-modality imaging
   approach combined with topical delivery of a cancer-targeting contrast
   agent has been preliminarily tested for colon cancer diagnosis.
   Preferential binding of the contrast agent to cancer tissue allowed the
   cancer-suspicious locations to be highlighted and, thus, guided OCT
   imaging to visualize tissue morphology and determine tissue type. If
   successful, this multimodal approach might help to increase the
   sensitivity and the specificity of current colon cancer-screening
   procedures in the future.}},

Title = {{GC/MS detection of central nervous tissues as specified BSE risk
   material in meat products: validation by an externally controlled blind
   trial}},
Journal = {{ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{The addition of central nervous tissues (CNT), such as brain and spinal
   cord, in the manufacturing of meat products is either forbidden-if the
   material falls under the legal definition of specified risk material
   (SRM)-or must be labelled on the packed product. To foster official food
   control, several CNT detection methods were developed, but only fatty
   acid patterns as detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
   (GC/MS) allow the further characterization of the detected CNT as to
   both the animal species and-surprisingly-the age of the animal from
   which the CNT was derived in accordance with the legal definition.
   Complementing a previous report in this journal by Lucker et al. 2010
   (doi:10.1007/s00216-010-3956-5) on CNT quantification by GC/MS, we now
   report results of the validation of this new analytical approach by an
   externally controlled blind trial elucidating its potential to identify
   the species and age of the CNT detected. The 72 samples (24 standards of
   emulsion-type sausage, each heated in three different batches: 75A
   degrees C, 30 min; 115A degrees C, 25 min; 133A degrees C, 40 min)
   containing porcine, ovine or bovine muscle tissue and differing amounts
   of CNT (bovine or ovine brain: 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0\% m/m) were
   produced externally and provided blind for analyses to our laboratory.
   In accordance with the previous study, heating had no detectable effect
   on the GC/MS analysis. Judged by the present sensitivity of this method
   (cut-off 0.2\% CNT), all of the samples containing 0.5\% or more CNT (n
   = 57, 100\%) were identified correctly as CNT-positive. The CNT species
   was identified correctly in 54 samples (94.7\%), with three samples of
   one specific standard (0.5\% ovine CNT) falsely classified as bovine
   CNT. However, the CNT age of these samples was correctly classified
   (more than 12 months). Overall, 57 samples (100\%) were correctly
   classified as SRM-positive and 15 samples (100\%) as SRM-negative. To
   the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a legal demand
   for the (1) detection of traces of a specific tissue in a food matrix,
   (2) the identification of its taxonomic origin and (3) the
   classification of its age has been shown to be analytically possible in
   totally blind samples. The very positive validation results of this
   externally controlled blind trial recommend the present GC/MS approach
   for the detection of CNT in meat products as a reference method.
   However, our results also demonstrate the need for further studies, in
   particular to increase sensitivity and to conduct ring trials including
   more than one laboratory.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Remote magnetic catheter navigation (RMN) may facilitate catheter
   ablation. However, as the system uses permanent magnets, interference
   (INF) with devices for pacing {[}pacemaker (PM)], defibrillation
   {[}implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD)], or cardiac
   resynchronisation {[}cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)] may occur.
   We investigated the effects of the RMN system on implanted arrhythmia
   devices in a prospective series.
   Prior to RMN-guided electrophysiological procedures, devices were fully
   interrogated and programmed to VVI 40/min with tachycardia detection off
   (if applicable). Periprocedural device performance was monitored by
   12-lead electrocardiogram, and duration and effect of asynchronous
   stimulation resulting from INF were evaluated. Following the procedure,
   devices were again interrogated and system integrity verified. A total
   of 21 procedures in 18 patients with implanted devices {[}PM n = 12, ICD
   n = 3, CRT-pacemaker (P) n = 1, CRT-defibrillation (D) n = 2] were
   evaluated. No relevant changes in lead parameters or device programming
   were observed after the procedure. No INF was noted in ICD/CRT-D devices
   (tachycardia detection off) and in 2 PMs, whereas 10 PMs and 1 CRT-P
   switched to asynchronous stimulation for 1.8 +/- 0.3 h (63 +/- 13\% of
   RMN duration) without clinical adverse effects. In one patient,
   ventricular tachycardia (VT) degenerating in ventricular fibrillation
   occurred, but no causal relation between INF and VT initiation could be
   ascertained.
   This prospective data provide no evidence that using RMN in patients
   with implanted arrhythmia devices may cause persistent device
   dysfunction. Asynchronous PM stimulation is common without negative
   clinical consequences. Although a causal role of INF for the VT observed
   seems unlikely, risks and benefits of RMN utilization should carefully
   be weighed for each patient with an implanted arrhythmia device.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of work was to study Norwegian consumers' acceptance of pork

   consumers (N = 55) participated in a home test and evaluated 11 samples
   with different skatole (range 0-0.35 ppm) and androstenone (range 0-9.0
   ppm) levels. Liking of odour during frying and odour and flavour of the
   fried meat were evaluated. Results showed that the non sensitive
   consumers accepted all levels of androstenone in the samples. Sensitive
   consumers gave a significantly lower liking score for androstenone
   samples containing 3 ppm (and more) than the reference sample when
   evaluating these samples above the frying pan, but no significant
   difference were found between 3 ppm samples and reference samples when
   liking of fried meat was evaluated. This indicated that the sensitive
   consumers accepted 3 ppm in fried meat, but not if 3 ppm was present in
   the sample during the frying process. The same consumer's differentiated
   skatole samples with regard to flavour at 0.15 ppm. The Norwegian
   established practise with a threshold value of 0.21 ppm skatole is
   higher than the value accepted by the consumers. (C) 2010 The American

   70-5 DE, a mixture of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (hereafter called
   PBDE); and Cereclor 701, a mixture of chlorinated paraffins (hereafter
   called CP).
   Female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to these compounds in dose
   ranges of 1.3-18.7 mg/kg bw/day (PBDE) and 1-55 mg/kg bw/day (CP), by
   gavage for 14 days. Biological responses were measured on liver somatic
   index (151) and hepatic enzyme activity of (a)
   ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) (indicating CYP1A1 activity), (b)
   pentoxyresorufin-O-depentylase (PROD) (indicating CYP2B activity) and
   (c) the phase II conjugation enzyme uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl
   transferase (UDP-GT). The levels of total and free thyroxine hormone in
   rat plasma (TT4 and FT4, respectively) were also measured. In the
   experimental work, a Doehlert uniform shell design was used in order to
   select the combination of concentrations of PBDE and CP administered to
   the rats. Eight different combinations were used, including a control.
   The measured responses were modelled with multiple linear regression
   (MLR), giving response surface plots. The results showed strong
   synergism between the two flame retardants at one particular exposure
   combination, resulting in increased hepatic microsomal enzyme responses
   and decreased serum T-4 concentrations. Notably, the exposure
   combination causing the most marked effects represented intermediate
   doses of both substances. The mechanisms behind the observed effects are
   unknown, but may involve induction or inhibition of enzyme systems.

   software commonly used in psychological experiments. The olfactometer
   can present either solid or liquid odor sources, and it exhibits a fast
   stimulus-rise time and a fast and stable stimulus-onset time. We provide
   a detailed description of the olfactometer construction, a list of its
   individual parts and prices, as well as potential modifications to the
   design. In addition, we present odor onset and concentration curves as
   measured with a photo-ionization detector, together with corresponding
   GC/MS analyses of signal-intensity drop (5.9\%) over a longer period of
   use. Finally, we present data from behavioral and psychophysiological
   recordings demonstrating that the olfactometer is suitable for use
   during event-related EEG experiments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{While advances in highly targeted therapies and increased use of
   mammogram services have contributed to the overall decline of breast
   cancer deaths in the United States, these benefits have not been
   distributed equitably. Less educated, poor, rural, non-Hispanic African
   American women have poorer access to cancer services and are less likely
   to have had a mammogram than are urban women. Lack of physician
   recommendations and perceived barriers in accessing diagnostic services
   are major factors that hinder the uptake of regular mammograms in rural
   communities. This article reports results of formative research
   conducted as part of a larger study focused on the participatory
   development of an electronic reminder system for breast cancer
   screening. The article discusses insights gained from focus groups with
   rural patients and clinicians about their information needs, breast
   cancer screening behaviors, barriers to care, and mammography referral
   practices.}},

Abstract = {{Tri- and diorganotin(IV) dicarboxylates derived from trans-glutaconic
   acid and acetone 1,3-dicarboxylic acid were prepared. Their structure
   was studied using NMR, IR, and MS data. All of these compounds (except
   for compound 2a) are polymeric in the solid state and depolymerise upon
   dissolving in deuteriochloroform to give monomeric particles with
   four-coordinated central tin atoms. X-ray crystallography was used to
   characterize (E)-bis(tributylstannyl) pent-2-enedioate (1a). This
   compound crystallizes in a monoclinic space group system. The
   supramolecular organization of 1a can be described as layered polymeric
   sheets constructed of forty-membered rings that are interconnected on
   four different sites to the third dimension. Each layer assembled of the
   forty-membered rings, is made up of six triorganotin fragments and six
   trans-glutaconic acids, where four of them are incorporated in the core
   of the ring and other two are bidentate bridging and participating in
   the ring system by three atoms of CO2 group only. (C) 2010 Published by

   hammer strength (HS) machines compared to free weights (FWs) and also to
   develop regression equations that can accurately predict 1RM when
   switching from exercise modality to another. Thirty-one trained male
   subjects performed 1-RM lifts (1RM's) on 3 HS externally loaded machines
   and 3 comparable FW exercises. Subjects performed 2 1RM tests during
   each laboratory session, with at least 48-72 hours of recovery between
   each. One repetition maximum data were used to (a) determine the
   relationship between 1RM performed on HS vs. FW and (b) to develop
   regression equations that can accurately predict 1RM's when switching
   from 1 exercise modality to another. Statistics revealed significant
   differences (p < 0.05) between 1RM's performed on the HS equipment as
   compared to its corresponding (FW) exercise. For all exercises, 1RM's
   were significantly greater on the HS equipment. Regression equations
   were developed for all exercises, except when predicting the HS shoulder
   press and the HS preacher curls from their free weight counterparts,
   where no variables existed that could significantly predict their
   respective 1RM's. As 1 RMs were significantly greater when using the HS
   equipment compared to when using FWs, those transitioning from HS
   exercise to FW exercise should exercise caution.}},

   Materials and Methods Thirty consenting patients participated in the
   study At the end of active treatment (T-1), final archwires were removed
   while leaving the fixed appliances on, and alginate impressions were
   taken Four weeks later (T-2) a second set of impressions was taken A
   clinical examination performed at T-2 determined if the fixed appliances
   could be removed or if additional treatment was required Based on the
   examination, patients were divided into two groups Patients in group I
   (n = 13) had their fixed appliances removed, while those in group II (n
   = 17) required additional treatment The American Board of Orthodontics'
   Objective Grading System scores and the following six variables were
   measured on plaster casts at T-1 and T-2 maxillary and mandibular
   crowding or spacing, overbite, overjet, and mandibular intercanine and
   intermolar widths Data were analyzed to detect potential changes from
   T-1 to T-2 and to evaluate differences between the groups
   Results Mandibular crowding, overjet, and interproximal contacts
   worsened for the entire sample, while marginal ridges, occlusal
   contacts, and total American Board of Orthodontics scores improved No
   statistically significant changes were found within group I from T-1 to
   T-2 Mandibular crowding, overbite, overjet, alignment/rotations, and

Abstract = {{A straightforward procedure of estimating maximum values of seismic peak
   ground acceleration and quantiles of its probabilistic distribution on a
   future time interval of 100 years is applied to territory of India. The
   input information for the method is seismic catalog and regression
   relation between peak ground acceleration at a given point and magnitude
   and distance from the considered site to hypocenter (seismic effect
   attenuation law). The method is based on Bayesian approach, which simply
   allows account the influence of uncertainties of seismic acceleration
   values. The main assumptions for the method are Poissonian character of
   seismic events flow, a frequency-magnitude law of Gutenberg-Richter's
   type with cutoff maximal value for estimated parameter and a seismic
   catalog, having a rather big number of events. The results obtained in

Abstract = {{The present study demonstrates the processes by which 12 young women
   working in four production chain factories in China shape their own
   lives - their developmental trajectories - during the period following
   their entry into factory work. One-on-one, in-depth, semi-structured
   interviews were conducted in August, 2005, as part of an evaluation
   project that assessed the labor practices and interpersonal
   relationships in production chain factories. These interviews revealed
   considerable personal agency among the women, and prompted us to examine
   how this agency manifests itself, and what individual and contextual
   factors influence it. Operating from a developmental systems
   perspective, and using a ``grounded approach{''} to identify active,
   personal agency as the organizing construct for this investigation, we
   adopted the selective optimization with compensation (SOC) model to
   guide data analysis and presentation, after initial data coding
   indicated its suitability. Findings suggest that activity within these
   three components (selection, optimization, and compensation) is oriented
   toward fulfilling both the women's family goals and their career goals.
   These workers sought to improve the well-being of their families and
   themselves through selecting to work in these particular production
   chain factories, optimizing their factory experiences, and compensating
   for the attendant losses - personal and career-related. Individual
   characteristics, such as marital status, migrant status, and educational
   background, in combination with contextual factors, such as family
   socio-economic background and factory labor practices, influenced these
   women worker's decisions, and thus, their developmental course.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Traumatic tricuspid insufficiency (TTI) is uncommon and
   surgical experience is limited. We report our surgical experience with
   TTI in 13 patients.
   Methods. From January 2000 through March 2008, we operated on 13
   patients with TTI (10 men 3 women; mean age, 39.8 +/- 10.5 years). The
   intervals from trauma to diagnosis and from trauma to surgery averaged
   37.4 and 54.4 months, respectively. At operation, the mechanism of TTI
   was due to anterior chordal rupture in 8, anterior papillary muscle
   rupture in 3, rupture of anterior papillary muscle and chordae in 1, and
   anterior leaflet defect in 1. In 7 patients the annulus was dilated.
   Valve repair was successful in 13 patients.
   Results. No early or late deaths occurred. Severe hemolysis occurred in
   1 patient after tricuspid and mitral valve repairs. At follow-up
   extending to 9.5 years, 9 patients were in New York Heart Association
   functional class I, and 4 were in class II. Transthoracic
   echocardiography demonstrated no or trivial residual regurgitation in 7
   patients, mild regurgitation in 4, and mild-to-moderate regurgitation in
   2. A significant decrease of the right ventricular end-diastolic
   dimension (37.7 +/- 9.7 vs 20.7 +/- 4.6 mm; p < 0.001) was observed. The
   mean transvalvular gradient was 2.5 +/- 0.8 mm Hg. Eleven patients were
   in sinus rhythm.
   Conclusions. Satisfactory early and midterm outcomes can be achieved for
   TTI by tricuspid valve repair. Early surgical intervention should be
   emphasized to achieve good functional results and preserve the right
   ventricular function. (Ann Thorac Surg 2010;90:1934-8) (C) 2010 by The

Abstract = {{The phase transition rule of near-beta Ti-3Zr-Mo-15Nb (TLE) medical
   titanium alloys was analyzed through DSC curves and XRD patterns;
   effects of the processing and the heat treatment on microstructure and
   mechanical properties of the TLE alloys was investigated by OM, TEM and
   tensile experiments. The results show that fine and equiaxed grains in
   the TLE alloy are formed after rolling in the (alpha+beta) phase field
   and solution-treatment; quenching of the beta phase filed results in the
   formation of a metastable martensitic structure alpha `' (orthorhombic).
   After low-temperature aging, some of alpha `' martensite is decomposed
   into alpha martensite; with the aging temperature increasing, alpha `'
   martensite is absolutely decomposed into alpha martensite. When the
   aging temperature is 250 degrees C, high strength, low modulus and high
   plasticity of the alloy can match preferably with human bone. The
   microstructure observation of the alloy indicates that the interaction
   between a few alpha `' orthorhombic martensite, alpha martensite and
   certain dislocation lead to lower elastic modulus and higher plasticity,
   while a lot of cross martensite which are fine and needle-like
   contribute greatly to biomechanical property.}},

Abstract = {{We provide the first quantification and localization of the nicotinic
   acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) alpha 7 and beta 2 in the human adult
   and infant brainstem and hippocampus. After applying
   immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed and paraffin embedded human brain
   tissue, we qualitatively analyzed the staining to provide a comparison
   in expression amongst the brainstem nuclei and hippocampal regions, and
   between the infants and adults. Amongst the brainstem regions studied,
   the greatest protein expression for both alpha 7 and beta 2 subunits was
   in the motor nuclei of the medulla and pons. Lowest expression for both
   subunits was in the midbrain nuclei, except for the oculomotor nucleus.
   Comparison between infants and adults showed greater expression in the
   infant brainstem nuclei of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus,
   hypoglossal, inferior olivary nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract,
   abducens, and facial nuclei, for both alpha 7 and beta 2 nAChRs. In the
   hippocampus, only the alpha 7 subunit showed greater expression in
   infants compared to adults. We conclude that both alpha 7 and beta 2
   containing nAChRs play an important role in many nuclei of the human
   infant and adult brainstem, and that the alpha 7 subunit may have a more
   prominent role in the infant than adult hippocampus. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To investigate spatial patterns of the incidence of pulmonary
   tuberculosis (TB) and its relationship with socio-economic status in
   Vitoria, Espirito Santo, Brazil.
   DESIGN: In a 4-year, retrospective, territory-based surveillance study
   of all new pulmonary TB cases conducted in Vitoria between 2002 and
   2006, spatial patterns of disease incidence were compared using spatial
   clustering statistics (Anselin's local indicators of spatial association
   {[}LISA] and Getis-Ord Gi{*} statistics), smoothed empirical Bayes
   estimates and model-predicted incidence rates. Spatial Poisson models
   were fit to examine the relationship between socio-economic status and
   TB incidence.
   RESULTS: A total of 651 TB cases were reported across 78 neighborhoods,
   with rates ranging from 0 to 129 cases per 100 000 population. Moran's I
   indicated strong spatial autocorrelation among incidence rates (0.399, P
   < 0.0001), and four areas of high incidence were identified by LISA and
   Gi{*} statistics. Smoothed spatial empirical Bayes estimates demonstrate
   that two of these areas range from 70 to 90 cases/100 000, while the
   other two range from 40 to 70 cases/100 000. TB incidence and
   socioeconomic status had a significant curvilinear relationship (P =
   0.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: Data derived from these spatial statistical tools will help
   TB control programs to allocate TB resources to those populations most
   at risk of increasing TB rates and to target areas where TB control
   efforts need to be concentrated.}},

Abstract = {{The paradoxical relationship between immunodeficiency
   (under-responsiveness) and autoimmunity (over-responsiveness) affecting
   the immune system was debated at the Fourth AARDA Colloquium on
   cross-disciplinary issues in autoimmunity. Immunodeficiency disease and
   autoimmune disease, far from being mutually exclusive, share profound
   dysregulation of the immune system. Among the most keenly discussed
   issues were: i) the remarkably high number of molecularly identified
   primary immunodeficiencies with autoimmune expressions; ii) the
   homeostasis of immune function such that deficiency in any one given
   compartment can result in over activity in the same or another
   compartment: iii) whilst some immune deficiency states are essentially
   monogenic, each of them can exhibit striking variability in autoimmune
   outcome, indicative of epigenetic or environmental influences on
   phenotypic expression; iv) innate immunity, particularly complement
   defects, as well as adaptive immunity, is complicit in the
   immunodeficiency-autoimmunity axis; v) features of certain of the
   disorders discussed at the meeting forced a reappraisal of what actually
   is meant by `autoimmune disease'. It was concluded that genes that
   determine inherited immunodeficiencies, hitherto rather neglected by
   autoimmunologists, compel attention to consideration of molecular
   genetic anomalies critical for emergence of autoimmune disease in humans
   and animals. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Wild populations of a small neotropical primate, Geoffroy's tamarin
   (Saguinus geoffroyi), were studied through 30-s instantaneous
   observational sampling to identify different canopy habitats used by
   this tamarin. Tree and shrub canopies were sampled in randomly selected
   plots and in nearby plots that tamarins were observed to use in the
   forests of Agua Clara, Panama (28 d, 59 100-m(2) plots, 32.25 h of
   tamarin observations, 27 tamarins in total), and in the nearby forests
   of Barro Colorado Island (49 d, 29 100-m(2) plots, 29.6 h of tamarin
   observations, 14 tamarins in total). Light penetration through the
   canopy, ambient temperature and humidity, presence of other primates,
   stem diameters, plant life-forms, distribution of woody flora, abundance
   of fleshy fruits and arthropods typically consumed by tamarins and
   abundance of thorny vegetation and biting arthropods in plots used by
   tamarins were compared with control plots. Habitats used by tamarins had
   significantly shorter distances between adjacent tree canopies and
   between canopies and the ground. There was a random distribution of
   large insects and fleshy fruits that tamarins are known to eat. Habitat
   selection by tamarins may not be influenced by spiny vegetation, but
   tamarins may avoid areas with abundant hooked thorns and blood-sucking
   arthropods. Mobility along runways in various tiers of a rain-forest
   canopy may be of primary importance, with local abundance of food being
   a secondary consideration in habitat selection by this small primate.}},

Abstract = {{Respiratory acid-base disorders are those abnormalities in acid-base
   equilibrium that are expressed as primary changes in the arterial carbon
   dioxide tension (PaCO(2)). An increase in PaCO(2) (hypercapnia)
   acidifies body fluids and initiates the acid-base disturbance known as
   respiratory acidosis. By contrast, a decrease in PaCO(2) (hypocapnia)
   alkalinizes body fluids and initiates the acid-base disturbance known as
   respiratory alkalosis. The impact on systemic acidity of these primary
   changes in PaCO(2) is ameliorated by secondary, directional changes in
   plasma {[}HCO(3)] that occur in 2 stages. Acutely, hypercapnia or
   hypocapnia yields relatively small changes in plasma {[}HCO(3)] that
   originate virtually exclusively from titration of the body's
   nonbicarbonate buffers. During sustained hypercapnia or hypocapnia, much
   larger changes in plasma {[}HCO(3)] occur that reflect adjustments in
   renal acidification mechanisms. Consequently, the deviation of systemic
   acidity from normal is smaller in the chronic forms of these disorders.
   Here we provide an overview of the renal acidification responses to
   respiratory acid-base disorders. We also identify gaps in knowledge that
   require further research.}},

Abstract = {{This article is set in the context of searching text and image
   repositories by keyword. We develop a unified probabilistic framework
   for text, image, and combined text and image retrieval that is based on
   the detection of keywords (concepts) using automated image annotation
   technology. Our framework is deeply rooted in information theory and
   lends itself to use with other media types.
   We estimate a statistical model in a multimodal feature space for each
   possible query keyword. The key element of our framework is to identify
   feature space transformations that make them comparable in complexity
   and density. We select the optimal multimodal feature space with a
   minimum description length criterion from a set of candidate feature
   spaces that are computed with the average-mutual-information criterion
   for the text part and hierarchical expectation maximization for the
   visual part of the data. We evaluate our approach in three retrieval
   experiments (only text retrieval, only image retrieval, and text
   combined with image retrieval), verify the framework's low computational
   complexity, and compare with existing state-of-the-art ad-hoc models.}},

Abstract = {{Parasite-derived lipids may play important roles in host-pathogen
   interactions and escape mechanisms. Herein, we evaluated the role of
   schistosomal-derived lipids in Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and eosinophil
   activation in Schistosoma mansoni infection. Mice lacking TLR2 exhibited
   reduced liver eosinophilic granuloma, compared with that of wild-type
   animals, following S. mansoni infection. Decreased eosinophil
   accumulation and eosinophil lipid body (lipid droplet) formation, at
   least partially due to reduced production of eotaxin, interleukin
   (IL)-5, and IL-13 in S. mansoni-infected TLR2(-/-) mice, compared with
   the corresponding production in wild-type mice, was noted. Although no
   differences were observed in survival rates during the acute
   schistosomal infection (up to 50 days), increased survival of TLR2(-/-)
   mice, compared with survival of wild-type mice, was observed during the
   chronic phase of infection. Schistosomal lipid extract- and
   schistosomal-derived lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC)-stimulated
   macrophages in vitro induced TLR2-dependent NF-kB activation and
   cytokine production. Furthermore, in vivo schistosomal lyso-PC
   administration induced eosinophil recruitment and cytokine production,
   in a mechanism largely dependent on TLR2. Taken together, our results
   suggest that schistosomal-derived lyso-PC may participate in cytokine
   production and eosinophil activation through a TLR2-dependent pathway in
   S. mansoni infection. Moreover, our results suggest that TLR2-dependent
   inflammatory reaction, cytokine production, and eosinophil recruitment
   and activation may contribute to the pathogenesis and lethality in the
   chronic phase of infection.}},

Abstract = {{Between the 1970s and the 1990s, women's studies research and
   theoretical confrontations became common both inside and outside Italian
   universities, producing a substantial cultural and scientific
   inheritance. However, the teaching of such content had to follow an
   accidental path deprived of any institutional visibility. Women's
   studies was forced to adapt itself to existing didactic structures,
   `hidden' inside single courses and single disciplines, without being
   evident itself in the university. Only in the late 1990s did such
   studies become institutionally formalized. Nowadays, there is a rapid
   growth in women's studies in Italy, thanks particularly to the course,
   Women Politics and Institutions, created in 2004. In this Open forum,
   the authors try to suggest what future scenarios might look like,
   anticipating a not yet realized horizon.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine whether a starch solution for volume
   resuscitation in a flow-based protocol improves circulatory status
   better than a crystalloid solution, as defined by the need for
   catecholamines in patients the morning after cardiac surgery, and
   whether this can be performed without increased morbidity.
   Design: Concealed, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial.
   Participants: Two hundred sixty-two patients who underwent cardiac
   surgery at a tertiary care hospital.
   Interventions: Based on predefined criteria indicating a need for
   fluids, and a nurse-delivered algorithm that used central venous
   pressure and cardiac index obtained from a pulmonary artery catheter,
   patients were allocated to receive 250-mL boluses of 0.9\% saline or a
   250-molecular weight 10\% solution of pentastarch.
   Results: Two hundred thirty-seven patients received volume boluses: 119
   hydroxyethyl starches and 118 saline. Between 8: 00 AM and 9: 00 AM the
   morning after surgery, 13 (10.9\%) of hydroxy-ethyl starch patients and
   34 (28.8\%) saline patients were using catecholamines (p=.001).
   Hydroxyethyl starch patients had less pneumonia and mediastinal
   infections (p=.03) and less cardiac pacing (p=.03). There were two
   deaths in each group. There was no difference in the daily creatinine,
   development of RIFLE risk criteria during hospital stay, or new
   dialysis. The numbers and volumes of packed red blood cells were similar
   in the two groups, but more hydroxyethyl starch patients received plasma
   transfusions (p=.05).
   Conclusions: Use of a colloid solution for volume resuscitation in a
   nurse-delivered flow-based algorithm, which included a pulmonary artery
   catheter, significantly improved hemodynamic status, an important factor
   for readiness for discharge from the intensive care unit. (Crit Care Med

   potentially posing a threat to marine communities through chemical
   interactions. Here, acute effects of the photosystem II-inhibiting
   herbicides diuron, tebuthiuron, atrazine, simazine, and hexazinone,
   herbicide breakdown products (desethyl-atrazine (DEA) and
   3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA)) and binary mixtures, were investigated
   using three tropical benthic microalgae; Navicula sp. and Cylindrotheca
   closterium (Ochrophyta) and Nephroselmis pyriformis (Chlorophyta), and
   one standard test species, Phaeodactylum tricornutum (Ochrophyta), in a
   high-throughput Maxi-Imaging-PAM bioassay (Maxi-IPAM). The order of
   toxicity was; diuron > hexazinone > tebuthiuron > atrazine > simazine >
   DEA > 3,4-DCA for all species. The tropical green alga N. pyriformis was
   up to 10-fold more sensitive than the diatoms tested here and reported
   for coral symbionts, and is recommended as a standard tropical test
   species for future research. All binary mixtures exhibited additive
   toxicity, and the use of herbicide equivalents (HEq) is therefore
   recommended in order to incorporate total-maximum-load measures for
   environmental regulatory purposes. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by

Abstract = {{Data hiding in the LSB of audio signals is an appealing steganographic
   method. This is due to the large volume of real-time production and
   transmission of audio data which makes it difficult to store and analyze
   these signals. Hence, steganalysis of audio signals requires online
   operations. Most of the existing steganalysis methods work on stored
   media files. In this paper, we present a steganalysis technique that can
   detect the existence of embedded data in the least significant bits of
   natural audio samples. The algorithm is designed to be simple, accurate,
   and to be hardware implementable. Hence, hardware implementation is
   presented for the proposed algorithm. The proposed hardware analyzes the
   histogram of an incoming stream of audio signals by using a sliding
   window strategy without needing the storage of the signals. The
   algorithm is mathematically modeled to show its capability to accurately
   predict the amount of embedding in an incoming stream of audio signals.
   Audio files with different amounts of embedded data were used to test
   the algorithm and its hardware implementation. The experimental results
   prove the functionality and high accuracy of the proposed method.}},

Title = {{High-Resolution 3D Ultrasound Jawbone Surface Imaging for Diagnosis of
   Periodontal Bony Defects: An In Vitro Study}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{Although medical specialties have recognized the importance of using
   ultrasonic imaging, dentistry is only beginning to discover its benefit.
   This has particularly been important in the field of periodontics which
   studies infections in the gum and bone tissues that surround the teeth.
   This study investigates the feasibility of using a custom-designed
   high-frequency ultrasound imaging system to reconstruct high-resolution
   (< 50 mu m) three-dimensional (3D) surface images of periodontal defects
   in human jawbone. The system employs single-element focused ultrasound
   transducers with center frequencies ranging from 30 to 60 MHz.
   Continuous acquisition using a 1 GHz data acquisition card is
   synchronized with a high-precision two-dimensional (2D) positioning
   system of +/- 1 mu m resolution for acquiring accurate measurements of
   the mandible, in vitro. Signal and image processing algorithms are
   applied to reconstruct high-resolution ultrasound images and extract the
   jawbone surface in each frame. Then, all edges are combined and smoothed
   in order to render a 3D surface image of the jawbone. In vitro
   experiments were performed to assess the system performance using
   mandibles with teeth (dentate) or without (nondentate). The system was
   able to reconstruct 3D images for the mandible's outer surface with
   superior spatial resolution down to 24 mu m, and to perform the whole
   scanning in < 30 s. Major anatomical landmarks on the images were
   confirmed with the anatomical structures on the mandibles. All the
   anatomical landmarks were detected and fully described as 3D images
   using this novel ultrasound imaging technique, whereas the 2D X-ray
   radiographic images suffered from poor contrast. These results indicate
   the great potential of utilizing high-resolution ultrasound as a
   noninvasive, nonionizing imaging technique for the early diagnosis of
   the more severe form of periodontal disease.}},

Abstract = {{Continuing professional development (CPD) courses seek to inform,
   educate and develop practitioners' patterns of prescribing in line with
   the evidence base. When devising such courses it would be useful for
   organisers to have some idea of what current practice is and the
   decision-making process as this would inform the development of
   appropriate continuing education courses. A questionnaire comprising ten
   questions was given to 90 dentists at the start of a day's lecture
   course run under Section 63 regulations. The dentists were then shown a
   series of pictures and asked how they would manage each of the cases
   presented. Eighty-nine dentists completed the questionnaire and the
   results were tabulated and fed back to the group at the end of their
   day's course. Results showed varied and inconsistent application of
   advances in restorative techniques among the respondents. Despite a
   definite interest in more modern treatment options, many practitioners
   continued to support the use of traditional techniques that could be
   considered outdated. Further investigation of the practices of GDPs and
   their decision-making processes would be useful in targeting
   postgraduate education programmes to encourage the uptake of
   evidence-based practice.}},

Abstract = {{The Numbers of elderly people are gradually increasing in our society,
   and mood disorders are progressively increasing among older people. Old
   age depression may also occur after life events: the death of the
   significant other, economical reasons, health problems (neurological
   and/or cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, cancer, nutritional
   deficiency) and can develop into a depressive state.
   Old age depression is often mistreated, or undertreated, and also
   underdiagnosed, and this for several reasons: older people reduce their
   social relations, depression very often presents as a comorbidity with
   organic diseases (that cover and mask depressive symptoms); finally,the
   patient may believe that a depressive state is a normal course of life
   in older people.
   Recovering from depression is really feasible both in young/adults and
   in old people, but in older people we can find a higher frequency of
   admission to hospital, or mortality or suicidality.
   The depressive symptoms in old age depression is similar to those in
   adults, however the following aspects require special care, in order to
   ensure a correct diagnosis despite the presence of comorbidities:
   - the mood: in contrast with the young and adult, old people often do
   not complain about their low mood;
   - the psychotic simptoms: hypocondriacal and psychotic, including
   hallucinatory symptoms are often present.
   - the anxiety symptoms: these are often present together with
   neuro-sensory symptoms;
   - the somatic symptoms: the comorbidity with organic diseases can mask
   and overlap the depressive state;
   - reduction of congnitive functioning: in these cases, which are quite
   frequent, it is essential to make a differential diagnosis from
   ``pseudodementia{''} and ``dementia{''}.
   In conclusion, several factors contribute to the onset of depression in
   old age, so that we can assert that it is a really a multifactorial
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Effective representation of biodiversity in a marine park can be limited
   by lack of sampling at a suitable scale due to various methodological,
   logistical and taxonomic constraints. Surrogates that describe key
   components of biodiversity can benefit management planning and assist
   evaluation of zoning arrangements by improving efficiency and
   effectiveness of sampling. Reef fish are considered an important
   component of biodiversity in the Solitary Islands Marine Park (SIMP),
   New South Wales, Australia. Fish assemblages were surveyed using 30-min
   timed counts at 68 sites spread across the extent of shallow reef in the
   SIMP. The overall assemblage was compared with various subsets of taxa
   using the RELATE procedure in PRIMER to determine useful surrogates. Two
   families, Labridae and Pomacentridae, showed a high concordance with
   overall patterns and the highest correlation in estimating species
   richness by site. These families were the two most speciose (43, 32
   species, respectively) comprising 30\% of the species richness out of 66
   families and 254 species. Surveying a subset of species that includes
   these two families has utility for marine park management in the SIMP,
   including evaluating the influence of `no take' zones on assemblage
   patterns and systematic planning for biodiversity representation.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium at iron (II) tetrakis
   (diaquaplatinum) octacarboxyphthalocyanine (PtFeOCPc) catalyst supported
   on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) has been described. The ORR
   followed the direct 4-electron transfer process, with a very low onset
   potential (approximately zero volts vs. Ag vertical bar AgCl, saturated
   KCl) and at a kinetic rate constant, 2.78 x 10(-2) cm s(-1). The results
   clearly showed that the ORR activity at the MWCNT-PtFeOCPc platform is
   comparable or even better than recent reports with other
   electrocatalysts, thus a promising catalytic platform for cathodic
   process in fuel cell device. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Carnosic acid, a primary phenolic compound found in the leaves of
   rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), has diverse pharmacological and
   biological activities. The aim of the present study was to investigate
   the anti-clastogenic effect of carnosic acid in DMBA-induced
   clastogenesis. The frequency of bone marrow micronucleated polychromatic
   erythrocytes (MnPCEs), chromosomal aberrations (cytogenetic end points),
   the status of Phase I and II detoxification enzymes, lipid peroxidation
   by-products and antioxidants (biochemical endpoints) were analyzed to
   assess the anti-clastogenic effect of carnosic acid in DMBA-induced
   clastogenesis. Oral pretreatment of carnosic acid for five days to
   DMBA-treated hamsters significantly protected DMBA-induced clastogenesis
   as well as biochemical abnormalities. Although the exact mechanism of
   anti-clastogenic effects of carnosic acid is unclear, the antioxidant
   potential and effect on modulation of Phase I and II detoxification

Title = {{Salivary epithelial cells from Sjogren's syndrome patients are highly

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AUTOIMMUNITY}},

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{In certain types of cells, Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3) ligation by
   viral dsRNA induces apoptotic death, likely engaged into the elimination
   of virus-infected cells. We have previously shown that TLR-3 ligation on
   cultured non-neoplastic salivary gland epithelial cells (SGEC) with
   polyI:C (a synthetic analogue of viral dsRNA) results in the induction
   of surface immunoactive molecules, however, the pro-apoptotic effect of
   such signaling has not been addressed. In this study, polyI:C-treated
   SGEC were found to suffer severe detachment from substratum and
   subsequent apoptosis, a phenomenon suggestive of anoikis or anoikia
   (detachment-induced apoptosis). PolyI:C-induced anoikis in SGEC was
   associated with the upregulation of the pro-apoptotic Bmf, BimEL and Bax
   and the down-regulation of the pro-survival Bcl-2 (real-time PCR
   analyses). Finally, the comparative analysis of SGEC lines derived from
   primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) patients (SS-SGEC) and non-SS controls
   had revealed that SS-SGEC are particularly susceptible to TLR-3-induced
   anoikis, as it was triggered by suboptimally low concentrations of
   polyI:C. This finding correlated with significantly higher constitutive
   surface TLR-3 expression by SS-SGEC, a feature indicative of their
   intrinsic activation status. In conclusion, TLR-3 signaling pathway in
   the salivary epithelium appears to extend beyond the induction of innate
   immune responses and to involve the activation of programmed-cell death
   via anoikis. In the same context, the increased vulnerability of SS-SGEC
   to the injurious effect of TLR-3 ligation is likely associated with the
   intrinsic activation processes that apparently operate in the epithelia
   of SS patients, and a feature of key pathogenetic importance for the
   disorder. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The aim of the study was to demonstrate the influence of BMI
   in pregnancy on rates of adverse pregnancy outcome in overweight
   nulliparous women
   Study design The study was a retrospective review of data from the local
   hospital database held at the Jessop Wing of the Royal Hallamshire
   Hospital in Sheffield We reviewed all nulliparous women with recorded
   BMI at booking between January 2001 and November 2008 who delivered
   singleton babies All the women were stratified into five groups
   (underweight normal overweight obese and morbidly obese) The different
   BMI range groups were compared with the group of women with a normal BMI
   (2025) SPSS v15 was used for statistical analysis
   Results The caesarean section rate rose from 18 2\% in women of normal
   BMI to 40 6\% in the morbidly obese women (RR 2 2 - CI 1 7-2 8) Morbidly
   obese women had three times that risk of macrosomia compared with normal
   BMI women (RR 3 1 - CI 2 1-48) The stillbirth rate was associated with
   increasing obesity with RR 167 (CI 49-56) for the morbidly obese women
   Conclusions Increasing degrees of obesity are associated with increases
   in the incidence of caesarean section fetal birth weight and adverse
   pregnancy outcomes The increased risk shows an increment in a stepwise
   fashion among the different BMI groups (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd All

Abstract = {{Objective. The purpose of this study was to define in volunteers a safe
   area for performing a percutaneous intrasheath first annular (A1) pulley
   release under ultrasonographic guidance in cadavers for the treatment of
   trigger fingers. Methods. First, in 100 fingers of 10 volunteers, we
   used Doppler ultrasonography to determine the limits of the sectors
   enclosing structures at risk (arteries and tendons). From the synovial
   sheath's most volar point, we determined the relative position of the
   arterial walls and the distance to the flexor tendons. A scatterplot
   overlay of the arterial positions was digitally analyzed for determining
   the limits of the safe area. Second, we released the A1 pulley in 46
   fingers from 5 cadavers, directing the edge of the cutting device toward
   our safe area from an intrasheath instrument position. The precision,
   safety, and efficacy of the release were evaluated by surgical exposure
   of the A1 and A2 pulleys and the neurovascular bundles. Results. In our
   volunteers, we observed a volar safe area from +6.1 degrees to +180
   degrees. Surgical precision was good in the cadavers, with no injuries
   to adjacent structures, a complete release in 44 fingers (95.7\%), and
   an incomplete release of less than 1.6 mm in 2 fingers. Conclusions.
   This study determined a safe volar area for aiming surgical instruments
   from an intrasheath position for percutaneous ultrasonographically
   guided A1 pulley release. The technique can be performed safely in all
   fingers, but we suggest being cautious in the thumb and converting the
   surgery to an open procedure if ultrasonographic visualization is not
   optimal.}},

Abstract = {{This paper modifies a Townsend turnpike model by letting agents stay at
   a location long enough to trade some consumption loans, but not long
   enough to support a Pareto-optimal allocation. Monetary equilibria exist
   that are nonoptimal in the absence of a scheme to pay interest on
   currency at a particular rate. Paying interest on currency at the
   optimal rate delivers a Pareto-optimal allocation, but a different one
   than the allocation for an associated nonmonetary centralized economy.
   The price level remains determinate under an optimal policy. We study
   the response of the model to ``helicopter drops{''} of currency, steady
   increases in the money supply, and restrictions on private

Abstract = {{Following a laboratory audit, a significant number of Treponema pallidum
   particle agglutination assay (TPPA)-negative sera were identified when
   TPPA was used as a confirmatory assay of syphilis enzyme immunoassay
   (EIA) screening-reactive sera (SSRS). Sera giving such discrepant
   results were further characterized to assess their significance. A panel
   of 226 sera was tested by the Abbott Murex ICE Syphilis EIA and then by
   the Newmarket Syphilis EIA II. TPPA testing was performed on 223 sera.
   Further testing by the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test,
   the Mercia Syphilis IgM EIA, the fluorescent treponemal antibody
   (FTA-ABS) assay, and INNO-LIA immunoblotting was undertaken in
   discrepant cases. One hundred eighty-seven of 223 (83.8\%) SSRS were
   TPPA reactive, while 26 (11.6\%) sera which were reactive in both the
   ICE and Newmarket EIAs were nonreactive by TPPA. The majority (68\%) of
   the TPPA-discrepant sera were from HIV-positive patients and did not
   represent early acute cases, based on previous or follow-up samples,
   which were available for 22/26 samples. FTA-ABS testing was performed on
   24 of these sera; 14 (58.3\%) were FTA-ABS positive, and 10 (41.7\%)
   were FTA-ABS negative. Twenty-one of these 26 sera were tested by
   INNO-LIA, and an additional 4 FTA-ABS-negative samples were positive. In
   this study, significant numbers (18/26) of SSRS- and TPPA-negative sera
   were shown by further FTA-ABS and LIA (line immunoblot assay) testing to
   be positive. The reason why certain sera are negative by TPPA but
   reactive by treponemal EIA and other syphilis confirmatory assays is not
   clear, and these initial findings should be further explored.}},

Abstract = {{Countless articles and judicial opinions have been devoted to the task
   of deciphering the scope and application of the limitations on habeas
   corpus relief announced in the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death
   Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Over the past ten years courts and scholars
   have developed an intricate framework of analysis for nearly every
   subsection of 2254. The decade-long process of interpretation and
   commentary has been characterized by questions of statutory meaning and
   federalism that appear to be as irresolvable for courts as they are
   intriguing to academics. But in the rush to sort out the minutiae of the
   AEDPA, the hallmarks of our legal system-basic due process and
   constitutional supremacy-have been overlooked This Article aims to
   re-focus the debate.
   The application and discussion of the A EDPA's limitations on relief has
   devolved into a bitter argument over the meaning of a statute which
   lacks a discoverable meaning, much less an obvious or plain meaning. It
   is statutory esotericism or statutory obfuscation much more than it is
   statutory interpretation. The discussion has become so technical and
   specialized, not to mention politically polarized, that we are at risk
   of permanently overshadowing the historical and constitutional
   underpinnings of the Great Writ. The goal of this Article is to recast
   and simplify the habeas debate and achieve some much needed common
   ground. The thesis is simple: Where the aggregate of available state
   proceedings fail to provide a meaningful corrective process such that
   federal constitutional issues are not ``fully and fairly{''}
   adjudicated, it is necessary for the federal courts to review the
   federal claims de novo. Deference to a procedural abyss is avoided. This
   modest procedural proposal is compelled by due process through a
   celebrated line of cases, and yet in the frenzy to interpret 2254 - in
   working out all of the (e) (2)s and the (d)(1)s-we have forgotten due
   process. It is time to return to it.}},

Abstract = {{Background/aims This study describes the types of therapy used in
   chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in France and patient characteristics
   according to therapy.
   Methods This was a descriptive, multicenter, retrospective study in 1730
   patients (54 centers). We collected information about demographics,
   epidemiology, severity of hepatitis B virus-related liver disease,
   antiviral therapy, response (hepatitis B viral DNA and alanine
   aminotransferase normalization changes), dose modification, or treatment
   interruption.
   Results Approximately, 60\% of patients enrolled had never been treated
   for CHB and 33.1\% were currently receiving treatment (47\% first line).
   Of those receiving treatment, 30\% were receiving adefovir-lamivudine
   combination. Of those receiving first-line therapy, 40, 30, and 15\%
   were receiving lamivudine, adefovir, or adefovir-lamivudine combination,
   respectively. Complete and partial virological responses were seen in 59
   and 13\% of patients, respectively. In patients having been treated at
   least once, biochemical response was seen in 45\%. Lamivudine or
   adefovir-resistant mutants were detected in 32.6 and 22.1\% of patients
   treated by these antiviral agents, respectively.
   Conclusion In France, among patients with CHB, we observed that
   one-third were receiving therapy, and, of these, 30\% were receiving
   first-line (15\%) or second-line (15\%) adefovir-lamivudine combination
   therapy. This observation highlights that clinical practice is
   influenced by available scientific data on resistance induced by
   monotherapy. Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol 22:1290-1296 (C) 2010 Wolters

Abstract = {{The prognostic role of small intrathoracic nodal metastases in primary
   patients with lung cancer has been controversial, and it is unclear how
   their presence should be used for pathologic staging and treatment
   planning. The intrathoracic lymph nodes from 266 clinical stage I non
   small cell carcinoma patients treated at Cedars Sinai Medical Center
   from 1992 to 2006 were evaluated with immunohistochemistry for keratin
   AE1/AE3 for the presence of isolated tumor cells and micrometastases, as
   defined by American Joint Commission on Cancer criteria, correlated with
   survival using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed with power analysis.
   The English literature from 1995 to 2008 was reviewed to identify best
   available evidence regarding the prognostic value of isolated tumor
   cells and rnicrometastases detected with various immunohistochemistry
   and molecular methods in non-small cell carcinoma patients. Results were
   combined with our own data and evaluated with meta-analysis using
   Comprehensive Meta-analysis 2.0 software (Biostat Inc, Englewood, NJ).
   Isolated tumor cells and micrometastases were detected in 8 and 67 of
   4148 lymph nodes, respectively, and their presence was not significantly
   associated with survival. Power analysis showed that 3060 cases followed
   up for 60 months would be needed to achieve 80\% power in a study
   designed to detect survival differences between patients with negative
   nodes and micrometastases. Meta-analysis of 835 non-small cell carcinoma
   patients reported in 13 studies showed scanty data to evaluate patients
   with isolated tumor cells, no significant association between
   micrometastases and survival and significant data heterogeneity. Current
   best evidence suggests that non-small cell carcinoma patients should
   probably not be ``upstaged{''} in the presence of isolated tumor cells
   and micrometastases. There is no data demonstrating survival benefits
   for patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy
   because of the presence of small nodal metastases. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Male sex is a risk factor for development and progression of diabetic
   nephropathy; however, the relationship between sex hormone levels and
   diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetic men is unknown. This was a
   prospective follow-up study as part of the nationwide Finnish Diabetic
   Nephropathy (FinnDiane)Study; 297 patients were followed for 5.9 +/- 1.5
   years. Serum total testosterone (Tt) and estradiol (Te), calculated free
   testosterone (cFt) and estradiol (cFe) and sex hormone binding globulin
   were measured at baseline and correlated with urinary albumin excretion
   rate, estimated glomerular filtration rate and markers of metabolic
   syndrome. Diabetes without renal disease was associated with decreased
   Tt (p < 0.001), Te (p < 0.001) and cFt (p = 0.001) levels compared with
   healthy non-diabetic men. With progression of renal disease from micro-
   to macroalbuminuria, this decrease in serum Tt was even more pronounced.
   Cox regression showed that cFt and cFe were independent predictors of
   the progression from macroalbuminuria to end-stage renal disease. Our
   study shows that men with type 1 diabetes exhibit dysregulated sex
   hormone levels, which is most pronounced in men with progressive renal
   disease, suggesting that sex hormones may play a role in the
   pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy associated with type 1 diabetes.

Abstract = {{This study presents an efficient method for estimating transient
   stability indices of electric power systems. It is based on equivalent
   network reduction techniques. The electromechanical equivalent system
   has been accomplished by considering clusters of coherent generators.
   The angular speed deviations of synchronous generators have been used as
   a criterion to perform the groups. The reduced order is obtained by
   replacing two groups of coherent generators by a single machine
   equivalent. With these equivalents, critical fault clearing times and
   security margins are calculated by using the well-known equal-area
   criterion. The method was compared with others, especially those based
   on the concepts of transient energy function. The critical fault
   clearing times are in agreement with and very close to those obtained by
   using Liapunov's direct method or the time-domain solution of the
   n-machine original system. Some numerical results are presented for a 3-
   and 10-generator power systems. The method is an excellent tool that can
   be applied as a filter to identify potentially harmful contingencies and
   to select these to perform detailed transient stability analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive simulation methodology for the systematic study of gate
   leakage variability in realistic nanoscale bulk CMOS transistors, on a
   statistical scale, is presented for the first time. This is based on the
   Glasgow ``atomistic{''} 3-D drift-diffusion device simulator with
   density-gradient quantum corrections, which is capable of modeling
   various sources of stochastic variability, including random dopant
   fluctuations (RDFs) and oxide thickness fluctuations (OTFs). The
   capabilities of the simulator are extended to model direct tunnelling of
   electrons through the gate dielectric by means of an improved
   Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin approximation with one model parameter only.
   The methodology is applied for the detailed study of the gate leakage
   variability arising from RDFs and OTFs in a 25-nm square-gate n-channel

Abstract = {{This article examines the convergence of two popular school improvement
   policies: instructional coaching and data-driven decision making (DDDM).
   Drawing on a mixed methods study of a statewide reading coach program in
   Florida middle schools, the article examines how coaches support DDDM
   and how this support relates to student and teacher outcomes. Authors
   find that although the majority of coaches spent time helping teachers
   analyze student data to guide instruction, data support was one among
   many coach activities. Estimates from models indicate that data analysis
   support, nevertheless, has a significant association with both perceived
   improvements in teaching and higher student achievement.}},

Abstract = {{Synaptically released Zn2+ is a potential modulator of neurotransmission
   and synaptic plasticity in fear-conditioning pathways. Zinc transporter
   3 (ZnT3) knock-out (KO) mice are well suited to test the role of zinc in
   learned fear, because ZnT3 is colocalized with synaptic zinc,
   responsible for its transport to synaptic vesicles, highly enriched in
   the amygdala-associated neural circuitry, and ZnT3 KO mice lack Zn2+ in
   synaptic vesicles. However, earlier work reported no deficiency in fear
   memory in ZnT3 KO mice, which is surprising based on the effects of Zn2+
   on amygdala synaptic plasticity. We therefore reexamined ZnT3 KO mice in
   various tasks for learned and innate fear. The mutants were deficient in
   a weak fear-conditioning protocol using single tone-shock pairing but
   showed normal memory when a stronger, five-pairing protocol was used.
   ZnT3 KO mice were deficient in memory when a tone was presented as
   complex auditory information in a discontinuous fashion. Moreover, ZnT3
   KO mice showed abnormality in trace fear conditioning and in fear
   extinction. By contrast, ZnT3 KO mice had normal anxiety. Thus, ZnT3 is
   involved in associative fear memory and extinction, but not in innate
   fear, consistent with the role of synaptic zinc in amygdala synaptic
   plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Liquidambar styraciflua L., also known as sweetgum, is an understory
   hardwood species that has widespread distribution in the southeast USA,
   especially in pine plantations. In addition to being a possible
   biorefinery feedstock, sweetgum contains shikimic acid, which is a
   precursor for the drug TamifluA (R). Sweetgum bark was extracted with 65
   A degrees C water and yielded 1.7 mg/g of shikimic acid, while sweetgum
   de-barked wood yielded 0.2 mg/g of shikimic acid. Because shikimic acid
   can be extracted with water, the coupling of the phytochemical hot water
   extraction with dilute acid pretreatment was examined. The addition of a
   65 A degrees C shikimic acid extraction step coupled to pretreatment
   with 0.98\% H(2)SO(4) at 130 A degrees C for 50 min resulted in 21\% and
   17\% increases in xylose percent recovery from bark and de-barked wood,
   respectively. These results indicate that, in addition to recovering a
   high value product, the 65 A degrees C wash step also increases xylose
   recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Soil application of phenol increases the resistance of elms to Dutch elm
   disease (DED), but the mechanisms involved in this enhanced resistance
   are poorly known. Based on the hypothesis that exogenous phenols play a
   role in the survival of some elm stands to DED, the effects of phenol on
   (i) mycelial growth and sporulation of Ophiostoma novo-ulmi, (ii) tree
   phenology, (iii) wood formation, (iv) histochemistry of xylem tissues,
   and (v) resistance of elms to DED, were studied. Phenol at 0.2\%
   strongly inhibited both mycelial growth and sporulation of O. novo-ulmi.
   In a greenhouse experiment, trees watered with a 0.2\% phenol solution
   accumulated phenol in distal twigs, and showed a delayed wood formation,
   suberized tangential bands in their xylem tissues, and a reduction of
   DED symptoms, in comparison to control trees. Soil texture had no effect
   on phenol accumulation in xylem tissues or on tree resistance level. The
   presence of two phenolic glycosides in the phenol-treated elms was
   interpreted as a mechanism for phenol detoxification. In a semi-natural
   Spanish elm stand where phenol-based products were applied in the past,
   phenol was not detected in the soil, probably because of its
   degradation. In the same stand, healthy trees located in areas with
   either low or high incidence of DED showed a similar phenol content in
   their xylem tissues. The role of exogenous phenol in the resistance of
   some elms to DED is discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{A large C-12/C-13 isotopic ratio in M 82 and NGC 253}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{522}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Aims. Our aim is to derive carbon isotopic ratios from optically thin
   tracers in the central regions of the starburst galaxies M 82 and NGC
   253.
   Methods. We present high-sensitivity observations of CCH and two of its
   C-13 isotopologues, (CCH)-C-13 and (CCH)-C-13, as well as the optically
   thin emission from (CO)-O-18 and (CO)-C-13-O-18. We assume the column
   density ratio between isotopologues is representative of the C-12/C-13
   isotopic ratio.
   Results. From CCH, lower limits to the C-12/C-13 isotopic ratio of 138
   in M 82, and 81 in NGC 253, are derived. Lower limits to the C-12/C-13
   ratios from CO isotopologues support these. (CO)-C-13-O-18 is
   tentatively detected in NGC 253, which is the first reported detection
   in the extragalactic ISM. Based on these limits, we infer ratios of
   O-16/O-18> 350 and > 300 in M 82 and NGC 253, respectively, and
   S-32/S-34 > 16 in NGC 253. The derived CCH fractional abundances toward
   these galaxies of less than or similar to 1.1 x 10(-8) agree well with
   those of molecular clouds in the Galactic disk.
   Conclusions. Our lower limits to the C-12/C-13 ratio from CCH are a
   factor of 2-3 larger than previous limits. The results are discussed in
   the context of molecular and nucleo-chemical evolution. The high
   C-12/C-13 isotopic ratio of the molecular ISM in these starburst
   galaxies suggest that the gas has been recently accreted toward their
   nuclear regions.}},

Abstract = {{The Eag1 and Eag2, voltage-dependent potassium channels, and the
   small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (Kcnn3) are highly
   expressed in limbic regions of the brain, where their function is still
   unknown. Eag1 co-localizes with tyrosine hydroxilase enzyme in the
   substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. Kcnn3 deficiency leads to
   enhanced serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission accompanied by
   distinct alterations in emotional behaviors. As exposure to stress is
   able to change the expression and function of several ion channels,
   suggesting that they might be involved in the consequences of stress, we
   aimed at investigating Eag 1, Eag2 and Kcnn3 mRNA expression in the
   brains of rats submitted to isolation rearing. As the long-lasting
   alterations in emotional and behavioral regulation after stress have
   been related to changes in serotonergic neurotransmission, expressions
   of serotonin Htr1a and Htr2a receptors in male Wistar rats' brain were
   also investigated. Rats were reared in isolation or in groups of five
   for nine weeks after weaning. Isolated and socially reared rats were
   tested for exploratory activity in the open field test for 5 min and
   brains were processed for reverse-transcription coupled to quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Isolated reared rats showed
   decreased exploratory activity in the open field. Compared to socially
   reared rats, isolated rats showed reduced Htr2a mRNA expression in the
   striatum and brainstem and reduced Eag2 mRNA expression in all examined
   regions except cerebellum. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
   show that isolation rearing can change Eag2 gene expression in the
   brain. The involvement of this channel in stress-related behaviors is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background Oncogenesis in the oral cavity is believed to result from
   genetic alterations that cause a stepwise transformation of the mucosa
   to invasive carcinoma. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) multiple
   cytogenetic abnormalities have been reported, but their practical
   significance remains uncertain.
   Objective To evaluate the usefulness of the assessment of CCND1, MYC,
   EGFR, ERBB2 and TP53 in OSCC and lymph node metastases.
   Methods Fifty-one consecutive samples of OSCC, nine lymph node biopsies
   showing metastatic spread from OSCC, 16 biopsies diagnosed as oral
   leucoplakia (OLK), 13 samples corresponding to oral lichen planus (OLP)
   and 14 samples from normal oral mucosa were included in the study.
   Clinical and histopathological characteristics were reviewed. The
   genetic and protein status of the CCND1, MYC, EGFR, ERBB2 oncogenes and
   the TP53 tumour suppressor gene were assessed by fluorescence in situ
   hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The obtained
   results were compared with the clinical characteristics and the outcome
   of the OSCCs.
   Results TP53 gene losses and MYC, ERBB2, CCND1 and EGFR copy number
   gains and amplifications were detected in a higher proportion in OSCC
   and lymph node samples than in OLK and OLP samples (P < 0.005).
   Overexpression of p53, Myc, Cyclin D1, c-erbB-2 and epidermal growth
   factor receptor (EGFR) was more prevalent in malignant samples than
   benign samples (P < 0 05). Correlation between FISH and IHC results was
   demonstrated in MYC, EGFR and CCND1 studies. The presence of two or more
   genetic abnormalities in the studied loci was exclusively detected in
   primary and metastatic OSCC.
   Conclusions In our series, genetic abnormalities in TP53, MYC, CCND1,
   ERBB2 and EGFR detected by FISH were absent in inflammatory lesions,
   infrequent in precursor lesions and common in tumoral lesions.
   Evaluation of the genetic status of TP53, MYC, CCND1, ERBB2 and EGFR may
   be an additional diagnostic tool in distinguishing benign from malignant
   oral lesions in histopathologically challenging cases.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. We evaluated the longitudinal association between self-rated
   health (SRH) and timed gait, an indicator of lower extremity
   dysfunction, in a community-based sample of older persons.
   Methods. Participants (N = 754) were evaluated at 18-month intervals for
   72 months. SRH was categorized as Excellent/Very Good/Good and
   Fair/Poor. Participants were asked to walk a 10-foot course ``as fast as
   it feels safe and comfortable,{''} turn around, and walk back, with
   timed gait defined as normal (<= 10 s) or slow (>10 s). Generalized
   multinomial logit models, adjusted for demographic features, biomedical
   and psychosocial factors, and activities of daily living, evaluated the
   association between SRH and the likelihood of 6 possible transitions
   (from normal or slow timed gait to normal timed gait, slow timed gait,
   or death) over time. We also ran a repeated measures linear mixed model
   with change in timed gait as the outcome.
   Results. Compared with participants reporting Excellent/Very Good/Good
   SRH, those reporting Fair/Poor SRH were more likely to transition from
   normal to slow timed gait or to death. SRH was not associated with
   transitions from slow timed gait to normal timed gait or to death. In
   addition, time to complete the gait task increased (i.e., slowed) over
   time among participants reporting Fair/Poor SRH compared with those
   reporting Excellent/Very Good/Good SRH.
   Discussion. Among older persons, SRH is associated with the development
   of lower extremity dysfunction but not with recovery from lower
   extremity dysfunction. This relationship may indicate an intermediate
   step in the pathway from SRH to mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the sex-specific
   physical activity (PA) intensity thresholds that best discriminate
   between unhealthy/healthy cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF).
   Methods: Participants included 1,808 adolescents (964 girls), aged
   12.5-17.5 years, from the HELENA study. We measured PA by accelerometer
   and calculated the time spent at light, moderate, vigorous, and
   moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA) intensities. CRF was assessed by the 20-m
   shuttle-run test. Adolescents were dichotomized (unhealthy/healthy)
   based on sex- and age-specific FITNESSGRAM standards. Receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine thresholds that best
   discriminate between CRF categories.
   Results: ROC analyses revealed that the PA thresholds that best
   discriminate between unhealthy/healthy CRF were >= 152, >= 33, >= 13,
   and >= 52 min/day in light, moderate, vigorous, and MVPA, respectively.
   In boys, the PA thresholds associated with a healthy CRF were >= 37, >=
   19, and >= 56 min/day in moderate, vigorous, and MVPA, respectively,
   whereas in girls were >= 152, >= 34, >= 12, and >= 51 min/day in light,
   moderate, vigorous, and MVPA, respectively. Spending at least 60 min/day
   in MVPA was also associated with a healthy CRF (odds ratios: 1.75, 1.94,
   and 1.57, all P < 0.05, for the whole sample, boys, and girls,
   respectively).
   Conclusions: This study shows sex- and intensity-specific PA thresholds
   to discriminate between adolescents with a healthy CRF from those with a
   less favorable or unhealthy CRF level. Journal of Hospital Medicine.

   growth{''} A simple solution to the autophagy paradox}},

Abstract = {{The role of autophagy in tumorigenesis is controversial. Both autophagy
   inhibitors (chloroquine) and autophagy promoters (rapamycin) block
   tumorigenesis by unknown mechanism(s). This is called the ``Autophagy
   Paradox{''}. We have recently reported a simple solution to this
   paradox. We demonstrated that epithelial cancer cells use oxidative
   stress to induce autophagy in the tumor microenvironment. As a
   consequence, the autophagic tumor stroma generates recycled nutrients
   that can then be used as chemical building blocks by anabolic epithelial
   cancer cells. This model results in a net energy transfer from the tumor
   stroma to epithelial cancer cells (an energy imbalance), thereby
   promoting tumor growth. This net energy transfer is both unilateral and
   vectorial, from the tumor stroma to the epithelial cancer cells,
   representing a true host-parasite relationship. We have termed this new
   paradigm ``The Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Cell
   Metabolism{''} or ``Battery-Operated Tumor Growth{''}. In this sense,
   autophagy in the tumor stroma serves as a ``battery{''} to fuel tumor
   growth, progression and metastasis, independently of angiogenesis. Using
   this model, the systemic induction of autophagy will prevent epithelial
   cancer cells from using recycled nutrients, while the systemic inhibiton
   of autophagy will prevent stromal cells from producing recycled
   nutrients-both effectively ``starving{''} cancer cells. We discuss the
   idea that tumor cells could become resistant to the systemic induction
   of autophagy, by the upregulation of natural endogenous autophagy
   inhibitors in cancer cells. Alternatively, tumor cells could also become
   resistant to the systemic induction of autophagy, by the genetic
   silencing/deletion of pro-autophagic molecules, such as Beclin1. If
   autophagy resistance develops in cancer cells, then the systemic
   inhibition of autophagy would provide a therapeutic solution to this
   type of drug resistance, as it would still target autophagy in the tumor
   stroma. As such, an anti-cancer therapy that combines the alternating
   use of both autophagy promoters and autophagy inhibitors would be
   expected to prevent the onset of drug resistance. We also discuss why
   anti-angiogenic therapy has been found to promote tumor recurrence,
   progression and metastasis. More specifically, anti-angiogenic therapy
   would induce autophagy in the tumor stroma via the induction of stromal
   hypoxia, thereby converting a non-aggressive tumor type to a
   ``lethal{''} aggressive tumor phenotype. Thus, uncoupling the metabolic
   parasitic relationship between cancer cells and an autophagic tumor
   stroma may hold great promise for anti-cancer therapy. Finally, we
   believe that autophagy in the tumor stroma is the local microscopic
   counterpart of systemic wasting (cancer-associated cachexia), which is
   associated with advanced and metastatic cancers. Cachexia in cancer
   patients is not due to decreased energy intake, but instead involves an
   increased basal metabolic rate and increased energy expenditures,
   resulting in a negative energy balance. Importantly, when tumors were
   surgically excised, this increased metabolic rate returned to normal
   levels. This view of cachexia, resulting in energy transfer to the
   tumor, is consistent with our hypothesis. So, cancer-associated cachexia
   may start locally as stromal autophagy, and then spread systemically. As
   such, stromal autophagy may be the requisite precursor of systemic
   cancer-associated cachexia.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To translate and culturally adapt the Shoulder Pain and
   Disability Index (SPADI) into Brazilian-Portuguese and to assess its
   reliability. Methods: The first step was the translation, synthesis,
   back-translation, revision by the committee, pre-testing and evaluation
   of documents by the committee and the author of the SPADI. The revised
   version by the committee was applied to 90 subjects with shoulder
   dysfunction, aged over 18 years from different education and
   sociocultural levels. The items misunderstood by 20\% or more of
   patients were reformulated and reapplied until they reach values lower
   than 20\%. The second stage consisted of two applications of SPADI to 32
   patients with shoulder dysfunction in a interval ranging from 2 to 7
   days. The data from the translation were analyzed descriptively, the
   test-retest reliability by Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and
   the internal consistency by Cronbach's Alpha. Results: Some expressions
   have been adapted to the Brazilian population and the items in the pain
   and disability subscales were changed for an easier reading in
   Portuguese Language. The pre-test revealed a need to change only one
   item of the pain domain and to administer the questionnaire by
   interview, since it was repeated three times and in the first two
   applications with self-reported questionnaire the patients had not been
   reporting their symptoms with regards to the past week and also they
   have not been properly used the item ``Not Applicable{''}. The
   test-retest reliability ranged from 0.90 to 0.94 and the internal
   consistency ranged from 0.87 to 0.89. Conclusion: After the translation
   and cultural adaptation, it was obtained a reliable version of
   SPADI-Brazil.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND - Dermatomycoses caused by non-dermatophyte filamentous fungi
   are rare infections, except for onychomycosis, whose prevalence has
   increased over the past few years. Among these etiologic agents, we
   highlight Scytalidium dimidiatum and S. hyalinum, emergent fungi that
   cause mycoses that affect the nails and skin.
   OBJECTIVE - To investigate the characteristics of onychomycosis and
   other mycoses caused by the fungi Scytalidium spp, using sex, age and
   site of infection as parameters.
   METHODS - Eighty-one samples were evaluated showing positive culture for
   Scytalidium spp, obtained from 74 patients referred to the Laboratory of
   Investigation in Dermatology (ID) located in the city of Rio de Janeiro,
   RJ, between 1997 and 2006. The samples were submitted to diagnostic
   confirmation through direct exam and culture.
   RESULTS - The prevalence of onychomycosis caused by Scytalidium spp. was
   of 0,87\%. The most prevalent age was between 41-60 years (48.64\%).
   Regarding the site of infection, the feet (91.36\%) were most affected,
   with predominance of the left hallux. Hyaline hyphae were the most
   common structures in direct examination and the species S. dimidiatum
   was the most frequent in culture.
   CONCLUSION - Onychomycosis caused by Scytalidium spp. is rare and S.
   dimidiatum was the most isolated species in this laboratory during the
   period of the study.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we derive an explicit, analytic formula for the geodesic

   constitute the configuration manifold for the space of bounded orbits of
   constant energy. We scale these spheres by a factor equal to the
   semi-major axis of the orbit, forming a linear cone. This
   five-dimensional manifold inherits a Riemannian metric, which is induced
   from the Euclidean metric on R(6), the space in which it is embedded. We
   derive an explicit formula for the geodesic distance between any two
   points in this space, each point representing a physical,
   gravitationally bound Keplerian orbit. Finally we derive an expression
   for the Riemannian metric that we used in terms of classical orbital
   elements, which may be thought of as local coordinates on our

Abstract = {{P>The quantification of messenger RNA expression levels by real-time
   reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction requires the
   availability of reference genes that are stably expressed regardless of
   the experimental conditions under study. We examined the expression
   variations of a set of eight candidate reference genes in tomato leaf
   and root tissues subjected to the infection of five taxonomically and
   molecularly different plant viruses and a viroid, inducing diverse
   pathogenic effects on inoculated plants. Parallel analyses by three
   commonly used dedicated algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper,
   showed that different viral infections and tissues of origin influenced,
   to some extent, the expression levels of these genes. However, all
   algorithms showed high levels of stability for glyceraldehyde
   3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ubiquitin, indicated as the most suitable
   endogenous transcripts for normalization in both tissue types. Actin and
   uridylate kinase were also stably expressed throughout the infected
   tissues, whereas cyclophilin showed tissue-specific expression stability
   only in root samples. By contrast, two widely employed reference genes,
   18S ribosomal RNA and elongation factor 1 alpha, demonstrated highly
   variable expression levels that should discourage their use for
   normalization. In addition, expression level analysis of ascorbate
   peroxidase and superoxide dismutase showed the modulation of the two
   genes in virus-infected tomato leaves and roots. The relative
   quantification of the two genes varied according to the reference genes
   selected, thus highlighting the importance of the choice of the correct
   normalization method in such experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The maintenance of synaptic functions is essential for neuronal
   information processing in the adult brain. Astrocytes express glutamate
   transporters that rapidly remove glutamate from the extracellular space
   and they play a critical role in the precise operation of glutamatergic
   transmission. However, how the glutamate clearance function of
   astrocytes is maintained remains elusive. Here, we describe a
   maintenance mechanism for the glutamate uptake capacity of Bergmann
   glial cells (BGs) in the cerebellum. When inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
   (IP3) signaling was chronically and selectively inhibited in BGs in
   vivo, the retention time of glutamate around parallel fiber-Purkinje
   cell synapses was increased. Under these conditions, a decrease in the
   level of the glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) in BGs was
   observed. The same effects were observed after chronic in vivo
   inhibition of purinergic P2 receptors in the cerebellar cortex. These
   results suggest that the IP3 signaling cascade is involved in regulating
   GLAST levels in BGs to maintain glutamate clearance in the mature
   cerebellum.}},

   Rajagopal and co-workers. The mixture consists of a linearly viscous
   fluid infused with solid particles. The solids particles are modeled as
   a granular media and it is assumed that the mixture is dense enough so
   that we can use the theory of interacting continua. The subsequent
   boundary value problem, flow between two flat plates, is then solved
   numerically and results for various dimensionless numbers are presented
   for velocities and volume fraction profiles. The engineering quantities
   of interests discussed are related to the pressure drop and skin
   friction at the walls. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Trichoderma spp. are endophytic plant symbionts that are widely used as
   seed treatments to control diseases and to enhance plant growth and
   yield. Although some recent work has been published on their abilities
   to alleviate abiotic stresses, specific knowledge of mechanisms,
   abilities to control multiple plant stress factors, their effects on
   seed and seedlings is lacking. We examined the effects of seed treatment
   with T harzianum strain T22 on germination of seed exposed to biotic
   stress (seed and seedling disease caused by Pythium ultimum) and abiotic
   stresses (osmotic, salinity, chilling, or heat stress). We also
   evaluated the ability of the beneficial fungus to overcome physiological
   stress (poor seed quality induced by seed aging). If seed were not under
   any of the stresses noted above, T22 generally had little effect upon
   seedling performance. However, under stress, treated seed germinated
   consistently faster and more uniformly than untreated seeds whether the
   stress was osmotic, salt, or suboptimal temperatures. The consistent
   response to varying stresses suggests a common mechanism through which
   the plant fungus association enhances tolerance to a wide range of
   abiotic stresses as well as biotic stress. A common factor that
   negatively affects plants under these stress conditions is accumulation
   of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), and we tested the hypothesis
   that T22 reduced damages resulting from accumulation of ROS in stressed
   plants. Treatment of seeds reduced accumulation of lipid peroxides in
   seedlings under osmotic stress or in aged seeds. In addition, we showed
   that the effect of exogenous application of an antioxidant, glutathione,
   or application of T22, resulted in a similar positive effect on seed
   germination under osmotic stress or in aged seed. This evidence supports
   the model that T harzianum strain T22 increases seedling vigor and
   ameliorates stress by inducing physiological protection in plants
   against oxidative damage.}},

   calculated temperature distribution was relatively uniform during
   upsetting with decelerated ram motion, and the maximum equivalent strain
   was maintained at a low level. Experimental and simulation results
   suggested that the influence of the press ram motion on the ductility of

   Educational Research Journal 35:619-638, 2009) metaphor of `learning as
   becoming' is used to conceptualise the ways trainees reconstruct
   learning in a continuous transactional process of boundary crossing
   between course and workplace. The findings of six longitudinal case
   studies of trainees' development, and evidence from other studies,
   illustrate the complex interrelationships between LSS workplace
   affordances, course affordances and trainee characteristics and the ways
   in which trainees reconstruct learning in each setting. The experience
   of teaching and interacting with learners, interactions with colleagues,
   and access to workplace resources and training are important workplace
   affordances for learning. However, some trainees have limited access to
   these affordances. Teaching observations, course activities and
   experiences as a learner are significant course affordances. Trainees'
   beliefs, prior experiences and dispositions vary and significantly
   influence their engagement with course and workplace affordances. It is
   proposed that better integration of course and workplace learning
   through guided participation in an intentional workplace curriculum and
   attention to the ways trainees choose to engage with this, together with
   the use of practical theorising has the potential to improve trainee
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{I study the information content of bond ratings changes using daily
   corporate bond data from TRACE. Abnormal bond returns over a two-day
   event window that includes the downgrade (upgrade) are negative
   (positive) and statistically significant, although the reaction to
   upgrades is economically small. Monthly abnormal bond returns around
   downgrades and upgrades are statistically significant but overstate the
   magnitude of the reaction relative to two-day abnormal returns. Unlike
   the bond market, the stock market reaction to upgrades is statistically
   insignificant. Evidence suggests that the differing inferences on the
   effect of upgrades in the two markets can be attributed to wealth
   transfer effects rather than relative market inefficiencies. In the
   cross-section, the bond market response is stronger for rating changes
   that appear more surprising, rating changes of lower rated firms, and
   upgrades that move the firm from speculative grade to investment grade.

Abstract = {{Following closely the guidelines of the German Federal Medical
   Association for quality assurance of outpatient surgery, the AGA
   (German-speaking Arthroscopy Association) has formulated recommendations

   The surgical facility should implement a quality management system.
   Minimum standards of construction, apparatus, technical and hygiene

   Medical Association for quality assurance in outpatient surgery. General
   organizational requirements and process quality are described. These
   include the pre-operative diagnosis and therapy, outpatient surgery and
   anesthesia, the treatment after surgery and the assessment of the
   quality of the result.
   Requirements for the qualification of surgeons for authorization to
   independently execute arthroscopic services and training are formulated.
   The AGA recommends that in addition to the specialist status for
   authorization to independently execute arthroscopic services, the
   qualification ``AGA arthroscopist{''} and for training of other doctors
   in the field of arthroscopic surgery, the qualification ``AGA

Abstract = {{Many gas molecules absorb electromagnetic radiation at characteristic
   wavelengths in the infrared region. This absorption can be used to
   identify defined substances like CO2, ammoniac, and so forth. A lot of
   different types of gas sensors are based on the principle of infrared
   absorption like photoacoustic sensors (e.g., Golay cells), dispersive
   infrared instruments (e.g., utilizing a diffraction grating), or Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers. However, the most commonly used
   types of infrared absorbing gas sensors are nondispersive infrared
   (NDIR) sensors. Such a NDIR gas sensor consists of some basic function
   blocks, i.e., an IR-source, the sensor cell or optical path containing
   the sample gas, a gas specific filter, and an IR-detector. One of the
   central issues in the design of this kind of sensors is the geometry of
   the sensor cell. In this paper we investigate the use of statistic ray
   tracing to predict the efficiency of 3-D cell geometries for NDIR gas
   sensors. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method and show examples
   on how to apply it on given 3-D sensor models where we illustrate the
   agreement between simulated and measured gas response data.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The embedding of a p-brane into higher dimensional spacetime breaks not
   only translational symmetries transverse to the worldvolume, but also
   Lorentz symmetries. There exist formulations for p-brane actions which
   associate Goldstone bosons with the generators of the broken Lorentz
   symmetries. These Goldstone bosons are unphysical, in that they can be
   eliminated in favour of other Goldstone bosons either via their
   equations of motion or via the imposition of an inverse Higgs
   constraint. In this paper, we examine the inter-relationship between the
   coset parameterization necessary to implement the inverse Higgs
   constraint, the equivalence of the inverse Higgs constraint to equations
   of motion, and the ability to find versions of the action with no
   explicit dependence on the unphysical Goldstone bosons. This is evidence
   that the unphysical Goldstone bosons are gauge degrees of freedom
   associated with an enlarged isotropy group. In addition to p-brane
   actions, a number of other cases, including conformally invariant
   dilaton actions, are shown to exhibit the same structure.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Having developed and validated a disease-specific
   health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measure for patients with
   systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the LupusQoL, we determined its
   relationship to demographic and clinical measurements in a group of
   patients with SLE.
   Methods. A group of 322 outpatients completed the LupusQoL. Demographic
   (age, sex, marital status, ethnicity) and clinical variables (disease
   duration, disease activity, damage) were recorded. Associations between
   the 8 LupusQoL domains and age, disease duration, disease activity, and
   damage were explored using Spearman's correlation coefficients.
   Differences in LupusQoL scores were examined for sex and marital status
   using the Mann-Whitney U test. Ethnic groups were compared using ANOVA.
   Results. All domains of LupusQoL were impaired, with fatigue (56.3)
   being the worst affected and body image (80.0) the least. The
   correlations between the LupusQoL domain scores and age (r = -0.01 to
   -0.22) and disease duration (r = 0 to 0.16) were absent or weak.
   Similarly, there were no significant differences in the LupusQoL scores
   regarding sex, marital status, or the 3 main ethnic groups
   (Black-Caribbean, Asian, White). Although there were statistically
   significant correlations between the scores of the LupusQoL domains and
   some scores of the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group index (r = -0.22
   to 0.09) and the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating
   Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (r = -0.29 to
   0.21), these were weak.
   Conclusion. HRQOL was impaired in this cohort of outpatients with SLE as
   assessed by the validated lupus-specific LupusQoL. There were no
   clinically important associations between the 8 domains of the LupusQoL
   and clinical or demographic variables in this group of patients. Thus,
   the LupusQoL is a relatively independent outcome measure in patients
   with SLE. (First Release September 1 2010; J Rheumatol 2010;37:2273-9;

Abstract = {{Losses of species and changes in the composition of plant communities
   are likely to influence numerous ecosystem functions. Changes in the
   plant-soil interactions that control decomposition, in particular, could
   alter carbon and nutrient cycling in soils and further alter other
   ecosystem functions. The effects of plant communities on decomposition
   may depend both on the type of tissue being decomposed and also on the
   different stages of the decomposition process. We used an experimental
   design where single plant functional groups were removed from a northern
   grassland to examine the role of plant identity in determining both
   short-term and long-term above- and belowground decomposition rates.
   Plant removals were conducted across fertilization and fungicide
   treatments to examine environmental context-dependency of functional
   group identity effects on decomposition. There were significant effects
   of plant functional group identity on aboveground decomposition, with
   the loss of grasses and forbs slowing decomposition, whereas the effects
   on belowground decomposition were rare and transient. Effects of plant
   identity on decomposition were consistent in both short- and long-term
   decomposition studies indicating that the influences of identity on the
   decomposition environment remained consistent throughout the different
   stages of the decomposition process. Both fertilizer and fungicide
   treatments affected overall decomposition rate, but there were few
   interactions between these treatments and plant removals. Although
   current species loss is likely to be happening in concert with
   environmental changes, the role a species plays in determining ecosystem
   functions such as decomposition may not be context-dependent in these
   northern environments, and this may provide greater predictive power in
   determining the effects of species loss with changing environments.
   Further, as plant identity shows significant effects on litter
   decomposition rates, the effects of current and predicted future
   biodiversity losses may depend specifically on which species are lost.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To assess the outcomes and learning curve of extraperitoneal endoscopic
   radical prostatectomy (EERP) using cumulative summation charts from a
   single tertiary referral centre.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS
   The data from 300 consecutive men with localized prostate cancer who
   underwent EERP at Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK, between
   February 2006 and July 2009 were prospectively maintained in a database.
   The data collected included demographic details, perioperative outcomes,
   complications and follow-up for functional and oncology outcomes. The
   learning curve was analysed using generalized linear models for
   complication rate, operative time and blood loss, using procedure
   experience.
   RESULTS
   The mean (sd, range) operative duration was 160.52 (40.84, 100-310) min,
   and the intraoperative blood loss was 229.3 (172, 20-1000) mL. There was
   no conversion to open surgery and no patient required intraoperative
   blood transfusion. Only one of 250 (0.3\%) patients required a blood
   transfusion after EERP. The median (range) hospital stay was 3 (2-20)
   days and the median catheterization time before cystography was 9 days.
   There was evidence that the complication rate reduced as experience was
   gained (odds ratio 0.98, 95\% confidence interval, CI, 0.97-0.99; P =
   0.002), with the estimated probability of a complication decreasing from
   29\% for the first to < 1\% for the 250th procedure. Also there was
   evidence of a decrease in operative duration (-0.0020 rate parameter on
   log scale; 95\% CI -0.0024 to -0.0017; P < 0.001) and blood loss (-0.01
   rate parameter on log scale; 95\% CI -0.003 to -0.0002; P = 0.021). The
   positive surgical margin rate in pT2 disease decreased from 27\% in the
   first 50 to 14.7\% in the last 50 operated cases. The continence rate
   and biochemical recurrence-free rate at a minimum follow-up of 1 year
   for the first 100 patients was 89\% and 94\%, respectively.
   CONCLUSION
   The results from this series suggest that the benefits of minimally
   invasive surgery for localized prostate cancer (EERP) can be replicated
   after mentored fellowship training of a surgeon. The complication rate
   reduced substantially as experience was gained, suggesting a continuous
   surgical learning curve.}},

Title = {{A Reasonable Alternative to the Reasonable Alternative Design
   Requirement in Products Liability Law: A Look at Pennsylvania}},
Journal = {{HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{155-183}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The manner in which design defects should be defined has caused more
   controversy than any other area of products liability law. The
   Restatement (Third) defines a product design as defective when the
   foreseeable risks of harm from using a product could have been avoided
   if the manufacturer had used a reasonable alternative design. This
   definition departs from the Restatement (Second), which defines
   defective products as unreasonably dangerous if the product fails to
   meet the expectations of consumers. Without so stating, the Restatement
   (Third) essentially changes products liability law from a regime of
   strict liability to one of negligence.
   The debate is most unsettled in Pennsylvania The Pennsylvania Supreme
   Court currently follows the approach of the Restatement (Second),
   holding that negligence has no place in determining whether a product is
   defective and, instead, modeling liability based on consumer
   expectations. In 2007, however, the Third Circuit predicted that the
   Pennsylvania Supreme Court would adopt the Restatement (Third) and apply
   a fault-based standard to determine liability in products liability
   cases. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted certiorari in a case to
   decide whether it should apply the Restatement (Third); however, in
   2009, it dismissed the appeal as improvidently granted As a result, the
   products liability law in Pennsylvania is influx.
   I argue that instead of following either of the Restatements, courts
   should apply strict liability, in which manufacturers are liable for
   foreseeable harm caused by their products, regardless of whether the
   product was deemed ``defective.{''} Although defect will not serve as a
   limitation on liability, manufacturers will be protected under my
   proposal by the affirmative defenses of negligent use or assumption of
   risk By eliminating the elusive concept of defect from products
   liability, liability will be more predictable and will better reflect
   the costs of product use.}},

Abstract = {{The literature concerning subjects who have reading difficulties has
   repeatedly noted their abnormal eye movements. The Developmental Eye
   Movement (DEM) test was developed on the assumption that poor eye
   movement control is a major cause of reading difficulties. The
   hypothesis tested by this study was that practice in fluent reading
   trains the eye movements that result in a good DEM score, whilst poor
   readers will exhibit low DEM scores due to insufficient training.
   English readers (43 children, 20 adults), and Arabic readers (six
   children, five adults) were recruited. The DEM test was administered
   twice, performed once reading the horizontal section in the habitual
   reading direction and secondly in the opposite direction, thus enabling
   the subjects' eye movements to be compared when reading in their
   habitual direction and when reading in a direction which is relatively
   unpracticed. Paired t-tests showed that the difference in eye movements
   (quantified via the DEM test ratio) between the two opposing reading
   directions was significant in English reading adults, English reading
   children and Arabic reading children, but not significant in the Arabic
   adults, who were equally practised in reading in the two directions. The
   results support the hypothesis that abnormal eye movements are more
   likely to be an effect and not the cause of reading difficulties. The
   DEM test should not be used to diagnose eye movement difficulties in a
   patient with poor reading ability.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of major and minor depression,
   panic disorder, and suicidal ideation during pregnancy while also
   identifying factors independently associated with antenatal depressive
   disorders.
   METHODS: In this prospective study, participants were 1,888 women
   receiving ongoing prenatal care at a university obstetric clinic from
   January 2004 through January 2009. Prevalence of psychiatric disorders
   was measured using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
   Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria based on the Patient Health
   Questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression identified factors
   associated with probable major depressive disorder and any depressive
   disorder.
   RESULTS: Antenatal depressive disorders were present in 9.9\% with 5.1\%
   (97) meeting criteria for probable major depression and 4.8\% (90)
   meeting criteria for probable minor depression. Panic disorder was
   present in 3.2\% (61), and current suicidal ideation was reported by
   2.6\% (49). Among patients with probable major depression, 29.5\% (28)
   reported current suicidal ideation. Psychosocial stress (odds ratio
   {[}OR], 1.29; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.21-1.36), domestic
   violence (OR 3.45; 95\% CI 1.46-8.12), chronic medical conditions (OR
   3.05; 95\% CI 1.63-5.69), and race (Asian: OR 5.81; 95\% CI 2.55-13.23;
   or African American: OR 2.98; 95\% CI 1.24-7.18)each significantly
   increased the odds of probable antepartum major depressive disorder,
   whereas older age (OR 0.92; 95\% CI 0.88-0.97) decreased the odds.
   Factors associated with odds of any depression were similar overall
   except that Hispanic ethnicity (OR 2.50; 95\% CI 1.09-5.72) also
   independently increased the odds of any depression.
   CONCLUSION: Antenatal major and minor depressive disorders are common
   and significantly associated with clinically relevant and identifiable
   risk factors. By understanding the high point prevalence and associated
   factors, clinicians can potentially improve the diagnosis and treatment
   rates of serious depressive disorders in pregnant women.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence and re-emergence of human and animal pathogens on a global
   scale continues unabated. One such pathogen is the arbovirus that causes
   Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever, which emerged in the Kingdom of Saudi
   Arabia in the mid 1990s. It has since re-emerged in other regions of the
   country and threatens to widen its area of endemicity beyond the
   peninsula. Human and animal movements, especially those associated with
   the annual mass gathering event of Hajj (pilgrimage) may facilitate
   introduction into other continental masses, where it must be
   differentiated from dengue and other similar arboviral haemorrhagic
   fevers. In addition to dengue and Kadam viruses, which are known to be
   endemic in Saudi Arabia, it is thought that other flaviviruses exist in
   the region, though undetected. Collectively, these viruses present
   diagnostic challenges that may confound the recognition of clinical
   cases of Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever. The Saudi Ministry of Health is
   making concerted efforts to expand the evidence base in order to enhance
   the diagnostic and preventive protocols used to address the challenge of
   Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. and the

   these molecules participate in the development of diabetic complications
   and related diseases. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by short-term
   metabolic changes in lipid and protein metabolism, and long-term
   irreversible changes in vascular and connective tissue. AGEs are
   directly implicated in the development of chronic complications in
   diabetes such as nephropathy, rethinopathy, neuropathy, and other
   related diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, and
   peripheral vascular disease. In this review, we aim to explain how
   glycation occurs in different molecules and what the pathological
   consequence of AGE formation in diabetes mellitus and other diseases
   are.}},

Volume = {{107}},

Abstract = {{The African freshwater fish of Cichlidae are parasitized by five genera
   of monogeneans belonging to Dactylogyridea. Ectoparasitic Scutogyrus,
   Onchobdella, and the highly diversified Cichlidogyrus represent three
   genera located on the gills, while the endoparasitic Enterogyrus and
   Urogyrus are located in the stomach and the urinary bladder,
   respectively. Representatives of four dactylogyridean genera (except for
   Urogyrus) were collected from seven cichlid species in West Africa. The
   aim of this study was to investigate the phylogenetic relationships
   between ectoparasitic and endoparasitic dactylogyridaen monogeneans
   specific to African freshwater Cichlidae and other representatives of
   Dactylogyridae, including a wide range of species from both freshwater
   and marine environments. All phylogenetic analyses point to the
   polyphyletic origin of the subfamily Ancyrocephalinae. Both Enterogyrus
   and Onchobdella were found to be monophyletic. The phylogenetic position
   of Scutogyrus longicornis was placed within the Cichlidogyrus species,
   which suggests the non-monophyly of Cichlidogyrus. Therefore, we have
   proposed a taxonomical revision of the species recently considered to be
   Scutogyrus. However, these four dactylogyridean genera-specific to
   cichlids do not form a monophyletic group. Using LSU rDNA analyses, we
   found that Enterogyrus and Onchobdella form a clade with
   Protogyrodactylus, i.e., the parasite species does not live in cichlids,
   which suggests that endoparasitism in cichlid monogeneans is not an
   ancestral feature.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, large-scale integration of wind power is a challenge in terms
   of the minimization of the insecurity risk, that is, of the expected
   cost associated with the expected load not served. In fact, when there
   is an elevated proportion of wind power, the electrical power quality in
   the sense of continuity of supply may be low, since energy from wind
   power cannot be dispatched in the classical sense and its output varies
   as weather conditions change. However, continuity of supply may also be
   undermined by other uncertain factors, such as the occurrence of random
   events like line outages, generator failures or sudden demand
   variations. Assuming the insecurity risk as a part of the overall
   expected cost for a secure management of a deregulated power system,
   this paper proposes a DC formulation of an AC Economically correct
   Secure Economic Dispatch (EcSED), modified also for the introduction of
   uncertain Wind Power Generation (WPG) sources. Finally, simulations were
   carried out in order to investigate how the above overall expected cost
   changes, as a function of varying penetration levels and varying
   installation locations of a WPG plant. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{ACCOUNTING REVIEW}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2075-2105}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The literature provides mixed evidence on whether investors find audit
   reports modified for going concern reasons to be useful. Using a
   substantially larger sample than previous studies, we observe negative
   excess returns when the going concern audit report (GCAR) is disclosed.
   We find that the reaction is more negative if the GCAR cites a problem
   with obtaining financing, suggesting that the GCAR provides new
   information to investors. Also, the reaction is more adverse if the GCAR
   triggers a technical violation of a debt covenant that restricts the
   firm from getting a GCAR. The evidence suggests that institutional
   investors drive the reaction to the GCAR, since there is no detectable
   reaction at low levels of institutional ownership. The market reaction
   gets more negative as the level of institutional ownership increases,
   and there is a decline in institutional ownership after the GCAR is
   issued. We attribute these results to sophisticated investors' awareness
   of the firm's financing needs and the covenants carried by the firm's
   debt.}},

Abstract = {{Although amino acid flux models have been developed in fish and other
   crustaceans, this is the first study to present an amino acid flux model
   for crabs. This study investigates the influence of different feeds and
   the deprivation of food on the free amino acid (FAA) pool, the rate of
   protein turnover and their relation to the growth and flux of amino
   acids in the shore crab Carcinus maenas. A model was developed for amino
   acid flux describing food consumption rates, assimilation rates, protein
   synthesis rates, growth and protein degradation, and losses. Crabs were
   fed frozen mussel (Mytilus edulis) tissue (Diet 1) or (fresh) white
   muscle from salmon (Salmo salar) (Diet 2) at 7\% of their body weight
   per day while other crabs were starved for ten days. hi the starved
   crabs, the amino acids partitioned into protein synthesis made up 36\%
   of the free amino acid pool. There was a 50\% reduction in the rate of
   protein synthesis in the starved crabs compared with the fed crabs. It
   was estimated that daily dietary amino acid intake might compose up to
   seven times the crabs' FAA pool. In addition, daily protein synthesis
   and degradation might respectively remove and return the equivalent of
   up to 4 times and twice the size of the FAA pool in the fed crabs,
   respectively. Specimens of C. maenas deposited in body proteins (as net
   growth) 14\% in diet 1 and 40\% in diet 2 of their amino acid
   consumption. The amino acid flux in the fed crabs suggested low protein
   conversion efficiency compared to other decapod crustaceans, including
   shrimps and lobsters.}},

Abstract = {{The blood of the sub-Antarctic fish Eleginops maclovinus (Em) contains
   three haemoglobins. The major haemoglobin (Hb1Em) displays the Root
   effect, a drastic decrease in the oxygen affinity and a loss of
   cooperativity at acidic pH. The carbomonoxy form of HbEm1 has been
   crystallized in two different crystal forms, orthorhombic (Ortho) and
   hexagonal (Hexa), and high-resolution diffraction data have been
   collected for both forms (1.45 and 1.49 A resolution, respectively). The
   high-frequency resonance Raman spectra collected from the two crystal
   forms using excitation at 514 nm were almost indistinguishable. Hb1Em is
   the first sub-Antarctic fish Hb to be crystallized and its structural
   characterization will shed light on the molecular mechanisms of cold
   adaptation and the role of the Root effect in fish haemoglobins.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Acute musculoskeletal-injury management largely focuses on
   inhibiting secondary injury, although the data describing secondary
   injury and the timeline for its progression are sparse. Objective: To
   describe the timeline and early progression of secondary injury in
   skeletal muscle over the first 5 h after blunt trauma. Design: A
   controlled laboratory study with 2 independent variables (injury status
   and postinjury time point) in a 2 x 21 factorial. Setting: University
   research laboratory. Subjects: 168 male Sprague Dawley rats (250 to 275
   g). Interventions: Uniform blunt-contusion injury was caused to the
   right triceps surae using a drop-weight method; the contralateral limb
   served as an uninjured control. Both triceps surae were excised and
   flash frozen at 21 intervals across 5 h postinjury (8 animals, each 15
   min). Main Outcome Measures: Cytochrome-c oxidase activity via reduction
   of triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) to triphenyl-formazan. Results:
   There was an interaction effect (P = .041) between and main effects for
   both injury status (P < .0005) and postinjury time point (P = .038). In
   the first 30 min after injury, uninjured tissues did not differ from
   injured tissues, and both displayed TTC reduction rates in the vicinity
   of 7.1 +/- 0.94 mu g . mg(-1) . h(-1). Statistical differences between
   uninjured and injured tissues became evident starting at 30 min. TTC
   reduction for uninjured tissues did not change, but injured tissues
   declined in a roughly linear fashion across the entire 5-h period to 4.8
   +/- 1.04 mu g . mg(-1) . h(-1). Conclusions: Cytochrome-c oxidase
   activity, an indicator of oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial
   viability, is diminished by events that follow muscle trauma. Loss of
   this enzymatic activity becomes statistically evident at 30 min
   postinjury and continues linearly for at least 5 h. This suggests that
   secondary injury is a slowly developing problem of more than 5 h
   duration. A window of opportunity for intervention may lie somewhere
   within the first 30 min after injury.}},

Abstract = {{Research on the relationship between the representation of space and
   time has produced two contrasting proposals. ATOM posits that space and
   time are represented via a common magnitude system, suggesting a
   symmetrical relationship between space and time. According to metaphor
   theory, however, representations of time depend on representations of
   space asymmetrically. Previous findings in humans have supported
   metaphor theory. Here, we investigate the relationship between time and
   space in a nonverbal species, by testing whether non-human primates show
   space-time interactions consistent with metaphor theory or with ATOM. We
   tested two rhesus monkeys and 16 adult humans in a nonverbal task that
   assessed the influence of an irrelevant dimension (time or space) on a
   relevant dimension (space or time). In humans, spatial extent had a
   large effect on time judgments whereas time had a small effect on
   spatial judgments. In monkeys, both spatial and temporal manipulations
   showed large bi-directional effects on judgments. In contrast to humans,
   spatial manipulations in monkeys did not produce a larger effect on
   temporal judgments than the reverse. Thus, consistent with previous
   findings, human adults showed asymmetrical space-time interactions that
   were predicted by metaphor theory. In contrast, monkeys showed patterns
   that were more consistent with ATOM. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Relic proto-stellar discs and the origin of luminous circumstellar
   interaction in core-collapse supernovae}},
Journal = {{MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{409}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{284-304}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A small fraction of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) showevidence that the
   outgoing blast wave has encountered a substantial mass similar to
   1-10M(circle dot) of circumstellar matter (CSM) at radii similar to
   10(2) - 10(3) au, much more than can nominally be explained by
   pre-explosion stellar winds. In extreme cases, this interaction may
   power the most luminous, optically energetic SNe yet discovered.
   Interpretations for the origin of the CSM have thus far centred on
   explosive eruptions from the star just similar to years-decades prior to
   the core collapse. Here, we consider an alternative possibility that the
   inferred CSM is a relic disc left over from stellar birth. We
   investigate this hypothesis by calculating the evolution of
   proto-stellar discs around massive stars following their early embedded
   phase using a self-similar accretion model. We identify a brief initial
   gravitationally unstable ('gravito-turbulent') phase, followed by a much
   longer period of irradiation-supported accretion during which less
   effective non-gravitational forms of angular momentum transport
   dominate. Although external influences, such as the presence of a wide
   binary companion, may preclude disc survival in many systems, we find
   that massive (similar to 1-10M(circle dot)) discs can preferentially
   survive around the most massive stars. Reasons for this perhaps
   counterintuitive result include (1) the shorter stellar lifetimes and
   (2) large photoevaporation radii (similar to 10(3) au) of very massive
   stars; (3) suppression of the magnetorotational instability due to the
   shielding from external sources of ionization and (4) relative
   invulnerability of massive discs to lower mass stellar collisions and
   luminous blue variable eruptions. Furthermore, discs with radii similar
   to 10(2)-10(3) au are picked out by the physics of the embedded stage of
   accretion and the requisite conditions for subsequent disc survival. The
   disc mass, radius and scaleheight at core collapse typically result in
   an similar to 10 per cent efficiency for converting the kinetic energy
   of the exploding star into radiation, potentially producing a total
   electromagnetic output of similar to 10(50)-10(51) erg. We identify two
   regimes of disc-supernova interaction, which are distinguished by
   whether the shocked disc radiates its thermal energy before being
   engulfed by the expanding SN ejecta. This dichotomy may explain the
   difference between very luminous supernova which show narrow H line
   emission and those which show no direct evidence for hydrogen-rich CSM
   interaction. Because very luminous SNe are rare, testing the relic disc
   model requires constraining the presence of long-lived discs around a
   small fraction of very massive stars.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this case report is to explore the treatment of
   ocular and visual complications secondary to familial dysautonomia
   (Riley-Day syndrome) on an 8month-old baby. Treatments for corneal
   scarring, ocular protection, and amblyopia were achieved by fitting a
   scleral lens with a unique piggyback combination involving a cosmetic
   soft contact lens.
   Method: The patient was seen in February 2008, on referral from a
   corneal specialist, for a scleral lens fitting. This case was comanaged
   from Universite de Montreal with the help of the Boston Foundation for
   Sight. Examination revealed a right cornea with opacities. We planned to
   use scleral lenses to treat this eye and to protect the other one.
   Although the patient's ocular condition did improve, some concerns arose
   about potential impact on her visual development. Our treatment for
   amblyopia involved the use of atropine in both eyes and penalization of
   the good eye with a cosmetic opaque contact lens that we fitted onto a
   piggyback system over the scleral lens. The rationale behind this
   approach is explained in this article.
   Result: After the contact lens was fitted and after penalization and
   atropinization, the baby's visual condition improved. Time will tell to
   what degree this treatment is effective.
   Conclusion: Familial dysautonomia is a challenging condition for the eye
   because of the presence of alacrymia and lack of corneal sensitivity.
   Scleral contact lenses and cosmetic contact lenses offer a unique way of
   addressing many issues, such as corneal healing and amblyopia, raised in
   this case report. These devices may be considered for any other case
   that requires corneal tissue healing and visual development.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Although quantitative evidence is lacking, it is generally
   believed that the majority of cases of transfusion-related acute lung
   injury (TRALI) are caused by female blood donors. We aimed to examine
   the relation between female donors and the occurrence of TRALI.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed an international, multicenter
   case-referent study. TRALI patients who were diagnosed clinically,
   independent of serology or donor sex, and had received transfusions
   either only from male donors or only from female donors (unisex cases)
   were selected The observed sex distribution among the donors of these
   TRALI patients was compared to the expected sex distribution, based on
   the relevant donor populations.
   RESULTS: Eighty-three clinical TRALI cases were included; 67 cases
   received only red blood cells (RBCs), 13 only plasma-rich products, and
   three both. Among RBC recipients the relative risk (RR) of TRALI after a
   transfusion from a female donor was 1.2 (95\% confidence interval
   {[}Cl], 0.69-2.1) and among plasma-rich product recipients the RR was 19
   (95\% Cl, 1.9-191). The p value for the difference between RBCs and
   plasma was 0.023.
   CONCLUSION: Our data support the notion that plasma from female donors
   is associated with an increased risk of TRALI, while RBCs from female
   donors are not.}},

   Derivation of a finite-element model of lingual deformation during
   swallowing from the mechanics of mesoscale myofiber tracts obtained by
   MRI. J Appl Physiol 109: 1500-1514, 2010. First published August 5,
   2010; doi: 10.1152/japplphysiol.00493.2010.-To demonstrate the
   relationship between lingual myoarchitecture and mechanics during
   swallowing, we performed a finite-element (FE) simulation of lingual
   deformation employing mesh aligned with the vector coordinates of
   myofiber tracts obtained by diffusion tensor imaging with tractography
   in humans. Material properties of individual elements were depicted in
   terms of Hill's three-component phenomenological model, assuming that
   the FE mesh was composed of anisotropic muscle and isotropic connective
   tissue. Moreover, the mechanical model accounted for elastic constraints
   by passive and active elements from the superior and inferior directions
   and the effect of out-of-plane muscles and connective tissue. Passive
   bolus effects were negligible. Myofiber tract activation was simulated
   over 500 ms in 1-ms steps following lingual tip association with the
   hard palate and incorporated specifically the accommodative and
   propulsive phases of the swallow. Examining the displacement field,
   active and passive muscle stress, elemental stretch, and strain rate
   relative to changes of global shape, we demonstrate that lingual
   reconfiguration during these swallow phases is characterized by (in
   sequence) the following: 1) lingual tip elevation and shortening in the
   anterior-posterior direction; 2) inferior displacement related to
   hyoglossus contraction at its inferior-most position; and 3) dominant
   clockwise rotation related to regional contraction of the genioglossus
   and contraction of the hyoglossus following anterior displacement. These
   simulations demonstrate that lingual deformation during the indicated
   phases of swallowing requires temporally patterned activation of
   intrinsic and extrinsic muscles and delineate a method to ascertain the
   mechanics of normal and pathological swallowing.}},

Abstract = {{Accurately predicting the size-dependant sinking rate of diatoms is
   necessary to fully understand the cycling of oceanic carbon and silicon.
   Stokes' law predicts that sinking velocity should be proportional to the
   square of a diatom's radius (a scaling exponent of 2), which does not
   agree with empirically measured sinking speeds (scaling exponents of
   1.2-1.6). We offer an alternative model for sinking speed that
   separately accounts for the different densities of a diatom's frustule
   (its siliceous cell armor) and its cytoplasm. The ratio of frustule to
   cytoplasm volume changes with size and, thereby, affects the scaling
   relationship between velocity and radius. The resulting model predicts a
   scaling exponent between 1 and 2 depending on the size and shape of the
   diatom, more accurately predicting the upper bound of measured sinking
   speeds and offering an analytical formula for the prediction of the
   maximum sinking speed of diatoms.}},

Abstract = {{We study a new enhanced-physics-based numerical scheme for the NS-alpha
   turbulence model that conserves both energy and helicity. Although most
   turbulence models (in the continuous case) conserve only energy,
   NS-alpha is one of only a very few that also conserve helicity. This is
   one reason why it is becoming accepted as the most physically accurate
   turbulence model. However, no numerical scheme for NS-alpha, until now,
   conserved both energy and helicity, and thus the advantage gained in
   physical accuracy by modeling with NS-alpha could be lost in a
   computation. This report presents a finite element numerical scheme, and
   gives a rigorous analysis of its conservation properties, stability,
   solution existence, and convergence. A key feature of the analysis is
   the identification of the discrete energy and energy dissipation norms,
   and proofs that these norms are equivalent (provided a careful choice of
   filtering radius) in the discrete space to the usual energy and energy
   dissipation norms. Numerical experiments are given to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the scheme over usual (helicity-ignoring) schemes. A
   generalization of this scheme to a family of high-order
   NS-alpha-deconvolution models, which combine the attractive physical
   properties of NS-alpha with the high accuracy gained by combining
   a-filtering with van Cittert approximate deconvolution. (C) 2009 Wiley

Abstract = {{Blood pressure (BP) reduction to 140/90 mm Hg or lower using
   renin-angiotensin-system blockers reportedly provides the greatest left
   ventricular (LV) mass regression; beta-blockers have less effect. This
   study examined whether combination antihypertensive therapy would
   provide greater benefit. With a double-blind, parallel-group design, the
   effects of 3 different combinations, carvedilol controlled-release
   (CR)/lisinopril, atenolol/lisinopril, and lisinopril, on left
   ventricular mass index (LVMI) were assessed by MRI after 12 months.
   Patients were treated to achieve guideline-recommended BP (<140 mm
   Hg/<90 mm Hg; diabetes: <130 mm Hg/<80 mm Hg). Sample size was
   calculated to achieve 90\% power to detect a 5 g/m(2) difference in mean
   change from baseline in LVMI between the carvedilol CR/lisinopril group
   and each of the other treatment groups. Of 287 patients randomized, more
   than 50\% were titrated to maximum dosage; 73\% reached targeted BP. At
   month 12 (last observation carried forward >= month 9) for 195 evaluable
   subjects, mean BP was similar in all groups (carvedilol CR/lisinopril:
   128.8/77.9; atenolol/lisinopril: 128.7/76.5; lisinopril: 126.3/80.3 mm

   all groups (carvedilol CR/lisinopril: -6.3; atenolol/lisinopril: -6.7;
   lisinopril: -7.9 g/m(2)). Achievement of targeted BP control is more
   important than treatment regimen in achieving LV mass reduction. J Am

Abstract = {{Miller, J. J. and Chanasyk, D. S. 2010. Soil characteristics in relation
   to groundwater for selected Dark Brown Chernozems in southern Alberta.
   Can. J. Soil Sci. 90: 597-610. Limited information exists on soil
   characteristics in relation to groundwater for undulating morainal
   landscapes of the Dark Brown soil zone in western Canada. A 4-yr
   (1985-1988) field study was conducted in southern Alberta to investigate
   these relationships for selected Dark Brown Chernozems. Soil morphology,
   physical and chemical properties of the soil horizons, water fluxes in
   the saturated zone, and tritium content of shallow groundwater were
   determined at nine sites. Three Orthic Dark Brown Chernozemic soils
   occurred in groundwater recharge areas with water tables >= 1.81 m,
   indicating that leaching of carbonates from the B horizons was
   consistent with downward groundwater flow. The other three Orthic soils
   occurred in groundwater discharge areas, and they may have developed
   because of deeper (>= 2.60 m) water tables. High water-soluble Na in
   these latter three Orthic soils suggested a sodic influence from a
   shallower water table sometime in the recent past. The two Calcareous
   Dark Brown Chernozems, and saline Calcareous Dark Brown Chernozem
   occurred in groundwater recharge areas. One calcareous soil at a lower
   slope position had a shallow (0.84-2.02 m) water table, suggesting
   carbonates were brought upward into the Cca horizon from the
   groundwater. The other calcareous soil at the upper slope position had a
   deeper (>6.62 m) water table, suggesting carbonates were leached
   downward and precipitated in the Cca horizon. The saline Calcareous Dark
   Brown Chernozem was located in an area of groundwater recharge with a
   deeper (4-9 m) water table, suggesting that. salinization likely
   occurred sometime in the past. Groundwater flow conditions during this

Abstract = {{Since monetary policy is constrained in fixed exchange rate regimes, we
   should observe fewer banking crises due to moral hazard in countries
   with credible currency pegs. However, three countries with seemingly
   credible pegs in the nineteen-eighties and -nineties, namely China, Hong
   Kong and Argentina, still suffered crises in their domestic banking
   sectors. The present note illustrates that bank incentives to take on
   excess risk still exist in countries with currency peg credibility and
   that the size of that risk exposure (and thus the potential for crisis)
   may be positively related to the level of central bank foreign exchange
   reserves. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The authors report on the ability to control the polarity of sputter
   deposited AlN (001) thin films using seed layers. Reactive sputter
   deposition leads to N-polarity on any substrate hitherto applied, i.e.,
   Si(111), sapphire, SiO2, and polycrystalline metals such as Pt(111),
   Mo(110), and W(110). A site-controlled polarity allows for an efficient
   excitation of shear modes of surface, bulk, and Lamb waves by
   interdigitated electrodes. The authors were able to introduce the
   Al-polarity through a metal-organic chemical-vapor deposition seed
   layer. By subsequently patterning the substrate surface, it was possible
   to define the desired film polarity of sputter deposited AlN film.
   Polarities were determined by selective etching with KOH solutions and
   by piezoresponse force microscopy. (c) 2010 American Vacuum Society.

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To present the first detailed assessment of the clinical
   features of CL-induced subconjunctival hemorrhage and associated risk
   factors.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional and case-control study of age-matched randomized
   groups.
   METHODS: A total of 45 CL wearers with subconjunctival hemorrhage aged
   18 to 45 years (CL-Hemorrhage group), 200 age-matched healthy control
   subjects (non-CL group), and 200 age-matched CL wearers (CL group) were
   enrolled. The conjunctiva was divided into the following 8 equal areas:
   superior, superior/nasal, nasal, inferior/nasal, inferior,
   inferior/temporal, temporal, and superior/temporal. The site of
   hemorrhage, the grade, and other parameters of conjunctivochalasis at 3
   locations (nasal, middle, and temporal), and the grade of pinguecula on
   the nasal or temporal conjunctiva were determined in all subjects.
   RESULTS: Typically, subconjunctival hemorrhage affected 1 or 2 regions
   of the temporal conjunctiva. The grade of conjunctivochalasis and
   pinguecula was higher in both the affected and unaffected eyes of the
   CL-Hemorrhage group than the non-CL and CL groups (all P < .00001). The
   effect of downward gaze or digital pressure on the extent of
   conjunctivochalasis was more marked in the CL-Hemorrhage group and
   superficial punctate keratitis was more common (all P < .00001).
   Multivariate logistic regression analysis of variables revealed that the
   presence of conjunctivochalasis and pinguecula were associated with an
   increased risk of CL-induced subconjunctival hemorrhage (all P < .05).
   CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the major risk factors for
   CL-induced subconjunctival hemorrhage are conjunctivochalasis and
   pinguecula. (Am J Ophthalmol 2010;150:656-665. (C) 2010 by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{To explore the crossover transition in the two-Impurity Kondo problem we
   calculate the differential conductance (dI/dV) corresponding to scanning
   tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements of a magnetic dimer adsorbed
   on a metal surface covered by a decoupling layer With the aid of the
   numerical renormalization group (NRG) technique we find that the peak
   structure of the dI/dV spectra near the Fermi level changes gradually as
   a function of the adatom separation and the coupling between the adatom
   localized spins and the metal surface conduction band When the coupling
   becomes small the peak disappears and instead a dip structure appears
   near the Fermi level This dip structure is the manifestation of the
   strong antiferromagnenc correlation between the localized spins We
   conclude that the gradual change of the dI/dV structure from a peak
   structure to a dip structure is an evidence of the crossover transition

Abstract = {{Infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IR-MPD) spectra in the N-H and
   O-H stretching region (3000-3700 cm(-1)) are reported for gas-phase
   monomeric M(2+)Trp and dimeric M(2+)Trp(2) complexes (where M = Mg, Ca,
   Sr, and Ba). The spectra are obtained by irradiating the complexes in
   the Penning trap of a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-IcR)
   mass spectrometer, using a tunable continuous-wave (cw) optical
   parametric oscillator (OPO) laser in combination with a fixed wavelength
   CO2 laser (10.6 mu m). These spectra are compared with previously
   recorded mid-IR-MPD spectra, using the free electron laser FELIX, and
   are interpreted based on harmonic frequency calculations performed with
   density-functional theory (DFT). The experimental spectra show that a
   simple assignment of bands can be made to distinguish zwitterionic (ZW)
   from charge solvation (CS) complexes. In particular, the carboxylic acid
   O-H stretch at similar to 3550 cm(-1) identifies the presence of a CS
   structure, whereas the NH3+ antisymmetric stretching mode in the
   3150-3375 cm(-1) range is diagnostic of a ZW structure. For the
   monomeric Ba(2+)Trp complex, exclusively the ZW structure is observed.
   Conversely, for the dimeric complexes of M(2+)Trp(2) (M = Sr and Ba)
   merely CS/CS geometries are confirmed. Surprisingly, for smaller
   alkaline earth metal dications (M = Mg and Ca), the IR-MPD spectra are
   consistent with the presence of mixed CS/ZW dimers. This is contrary to
   most previous trends for alkali metals, where larger cations typically
   favor ZW stabilization. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The dendrometer has been proposed as a sensitive plant water indicator
   based on stem growth. However, studies including dendrometers have been
   mainly focused on fruit trees and less attention has been paid to
   ornamental shrubs (small plants). In the study described here, stem
   dendrometers were used to ascertain whether there is any relationship
   between water status and dendrometric indices in potted ornamental
   shrubs (1 to 2 cm diameter). For this purpose, three Mediterranean
   shrubs (Pittosporum tobira, Callistemon thrums, and Rhamnus alaternus)
   were studied under water stress recovery conditions in winter, spring,
   and early summer. At the end of the experiment, an extreme water stress
   treatment, which resulted in plant death (August) was also studied. Stem
   diameter variations {[}maximum and minimum daily stem values (MXDS and
   MNDS, respectively), maximum daily shrinkage (MDS), and stem growth rate
   (SGR)], daily evapotranspiration (daily plant ET), and leaf water
   potential (Psi(leaf)) parameters were considered throughout the
   experiment. A regression analysis between dendrometric indices and daily
   plant ET showed that MXDS and MNDS were sensitive under water stress
   recovery conditions, especially in severe environmental conditions
   (spring and summer). The SGR in C. citrinus, the MDS in P. tobira, and
   both indices in R. alaternus were seen to be sensitive during the stress
   to death period. Although more studies are needed, the results confirm
   that the use of dendrometers in small plants may be useful to provide
   continuous and automated registers of the plant water status under
   different substrate water content and climatic conditions. However, the
   response of these indices may imply moderate water stress.}},

Abstract = {{This study had as its objective to compare the transposition of the soil
   seed bank of two successional stages of Seasonal Semideciduous Forest
   for a Melinis Minutiflora P. Beauv site, in an abandoned pasture of the
   Mata do Paraiso Forest Reserve, Vicosa, MG. Ten parcels had been placed
   in each successional site of forest and withdrawals of the center of
   each parcel sample of 1 m(2) and 5 cm of superficial depth of soil,
   being carried afterwards to the abandoned pasture site. Two hundred and
   thirty one individuals had been registered in the two treatments
   (initial forest and mature forest), consisting of 31 shrubs and 200
   trees. The individuals are distributed by 13 families, 17 kinds and 22
   species. The most abundant species had been Vernonia polyanthes, with
   108 individuals and Senna multijuga, with 39 individuals. The soil seed
   bank coming from the site of initial secondary forest (Fi) registered
   more individuals (120) than the bank coming from the site of the mature
   forest (Fm), with 111 individuals. The parcels witnesses had been
   colonized by herbaceous and mainly by the exotic grass Melinis
   Minutiflora. The number of germinated seeds was only greater in the Fm
   treatment in the months of july/2008 and january/2009. Significant
   differences were observed with 1\% probability, between the treatments,
   for the variable wealth of species and density of individuals. The
   present study showed that it is recommendable and viable to adopt the
   technique of transposition of the seed bank as a methodology of forest
   restoration of abandoned pasture.}},

Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{Free equiaxed dendrites in solidifying alloy melts are subjected to
   hydrodynamic effects as a result of gravity. The sedimentation of
   dendrites is one such effect and believed to be a cause of macro
   segregation in partitioning alloys. A novel computational model is
   proposed to estimate the settling speed of free dendrites at moderate
   Reynolds numbers. Growth of the dendrite, momentum changes, internal
   solid fraction evolution within a spherical dendrite envelope of
   changing diameter, and surface morphology of the dendrite while settling
   are taken into account in the development of the model. Comparison with
   results from a series of equiaxed dendrite settling experiments, on
   solidifying transparent alloy analogues to metals, shows good agreement
   between predicted and experimental settling speeds. The correlation
   between surface morphology of the dendrite which affects drag force and
   the physical parameters of the settling dendrite is studied. The
   feasibility of applying the proposed model to metallic systems is also
   explored and the outlook is positive. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Global climate change is expected to result in more frequent and intense
   droughts in the Mediterranean region. To understand forest response to
   severe drought, we used a mobile rainfall shelter to examine the impact
   of spring and autumn rainfall exclusion on stomatal (S-L) and
   non-stomatal (NSL) limitations of photosynthesis in a Quercus ilex
   ecosystem. Spring rainfall exclusion, carried out during increasing
   atmospheric demand and leaf development, had a larger impact on
   photosynthesis than autumn exclusion, conducted at a time of mature
   foliage and decreasing vapour pressure deficit. The relative importance
   of NSL increased with drought intensity. S-L and NSL were equal once
   total limitation (T-L) reached 60\%, but NSL greatly exceeded S-L during
   severe drought, with 76\% NSL partitioned equally between mesophyll
   conductance (MCL) and biochemical (B-L) limitations when T-L reached
   100\%. Rainfall exclusion altered the relationship between leaf water
   potential and photosynthesis. In response to severe mid-summer drought
   stress, A(n) and V-cmax were 75\% and 72\% lower in the spring exclusion
   plot than in the control plot at the same pre-dawn leaf water potential.
   Our results revealed changes in the relationship between photosynthetic
   parameters and water stress that are not currently included in drought
   parameterizations for modelling applications.}},

Abstract = {{Bamboo is viewed as a sustainable and highly renewable material that may
   be grown in any temperate climate zone. Interest in the engineering
   properties of bamboo and the use of bamboo in engineered construction is
   growing. Although often having superior mechanical properties than
   readily available sawn timber, bamboo, being largely an unidirectional
   fibrous material, is very susceptible to longitudinal splitting. Despite
   being the dominant limit state in many applications, very little
   previous work has addressed the characterization of bamboo splitting
   failure. The present research focuses on the development of a split pin
   test method for characterizing the splitting strength of bamboo culms.
   The proposed split pin test uses a full culm section test, thereby
   eliminating some of the complexities of partial culm tests. Results of a
   pilot study of the split pin test having similar specimens with
   different split pin diameters yielded consistent results and variations
   less than that of the previously standardized direct shear test. In
   order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed test method, a series
   of tests was performed on samples of Tre Gai (Bambusa stenostachya
   Hackel) bamboo.}},

Abstract = {{A new method is developed for reconstruction of the local orientation of
   the parent austenite based on the orientation of lath martensite
   measured by electron backscattered diffraction. The local orientation of
   austenite was obtained by least squares fitting as the difference
   between the experimental data and the predicted martensite orientation
   was minimal, assuming the specific orientation relationship (OR) between
   martensite and the parent austenite. First, the average OR between
   austenite and lath martensite was precisely determined and it was shown
   that both close packed planes and directions between martensite and the
   parent austenite deviated by more than 1 degrees in low carbon
   martensite. The quality of the reconstructed austenite orientation map
   depended strongly on the OR used for the calculation. When Kurdjumov
   Sachs (K-S) or Nishiyama-Wasserman (N-W) ORs were used the austenite
   orientation was frequently mis-indexed as a twin orientation with
   respect to the true orientation because of the mirror symmetry of (0 1
   1)(alpha) stacking in the K S or N-W ORs. In contrast, the frequency of
   mis-indexing was significantly reduced by using the measured OR, where
   the close packed planes and directions were not parallel. The
   deformation structure in austenite was successfully reconstructed by
   applying the proposed method to ausformed martensite in low carbon
   steel. (C) 2010 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is induced by transforming
   growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and is a crucial event for cancer
   cells to acquire invasive and metastatic phenotypes. However, the
   signals that induce EMT in cancer cells have yet to be adequately
   defined. In this study, a proteomic investigation was performed to
   understand the signaling pathway of the EMT of lung cancer using
   two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass
   spectrometry. The protein expression profiles of A549 were compared to
   those of A549 cells treated with TGF-beta 1. Of more than 2,000 protein
   spots shown by 2D-DIGE, 53 were found to be up- or down-regulated upon
   induction with TGF-beta 1. In the 53 protein. spots, the protein level
   of heat shock protein (HSP) 27 was found to increase significantly.
   HSP27 protein was higher in two different lung cancer cell lines,
   demonstrating the EMT phenomenon with TGF-beta 1. Notably, the silencing
   of HSP27 enhanced. spindle integration, resulting in an additive effect
   with TGF-beta 1-induced EMT. Furthermore, the TGF-beta 1-induced HSP27
   increase was not affected by the suppression of Smad2 and Smad3 in A549
   cells. These results suggest that HSP27 was involved in TGF-beta
   1-induced EMT in a Smad-independent manner in lung cancer cells and may
   provide an effective clinical strategy in lung cancer patients whose
   tumors are dependent on TGF-beta 1-induced EMT.}},

Abstract = {{P>The utility of many T-DNA insertion mutant lines of Arabidopsis is
   compromised by their propensity to trigger transcriptional silencing of
   transgenes expressed from the CaMV 35S promoter. To try to circumvent
   this problem, we characterized the genetic requirements for maintenance
   of 35S promoter homology-dependent transcriptional gene silencing
   induced by the dcl3-1 (SALK\_005512) T-DNA insertion mutant line.
   Surprisingly, even though DCL3 and RDR2 are known components of the
   siRNA-dependent transcriptional gene silencing pathway, transcriptional
   gene silencing of a 35S promoter-driven GUS hairpin transgene did occur
   in plants homozygous for the dcl3-1 T-DNA insertion and was unaffected
   by loss of function of RDR2. However, the transcriptional gene silencing
   was alleviated in dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 triple mutant plants and also by
   mutations in AGO4, NRPD2, HEN1 and MOM1. Thus, some T-DNA insertion
   mutant lines induce 35S promoter homology-dependent transcriptional
   silencing that requires neither DCL3 nor RDR2, but involves other genes
   known to function in siRNA-dependent transcriptional silencing.
   Consistent with these results, we detected 35S promoter siRNAs in dcl3-1
   SALK line plants, suggesting that the 35S promoter homology-dependent
   silencing induced by some T-DNA insertion mutant lines is
   siRNA-mediated.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The initial step in atherosclerosis is the
   adhesion of leukocytes to activated endothelial cells mediated by
   intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). This study aimed to
   investigate the association of K469E polymorphism of the ICAM-1 gene and
   soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) serum level with coronary heart disease (CHD)
   in Egyptian subjects.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a case-control design, we studied 100
   patients with CHD, including 73 patients with acute myocardial
   infarction (MI) and 27 with unstable angina (UA). The control group
   consisted of 50 healthy subjects with normal left ventricular function.
   All participants were genotyped for the ICAM-1 polymorphism by the
   polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
   (PCR-RFLP) method. Serum sICAM-1 was measured by enzyme-linked
   immunoassay (ELISA).
   RESULTS: In CHD patients, the frequencies of K genotype (KK and EK) were
   significantly higher when compared to controls (P<.001) and were
   associated with an increased risk of disease development (OR=3.8, 95\%
   CI: 1.7 to 8.5; P=.001). K genotype frequencies in patients with MI
   showed no significant difference when compared to patients with UA
   (P=.121). Serum sICAM-1 levels were comparable between CHD patients and
   controls (P=.37) and between MI and UA patients (P=.23). There were no
   significant differences in sICAM-1 levels among patients with different
   genotypes (P=.532). Men presented with higher sICAM-1 levels than women
   (P=.004).
   CONCLUSION: ICAM-1 gene polymorphism in codon 469 is associated with a
   risk for CHD development in Egyptian subjects. Serum sICAM-1 is not
   influenced by this polymorphism and is not necessarily elevated in CHD.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between several genes and environmental factors occur in
   silicosis and other dust-mediated pulmonary fibrosis. It has been
   suggested that several genes play role in individual susceptibility to
   silicosis. The aim of this study was to determine the
   angiotensin-1-converting enzyme (ACE) gene (I/D) variations in patients
   with silicosis and healthy controls in Iranian Kurdish population.
   Forty-one male workers with silicosis and 41 healthy male controls were
   entered in the study. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was carried
   out for allele and genotype typing. Our finding showed that the
   frequencies of D and I alleles were 0.65 and 0.35 in the silicotic
   patients compared to 0.52 and 0.48 in the controls. The frequencies of
   ACE D/D, D/I, and I/I genotypes were 15 (36.59\%), 23 (56.1\%), and 3
   (7.31\%) in patients, and 14 (34.15\%), 15 (36.59\%), and 12 (29.27\%)
   in the controls, respectively. The results indicate that the frequency
   of ACE D/D+D/I genotypes were higher in the patients group (92.7\% vs.
   70.73\%) (OR: 5.24, 95\% CI: 1.35-20.30, P = 0.01). Also, ACE I/I
   genotype frequency was lower in patients (7.32\% vs. 29.27\%) (OR: 0.19,
   95\% CI: 0.04-0.73, P = 0.01). It can be concluded that ACE D/D and I/D
   genotypes may play a role in the susceptibility to silicosis; on the
   contrary, ACE I/I genotype may have protective effect.</.}},

Abstract = {{This study is part of the broad debate about the role of distance and
   technology for interpersonal contact. To the best of the authors'
   knowledge, this is the first study that systematically and explicitly
   compares the role of distance in social networks pre- and post-Internet.
   An analysis is made of the effect of distance on the frequency of
   e-mail, phone, face-to-face and overall contact in personal networks,
   and the findings are compared with their pre-Internet counterpart whose
   data were collected in 1978 in the same East York, Toronto locality.
   Multilevel models with a spline specification are used to examine the
   non-linear effects of distance on the frequency of contact. These
   effects are compared for both very close and somewhat close ties, and
   for different role relationships: immediate kin, extended kin, friends
   and neighbours. The results show that e-mail contact is generally
   insensitive to distance, but tends to increase for transoceanic
   relationships greater than 3000 miles apart. Face-to-face contact
   remains strongly related to short distances (within five miles), while
   distance has little impact on how often people phone each other at the
   regional level (within 100 miles). The study concludes that e-mail has
   only somewhat altered the way people maintain their relationships. The
   frequency of face-to-face contact among socially close friends and
   relatives has hardly changed between the 1970s and the 2000s, although
   the frequency of phone contact has slightly increased. Moreover, the
   sensitivity of these relationships to distance has remained similar,
   despite the communication opportunities of the Internet and low-cost
   telephony.}},

Abstract = {{Forest management plans in Bhutan are implemented under the premise that
   species diversity is not significantly altered while providing forest
   products and services to local communities. This study examines the
   impact on local communities of government-management logging operations
   in national forests near their villages and the impact of the
   single-tree selection system on species diversity in 4 forest management
   units with mixed conifer forests in western Bhutan. Household interviews
   were conducted using semistructured questionnaires to assess the
   availability of forest products and the accessibility of forests for
   grazing and identifying constraints and opportunities. Moreover,
   single-tree selection forests and old-growth uncut forests were sampled
   for comparing species diversity. Forest product availability and
   accessibility of forests to rural communities for grazing varies between
   forest management units (FMUs). Currently, at Chamgang and Gidakom FMUs,
   lesser quantities of timber and other wood products such as beams,
   planks, scaffoldings, poles, fuelwood, and leaf litter were available to
   rural communities compared with 10 years before the implementation of
   logging operations. At Chamgang and Gidakom FMUs, logging followed by
   plantation and fencing and retention of coarse woody debris constituted
   barriers to cattle herding. Notwithstanding, forest roads provided
   access to forest resources. The government-managed national forests,
   however, provide limited accessibility to rural communities for
   extracting timber and other wood products. The single-tree selection
   system did not alter species composition and was not detrimental to
   forest species diversity in national forests.}},

Abstract = {{Serotonin 2C receptors (5-HT2CR) have been shown to undergo
   post-transcriptional RNA editing. This modification affects the
   affinity, coupling and constitutive activity of the receptor. In vivo,
   manipulations such as stress or antidepressant administration
   dramatically modify the pattern of 5-HT2CR mRNA editing, suggesting that
   this phenomenon might be involved in the pathophysiology of
   stress-related disorders. Indeed, alterations of 5-HT2CR mRNA editing
   have been observed in depressed patients. Thus, the recent development
   of mice expressing either the non-edited (5-HT2CR-INI) or the
   fully-edited form of 5-HT2CR (5-HT2CR-VGV) provides a novel opportunity
   to investigate the relevance of this phenomenon in the context of
   stress-related disorders. We observed that both 5-HT2CR-INI and
   5-HT2CR-VGV mice exhibit exaggerated anxiety-like behaviors in the
   elevated-plus maze paradigm. This phenotype was observed when the IN! or
   VGV mutations were present in mice on a BALB/c background, as well as
   non-significant trends in the same direction in mice on a C57BL/6J
   background. In animal models of antidepressant-like activity, the
   absence of editing of 5-HT2CR mRNA (5-HT2CR-INI) induced an increase in
   the time spent immobile in the forced-swim test (FST) and tail
   suspension test (TST). Complete editing of 5-HT2C receptor mRNA
   (5-HT2CR-VGV) induced antidepressant-like behavior in the FST and TST,
   as reflected by a significant decrease in time spent immobile. These
   phenotypes were unrelated to alterations in locomotor activity in both
   5-HT2CR-INI and 5-HT2CR-VGV. In the TST, these phenotypes were
   accompanied by a decrease and an increase in response to desipramine in
   5-HT2CR-INI and 5-HT2CR-VGV, respectively. These data constitute the
   first in vivo demonstration of a role for 5-HT2CR mRNA editing in
   anxiety- and depression-related behaviors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Diagnosis in psychiatry is portrayed as the same type of activity as
   diagnosis in other areas of medicine. However, the notion that
   psychiatric conditions are equivalent to physical diseases has been
   contested for several decades. In this paper, I use the work of Jeff
   Coulter and David Ingelby to explore the role of diagnosis in routine
   psychiatric practice. Coulter examined the process of identification of
   mental disturbance and suggested that it was quite different from the
   process of identifying a physical disease, as it was dependent on social
   norms and circumstances. Ingelby pointed out that it was the apparent
   medical nature of the process that enabled it to act as a justification
   for the actions that followed. I describe the stories of two patients,
   which illustrate the themes Ingelby and Coulter identified. In
   particular they demonstrate that, in contrast to the idea that diagnosis
   should determine treatment, diagnoses in psychiatry are applied to
   justify predetermined social responses, designed to control and contain
   disturbed behaviour and provide care for dependents. Hence psychiatric
   diagnosis functions as a political device employed to legitimate
   activities that might otherwise be contested. Social Theory \& Health

   The effects of Ni loading, reaction temperature and feed gas ratio for

   with a solution of nickel nitrate. XRD patterns and activity tests have
   verified that the 5wt\%Ni/alpha-Al2O3 was the most active catalyst, as
   compared with the other prepared catalyst samples. An increase of the Ni
   loading to more than 5 wt\% led to a reduction in the Ni dispersion. In
   addition, by combining the endothermic carbon dioxide reforming reaction
   with the exothermic partial oxidation reaction, the loss of catalyst
   activity with time on stream was reduced with the amount of oxygen added
