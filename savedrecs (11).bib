Abstract = {{The study analyses the contribution of relevant economic actors to the
   provision of private and public goods in agricultural landscapes. A
   method consisting of a multi-sectoral perspective and an integrated
   approach based on the analytic network process (ANP) and the use of
   selected local stakeholders is applied. The usefulness of the method is
   demonstrated in three European case studies in Austria, Italy and Spain.
   The results show that agriculture and tourism are the sectors that
   contribute the most and the least, respectively, to the provision of
   goods and services in agricultural landscapes. Moreover, the results
   underscore that policy instruments towards such provision need to be
   targeted differently in different areas and must take into account the
   different roles of the local actors involved.}},

Abstract = {{We report a facile synthesis of multiply twinned Pd@Pt core shell
   concave decahedra by controlling the deposition of Pt on preformed Pd
   decahedral seeds. The Pt atoms are initially deposited on the vertices
   of a decahedral seed, followed by surface diffusion to other regions
   along the edges/ridges and then across the faces. Different from the
   coating of a Pd icosahedral seed, the Pt atoms prefer to stay at the
   vertices and edges/ridges of a decahedral seed even when the deposition
   is conducted at 200 degrees C, naturally generating a core shell
   structure covered by concave facets. The nonuniformity in the Pt coating
   can be attributed to the presence of twin boundaries at the vertices, as
   well as the \{100\} facets and twin defects along the edges/ridges of a
   decahedron, effectively trapping the Pt adatoms at these high-energy
   sites. As compared to a commercial Pt/C catalyst, the Pd@Pt concave
   decahedra show substantial enhancement in both catalytic activity and
   durability toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). For the concave
   decahedra with 29.6\% Pt by weight, their specific (1.66 mA/cm(pt)(2))
   and mass (1.60 A/mg/0 ORR activities are enhanced by 4.4 and 6.6 times
   relative to those of the Pt/C catalyst (0.36 mA/cm(pt)(2) and 0.32
   A/mgpt, respectively). After 10 000 cycles of accelerated durability
   test, the concave decahedra still exhibit a mass activity of 0.69
   A/mgpt, more than twice that of the pristine Pt/C catalyst.}},

Title = {{The Measurement and Clinical Importance of Syndesmotic Reduction After

Abstract = {{Background: Rotational ankle fractures often have unstable syndesmotic
   injuries that require reduction and stabilization. Multiple studies have
   focused on methods to assess syndesmotic reduction; however, the
   clinical importance of anatomic syndesmotic reduction remains unclear.
   The purpose of this study was to determine whether the quality of
   syndesmotic reduction influenced clinical outcomes following operative
   treatment of ankle fractures with unstable syndesmotic injuries.
   Methods: Patients were included from an institutional trauma registry if
   they had sustained rotational ankle fractures with intraoperative
   evidence of syndesmotic instability requiring syndesmotic reduction and
   stabilization. Patients with at least twelve months of disease-specific,
   patient-reported clinical outcomes were included. Computed tomography
   (CT) imaging of both ankles was performed within two days
   postoperatively for all patients. Four previously utilized methods of
   assessing syndesmotic reduction using axial CT images of the operatively
   treated and the contralateral ankle were used.
   Results: A total of 155 patients met the study inclusion criteria and
   underwent analysis. The four methods used to assess syndesmotic
   reduction had reliabilities ranging from moderate to almost perfect
   (intraclass correlation coefficient {[}2,1] range = 0.544 to 0.821).
   Measurements of the uninjured syndesmosis were consistent with those in
   several previous studies of normal syndesmotic morphology, and the four
   methods of syndesmotic assessment had strong internal consistency. The
   mean measurement differences between the injured and normal ankles
   ranged from 1.32 to 1.88 mm of displacement and averaged 5.75 degrees of
   rotation. There were no correlations noted between any of the four
   syndesmotic reduction assessment methods and any Foot and Ankle Outcome
   Score domains.
   Conclusions: Within the range of syndesmotic malreductions studied, the
   quality of syndesmotic reduction did not significantly influence
   clinical outcomes. These results challenge previous definitions of
   syndesmotic malreduction and the clinical importance of minor
   syndesmotic changes. It remains unclear, however, whether greater
   magnitudes of syndesmotic malreduction than those seen in this cohort
   would lead to inferior patient-reported outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Surface depressions are abundant in topographically complex landscapes,
   and they exert significant influences on hydrological, ecological, and
   biogeochemical processes at local and regional scales. The increasing
   availability of high-resolution topographical data makes it possible to
   resolve small surface depressions. By analogy with the reasoning process
   of a human interpreter to visually recognize surface depressions from a
   topographic map, we developed a localized contour tree method that is
   able to fully exploit high-resolution topographical data for detecting,
   delineating, and characterizing surface depressions across scales with a
   multitude of geometric and topological properties. In this research, we
   introduce a new concept pour contour' and a graph theory-based contour
   tree representation for the first time to tackle the surface depression
   detection and delineation problem. Beyond the depression detection and
   filling addressed in the previous raster-based methods, our localized
   contour tree method derives the location, perimeter, surface area,
   depth, spill elevation, storage volume, shape index, and other geometric
   properties for all individual surface depressions, as well as the nested
   topological structures for complex surface depressions. The combination
   of various geometric properties and nested topological descriptions

Abstract = {{In the deepest section of a large complex cave in the northern Negev
   desert, Israel, a bi-conical lead object was found logged onto a wooden
   shaft. Associated material remains and radiocarbon dating of the shaft
   place the object within the Late Chalcolithic period, at the late 5th
   millennium BCE. Based on chemical and lead isotope analysis, we show
   that this unique object was made of almost pure metallic lead, likely
   smelted from lead ores originating in the Taurus range in Anatolia.
   Either the finished object, or the raw material, was brought to the
   southern Levant, adding another major component to the already-rich Late
   Chalcolithic metallurgical corpus known to-date. The paper also
   discusses possible uses of the object, suggesting that it may have been
   used as a spindle whorl, at least towards its deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluate safety and immunization coverage of a new kind of recombinant
   Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) in Ningbo city, China. Two groups were
   carried out in 2 of 11 randomly selected countries in Ningbo in 2009.
   All of the infants born from July 1 to December 31, 2009 were enrolled
   as subjects and received 3 doses of HepB at 0, 1, 6 month. Control group
   (N = 3452) received current HepB derived from Saccharomyces Cerevisiae
   Yeast (HepB made by recombinant DNA techniques in Saccharomyces
   Cerevisiae Yeast, HepB-SCY; 5 g/0.5 ml per dose) and experimental group
   (N = 5104) received the new kind of HepB derived from Hansenula
   polymorpha Yeast (HepB made by recombinant DNA techniques in Hansenula
   polymorpha Yeast, HepB-HPY; 10 g/0.5 ml per dose). 3-dose and timely
   birth dose (TBD) coverage were available and compared between 2 groups.
   Standard structuredquestionnaires were applied to record information
   from parents and hospitals for selecting determinants of coverage. The
   data were analyzed using stepwise multiple logistic regression models.
   After each dose, HepB-related adverse events (AEs) and recta-temperature
   were recorded for 7days. 3-dose coverage in control group (89.98\%) was
   higher than that in experimental group (2 = 575.1173, P < 0.0001). TBD
   coverage in control and experimental group were 98.41\% and 98.53\%,
   respectively. No statistically significant difference in TBD coverage
   was found between 2 groups (2 = 0.0623, P = 0.8029). A total of 9 local
   AEs were reported, 4 for control group and 5 for experimental group. The
   percentages of subjects reporting AEs were similar across the 2
   vaccination groups. No serious or immediate reactions were found in this
   study. From logistic models, receiving 10 g vaccine (odds ratio
   {[}OR]:0.38; 95\% confidence interval {[}95\%CI]: 0.34-0.44) and mother
   migrating from other cities (OR: 0.45; 95\%CI: 0.42-0.47) were the
   determinants for non-acceptance of 3 doses of HepB; infants born from
   low grade hospitals and native mothers contributed to administrate the
   TBD.}},

Abstract = {{Fractal-like aggregates exhibit interesting properties that determine
   their physicochemical advantages, and thus, the control and prediction
   of aggregation is critical for many applications. An off-lattice kinetic
   Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation was performed to investigate the aggregate
   evolution from primary particles to three-dimensional fractal
   aggregates, at three different volume fractions. We have found that at
   low volume fraction, aggregation kinetics is slow, and aggregate
   morphology is widely open and stringy, with fractal dimension of (D-f)
   1.8, in which the system is constantly preserved in the dilute regime.
   In denser volume fractions, however, the aggregation kinetics appears to
   be accelerated and aggregate morphology is more compact and less stringy
   due to the transition from dilute to dense regimes. Moreover, the volume
   fractions determine what kind of coagulation mechanism may occur to
   produce aggregates with different morphologies. At low volume fraction,
   coagulation is predominated by coagulation between aggregates in which
   the maximum probability of interpenetration event is only 18\%. This
   suggests that aggregates at low volume fraction can maintain their
   self-similarity behavior. While at high volume fraction, coagulation is
   predominated by two subsequent coagulation mechanisms, namely, primary
   particle-aggregate and aggregate-aggregate interaction. The probability
   of interpenetration event increases up to 40\%. In addition, the
   interpenetration process as well as the primary particle-aggregate
   coagulation, particularly in the dense regime, could produce
   superaggregates with a hybrid structure with a high fractal dimension at
   large size scales and a low fractal dimension at small scales. A detail
   mechanism for the formation of superaggregates was discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescent organic nanoparticles based on small molecules have been
   regarded as promising candidates for bioimaging in recent years. In this
   study, we report a highly stable near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent organic
   nanoprobes based on nanoparticles of an anthraquinone derivate with
   strong aggregation-induced emission (AIR) characteristics and a large
   Stokes shift (>175 nm). These endow the nanoprobe with high fluorescent
   brightness and high signal-to-noise ratio. On the other hand, the
   nanoprobe also shows low cytotoxicity, good stability over a wide pH
   range, superior resistance against photodegradation and photobleaching
   comparing to typical commercial fluorescent organic dyes such as
   fluorescein sodium. Endowed with such merits in term of optical
   performance, biocompatibility, and stability, the nanoprobe is
   demonstrated to be an ideal fluorescent probe for noninvasive long-term
   cellular tracing and imaging applications. As an example, it is shown
   that strong red fluorescence from the nanoprobe can still be clearly
   observed in A549 human lung cancer cells after incubation for six

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of multi-class image classification by
   proposing a novel multi-view multi-sparsity kernel reconstruction (MMKR
   for short) model. Given images (including test images and training
   images) representing with multiple visual features, the MMKR first maps
   them into a high-dimensional space, e.g., a reproducing kernel Hilbert
   space (RKHS), where test images are then linearly reconstructed by some
   representative training images, rather than all of them. Furthermore a
   classification rule is proposed to classify test images. Experimental
   results on real datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed MMKR
   while comparing to state-of-the-art algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{We use both qualitative and quantitative tools to examine whether
   membership in the WTO reduces the likelihood of conflict. In our
   qualitative analysis, we show how WTO facilitates cooperation and
   transparency. Then we study what policymakers say and do to use trade to
   promote peace. We also examine whether and how members of the WTO
   respond to acceding states as well as member states experiencing
   inter-state conflict. We find member states do little to expand trade
   with states in conflict. Moreover, they continue to use trade sanctions.
   Hence, they are sending contradictory messages about the trade/peace
   relationship. Next we test whether the trust engendered through daily
   interactions and participation in a rules based system (our membership
   hypothesis) reduces the likelihood of conflict or whether membership in
   the WTO which in turn leads to expanded trade reduces the likelihood of
   conflict (our membership and trade hypothesis). We find no evidence that
   membership alone reduces the likelihood of either major interstate war
   or militarized interstate dispute among members. However, when states
   are both members of the GATT/WTO and benefit from increased trade, they
   are less likely to engage in militarized interstate disputes. Hence, the
   liberal illusion is not a complete delusion.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. Anemia is associated with poor quality of life in dialysis
   patients. However, data on this association are scarce on transplant
   patients. We aimed to find the frequency of anemia, and the effect of
   anemia on the quality-of-life parameters in patients who have undergone
   kidney transplantation.
   Methods. Anemia was defined by a hemoglobin (Hgb) level of <12 g/dL and
   severe anemia by a Hgb level of <10 g/dL. All patients were evaluated
   with the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL-SF) scale forms.
   Results. Two hundred patients (128 male and 72 female; mean age, 39.2
   +/- 11.5 years) were examined. Anemia was found in 19\% and severe
   anemia was found in 4.5\% of all patients. Low glomerular filtration
   rate, young age, and female gender were demographic parameters
   associated with anemia. Parathormone levels were higher in the anemic
   group. The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin
   receptor blockers, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors was
   significantly higher in the anemic group. In addition, patients with
   anemia had a lower KDQOL-SF mental health component score than that of
   the patients without anemia.
   Conclusions. Anemia was related to the degree of renal function in
   posttransplant patients. Anemia had an important influence on mental
   health in renal transplant patients.}},

Title = {{THE EFFECT OF REFLECTIVE TEACHING ON THE INTRINSIC MOTIVATION AND

Journal = {{MODERN JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE TEACHING METHODS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{As Jay and Johnson (2002, p. 73) maintain ``Reflection has become an
   integral part of teacher education{''} and `` there is not a single
   teacher educator who would say that he or she is not concerned about
   preparing teachers who are reflective{''} (Tabachnick \& Zeichner, 2002,
   p. 13). Similarly, critical thinking (Collins \& Onwuegbuzie, 2000;
   Solon, 2003; Nikoopour et al., 2011) and motivation (Krashen, 2002;
   Ushida, 2005; Pourhosein \& Gilakjani, 2012) have also been found as two
   important variables in general educational settings and language
   learning contexts in particular. To the same end, the present study
   sought to explore the effect of reflective teaching on critical thinking
   and intrinsic motivation of female Iranian intermediate learners.
   Moreover, the study aimed at examining the impact of reflective teaching
   on critical thinking and motivation across age groups. To do so, an
   experimental design was adopted. Initially, two teachers - a reflective
   and a non-reflective teacher were selected based on the results of
   reflective teaching questionnaire. Following that, the legitimate
   participants were chosen. The initial subjects of this study were ninety
   adult intermediate EFL learners in one of the language academies in
   Sirjan. Six classes out of 10 intermediate classes at this language
   academy were chosen randomly. Out of these 90 subjects 60 were selected
   based on the scores of PET. The motivation and critical thinking
   questionnaires were administered to both groups. The results obtained
   from the two groups were compared so as to make sure that both groups
   were homogenous regarding the level of motivation and critical thinking
   prior to the main study. Following that, the treatment was administered.
   The experimental group was taught by the reflective teacher. During this
   class, the teacher drew upon the principles of reflective teaching
   offered by Kumaravadivelu (2006) who asserts that reflective action
   consists of many elements involving an individual's willingness to be
   curious and assertive in order to increase self-awareness,
   self-knowledge, and develop a new understanding of the world. On the
   other hand, the control group was taught by the non-reflective teacher.
   No tangible reflective actions were adopted by the teacher in this
   group. Finally, both groups filled out the motivation and critical
   thinking questionnaires the results of which were used to examine the
   research questions. The results of MANOVA indicated that both critical
   thinking and motivation were significantly affected by reflective
   teaching. However, the critical thinking and motivation of the
   participants were not significantly impacted as a result of reflective
   teaching across age groups. The findings of the present study have
   implications for teacher educators and teachers as they provide a higher
   degree of awareness in terms of the effects of reflective teaching on
   learners' motivation and critical thinking level as two important
   elements in the learning process.}},

Abstract = {{NixCe1-xO2 (where x = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.07) nanoparticles were
   synthesized by soft chemical method and were characterized using X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman, UV-vis
   absorption spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). XRD and
   Raman results indicated the formation of single phase cubic fluorite
   structure for the synthesized nanopartides. Ni dopant induced excessive
   structural changes such as decrease in crystallite size as well as
   lattice constants and enhancement in oxygen vacancies in CeO2 crystal
   structure. These structural variations significantly influenced the
   optical and magnetic properties of CeO2 nanoparticles. The synthesized
   NixCe1-xO2 nanoparticles exhibited room temperature ferromagnetic
   behavior. Ni doping induced effects on the cytotoxicity of CeO2
   nanoparticles were examined against HEK-293 healthy cell line and
   SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cancer cell line. The prepared NixCe1-xO2
   nanoparticles demonstrated differential cytotoxicity. Furthermore,
   anticancer activity of CeO2 nanoparticles observed to be significantly
   enhanced with Ni doping which was found to be strongly correlated with
   the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The prepared
   ferromagnetic NixCe1-xO2 nanoparticles with differential cytotoxic
   nature may be potential for future targeted cancer therapy. (C) 2015

Title = {{Comparison of infection of Citrus tristeza closterovirus in Kinnow
   mandarin (Citrus reticulata) and Mosambi sweet orange (Citrus sinensis)
   in Pakistan}},
Journal = {{CROP PROTECTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{78}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The study was conducted in commercial orchards in three major citrus
   producing regions of Pakistan to compare the infection of Citrus
   tristeza closterovirus (CTV) in leading citrus cultivars. In total, 450
   trees of mandarin (Citrus reticulata cv. Minnow) and sweet orange
   (Citrus sinensis cv. Mosambi) were tested for the presence of CTV using
   double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA).
   The serological analysis showed that the average infection rate in sweet
   orange and mandarin was 33.77\% and 17.33\%, respectively. Serological
   testing of the collected samples from symptomatic trees also revealed
   that CTV was widely distributed in the surveyed citrus orchards.
   Infection rates of CTV in Sargodha, Sahiwal, and Faisalabad districts
   ranged from 23.33 to 40\%, 23.33-36.66\%, and 6.66-23.33\%,
   respectively. Absorbance values (OD405nm) of virus titer in infected
   sweet orange trees ranged from 0.353 to 1.548 and in mandarin from 0311
   to 0.914. CTV titers in citrus cultivars in Sargodha and Faisalabad
   districts fluctuated in different seasons. Absorbance values fell below
   the cut-off point during high summer temperatures and severe winters in
   both mandarins and sweet oranges. The results indicate that selection of
   citrus cultivars may play a significant role in developing integrated
   programs for managing disease caused by Citrus tristeza closterovirus.

Abstract = {{Avian Influenza (AI) vaccines are widely used for mammals and birds in a
   trial to eliminate the Avian Influenza virus (AIV) infection from the
   world. However and up till now the virus is still existed via modulation
   of its antigenic structure to evade the pressure of host immune
   responses. For a complete understanding of the immune responses
   following AI vaccination in chickens, the modulations of the chickens
   humoral immune responses and interferon-alpha signaling pathway, as a
   fundamental part of the innate immune responses, were investigated. In
   our study, we measured the humoral immune response using
   hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA) tests. In addition, chicken interferon-alpha pathway components
   was measured at RNA levels using Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
   following one dose of inactivated H5N1 influenza vaccine at 14 days of
   age. In this study, the protective levels of humoral antibody responses
   were observed at 14, 21 and 28 days following immunization with
   inactivated (Re-1/H5N1) AI vaccine. In the chicken spleen cells, up
   regulation in the chicken interferon-alpha pathway components (MX1 \&
   IRF7) was existed as early as 48 h post vaccination and remained until
   28 days post vaccination at the endogenous state. However, after the
   recall with ex-vivo stimulation, the up regulation was more pronounced
   in the transcriptional factor (IRF7) compared to the antiviral gene
   (MX1) at 28 days post vaccination. So far, from our results it appears
   that the inactivated H5N1 vaccine can trigger the chicken
   interferon-alpha signaling pathway as well as it can elicit protective
   humoral antibody responses.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a general framework to determine the location and
   capacity limits of distributed generation (DG) in the distribution
   system (DS) in order to maintain the traditional protection scheme. The
   impacts of DG penetration on overcurrent protection coordination are
   analyzed including fuse-recloser and recloser-relay. The minimum
   boundary of DG penetration in distribution system and the effects of
   modifying the setting of overcurrent protective devices have been
   investigated. Applying this framework in the developing countries could
   save money and time during integration of DGs to the network on a large
   scale based on country regulation. The proposed framework is implemented
   on a typical 11 kV overhead distribution feeder using Matlab/Simulink
   (R) and Etap (R) simulation packages. Protective device coordination
   under different fault locations and types with and without the DG is
   investigated. The results show the possibility of minimizing network
   power losses and improving voltage profile without replacing the
   existing protection system. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the properties of the ergoregion and the location of the
   curvature singularities for the Kerr black hole distorted by the
   gravitational field of external sources. The particular cases of
   quadrupole and octupole distortion are studied in detail. We also
   investigate the scalar curvature invariants of the horizon and compare
   their behaviour with the case of the isolated Kerr black hole. In a
   certain region of the parameter space the ergoregion consists of a
   compact region encompassing the horizon and a disconnected part
   extending to infinity. The curvature singularities in the domain of
   outer communication, when they exist, are always located on the boundary
   of the ergoregion. We present arguments that they do not lie on the
   compact ergosurface. For quadrupole distortion the compact ergoregion
   size is negatively correlated with the horizon angular momentum when the
   external sources are varied. For octupole distortion infinitely many
   ergoregion configurations can exist for a certain horizon angular
   momentum. For some special cases we can have J(2)/M-4 > 1 and yet avoid

Title = {{Improving homomorphic wavelet estimation by compensating for residual

Journal = {{APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Wavelet estimation is a common step in seismic data processing and
   inversion. Homomorphic wavelet estimation has long utilized as a method
   that uses a seismic stack section with no phase presumption. Forming a
   stack section, normal move-out (NMO) correction must be applied on
   common midpoint (CMP) gathers, although it introduces NMO stretching.
   After stacking, residual of the NMO stretching may affect the stack
   section even after muting the highly stretched zone of the NMO corrected
   CMP gather. Presence of significant residual NMO stretching changes the
   spectral characteristics of data in time direction, by different
   degrees. Considering that in homomorphic process the wavelet is
   estimated based on the spectral characteristics of data, compensating
   for the residual NMO stretching, can improve the accuracy of the
   process. Here, we introduce a fast method of calculating the amount of
   residual NMO stretching and compensating for its effect on wavelet
   estimation. The proposed method needs limited prestack information like
   offsets and velocity function and include no prestack processing. We
   apply the proposed method on synthetic and real datasets and demonstrate
   the improvement of the estimated wavelet.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To examine the performance of screening for Down syndrome
   based on maternal age, fetal nuchal translucency (NT) and different
   combinations of the additional ultrasound parameters: nasal bone (NB),
   tricuspid flow (TF) and ductus venosus (DV).
   Methods Retrospective study at the University of Tuebingen, Germany
   including women who underwent chorionic villous sampling between 2008
   and 2014. Prior to invasive testing, the crown rump length, NT, NB, TF
   and DV were measured. In each case, the added value of the additional
   markers NB, TF and DV were compared with screening for trisomy 21 based
   on maternal age (MA) and NT thickness alone.
   Results A total of 1916 pregnancies met the inclusion criteria,
   including 1823 fetuses with a normal karyotype and 93 with trisomy 21.
   Screening based on MA, fetal NT and one, two and three of the additional
   ultrasound markers resulted in a detection rate of about 80\%, 87\% and
   94\%, respectively for a false positive rate of 3\%.
   Conclusion Detection rates for trisomy 21 in first trimester ultrasound
   screening are substantially higher if all three additional markers
   rather than just one are assessed. (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background User involvement in long-term care has become official policy
   in many countries. Procedural and managerial approaches to user
   involvement have numerous shortcomings in long-term care. What is needed
   is a different approach that is beneficial and tuned to the needs of
   clients and professionals.
   Aim This article presents a care-ethics approach to involvement. We
   illustrate this approach and its practical implementation by examining a
   case example of user involvement in long-term elderly care.
   Methodology This case example is based on an action research project in
   a residential care home in the Netherlands. Seven female clients
   participated in the process, as well as diverse groups of professionals
   from this residential care home.
   Results The clients were concerned about meals, and collectively they
   became empowered and came up with ideas for improving meals.
   Professionals also shared the clients' experiences with meals, first in
   homogeneous groups and then in heterogeneous meetings with the client
   group. This process led to the development of partnership relations
   between clients and professionals.
   Conclusion Our findings suggest that a care-ethics approach to user
   involvement is a means to increase resident empowerment in long-term
   care. Clients and professionals start sharing their experiences and
   values through dialogue, and they develop mutual trust and openness
   while doing so.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic variability of Lotus corniculatus, a common and important
   fodder legume, was studied in relation to habitat type and to species
   diversity at a local level. The study was conducted in Cholomontas
   mountain, northern Greece, at altitudes of 760-870 m. Genetic material
   was selected from four forested, at the edge of forest, and four open
   grassland sites, and was studied with the aid of ISSR molecular markers.
   The plant cover at each study site was measured and the floristic
   composition was estimated. The percentage of graminoides increased in
   grassland sites with high grazing intensity, while the abundance of
   legumes, including L. corniculatus, forbs and woody species, increased
   in forested sites with low grazing intensity. Gene diversity H-E within
   the studied populations of L. corniculatus ranged from 0.167 to 0.213
   and Shannon index (I) from 0.269 to 0.340. Genetic differentiation was
   detected between habitats as well as among the populations in each
   habitat, although it was low, 3\% and 7\% respectively. However, genetic
   differentiation was significant within the populations (90\%). Genetic
   diversity of L. corniculatus was not correlated with species diversity
   (richness and evenness) either within or between populations, while was
   negatively correlated with L. corniculatus abundance. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Iso-alkanes comprise a substantial proportion of petroleum and refined
   products that impact the environment, but their fate is cryptic under
   methanogenic conditions. We investigated methanogenic biodegradation of
   C-7 and C-8 iso-alkanes found in naphtha, specifically 2-methylhexane,
   3-methylhexane, 2-methylheptane, 4-methylheptane and 3-ethylhexane.
   These were incubated as a mixture or individually with enrichment
   cultures derived from oil sands tailings ponds that generate methane
   from naphtha components; substrate depletion and methane production were
   monitored for up to 663 days. 3-Methylhexane and 4-methylheptane were
   degraded both singly and in the mixture, whereas 2-methylhexane and
   2-methylheptane resisted degradation as single substrates but were
   depleted in the iso-alkane mixture, suggesting co-metabolism.
   3-Ethylhexane was degraded neither singly nor with co-substrates.
   Putative metabolites consistent with succinylated C-7 and C-8 were
   detected, suggesting activation by addition of iso-alkanes to fumarate
   and corresponding to detection of alkylsuccinate synthase-like genes.
   454 pyrotag sequencing, cloning and terminal restriction fragment length
   polymorphism of 16S rRNA genes revealed predominance of a novel member
   of the family Peptococcaceae (order Clostridiales) and Archaea
   affiliated with Methanoregula and Methanosaeta. We report here
   isomer-specific metabolism of C-7-C-8 iso-alkanes under methanogenic
   conditions and propose their activation by a novel Peptococcaceae via
   addition to fumarate.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cataract extraction is the most commonly performed
   ophthalmic surgical procedure. There is no registry for documenting
   cataract surgical procedures and the overall risk of its complications
   over time in Israel.
   Objectives: To present trends in the number and type of selected
   parameters associated with cataract surgical procedures in Israel
   between 1990 and 2014.
   Methods: Questionnaires had been sent annually to all surgical centers
   in which cataract surgery was performed in Israel during the study
   period. The trends that were investigated included annual rates,
   surgical sites, surgical techniques, use of an intraocular lens (IOL),
   and type and rates of postoperative endophthalmitis (POE).
   Results: A total of 812,112 cataract surgical procedures were reported
   during the 25 year study period. Responses to the questionnaire
   increased from 75\% in 1990 to 100\% in 2006 onwards. The annual number
   of reported cataract surgical procedures increased from 16,841 (3.5 per
   1000) in 1990 to 57,419 in 2014 (6.9 per 1000), representing an increase
   of 197\%. There was a shift from performing the surgery in the public
   health system to private medical centers. The surgical technique changed
   from predominantly manual extracapsular cataract extraction (56\% in
   1999) to predominantly phacoemulsification (98.7\% in 2014). POE rates
   decreased from 0.25\% in 2002 to 0.028\% in 2014.
   Conclusions: There was a continuous increase in the rate of surgical
   cataract procedures, and more were performed in private medical
   facilities. There was also a major shift towards advanced cataract
   procedures and a decreased rate of POE.}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses the issue of whether large shareholders in
   Victorian public companies were active in the control of companies or
   were simply wealthy rentiers. Using ownership records for 890
   firm-years, we examine the control rights, socio-occupational
   background, and wealth of large shareholders. We find that many large
   shareholders had limited voting rights and neither they nor family
   members were directors. This implies that the majority of public
   companies in the second half of the nineteenth century cannot be
   characterized as family companies and that large shareholders are better
   viewed as wealthy gentlemen capitalists rather than entrepreneurs.}},

Abstract = {{The modeling of bubbles initiated by laser-irradiated nanoparticles is

   alternative approach with a key assumption: the vapor bubble evolves
   adjacent to the nanoparticle. To take into account the irreversible
   evolution, the statistical rate theory was used, thus avoiding the
   introduction of extra ad hoc parameters. Model results agree well with
   published data and our measurements. The only free parameter, the
   thermal boundary conductance, can be obtained by adjusting the model to

Abstract = {{Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) are rare. IMTs of the head
   and neck occur in all age groups, from neonates to old age, with the
   highest incidence occurring in childhood and early adulthood. An IMT has
   been defined as a histologically distinctive lesion of uncertain
   behavior. This article describes an unusual case of IMT mimicking apical
   periodontitis in the mandible of a 42-year-old man. At first
   presentation, the patient showed spontaneous pain and percussion pain at
   teeth \#28 to 30, which continued after initial endodontic treatment.
   Panoramic radiography revealed a radiolucent lesion at the site.
   Cone-beam computed tomographic imaging showed osteolytic lesions,
   suggesting an aggressive neoplasm requiring incisional biopsy.
   Histopathological examination indicated an IMT. The lesion was removed
   en bloc under general anesthesia, and the patient manifested no clinical
   evidence of recurrence for 24 months. Lesions of nonendodontic origin
   should be included in the differential diagnosis of apical
   periodontitis. Every available diagnostic tool should be used to confirm
   the diagnosis. Cone-beam computed tomographic imaging is very helpful
   for differential diagnosis in IMTs mimicking apical periodontitis.}},

   in The New Yorker, strongly support and extend claims made by Michael
   Adams in ``'The Course of a Particular': Names and Narrative in the
   Works of Joseph Mitchell,{''} published in Names 63 (2015). Mitchell
   explicitly describes lists of names as possessing a lyrical quality, so
   that such lists - lyrical inserts - would exhibit prosodic features out
   of tempo with the surrounding narrative. And the fragment of memoir
   titled `` Days in the Branch{''} suggests - in the dissonance between
   topographical and genealogical views of experience and personal history
   - why names had the epistemological, ontological, and finally affective
   significance Adams claimed they had for Mitchell.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminium induced texture (AIT) method has been used for obtaining
   highly textured glass substrate suitable for silicon based thin film
   solar cell technology. Wet etch step parameters of AIT process have been
   varied and effect of different etchants and different etching times on
   morphological and optical properties has been analyzed. The resulting
   morphology features (shape, size distribution, inclination angle) have
   been optimized in order to obtain the best scattering properties. ZnO:Ga
   (GZO) films have been deposited by sputtering technique on AIT-processed
   glass. Two different ZnO surface morphologies have been obtained,
   strongly depending on the underlying glass substrate morphology induced
   by different etching times. Very rough and porous texture (arms 150 nm)
   was obtained on glass etched 2 min showing cauliflower-like structure,
   whereas a softer texture (arms 78 nm) was obtained on glass etched 7 min
   giving wider and smoother U-shaped craters. The effect of different
   glass textures on optical confinement has been tested in amorphous
   silicon based p-i-n devices. Devices fabricated on GZO/high textured
   glass showed a quantum efficiency enhancement due to both an effective
   light trapping phenomenon and an effective anti-reflective optical
   behaviour. Short etching time produce smaller cavities (<1 mu m) with
   deep U-shape characterized by high roughness, high inclination angle and
   low autocorrelation length. This surface morphology promoted a large
   light scattering phenomenon, as evidenced by haze value and by angular
   resolved scattering (ARS) behaviour, into a large range of diffraction
   angles, giving high probability of effective light trapping inside a PV
   device. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Color is a visible pollutant and the presence of even minute amounts of
   coloring substance makes it undesirable due to its appearance. The
   removal of color from dye-bearing effluents is a major problem due to
   the difficulty in treating such wastewaters by conventional treatment
   methods. The most commonly used methods for color removal are biological
   oxidation and chemical precipitation. However, these processes are
   effective and economic only in the case where the solute concentrations
   are relatively high. Most industries use dyes and pigments to color
   their products. The presence of dyes in effluents is a major concern due
   to its adverse effect on various forms of life. The discharge of dyes in
   the environment is a matter of concern for both toxicological and
   esthetical reasons. It is evident from a literature survey of about 283
   recently published papers that low-cost adsorbents have demonstrated
   outstanding removal capabilities for dye removal and the optimal
   equilibrium time of various dyes with different charcoal adsorbents from
   agricultural residues is between 4 and 5 h. Maximum adsorptions of
   acidic dyes were obtained from the solutions with pH 8-10. The
   challenges and future prospects are discussed to provide a better
   framework for a safer and cleaner environment. (C) 2015 Published by

Journal = {{HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1751-1771}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. To assess whether, 5 years into the HITECH programs, national
   data reflect a consistent relationship between EHR adoption and hospital
   outcomes across three important dimensions of hospital performance.
   Data Sources/Study Setting. Secondary data from the American Hospital
   Association and CMS (Hospital Compare and EHR Incentive Programs) for
   nonfederal, acute-care hospitals (2009-2012).
   Study Design. We examined the relationship between EHR adoption and
   three hospital outcomes (process adherence, patient satisfaction,
   efficiency) using ordinary least squares models with hospital fixed
   effects. Time-related effects were assessed through comparing the impact
   of EHR adoption pre (2008/2009) versus post (2010/2011) meaningful use
   and by meaningful use attestation cohort (2011, 2012, 2013, Never). We
   used a continuous measure of hospital EHR adoption based on the
   proportion of electronic functions implemented.
   Data Collection/Extraction Methods. We created a panel dataset with
   hospital-year observations.
   Principal Findings. Higher levels of EHR adoption were associated with
   better performance on process adherence (0.147; p <.001) and patient
   satisfaction (0.118; p <.001), but not efficiency (0.01; p =.78). For
   all three outcomes, there was a stronger, positive relationship between
   EHR adoption and performance in 2010/2011 compared to 2008/2009. We
   found mixed results based on meaningful use attestation cohort.
   Conclusions. Performance gains associated with EHR adoption are apparent
   in more recent years. The large national investment in EHRs appears to
   be delivering more consistent benefits than indicated by earlier
   national studies.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Increasing capability of MR imaging via applying DWI gives
   additional information about the functional state of tissues with high
   potentials due to lacking radiation exposure and contrast hazards.
   Application included evaluation of gastrointestinal tumors and follow-up
   to assess response to treatment. In IBD, DWI is useful in highlighting
   bowel segments of active disease and the purpose of this study is to
   evaluate role of DWI-MRI in neoplastic and inflammatory small bowel
   diseases.
   Materials and methods: Prospective study included 50 patients subjected
   to MRI enterography using 1.5 T closed magnet followed with DWI and then
   ADC values were estimated. Ileo-colonoscopy and biopsy were done and
   pathological data were reviewed.
   Results: Twenty-four males and 26 females with small bowel lesions were
   divided into two groups, 26 neoplastic (5 benign, 21 malignant) and 24
   inflammatory lesions (48\%). Mean ADC value of inflamed bowel was 1.59
   +/- 0.45 x 10 (3) mm(2)/s, compared to 2.74 +/- 0.68 x 10 (3) mm(2)/s in
   normal bowel. ADC value of neoplastic lesions ranged from 0.6 to 1.5 and
   non-neoplastic lesions from 1.1 to 2. ADC value of lymphoma ranged from
   0.6 to 0.7 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s and adenocarcinomas from 0.8 to 1.0 x 10 (3)
   mm(2)/s.
   Conclusion: DWI is an important complementary sequence with the routine
   MRI of the small bowel helping in lesion characterization and
   differentiation of pathology. (C) 2015 The Authors. The Egyptian Society

   regarding the perception of the philosophical text inside the research

   inquiry and understanding. We can notice that, the institutional
   situation of philosophy is definitely not a good one, because in
   nowadays universities it lost its definitory role in a man's spiritual
   evolution. One of the aspects that leaded to this unfortunate situation
   has to do with the constantly depreciation of what we call reflection,
   theoretical thinking, or even vision. Anyway, this problem is strictly

Abstract = {{The cotton mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Homoptera:
   Pseudococcidae) has gained recognition as a key pest due to its invasive
   nature throughout the world. The P. solenopsis has a wide range of host
   plants and damages the cotton crop in various parts of the world. In
   view of the economic importance of this pest, a study on selection,
   inheritance and mechanism of spinosad resistance was conducted on P.
   solenopsis. Selection of field collected P. solenopsis for seven
   generations with spinosad resulted in a high resistance ratio of
   282.45-fold. Genetic studies of spinosad resistance in P. solenopsis
   indicated that maternal effects are not involved in spinosad resistance;
   and resistance development is an autosomal and incompletely dominant
   trait. The number of genes involved in spinosad resistance was
   determined to be more than one, suggesting that resistance is controlled
   by multiple loci. The realized heritability (h (2)) value for spinosad
   resistance was 0.94. Synergism bioassays of spinosad with piperonyl
   butoxide and S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate showed that spinosad
   resistance in P. solenopsis could be due to esterase only. The study
   provides the basic information for implementation of effective
   resistance management strategies to control P. solenopsis.}},

Abstract = {{Non-invasive automatic crack detection and characterization of packaged
   ceramic tiles is an integral part of industrial processes.
   Inefficiencies in quality monitoring of packaged tiles is quite
   unbearable in terms of manufacturing, time, money, and consumer
   satisfaction. As a result, there is an increasing demand for the use of
   smart visual inspection systems to ensure the high quality of products
   in the manufacturing line. Although different techniques have been
   proposed by various researchers, accurate monitoring of the packaged
   ceramic tiles remains particularly challenging in order to cut down
   number of false alarms, which could, otherwise, result in fiscal or
   reputation loss to the company. Therefore, this paper explores the
   possibility of application of millimeter wave-based non-invasive crack
   detection of packaged ceramic tiles using an ingeniously designed V band
   (60 GHz) imaging radar system. A statistics-based adaptive algorithm has
   been proposed for crack detection of packaged ceramic tiles with the
   main consideration of achieving minimal false alarm. A total of 40
   different ceramic tiles with different crack and non-crack
   configurations were considered. The proposed algorithm was tested and
   satisfactory performance has been achieved.}},

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the impact of different schooling dimensions
   (primary, secondary and tertiary) on the intensity of intra-state
   conflicts in 25 African states during the period 1989-2008. It uses
   fixed-effects and Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) estimators in an
   annualized panel data framework. Parameter estimates suggest the
   following (1) primary schooling broadly mitigates conflicts in Africa.
   However, in environments with high natural resource rents, it could
   ignite conflicts; (2) there is evidence, although not overwhelming, that
   secondary schooling potentially drives conflicts in Africa. There is
   also evidence that urbanization potentially drives conflicts in Africa.
   However, although secondary schooling and urbanization potentially
   drives conflicts, in environments where secondary schooling
   (urbanization) is high, urbanization (secondary schooling) mitigates
   conflicts; (3) there is no evidence of a strong direct positive impact
   of tertiary education on conflicts and conditioning on tertiary
   schooling, income inequality potentially drives conflicts in African
   states. However, in contexts where income inequality (tertiary
   schooling) is high, tertiary schooling (inequality) mitigates conflict.
   Two important policy implications follow from this study. First, in
   contexts where income inequality is high (for instance, in South
   Africa), governments should strive to foster tertiary education in order
   to reduce conflict. Second, where urbanization rates are high, they
   should foster both secondary and tertiary education. This study
   contributes to existing knowledge by clearly demonstrating the utility
   of distinguishing between different educational dimensions and the
   contexts wherein they matter for conflict mitigation in Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Up to now there have only been marginal data in the elderly in need of
   care regarding spatiotemporal gait parameters during single (ST) and
   dual tasking (DT).
   The aim of this study was to allocate data for gait speed, cadence and
   stride length cycle variability in the elderly in need of care and in
   young adults during ST and DT, to compare the two groups and to
   demonstrate the impact of ST and DT on gait parameters.
   This cross-sectional study investigated a group of 16 young healthy
   adults (mean age 23.0 +/- 2.5 years) and a group of 16 elderly persons
   in need of care (mean age 85.5 +/- 0.6 years). The RehaWatchA (R) system
   was used to collect the spatiotemporal gait parameters cadence, speed
   and stride length. The participants completed four different
   measurements during normal walking and fast walking during ST and DT
   over a walking distance of 20 m. The Wilcoxon rank sum test and
   Whitney-U test were used for statistical analysis.
   Gait speed (ST and DT: p < 0.001), cadence (ST and DT: p < 0.001) and
   gait variability (ST: p = 0.007, DT: p = 0.003) were significantly
   reduced in the elderly in need of care group compared to the young
   group. The gait speed in the elderly in need of care group decreased
   from normal to fast walking (ST = -aEuro parts per thousand 2.8 \%, DT =
   -aEuro parts per thousand 12.2 \%) compared to the young group (ST =
   31.5 \%, DT = 25.2 \%).
   The results of this study are comparable with the results of existing
   studies, which investigated falling and non-falling participants.
   Elderly people in need of care cannot increase the normal gait speed.}},

Journal = {{BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{As indicated by the UNESCO-sCBD Florence Declaration on biocultural
   diversity the current state of biological and cultural diversity results
   from the combination of historical and on-going processes. The
   Declaration indicates the landscape level, particularly the rural
   landscape, as an appropriate dimension for understanding and applying
   this concept. The spatial component of biological diversity is of
   crucial importance for biodiversity, but is also one of the most
   interesting scientific perspective to understand biocultural diversity
   and the relationships with human influence. Historical landscapes still
   applying traditional agricultural practices are very good examples of
   how man has been able to adapt to difficult and often extreme,
   environmental conditions, preserving biodiversity. Species and their
   habitats have adapted to landscapes, changing their features, therefore
   a biocultural approach is probably best suited to understand and manage
   most of the biodiversity existing in landscape characterized by a long
   history of human influence. Some important international programs, such
   as UNESCO World Heritage List (WHL) for Cultural Landscapes and FAO
   Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) are protecting
   rural landscapes. However, there is the need to introduce the
   biocultural diversity associated to the landscape mosaic in their
   conservation strategies. In order to study and compare biocultural
   diversity at landscape level, three case studies were selected in three
   different continents: Northern Africa (Morocco), Caribbean (Cuba) and
   Southern Europe (Italy). The landscape structure has been studied also
   to understand possible common features among areas located in very
   different social and environmental conditions, but all of them resulting
   from centuries of human influence. Despite these differences, the three
   areas have in common a high complexity and fragmentation of the mosaic
   that the study intended to highlight as an important aspect of
   biocultural diversity. In a comparative perspective, the three areas all
   display a prevalence of farmland over woodland and a relatively small
   average area of farmed plots: 0.48 ha in Viales, 0.29 ha in the Itria
   valley, and 0.09 ha in Telouet, with an average patch size of 0.42 ha
   and an average agricultural patch size of 0.28 ha. The Moroccan site has
   by far the finest-grained landscape mesh, due to the characteristics of
   its irrigated fields and historical farming practices. According to this
   study, complex landscape mosaics represent a common feature of many
   traditional landscapes around the world, where socioeconomic needs
   rather than the environmental features, seem to be the driving factors.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated the toxic effects of individual, combined
   (binary and ternary) exposure to lead, arsenic and mercury on, (i)
   oxidative stress (ii) alterations in brain biogenic amines and (iii)
   tissue metals concentration. Rats were exposed to lead, arsenic and
   mercury either individually (30 ppm in drinking water), various binary
   (15 ppm each) or ternary combination (10 ppm each) for a period of 6
   months. Lead + arsenic and lead + arsenic + mercury co-exposure led to a
   significant increase in the blood oxidative stress. Mercury + arsenic
   and lead + arsenic + mercury co-exposure produced a more pronounced
   hepatotoxicity while, lead + arsenic and lead + arsenic + mercury
   produced a significant increase in hepatic oxidative stress. Kidney
   oxidative stress and changes in brain biogenic amines were more
   prominent in animals exposed to three metals. Accumulation of three
   metals did not exhibit the pattern as in the case of oxidative stress.
   Exposure to two toxic metals also showed less accumulation of toxic
   metals suggesting possible antagonism. The present study thus provides
   some interesting observations on the interaction between lead, arsenic
   and mercury. Co-exposure to lead + arsenic + mercury led to a more
   pronounced increase in oxidative stress in liver and kidneys compared to
   other exposed groups. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{IRC + 10216 is a circumstellar envelope around a carbon-rich evolved
   star which contains a large variety of molecules. According to
   interferometric observations, molecules are distributed either
   concentrated around the central star or as a hollow shell with a radius
   of similar to 15 `' We present ALMA Cycle 0 band 6 observations of the J
   = 14 - 13 rotational transition of CH3CN in IRC + 10216, obtained with
   an angular resolution of 0 `'.76. x. 0 `'.61. The bulk of the emission
   is distributed as a hollow shell located at just similar to 2 `' from
   the star, with a void of emission in the central region up to a radius
   of similar to 1 `'. This spatial distribution is markedly different from
   those found to date in this source for other molecules. Our analysis
   indicates that methyl cyanide is not formed in either the stellar
   photosphere or far in the outer envelope, but at radial distances as
   short as 1 `'-2 `', reaching a maximum abundance of similar to 0.02
   molecules cm(-3) at 2 `' from the star. Standard chemical models of IRC
   + 10216 predict that the bulk of CH3CN molecules should be present at a
   radius of similar to 15 `' where other species such as polyyne radicals
   and cyanopolyynes are observed, with an additional inner component
   within 1 `' from the star. The non-uniform structure of the
   circumstellar envelope and grain surface processes are discussed as
   possible causes of the peculiar distribution of methyl cyanide in IRC +
   10216.}},

Abstract = {{This study considered the shear buckling behavior of a web panel with
   pitting and through-thickness corrosion damage in the diagonal tension
   field. Shear loading tests were conducted on three large-scale specimens
   under different corrosion damage conditions to compare their shear
   buckling behaviors. To consider corrosion damage, artificial pitting
   holes and artificial rectangular sectional damage were induced in the
   lower web panel of each specimen. Finite element (FE) analysis was also
   performed to evaluate the shear buckling strength and post-shear
   buckling behavior. From shear buckling test results, the specimen with
   artificial pitting corrosion damage exhibited similar shear buckling
   behavior to the specimen without corrosion damage. However, for the
   shear buckling specimen with artificial rectangular sectional damage,
   its shear buckling behavior and shear failure mode changed with a
   slightly distorted diagonal tension band, and its shear buckling
   strength and critical buckling load significantly decreased relative to
   the shear buckling specimen with pitting corrosion. Therefore, the
   region of corrosion damage should be examined with the corrosion level
   of the web panel because corrosion pitting or section loss of the web
   panel can affect the shear buckling behavior when it extends to the
   critical corrosion damage level in the diagonal tension field. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Visibility is one of the most important design elements in vehicle
   design because drivers perceive most driving-related information through
   vision. In this study, we redefine the area of vehicle forward
   visibility based on the driver visibility angle according to information
   susceptibility. In addition, we present a forward visibility assessment
   tool that employs the driver gaze ratio obtained from the tracking
   driver gaze and weighted value numbers. Experimental vehicles were
   selected from a group of domestic and foreign vehicles; those with
   similar characteristics were grouped together. Twenty-five adult
   subjects participated in this study. The vehicle forward visibility was
   assessed using the sensibility assessment method. It was then compared
   with results of the visibility assessment tool. The area of the forward
   visibility could be defined and classified into effective, optimal,
   inducible, and auxiliary visibility areas. Accordingly, the forward
   visibility assessment tool was developed. The results of this study
   demonstrate the high correlation and reliability between the results of
   the forward visibility assessment tool and subjective sensibility
   assessment. The proposed method of evaluating vehicle forward visibility
   is suggested for application to the vehicle design process.}},

Abstract = {{Endothelial apoptosis triggered by oxidized low-density lipoprotein
   (oxLDL) can accelerate the progression of endothelial dysfunction
   atherosclerosis. Phosphocreatine (PCr) is a natural compound, which has
   been used in cardiac disease and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However,
   its protective effects on atherosclerosis and its mechanism have not
   been clarified. In the present study, we investigated the anti-apoptotic
   effect of phosphocreatine in human umbilical vein endothelial cells
   (HUVECs) exposed to oxLDL and explored the possible mechanisms. HUVECs
   were pre-treated with 10-30 mM PCr and then stimulated with oxLDL. Cell
   morphology, cytotoxicity and apoptosis were evaluated by light
   microscopy, CCK assay, and flow cytometry respectively. Levels of Bax,
   Bcl-2, protein expression of protein kinase B (Akt), eNOS and caspase
   activities were assessed by Western blotting. Reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured with
   fluorescent probes. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA),
   nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) contents were
   determined by spectrophotometer. Our results showed that PCr
   dose-dependently prevented oxLDL associated HUVEC cytotoxicity and
   apoptotic biochemical changes such as loss of MMP, LDH and MDA leakage
   and loss of SOD, decrease of Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio, activation of
   caspase-3 and 9, and ROS generation. In addition, the antiapoptotic
   effect of PCr was partially inhibited by a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) and
   also enhanced p-Akt/Akt protein ratio, eNOS activation and NO
   production. In conclusion, our data show that the inhibition of
   oxLDL-induced endothelial apoptosis by PCr is due, at least in part to
   its anti-oxidant activity and its ability to modulate the PI3K/Akt/eNOS
   signaling pathway.}},

Title = {{Geographic Variation in Rosiglitazone Use Surrounding FDA Warnings in
   the Department of Veterans Affairs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE \& SPECIALTY PHARMACY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Geographic variation in the use of prescription drugs,
   particularly those deemed harmful by the FDA, may lead to variation in
   patient exposure to adverse drug events. One such drug is the
   glucose-lowering drug rosiglitazone, for which the FDA issued a safety
   alert on May 21, 2007, following the publication of a meta-analysis that
   suggested a 43\% increase in the risk of myocardial infarction with the
   use of rosiglitazone. This alert was followed by a black box warning on
   August 14, 2007, that was updated 3 months later. While large declines
   have been documented in rosiglitazone use in clinical practice, little
   is known about how the use of rosiglitazone and other glucose-lowering
   drugs varied within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), surrounding
   the FDA alerts. Understanding this variation within integrated health
   care systems is essential to formulating policies that enhance patient
   protection and quality of care.
   OBJECTIVE: To document variation in the use of rosiglitazone and other
   glucose lowering drugs across 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks
   (VISNs).
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of drug use patterns for
   all major diabetes drugs in a national cohort of 550,550 veterans with
   diabetes from 2003 to 2008. This included the time periods when
   rosiglitazone was added to (November 2003) and removed from (October
   2007) the VA national formulary (VANF). We employed multivariable
   logistic regression models to statistically estimate the association
   between a patient's location and the patient's odds of using
   rosiglitazone.
   RESULTS: Aggregate rosiglitazone use increased monotonically from 7.7\%,
   in the quarter it was added to the VANF (November 4, 2003), to a peak of
   15.3\% in the quarter when the FDA issued the safety alert.
   Rosiglitazone use decreased sharply afterwards, reaching 3.4\% by the
   end of the study period (September 30, 2008). The use of pioglitazone,
   another glucose lowering drug in the same class as rosiglitazone, was
   low when the FDA issued the safety alert (0.4\%) but increased sharply
   afterwards, reaching 3.6\% by the end of the study period. Insulin use
   increased monotonically; metformin use remained relatively flat; and
   sulfonylurea use exhibited a general declining trend throughout the
   study period. Statistically significant geographic variation was
   observed in rosiglitazone use throughout the study period. The
   prevalence range, defined as the range of minimum to maximum use across
   VISNs was 3.7\%-12.4\% in the first quarter (January 1 to March 31,
   2003); 1.0\%-5.5\% in the last quarter of study period (July 1 to
   September 30, 2008); and reached a peak of 9.6\%-25.5\% in the quarter
   when the FDA safety alert was issued (April 1 to March 31, 2007). In 5
   VISNs, peak rosiglitazone use occurred before the FDA issued the safety
   alert. The odds ratio of using rosiglitazone in a given VISN varied from
   0.55 (95\% CI=0.52-0.59; VISN 10) to 1.58 (95\% CI=1.50-1.66; VISN 15),
   with VISN 1 being the reference region. The variation was higher in the
   periods after the FDA issued the safety alert. Much less variation was
   observed in the use of pioglitazone, metformin, sulfonylurea, and
   insulin.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results show statistically significant variation in the
   way VISNs within the VA responded to the FDA alerts, suggesting a need
   for mechanisms that disseminate information and guidelines for drug use
   in a consistent and reliable manner. Further study of regions that
   adopted ideal practices earlier may provide lessons for regional
   leadership and practice culture within integrated health care systems.

Abstract = {{Objectives: Asian Americans (AA) are the fastest growing minority
   population in the United States. Leading AA scholars have highlighted
   the unmet service needs and the necessity to investigate subgroup
   variations in the mental health of AAs. This study addressed a research
   gap of whether racial and ethnic identity (REI) in three AA subgroups
   (Chinese, Filipino, and Vietnamese) consistently protects against major
   depressive disorder (MDD), counteracting the deleterious role of
   discrimination. Method: Using the National Latino and Asian American
   Study (NLAAS), we explored the varying and incremental predictive values
   of REI, above and beyond the effects of known demographic and
   acculturation predictors, alongside other potentially protective
   factors. Results: In three sets of two-step logistic regressions, REI
   had an inverse relationship with MDD in the Filipino subgroup only but a
   positive association in the Chinese subgroup. The damaging role of
   negative REI moderated the effect of discrimination. The longest stay in
   the United States and discrimination predicted a higher likelihood of a
   MDD diagnosis in the Filipino subgroup. Social support contributed to
   the lower odds of MDD in Chinese and Vietnamese subgroups, had lower
   odds of having MDD, and religious attendance may act as a protective
   factor in the Vietnamese subgroup. Conclusion: Our findings do not
   reinforce uniform protection of REI but lend partial support for two
   underlying rationales. Based on cultural psychologists' framework,
   inconsistent findings are interpreted within the sociocultural contexts
   of the 3 subgroups. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: No epidemiological data on halitosis are available from Italy.
   Thus, the aim of this population-based cross-sectional study was to
   estimate the prevalence of halitosis in an urban adult population from
   North Italy and to explore related oral risk indicators.
   Materials and Methods: The survey used a two-stage probability sampling
   method to collect a representative sample of inhabitants, aged between
   20 and 75 years, in the city of Turin. Seven hundred and forty-four
   adults were clinically examined (47\% of sampled subjects) for oral
   malodor and periodontal conditions. Using a standardized questionnaire
   social, health and halitosis-related parameters were collected. Logistic
   models with interaction terms between tongue coating scores (TCS) and
   periodontal status were used to explore halitosis risk indicators.
   Results: The prevalence estimate of halitosis according to the
   organoleptic assessment was 53.51\% (95\% CI: 48.55-58.50). A
   statistically significant correlation was found between organoleptic and
   gas chromatography measurements (p < 0.0001). Stronger associations
   between halitosis and periodontitis were observed in people having
   higher TCS: adjusted odds ratio considering low and high TCS in
   individuals with severe periodontitis were 2.95 and 20.77 (p = 0.003).
   Conclusions: Due to the high prevalence of halitosis in the Turin
   population, its diagnosis and management should be incorporated in
   comprehensive dental care.}},

Abstract = {{Employing a dataset of 658 large storm-events from 15 South Korean
   watersheds (48.6-249.63 km(2)), this study established the initial
   abstraction (I-a) as 2\% of the rainfall amount (obtained based on three
   different scenarios), instead of the originally assumed 20\% of the
   maximum potential retention (S) in the Soil Conservation Service Curve
   Number (SCS-CN) model. After investigating 8 different models, including
   the original SCS-CN and its inspired modified models, it was found that
   lower values of the initial abstraction coefficient (lambda) exhibited
   better runoff estimation than the fixed lambda (=0.2) as lower lambda <
   0.2 was recommended by researchers and supported by this work for CN
   values calculated from observed storm-events. To reduce errors in runoff
   estimation, CNs should be calibrated using observed rainfall-runoff data
   from regional watersheds. The proposed model, which incorporates the
   newly suggested initial abstraction based on rainfall-runoff rank-order
   data, outperformed in 14 out of 15 watersheds. Using the
   optimized/calculated CN values, the proposed model ranked first (as
   best) based on the evaluation of three different performance indices,
   followed by the model of Hawkins et al. (2002), one of the models of the
   Mishra and Singh, and the original SCS-CN model respectively. Owing to a
   significant degree of agreement between the observed and calculated
   runoff, the proposed model is recommended for field applications in this
   study area. (C) 2014 International Association for Hydro-environment

Abstract = {{Humic acid is an antioxidant molecule used in agriculture and livestock
   breeding, as well as in medicine. Our aim was to investigate the
   potential renoprotective effects of humic acid in a renal ischemia
   reperfusion model. Twenty-one rats were randomly divided into three
   equal groups. Intraperitoneal serum or humic acid was injected at 1, 12,
   and 24 h. Non-ischemic group I was evaluated as sham. The left renal
   artery was clamped in serum (group II) and intraperitoneal humic acid
   (group III) to subject to left renal ischemic reperfusion procedure.
   Ischemia and reperfusion time was 60 min for each. Total antioxidant
   status, total oxidative status, oxidative stress index, and
   ischemia-modified albumin levels were analyzed biochemically from the
   serum samples. Kidneys were evaluated histopatologically and
   immunohistochemically. Biochemical results showed that total oxidative
   status, ischemia-modified albumin, and oxidative stress index levels
   were significantly decreased, but total antioxidant status was increased
   in the humic acid group (III) compared with the ischemia group (II) On
   histopathological examination, renal tubular dilatation, tubular cell
   damage and necrosis, dilatation of Bowman's capsule, hyaline casts, and
   tubular cell spillage were decreased in the humic acid group (III)
   compared with the ischemia group (II). Immunohistochemical results
   showed that apoptosis was deteriorated in group III. Renal ischemia
   reperfusion injury was attenuated by humic acid administration. These
   observations indicate that humic acid may have a potential therapeutic
   effect on renal ischemia reperfusion injury by preventing oxidative
   stress.}},

Volume = {{69}},

Abstract = {{How honest or reliable signaling can evolve and be maintained has been a
   major question in evolutionary biology. The question is especially
   puzzling for a particular class of signals used in aggressive
   interactions: threat signals. Here, we report a study on song sparrows
   (Melospiza melodia) in which we assayed males with playbacks on their
   territories to quantify their aggressiveness (flights and close
   proximity) and aggressive signaling levels (rates of soft song, a
   close-range signal reliably predicting attack) and asked whether these
   traits affect individuals' survival on territory. We found that the
   effect of aggressive signaling via soft song interacted with aggressive
   behaviors such that there was a negative correlational selection: among
   males with low aggression, those males that signaled at higher levels
   (over-signalers) had higher survival whereas among males with high
   aggression those that signaled at low levels (under-signalers) survived
   longer. In other words, males that deviate from reliable signaling have
   a survival advantage. These results, along with previous research that
   suggested most of the deviation from reliable signaling in this system
   is in the form of under-signaling (high-aggression males signaling at
   low levels) pose a puzzle for future research on how this reliable
   signaling system is maintained.}},

Abstract = {{The reactions of ZnCl2 and cysteamine hydrochloride (Cym-H center dot

   cis-1,2-diaminocyclohxane (dach), a diamine complex, {[}Zn(dach)Cl-2]
   (2) was obtained. The compounds, 1 and 2 were characterized by elemental
   analysis, IR and NMR (H-1 and C-13) spectroscopy. The crystal structure
   of 1 was determined by X-ray crystallography. The structure of 1 shows
   that the complex exists in the form of a tetranuclear molecule in which
   zinc atoms are bridged by S atoms of Cym forming an eight-membered ring.
   The complex consists of two crystallographically independent Zn(II)
   ions. Zn1 and symmetry related ion are coordinated with two sulfur atoms
   and two nitrogen atoms of Cym, while Zn2 and symmetry related ion
   exhibit a ZnS2Cl2 setup. In both coordination environments zinc atom
   adopts a distorted tetrahedral geometry. Antimicrobial activities of the
   complex 1 were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration and the
   results showed that the complex exhibited remarkable activities against
   gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, P. aeruginosa) and yeasts (C. albicans,
   S. cerevisiae).}},

Abstract = {{Background: Health care faces challenges due to complications,
   inefficiencies and other concerns that threaten the safety of patients.
   Aim: The purpose of his study was to identify causes of complications
   encountered after administration of local anaesthesia for dental and
   oral surgical procedures and to reduce the incidence of complications by
   introduction of six sigma methodology.
   Materials and Methods: DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and
   Control) process of Six Sigma was taken into consideration to reduce the
   incidence of complications encountered after administration of local
   anaesthesia injections for dental and oral surgical procedures using
   failure mode and effect analysis. Pareto analysis was taken into
   consideration to analyse the most recurring complications. Paired
   z-sample test using Minitab Statistical Inference and Fisher's exact
   test was used to statistically analyse the obtained data. The p-value
   <0.05 was considered as significant value.
   Results: Total 54 systemic and 62 local complications occurred during
   three months of analyse and measure phase. Syncope, failure of
   anaesthesia, trismus, auto mordeduras and pain at injection site was
   found to be most recurring complications. Cumulative defective
   percentage was 7.99 in case of pre-improved data and decreased to 4.58
   in the control phase. Estimate for difference was 0.0341228 and 95\%
   lower bound for difference was 0.0193966. p-value was found to be highly
   significant with p=0.000.
   Conclusion: The application of six sigma improvement methodology in
   healthcare tends to deliver consistently better results to the patients
   as well as hospitals and results in better patient compliance as well as
   satisfaction.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pilots are exposed to various physical and hemodynamic
   stresses during flight. Aortic dilatation may be one of the important
   consequences of flight-related stress. In this study, we evaluated
   whether or not variation in aortic diameter was associated with the type
   of aircraft and the age of pilots. Materials and Methods: Medical
   records of 87 jet aircraft pilots (JP) (mean age = 30.0 +/- 7.0 years)
   and 65 non-jet aircraft pilots (NJP) (mean age = 32.63 +/- 5.7) were
   reviewed. Echocardiographic diameters of the aortic sinus (AoS) and
   ascending aorta (AoAsc) were measured using standard echo probe
   positions. Results: Aortic diameters were not statistically different
   between JP and NJP. Regression analysis revealed that the diameters of
   the AoS (R = 0.484, R-2 = 0.234, p < 0.001) and AoAsc (R = 0.514, R-2 =
   0.264, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with age in the JP
   group. Whereas, there was not any relationship found between age and the
   diameters of the AoS and AoAsc in the NJP group. Conclusion: Jet pilots
   had aortic enlargement as they became older in contrast to the NJP
   group. Although the aortic diameters were not within the critical ranges
   in the JP group, these results could suggest that flight-related
   stresses might result in acute aortic syndromes in the long term.}},

Abstract = {{Comparative anatomy of two Artocarpus species was carried out to
   identify and describe anatomical characters in search of distinctive
   characters that could possibly be used to delimit the two taxa.
   Transverse, tangential and radial longitudinal sections and macerated
   samples of the stem and root wood were prepared onto microscopic slides.
   Epidermal peels and cleared leaves of the two species were made.
   Characteristic similarity disparity in the tissues arrangement as well
   as cell inclusions were noted for description and delimitation. The two
   Artocarpus species studied had essentially the same anatomical features;
   however, there were characters that seem to be taxon specific. The study
   revealed that at the transverse plane of the root, A. communis (J. R. \&
   G. Forster) have predominantly solitary vessel, whereas pore multiple
   was predominant in A. altilis (Parkinson) Fosberg. Tyloses in vessels of
   the root were more frequent in A. communis than in A. altilis. In the
   cleared leaves, venation pattern also revealed some differences in the
   two species. The veins of A. communis were more or less straight and
   that of A. altilis were undulating especially in the secondary veins.
   Prismatic crystals were found in the cortex of the petiole in A.
   communis but not in A. altilis. Similarly, tannins were found in the
   root bark of A. communis but not in A. altilis. Trichomes and scales
   were more abundant in A. communis than in A. altilis. In the transverse
   section of the leaves, abaxial and adaxial epidermis were uniseriate in
   A. communis but only the abaxial epidermis was uniseriate in A. altilis,
   the adaxial epidermis was made up of 2 to 3 layers of cells. The
   epidermal cells in A. communis were predominantly short cylindrical
   shaped cells but were not so in A. altilis.}},

Abstract = {{Single-cell dry mass measurement is used in biology to follow cell
   cycle, to address effects of drugs, or to investigate cell metabolism.
   Quantitative phase imaging technique with quadriwave lateral shearing
   interferometry (QWLSI) allows measuring cell dry mass. The technique is
   very simple to set up, as it is integrated in a camera-like instrument.
   It simply plugs onto a standard microscope and uses a white light
   illumination source. Its working principle is first explained, from
   image acquisition to automated segmentation algorithm and dry mass
   quantification. Metrology of the whole process, including its
   sensitivity, repeatability, reliability, sources of error, over
   different kinds of samples and under different experimental conditions,
   is developed. We show that there is no influence of magnification or
   spatial light coherence on dry mass measurement; effect of defocus is
   more critical but can be calibrated. As a consequence, QWLSI is a
   well-suited technique for fast, simple, and reliable cell dry mass
   study, especially for live cells. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{Traditional adjudication which was presided over by traditional rulers
   and religious priests and backed by supernatural entities lost grounds
   to the constitutional courts established by the colonial authorities
   under the laws of the Gold Coast. The Native Jurisdiction Ordinance of
   1883 instituted by the colonial administration curtailed the judicial
   powers of the traditional authority to settling minor issues. Although
   the Native Jurisdiction Ordinance also banned trial by ordeal which was
   believed to be controlled by supernatural forces, the phenomenon has not
   only assumed different dimensions but is also on the ascendency in
   contemporary times. This work, utilizes qualitative methods to explore
   the search for justice and the process of adjudication in troxovi
   shrines, the types of cases that have ``fallen within the
   jurisdiction{''} of the shrines through the prism of rational choice
   theory. It is argued that aggrieved persons patronize the troxovi
   shrines due to their perceived want of the truth in constitutional
   courts, the absence of bribery and corruption since any attempt at
   corruption by any shrine operative attract immediate supernatural
   sanction. It is apparent that justice in the troxovi shrines will
   continue as long as justice continues to elude the aggrieved in the
   constitutionally mandated courts.}},

Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{605-625}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article provides a critique of the concept of reflexivity in social
   theory today and argues against the tendency to define agency
   exclusively in terms of reflexivity. Margaret Archer, in particular, is
   highlighted as a key proponent of this thesis. Archer argues that late
   modernity is characterized by reflexivity but, in our view, this
   position neglects the impact of more enduring aspects of agency, such as
   the routinization of social life and the role of the taken-for-granted.
   These concepts were pivotal to Bourdieu and Giddens' theorization of
   everyday life and action and to Foucault's understanding of technologies
   of the self. We offer Bourdieu's habitus as a more nuanced approach to
   theorizing agency, and provide an alternative account of reflexivity.
   Whilst accepting that reflexivity is a core aspect of agency, we argue
   that it operates to a backdrop of the routinization of social life and
   operates from within and not outside of habitus. We highlight the role
   of the breach in reflexivity, suggesting that it opens up a critical
   window for agents to initiate change. The article suggests caution in
   over-ascribing reflexivity to agency, instead arguing that achieving
   reflexivity and change is a difficult and fraught process, which has
   emotional and moral consequences. The effect of this is that people
   often prefer the status quo, rather than to risk change and uncertainty.}},

Title = {{Characterization of almond processing residues from the Central Valley
   of California for thermal conversion}},
Journal = {{FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{132-147}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Characterization of biomass relevant to thermochemical conversion
   processes and other applications is critical to the design and proper
   operation of energy conversion, biorefining, and other facilities,
   especially in regard to estimating critical problems related to fouling
   and slagging from ash constituents. Residue feedstock from almond
   production was obtained from seven huller and sheller facilities located
   throughout the Central Valley of California. Results of proximate
   (moisture, ash, volatile and fixed carbon content), ultimate (C, H, N,
   S, O composition), heating value, major and trace elements, and melting
   behavior analyses (all reported on a wt.\% dry basis) reveal many
   similarities and also differences that potentially affect their
   utilization. The moisture content of air-dried feedstock is an average
   of 9.7\% with only the separated hull material having a higher value
   (12.2\%) and the fine component (<2 mm) a lower value (8.2\%) on an as
   received basis. The volatile matter is relatively constant (72-76\%).
   The ash content reflects a variable soil component in most fractions
   with a low average in hell of 3.5\% and increasing to 22\% in the fine
   fraction. The elemental C/O ratio is constant at about 1.15 and only
   appears slightly higher in the woody fraction (1.21). Nitrogen
   (0.4-0.8\%) and sulfur (0.2-0.3\%) are elevated compared to many other
   types of biomass, with the large variation in N probably related to
   irrigation water source and fertilization practices. Chlorine is
   generally low (<0.05) and varies without KCl control in both the crude
   feedstock and the ash. The ash of the almond biomass is very high in K,
   varying between 18-36\% and only S, Ca, and Preaching substantial
   amounts. The trace element concentrations are mostly well below local
   soil compositions with only Ga, Sr, and Cu well above and thus suggest
   few, if any, regulatory utilization challenges. The elevated feedstock
   concentrations of S and N may be sufficient to cause some environmental
   concern for certain types of thermal conversion processes, mostly in
   relation to NOx and SOx emissions. The high ash content together with
   the very high K content can cause adverse bed behavior, corrosion, and
   fouling in boilers, despite the relatively high ash melting temperatures
   (>1100 degrees C) suggested by pellet fusibility test. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Accurate and reliable modelling of protein-protein interaction networks
   for complex diseases such as colorectal cancer can help better
   understand mechanism of diseases and potentially discover new drugs.
   Different machine learning methods such as empirical mode decomposition
   combined with least square support vector machine, and discrete Fourier
   transform have been widely utilised as a classifier and for automatic
   discovery of biomarkers for the diagnosis of the disease. The existing
   methods are, however, less efficient as they tend to ignore interaction
   with the classifier. In this study, the authors propose a two-stage
   optimisation approach to effectively select biomarkers and discover
   interactions among them. At the first stage, particle swarm optimisation
   (PSO) and differential evolution (DE) are used to optimise parameters of
   support vector machine recursive feature elimination algorithm, and
   dynamic Bayesian network is then used to predict temporal relationship
   between biomarkers across two time points. Results show that 18 and 25
   biomarkers selected by PSO and DE-based approach, respectively, yields
   the same accuracy of 97.3\% and F1-score of 97.7 and 97.6\%,
   respectively. The stratified analysis reveals that
   Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein was a dominant hub gene with multiple
   interactions to other genes including Fibrinogen alpha chain, which is
   also a potential biomarker for colorectal cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To estimate the prevalence and risk factors for obstetric
   anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) in Saudi Arabia using data in a tertiary
   care University Center
   Design: A retrospective case-control study
   Setting: King Khalid University Hospital, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
   Subjects: All women with third and fourth degree perineal tears over a
   10-year period Interventions: We conducted this study by creating an
   obstetric database compiled over a period of 10 years (2002 2012)
   screening all for third and fourth degree perineal tears and too control
   matched by the time of delivery and delivery team (midwife and
   obstetrician).
   Main Outcome Measures: The prevalence of perineal injuries was
   calculated in cases and controls. Maternal and obstetric parameters were
   analyzed and compared between the two groups. Results: Of 31,665 vaginal
   deliveries, seventy-three patients (0.23 \%, 95\% CI by the adjusted
   wald method: 0.18\% - 0.29\%) had a recognized third (n = 66) or
   fourth-degree (n = 7) perineal tear. The following three variables were
   independently associated with OASIS on multivariate logistic regression
   models adjusting for potential confounders: primiparity (OR 3.32)
   instrumental delivery (OR 7.19) and episiotomy (OR 4.92).
   Conclusion: The overall prevalence of third- and fourth-degree perineal
   tears in our population is low; avoidance of certain obstetric
   interventions including instrumental delivery and episiotomy may
   decrease such complications.}},

Abstract = {{In the 1990s, the industrial application of high-speed machining
   achieved enormous success because of its favorable characteristics such
   as high productivity, better work quality, and ease of machining
   thin-walled structures. With fast changing emphasis of the world's
   manufacturing sector towards environmental benignity, the issue of
   sustainability with regard to application of high-speed machining
   becomes pivotal. The article presents an experimental investigation
   regarding comparison of conventional machining and high-speed machining
   with respect to sustainability measures. A set of 64 grooving
   experiments was performed on two tempers each of a high-strength
   low-alloy steel and a heat treatable titanium alloy. The experimental
   design focused on studying the effects of cutting mode
   (conventional/high-speed machining), cutting speed levels for each of
   the two modes, feed rate, and minimum quantity lubrication on tool life,
   specific cutting energy, productivity, process cost, and machining
   forces. It was found that the choice between the two machining modes is
   highly sensitive with respect to manufacturing sustainability. The
   conventional machining mode was found to be comparatively economical,
   while the high-speed machining mode significantly outperformed the other
   in terms of low specific energy consumption and high productivity. The
   article asserts that high speed machining can completely surpass
   conventional machining as the sustainable way of metal cutting if the
   ways could be found to curb excessive tool damage observable at high
   cutting speeds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background Evaluation of the association between treatment satisfaction
   and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) may enable health-care
   providers to understand the issues that influence quality of life and to
   recognize the aspects of hypertension treatment that need improvement to
   enhance the long-term treatment outcomes.
   Objective The aim of this study was to determine the relationship
   between HRQoL and treatment satisfaction in a sample of Palestinian
   hypertensive patients.
   Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted, adopting the Treatment
   Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM 1.4) for the assessment
   of treatment satisfaction and using the European Quality of Life scale
   (EQ-5D-5L) for the assessment of HRQoL. Descriptive and comparative
   statistics were used to describe socio-demographic and disease-related
   characteristics of the patients. All analyses were performed using SPSS
   v 15.0.
   Results Four hundred and ten hypertensive patients were enrolled in the
   study. This study findings indicate a positive correlation between all
   satisfaction domains and HRQoL. Significant differences were observed
   between this study variables (P < 0.001). After adjustment for
   covariates using multiple linear regression, an increase of one point in
   the global satisfaction scale was associated with a 0.16 increase in
   EQ-5D index scores (r = 0.16; P < 0.001).
   Conclusions Patients with reportedly higher satisfaction scores have
   reported relatively higher EQ-5D-5L index values. These study findings
   could be helpful in clinical practice, mainly in the early treatment of
   hypertensive patients, at a point where improving treatment satisfaction
   and HRQoL is still possible.}},

   Results: Our cohort included 158 patients with CS, 115 patients with
   UPSC and 561 patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Of the cohort,
   38\% of the patients had Stage III or IV disease. LND was performed in
   73\% of patients with CS, 68\% of patients with UPSC and 79\% of
   patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma. LND was performed in 82\% of
   Stage I-II and in 68\% of Stage III-IV cases. The median total LNC was
   13 (range 1-75) and there was no significant difference in the total LNC
   between the different histologies. Median OS was 21 months for CS, 18
   months for UPSC and 200 months for patients with endometrioid
   adenocarcinoma. A positive association between the total and positive
   LNC was present in all three histologic types (Spearman coefficient, p <
   0.001). The cohort was divided in quartiles based on the total LNC and a
   Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. A continuum of improved OS
   was noted in correlation with increased LNC. OS was 27 months for the
   group with 0 nodes, 112 months for the group with 1-8 nodes, 117 months
   for the group with 9-16 nodes and 196 months for the group with > 17
   nodes. Doubling the total LNC was associated with 28\% risk of death
   reduction (HR 0.724, CI 0.66-0.794, p < 0.001) for the first year and
   14\% risk reduction (HR 0.858, CI 0.761-0.967, p = 0.012) for the second
   year.
   Conclusions: In our cohort, the performance of LND is associated with
   improved OS. This effect appears to be uniform across pathology types.
   The extent of the LND is inversely correlated with the risk of death for
   the first 2 years. (C) 2015 IJS Publishing Group Limited. Published by

Abstract = {{We propose a novel personalized Recommender System (RS) framework,
   so-called Implicit Social Trust and Sentiment (ISTS) based RS which
   draws user preferences by exploring the user's Online Social Networks
   (OSNs). This approach overcomes the overlooked use of OSNs in
   Recommender Systems (RSs) and utilizes the widely available information
   from such networks. Bearing in mind that a user's selection is greatly
   influenced by his/her trusted friends and their opinions, this paper
   presents a framework to apply a new source of data to personalise
   recommendations by mining their friends' short text posts in
   microbloggings. ISTS maps suggested recommendations into numerical
   rating scales by applying three main components: (1) measuring the
   implicit trust between friends based on the intercommunication
   activities; (2) inferring the sentiment rating to reflect the knowledge
   behind friends' short posts, so-called micro-reviews, using sentiment
   techniques adding several ONSs language features to empower the
   extracted sentiment; (3) identifying the impact degree of trust level
   between friends and sentiment rating from micro-reviews on
   recommendations by using machine learning regression algorithms
   including linear regression, random forest and support vector regression
   (SVR). Our framework takes into consideration the semantic relationships
   between rating categories when estimating ratings to users. Empirical
   results, using real social data from Twitter microblogger, verified the
   effectiveness and promises of ISTS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and their nitro and oxy
   derivatives have been sampled every three hours over one week in winter
   at two sites in Birmingham UK. One site is heavily influenced by road
   traffic and is close to residential dwellings, while the other site is a
   background urban location at some distance from both sources of
   emission. The time series of concentrations has been examined along with
   the ratio of concentrations between the two sampling sites. A comparison
   of averaged diurnal profiles has shown different patterns of behaviour
   which has been investigated through calculating ratios of concentration
   at 18:00-21:00 h relative to that at 06:00-09:00 h. This allows
   identification of those compounds with a strong contribution to a
   traffic-related maximum at 06:00-09:00 h which are predominantly the low
   molecular weight PAHs, together with a substantial group of quinones and
   nitro-PAHs. Changes in partitioning between vapour and particulate forms
   are unlikely to influence the ratio as the mean temperature at both
   times was almost identical. Most compounds show an appreciable increase
   in concentrations in the evening which is attributed to residential
   heating emissions. Compounds dominated by this source show high ratios
   of 18:00-21:00 concentrations relative to 06:00-09:00 concentrations and
   include higher molecular weight PAH and a substantial group of both
   quinones and nitro-PAH. The behaviour of retene, normally taken as an
   indicator of biomass burning, is suggestive of wood smoke only being one
   contributor to the evening peak in PAH and their derivatives, with coal
   combustion presumably being the other main contributor. Variations of
   PAH concentrations with wind speed show a dilution behaviour consistent
   with other primary pollutants, and high concentrations of a range of air
   pollutants were observed in an episode of low temperatures and low wind
   speeds towards the end of the overall sampling period consistent with
   poor local dispersion processes. Results from a short summer campaign
   give indications of the formation of some nitro-PAH by atmospheric
   chemical reactions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: ``Blush,'' defined as a focal area of contrast pooling
   within a hematoma, is frequently encountered in patients with severe
   blunt torso trauma. Contemporary clinical practice guidelines recommend
   the use of angiography with embolization in all hemodynamically stable
   patients with evidence of active extravasation. Patients presenting with
   blush visualized on computed tomography (CT), but not demonstrated on
   subsequent angiography, present a challenging clinical dilemma. The
   purpose of this study was to study the natural course of patients with
   this blush disparity between CT and angiography.
   METHODS: The study was conducted as a retrospective analysis of patients
   who underwent angiography after initial CT scans revealed blush after
   blunt abdominal trauma at a level I trauma center (January 2005 to
   December 2014).
   RESULTS: A total of 143 patients with blunt splenic injuries were found
   to have CT blush and underwent catheter angiography. Of the 143 patients
   with blush on CT, 24 (17\%) showed no evidence of blush on angiography.
   Patients with CT-angiographic discrepancy were more than twice as likely
   to rebleed compared with those with angiographic evidence of blush (25\%
   vs 10\%, P < .05). This is due to the fact that although all patients
   with blush on angiography underwent embolization, only 7/22 of those
   with no evidence of blush were embolized. Sixty-eight patients with
   blunt liver injuries demonstrated blush on CT and underwent catheter
   angiography. Of the 68 patients with blush on CT, 22 patients (33\%)
   showed no evidence of blush on angiography. None of these 22 patients
   underwent angioembolization. The rebleeding rate in this cohort was 32\%
   (7/22). Again, this was more than twice the rate observed in patients
   who did have angiographic evidence of blush and were embolized (11\%,
   5/46).
   CONCLUSIONS: CT imaging has enhanced our ability to detect contrast
   extravasation after injury, and evidence of blush on CT suggests the
   presence of active hemorrhage. This analysis suggests that in clinical
   situations in which CT blush is noted secondary to blunt trauma to the
   spleen or liver, a negative angiogram still carries a significant risk
   of recurrent hemorrhage; consideration for empiric embolization at the
   time of the initial procedure even in the absence of blush on
   angiographic evaluation is thus warranted. Prospective studies are
   needed to validate these findings and to assess the utility of this
   clinical paradigm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A perturbed hard-chain (PHC) equation of state (EOS) has been previously
   employed to model the volumetric properties of molten polymers. The aim
   of this paper is to develop a new version of the PHC EOS for 25 polymers
   which employs a trimer expression from the statistical associating fluid
   theory-trimer (SAFT-T) as the reference physical model perturbed by the
   van der Waals dispersion forces. The significance of the proposed
   perturbed-hard-trimer-chain (PHTC) EOS is its capability of predicting
   the volumetric properties of polymers ranging from the amorphous state
   to above the melting temperature. Another feature of this model is the
   number of temperature-dependent parameters appeared in the EOS, for
   which only one temperature-dependent parameter is appeared to be the
   universal function of the reduced temperature using the molecular
   scaling constants: the dispersive energy among the pair-wise trimers,
   epsilon and the hard-core diameter, a. The performance of the PHTC EOS
   has been checked by predicting 3262 and 910 volumetric data related to
   the respectively, molten and amorphous/glassy polymers over pressure
   range within 0.1-200 MPa and temperature ranging from 294 to 608 K. The
   average absolute deviation (MD in \%) of the predicted specific volumes
   of studied amorphous and molten polymers were found to be 038\% and
   0.23\%, respectively, which represents lower AADs than those obtained
   from the preceding PHC EOS. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We previously described a synthesis method to prepare bimetallic
   catalysts with narrow nanoparticle size and composition distributions by
   means of controlled surface reactions (CSR) between a reduced supported
   metal nanoparticle and an organometallic precursor of an oxophilic
   promoter metal. Herein, we report a comparison of such catalysts with
   those prepared by traditional incipient wetness impregnation. STEM/EDS
   analysis indicates that catalysts prepared by CSR exhibit more effective
   interaction of metals, thereby minimizing the undesirable formation of
   component-rich nanoparticles and/or monometallic domains. Reaction
   kinetics studies using these bimetallic catalysts reveal that optimal
   conversion rates in a selective CO hydrogenolysis reaction (i.e.,
   hydrogenolysis of 2-(hydroxymethyl) tetrahydropyran to 1,6-hexanediol)
   could be achieved using a lower amount of the oxophilic promoter metal
   for the catalysts prepared by the CSR approach, as compared to their
   impregnated counterparts.}},

Title = {{Impact of sleep loss before learning on cortical dynamics during memory
   retrieval}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{51-62}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Evidence shows that sleep loss before learning decreases activation of
   the hippocampus during encoding and promotes forgetting. But it remains
   to be determined which neural systems are functionally affected during
   memory retrieval after one night of recovery sleep. To investigate this
   issue, we evaluated memory for pairs of famous people's faces with the
   same or different profession (i.e., semantically congruent or
   incongruent faces) after one night of undisturbed sleep in subjects who
   either underwent 4 hours of acute sleep restriction (ASR, N = 20) or who
   slept 8 hours the pre-training night (controls, N = 20). EEG recordings
   were collected during the recognition memory task in both groups, and
   the cortical sources generating this activity localized by applying a
   spatial beamforming filter in the frequency domain. Even though sleep
   restriction did not affect accuracy of memory performance, controls
   showed a much larger decrease of alpha power relative to a baseline
   period when compared to sleep-deprived subjects. These group differences
   affected a widespread frontotemporoparietal network involved in
   retrieval of episodic/semantic memories. Regression analyses further
   revealed that associative memory in the ASR group was negatively
   correlated with alpha power in the occipital regions, whereas the
   benefit of congruency in the same group was positively correlated with
   delta power in the left lateral prefrontal cortex. Retrieval-related
   decreases of alpha power have been associated with the reactivation of
   material-specific memory representations, whereas increases of delta
   power have been related to inhibition of interferences that may affect
   the performance of the task. We can therefore draw the conclusion that a
   few hours of sleep loss in the pre-training night, though insufficient
   to change the memory performance, is sufficient to alter the processes
   involved in retrieving and manipulating episodic and semantic
   information. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Infection of synthetic mesh after abdominal wall hernia
   repair is a complex problem. The purpose of this study was to determine
   whether a staged approach to abdominal wall reconstruction (AWR) using a
   porcine acellular dermal matrix (PADM) is beneficial in the setting of
   infected synthetic mesh.
   Methods: The authors performed a retrospective review of 27 patients who
   underwent immediate, staged complex AWR using PADM from 2007 to 2012.
   Results: After a component separation, primary fascial closure was
   achieved in 21/27 (78\%) patients, whereas 6/22 (22\%) received a
   bridged hernia repair with PADM. Wound-related complications developed
   in 7/27 (26\%) patients including wound dehiscence 6/27 (22\%), surgical
   site infection 5/27 (19\%), and hematoma 1/27 (4\%). The hernia
   recurrence rate observed by 32 months was 19\%. A bridged hernia repair
   and the development of a postoperative infection were associated with
   hernia recurrence, P < 0.05.
   Conclusions: A 2-stage approach to AWR with PADM can provide a safe and
   effective solution for patients with infected synthetic mesh.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic transformation of coffee (Coffea spp.), the second most traded
   commodity worldwide, is an alternative approach to introducing features
   that cannot be introgressed by traditional crossings. The transgenic
   stability, heritability and quantitative and spatial expression patterns
   of the seed-specific promoter phytohemagglutinin (PHA-L) from Phaseolus
   vulgaris were characterized in genetically modified C. arabica
   expressing the alpha-amylase inhibitor-1 (alpha-AI1) gene. The alpha-AI1
   inhibitor shows considerable activity toward digestive enzymes of the
   coffee berry borer (CBB) Hypothenemus hampei. This insect pest expends
   its life cycle almost entirely in coffee berries. Transgene containment
   in the fruit is important to meeting food and environmental safety
   requirements for releasing genetically modified (GM) crops. PCR analysis
   of T2 coffee plants showed a Mendelian single-copy segregation pattern.
   Ectopic transgene expression was only detected in coffee grains, as
   demonstrated by reverse transcription-PCR analysis of different plant
   tissues. An intense immunocytochemical signal associated with alpha-AI1
   protein expression was localized to endospermic cells. In addition, a
   delay in the larval development of CBB was observed after challenging
   transgenic coffee seeds with the insect. These results indicate that the
   PHA-L promoter might be a useful tool in coffee for the seed-specific
   expression of genes related to coffee bean productivity, quality and
   pest protection. The biotechnological applicability of the alpha-AI1
   gene for controlling CBB is also discussed. This work is the first
   report showing a seed-specific transgene expression in coffee plants.}},

   further investigate the allocation of responding under concurrent

   different reinforcement ratios (9:1, 1:1 and 1:9) in the terminal links

   allocation of responding under this schedule was well described by the
   generalized matching equation, for each participant. These results
   replicate previous findings obtained with nonhumans and humans under
   concurrent schedules of positive reinforcement. In addition, they extend
   the results reported by Alessandri and Riviere (2013) showing that human

Abstract = {{Following a request from the European Commission, the risks for human
   and animal health related to the presence of phorbol esters (PEs) in
   Jatropha kernel meal were assessed by the EFSA Panel of Contaminants in
   the Food Chain (CONTAM). Jatrophacurcas (Jatropha) seeds contain
   substantial amounts of extractable oil utilised for biodiesel
   production. The remaining protein-rich products (seed meal or kernel
   meal) may be used as a protein source in animal feed after removal of
   anti-nutritive factors and toxic PEs. The available dataonabsorption of
   Jatropha PEs afteroral ingestion, biotransformation, elimination, and
   dose-dependent toxic effects are very limited, and only for pigs a no
   observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 0.4 mg PEs/kg bw per day
   (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) equivalent), based on
   decreases in body weight gain and feed intake, could beidentified from
   short-term feeding studies. No health based guidance value for humans
   could be established. Processes that almost completely remove or degrade
   toxic PEs in Jatropha products are available, resulting in levels below
   the limit of detection of 3 mg Jatropha PEs/kg (TPA equivalent).
   Replacement of 50\% of the protein in compound feedswith treated
   Jatropha materials would result in animal exposures that are still 10 to
   200-fold lower than the NOAEL for pigs. The CONTAM Panel concluded that
   such use of Jatropha material would not pose a health risk to
   pigsandthat the risk to other species is likely to be low. The transfer
   of Jatropha PEs to animal derived products is unknown. In a human
   exposure scenario using a 50\% transfer rate from feed to milk, a daily
   intake of 1 mu g Jatropa PEs/kg bw per day was calculated. The CONTAM
   Panel concluded that more data are needed to draw firm conclusions on
   human risks. (C) European Food Safety Authority, 2015}},

Abstract = {{A pump-probe experimental approach has been shown to be a very efficient
   tool for the observation and analysis of various laser matter
   interaction effects. In those setups, synchronized laser pulses are used
   to create an event (pump) and to simultaneously observe it (probe). In
   general, the physical effects that can be investigated with such an
   apparatus are restricted by the temporal resolution of the probe pulse
   and the observation window. The latter can be greatly extended by
   adjusting the pump-probe time delay under the assumption that the
   interaction process remains fairly reproducible. Unfortunately, this
   assumption becomes invalid in the case of high-repetition-rate ultrafast
   laser material processing, where the irradiation history strongly
   affects the ongoing interaction process. In this contribution, the
   authors present an extension of the pump-probe setup that allows to
   investigate transitional and dynamic effects present during ultrafast
   laser machining performed at high pulse repetition frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{Mock modular forms, which give the theoretical framework for Ramanujan's
   enigmatic mock theta functions, play many roles in mathematics. We study
   their role in the context of modular parameterizations of elliptic
   curves E/Q. We show that mock modular forms which arise from Weierstrass
   zeta-functions encode the central L-values and L-derivatives which occur
   in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture. By defining a theta lift
   using a kernel recently studied by Hovel, we obtain canonical weight 1/2
   harmonic Maass forms whose Fourier coefficients encode the vanishing of
   these values for the quadratic twists of E. We employ results of
   Bruinier and the third author, which builds on seminal work of Gross,
   Kohnen, Shimura, Waldspurger, and Zagier. We also obtain p-adic formulas
   for the corresponding weight 2 newform using the action of the Hecke
   algebra on the Weierstrass mock modular form.}},

   been performed in steady state laminar flow regime. Experimental setup
   is validated by comparing the results of distilled water using staggered

   on enhancement ratio. Consequently, greater heat transfer enhancement is
   observed in staggered pin fin heat sink as compared to inline pin fin
   heat sink using same fluid. TiO2(Rutile)/H2O nanofluids show better
   thermal performance than TiO2(Anatase)/H2O nanofluids for both tested
   geometries. Uniform heat flux is applied at bottom side of heat sink by

Title = {{Effect of Paddle-Wheel Pulsating Velocity on the Hydrodynamic
   Performance of High-Rate Algal Ponds}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{High-rate algae ponds (HRAPs) are widely used in increasing biofuel
   production because of their effective design in terms of cost and power
   consumption. Using modeling and simulation techniques is an economical
   approach for improving the design of raceways. Previous modeling studies
   reported the use of a flat velocity profile, thus failing to depict the
   real phenomena involved. However, in practice, the rotating paddle wheel
   in HRAPs produces a pulsating velocity that is necessary for culture
   growth. In this study, the hydrodynamic characteristics of algal ponds
   were investigated using a coupling algorithm to map the effects of a
   two-dimensional paddle wheel on a three-dimensional raceway model. HRAPs
   with and without paddle wheels were compared in terms of hydrodynamic
   mixing, dead zones, and power consumption. The results revealed that
   compared with a flat velocity at the inlet, the pulsating velocity of a
   paddle wheel produced a large dead zone volume with reduced power
   consumption, shear stress, and turbulence. A few pond design
   modifications were tested with this realistic situation and an
   additional recirculation zone was found near the paddle wheel. This zone
   needs to be addressed in future pond designs. (C) 2014 American Society

Abstract = {{A new methodology for assessing the effectiveness of carbon capture and
   storage (CCS) that does explicitly consider the detailed operation of
   the target electricity system is proposed. The electricity system
   simulation consists of three phases, each one using a modified version
   of an economic dispatch problem that seeks to maximize the producers'
   and consumers' surplus while satisfying the technical constraints of the
   system. The economic dispatch is formulated as a dynamic mixed-integer
   nonlinear programming problem and implemented in general algebraic
   modelling system (GAMS). The generating unit with CCS is designed and
   simulated using Aspen Plus (R). In the first case study, the operation
   of the IEEE RTS `96 (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
   One-Area Reliability Test System1996) is simulated with greenhouse gas
   (GHG) regulation implemented in the form of CO2 permits that generators
   need to acquire for every unit of CO2 that it is emitted. In the second
   case study, CCS is added at one of the buses and the operation of the
   modified IEEE RTS `96 is again simulated with and without GHG
   regulation. The results suggest that the detailed operation of the
   target electricity system should be considered in future assessments of
   CCS and a general procedure for undertaking this for any GHG mitigation
   option is proposed. Future work will use the novel methodology for
   assessing the effectiveness of generating units with flexible CO2
   capture. (c) 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Incidence of hospital-acquired diarrhea has
   increased rapidly and burn patients are at high risk of getting it.
   Infection with C. difficile is the most common cause of antibiotic
   associated diarrhea. The aim of this study was to determine the baseline
   characteristics and clinical presentation of hospital-acquired diarrhea
   and compare C. difficile and non-C. difficile diarrhea in burn patients
   treated at a burn center.
   Materials and Methods: During a 1-year study all patients with
   hospital-acquired diarrhea at Motahari Burn Hospital, Tehran, Iran
   enrolled in this study. We compared patients with a stool sample
   positive for C. difficile toxin or tracing the antigen in patients who
   were negative for detection of toxin in their stool sample specimens.
   Results: Diarrhea developed in 37 patients out of 3200 admitted patients
   with a mean burn size of 34.8 +/- 20.1\%. Among them, 8 patients had a
   positive result for C. difficile. The mean time between antibiotic
   therapy and occurrence of diarrhea was 9.5 +/- 6.2 days. Nine (23.7\%)
   patients died in the 7.8 +/- 4.2 days, mostly due to co-morbidities. The
   mean duration of diarrhea was 3.6 +/- 2 days. Twenty two (57.9\%)
   patients were treated with oral metronidazol and eleven (28.9\%)
   patients were treated with combination of metronidazole and vancomycin,
   higher rate of combination therapy was seen in Clostridium difficile
   CDI.
   Conclusion: Overall, the prevalence of hospital-acquired diarrhea was
   120/10,000 and 21\% of them caused by infection with C. difficile.
   Presence of peripheral leukocytosis and colitis were the alarm sign for
   diagnosis of C. difficile infection.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is an alternative source of
   hematopoietic stem cell(HSC) transplantation for the treatment of
   patients with leukemia if matched donor is not available. CD34+ is a pan
   marker for human hematopoietic stem cells, including umbilical cord
   blood stem cell. In comparison to other sources, cord blood CD34+ cells
   proliferate more rapidly and produce large number of progeny cells. For
   ex vivo expansion of Umbilical Cord Blood- HSCs/HPCs, different
   combinations of cytokines have been used in many laboratories. IL2rg
   cytokines, including IL2, IL7 and IL15, are key cytokines in the
   regulation of differentiation, proliferation and survival of immune
   cells. IL2 is important cytokine for T cell survival and proliferation,
   IL7 involve in B cell development and IL15 is a key cytokine for NK cell
   development. In this study we evaluated the generation of T cells
   derived from CD34+ and CD34- cord blood mononuclear cells by using
   combination of cytokines including IL2, IL7 and IL15.
   Methods: Cultured cord blood mononuclear cells were evaluated at
   distinct time points during 21 days by using flow cytometry.
   Results: Present study showed that differentiation of T cells derived
   from CD34+ cord blood mononuclear cells increased by using IL2 and IL7
   at different time points. In the other hand IL15 did not show any
   significant role in generation of T cells from CD34+ cord blood
   mononuclear cells.
   Conclusion: Taken together, our data illustrated that either IL2 or IL7
   versus other cytokine combinations, generate more T cell from cord blood
   CD34 cells, probably this cytokines can be the best condition for ex
   vivo expansion of UCB HSCs.}},

Abstract = {{A unique feature of the space radiation environment is the presence of
   high-energy charged particles, which can be significantly hazardous to
   space flight crews who are exposed during a mission. Health risks
   associated with high-LET radiation exposure include cognitive injury.
   The pathogenesis of this injury is unknown but may involve modifications
   to dendritic structure and/or alterations in dendritic spine density and
   morphology. In this study, 24 two-month-old C57BL6/J male mice were
   either whole-body irradiated with 0.5 Gy 56Fe (600 MeV/n; n = 12) or
   sham irradiated (n = 12). Three months postirradiation animals were
   tested for locomotor activity and habituation. After behavioral testing,
   animals were euthanized and the brains were flash frozen. Compared to
   sham-irradiated mice, irradiated mice moved less when first introduced
   to the environment, although they did recognize the environment when
   re-exposed to it one day later. Exposure to 56Fe radiation significantly
   compromised the dendritic architecture and reduced spine density
   throughout the hippocampal tri-synaptic network. To our knowledge, these
   data represents the first reported evidence that high-LET radiation has
   deleterious effects on mature neurons associated with hippocampal
   learning and memory. (C) 2015 by Radiation Research Society}},

Abstract = {{By analysing ancient DNA (aDNA) from 74 C-14-dated individuals of the
   extinct South Island giant moa (Dinornis robustus) of New Zealand, we
   identified four dyads of closely related adult females. Although our
   total sample included bones from four fossil deposits located within a
   10 km radius, these eight individuals had all been excavated from the
   same locality. Indications of kinship were based on high pairwise
   genetic relatedness (r(XY)) in six microsatellite markers genotyped from
   aDNA, coupled with overlapping radiocarbon ages. The observed r(XY)
   values in the four dyads exceeded a conservative cutoff value for
   potential relatives obtained from simulated data. In three of the four
   dyads, the kinship was further supported by observing shared and rare
   mitochondrial haplotypes. Simulations demonstrated that the proportion
   of observed dyads above the cutoff value was at least 20 times higher
   than expected in a randomly mating population with temporal sampling,
   also when introducing population structure in the simulations. We
   conclude that the results must reflect social structure in the moa
   population and we discuss the implications for future aDNA research.}},

Abstract = {{Aims/hypothesis Insulin secretion is widely studied because it plays a
   central role in glucose homeostasis and diabetes. Processes from insulin
   granule fusion in beta cells to in vivo insulin secretion have been
   elucidated, but data at the cellular level do not fully account for
   several aspects of the macroscopic secretory pattern. Here we
   investigated how individual secretory events are coordinated spatially
   and temporally within intact human islets.
   Methods We used the fluorescent probe neuropeptide Y(NPY)-pHluorin to
   visualise insulin granule secretion in isolated intact human islets.
   Results We found that individual beta cells respond to increases in
   glucose concentration by releasing insulin granules in very discrete
   bursts with periods consistent with in vivo pulsatile insulin secretion.
   In successive secretory bursts during prolonged exposure to high glucose
   levels, secretory events progressively localised to preferential release
   sites, coinciding with the transition to second phase insulin secretion.
   Granule secretion was very synchronised in neighbouring beta cells,
   forming discrete regional clusters of activity.
   Conclusions/interpretation These results reveal how individual secretory
   events are coordinated to produce pulsatile insulin secretion from human
   islets.}},

Abstract = {{Literature about the association between clinical and laboratory
   presentation and pyloric muscle thickness in infants with pyloric
   stenosis is lacking. The objective of this study is to examine the
   effect of pyloric muscle thickness on clinical and laboratory
   presentation in infants with pyloric stenosis. Thirty infants with
   hypertrophic pyloric stenosis presented at the Maternity and Children
   Hospital, Al-Madinah, Saudi Arabia, were included in this study
   analysis. Clinical and laboratory data of these infants were recorded.
   Statistical tests and univariate linear regression analyses were used as
   appropriate. P value was considered significant at a level <= 0.05. The
   mean age of the studied infant was 5.1 +/- 2.6 weeks and mean weight was
   3.4 +/- 0.7 kg. Most of these infants were full-term (93.3 \%), some
   presented to the hospital dehydrated (80 \%), and some were lethargic
   (56.7 \%). The mean pyloric muscle thickness among these infants showed
   statistically significant difference with regard to the studied clinical
   and laboratory data. A linear regression analyses also showed positive
   association between increasing pyloric muscle thickness and almost all
   studied clinical and laboratory data, with statistically significant
   difference observed for hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and high
   bicarbonates. The findings suggest that pyloric muscle thickness is a
   significant factor that determines the severity of clinical and
   laboratory presentation in infants with pyloric stenosis.}},

Abstract = {{Electrostatic spraying which has an even and retained surface coverage
   could be an effective novel technique to completely cover the surface of
   fresh produce to disrupt biofilm formation by pathogenic bacteria.
   Spinach leaves and cantaloupe rind were spot-inoculated with a bacterial
   culture and stored at 8 degrees C for 72 h to allow biofilm formation.
   Among various green fluorescent protein-labeled strains, ED 14 strain of
   E. coli O157:H7 and SD 10 strain of Salmonella Typhimurium had the best
   attachment based on colony counts. The produce samples were
   electrostatically sprayed with malic (MA) and lactic (LA) acid solutions
   alone (1.0/2.0/3.0/4.0\% w/v) or in combination (0.5 + 0.5/1.0 + 1.0/1.5
   + 1.5/2.0 + 2.0\% w/v) to test for a reduction in the attached bacteria.
   A combined treatment of LA 2.0\% w/v + MA 2.0\% w/v had the highest log
   reduction (CFU/disk) of 4.14 and 3.6 on the attached E. coli strain ED
   14 (spinach) and Salmonella strain SD 10 (cantaloupe), respectively.
   Crystal violet assay demonstrated the disruptive effect of organic acids

Abstract = {{In the 1990s, the field of geoethics started its development, associated
   with a set of ethical principles that regulate the profession of
   geologists in their relationship with society and with nature. Given the
   importance of this field, but also its youth, 36 higher education
   students attending a Master's of Geology course were surveyed (20 were
   from an educational branch and 16 were from a scientific branch). The
   questionnaire applied to them aimed to achieve the following goals: (a)
   to identify the knowledge of the respondents about this new field and to
   verify their position about the inclusion of geoethics in the
   curriculum, (b) to understand how they consider the importance of
   geological knowledge in political decisions and (c) to investigate
   possible differences in the thinking of the respondents, given the
   specificities of their educational branches. The study concluded that
   the field of geoethics is unknown to the majority of the respondents.
   However, the recognition of its importance was also verified, after
   getting familiar with the definition of the concept, as well as the need
   for its inclusion in formal education. The respondents also considered
   relevant the creation of a deontological code that could provide
   geologists with ethical guidance. They also considered that geology
   should influence political decisions, but they did not consistently
   recognise the limits of its influence, which seems to reveal the need of
   a deeper understanding of the specific nature of geological knowledge
   when compared with other sciences. Almost all the results were similar
   in both groups, but the students from the educational branch offered
   more elaborate answers about the issues present in the questionnaire.}},

   groups (chaebol) in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis,
   and the consequences of this capital reallocation for the investment and
   performance of chaebol firms. We show that chaebol transferred cash from
   low-growth to high-growth member firms, using cross-firm equity
   investments. This capital reallocation allowed chaebol firms with
   greater investment opportunities to invest more than control firms after
   the crisis. These firms also showed higher profitability and lower
   declines in valuation than control firms following the crisis. Our
   results suggest that chaebol internal capital markets helped them
   mitigate the negative effects of the Asian crisis on investment and

Abstract = {{In this work, a simple yet robust method to prepare lipid-based
   biosensing interfaces on gold using common lipids (a phospholipid and
   cholesterol) and an alkanethiol is reported. The lipids were carefully
   chosen to tailor the biophysical properties of the bilayer. The
   simplicity of the method relies on the incorporation of a small
   percentage of decanethiol in the lipid vesicles for a direct formation
   of a thiol-linked supported lipid bilayer, which is advantageous in
   several respects. It prevents the use of specially synthesized
   thiolipids and preserves the natural fluidity and dynamics of the
   lipids. As a consequence the whole arrangement is extremely stable
   regarding ionic strength changes and solution flow during surface
   plasmon resonance experiments. Moreover, we show that this interface is
   very effective on suppressing the nonspecific adsorption of proteins on
   the surface, and enables the covalent attachment of the recognition
   antibody. The subsequent detection of specific interaction toward
   antigen was monitored in real-time by SPR and confirmed by ellipsometric
   measurements. This lipid-based biosensing platform is versatile and can
   be adapted to the biorecognition reaction of interest. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Energetic and exergetic analyses are conducted using operating data for
   Sabiya, a combined cycle power plant (CCPP) with an advanced triple
   pressure reheat heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). Furthermore, a
   sensitivity analysis is carried out on the HRSG using a recent approach
   to differentiate between the sources of irreversibility. The proposed
   system was modelled using the IPSEpro software and further validated by
   the manufacturer's data. The performance of the Sabiya CCPP was examined
   for different climatic conditions, pressure ratios, pinch point
   temperatures, high-pressure steam, and condenser pressure values. The
   results confirmed that 60.9\% of the total exergy destruction occurs in
   the combustion chamber, which constitutes the main source of
   irreversibilities within a system. The exergy destruction was
   significantly affected by both the pressure ratio and the high-pressure
   steam, where the relation between them was seen to be inversely
   proportional. The high-pressure stage contributes about 50\% of the
   exergy destruction within the HRSG compared to other stages and the
   reheat system, due to the high temperature difference between the
   streams and the large number of components, which leads to high energy
   loss to the surroundings. Numerous possibilities for improving the
   CCPP's performance are introduced, based on the obtained results.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential for neurocognitive
   function. This study aims at establishing a plausible link between level
   of serum BDNF, functional capacity (FC), and vascular function in 181
   young (age 25.5 +/- 9.1 years old), apparently healthy adults. Fasting
   blood samples were drawn from participants' antecubital veins into plain
   glass tubes while they were in a sitting position to evaluate serum BDNF
   using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Mercury-in-silastic
   strain-gauge plethysmography was used to determine arterial function
   indices, blood flow and vascular resistance at rest and following 5
   minutes of arterial ischemia. The 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) test was
   used to determine FC, according to the American Thoracic Society
   Committee on Proficiency Standards for Clinical Pulmonary Function
   Laboratories guidelines. It was conducted in an enclosed corridor on a
   flat surface with a circular track 33 meters long. The walking course
   was demarcated with bright colored cones. The 6MWD correlated with BDNF
   (r=0.3, p=0.000), as well as with forearm blood inflow (r=0.5, p=0.000)
   and vascular resistance (r = -0.4, p=0.000). Subsequent comparison
   showed that BDNF and blood inflow were greater (p<0.05) while vascular
   resistance was less (p<0.05) in participants who achieved a longer 6MWD.
   Similarly, BDNF correlated with forearm blood inflow (r=0.4, p=0.000)
   and vascular resistance (r = -0.4, p=0.000). Subsequent comparison
   showed improved vascular function (p<0.05) in the participants with
   greater BDNF. In conclusion, these findings might suggest that improved
   vascular function in individuals with greater FC is mediated, at least
   partially, by an enhanced serum BDNF level.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in computer-based technology has created a significant
   opportunity for implementing new training paradigms in neurosurgery
   focused on improving skill acquisition, enhancing procedural outcome,
   and surgical skills assessment. NeuroTouch is a computer-based virtual
   reality system that can generate output data known as metrics from
   operator performance during simulated brain tumor resection. These
   measures of quantitative assessment are used to track and compare
   psychomotor performance during simulated operative procedures. Data
   output from the NeuroTouch system is recorded in a comma-separated
   values file. Data mining from this file and subsequent metrics
   development requires the use of sophisticated software and engineering
   expertise. In this article, we introduce a system to extract a series of
   new metrics using the same data file using Excel software. Based on the
   data contained in the NeuroTouch comma-separated values file, 13 novel
   NeuroTouch metrics were developed and classified. Tier 1 metrics include
   blood loss, tumor percentage resected, and total simulated normal brain
   volume removed. Tier 2 metrics include total instrument tip path length,
   maximum force applied, sum of forces utilized, and average forces
   utilized by the simulated ultrasonic aspirator and suction instrument
   along with pedal activation frequency of the ultrasonic aspirator.
   Advanced tier 2 metrics include instrument tips average separation
   distance, efficiency index, ultrasonic aspirator path length index,
   coordination index, and ultrasonic aspirator bimanual forces ratio. This
   system of data extraction provides researchers expedited access for
   analyzing the data files available for NeuroTouch platform to assess the
   multiple psychomotor and cognitive neurosurgical skills involved in
   complex surgical procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Applications of RNA interference for neuroscience research have been
   limited by a lack of simple and efficient methods to deliver
   oligonucleotides to primary neurons in culture and to the brain. Here,
   we show that primary neurons rapidly internalize hydrophobically
   modified siRNAs (hsiRNAs) added directly to the culture medium without
   lipid formulation. We identify functional hsiRNAs targeting the mRNA of
   huntingtin, the mutation of which is responsible for Huntington's
   disease, and show that direct uptake in neurons induces potent and
   specific silencing in vitro. Moreover, a single injection of
   unformulated hsiRNA into mouse brain silences Htt mRNA with minimal
   neuronal toxicity. Thus, hsiRNAs embody a class of therapeutic
   oligonucleotides that enable simple and straightforward functional
   studies of genes involved in neuronal biology and neurodegenerative
   disorders in a native biological context.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a network design application that is modeled as the
   two-level network design problem under uncertainty. In this problem, one
   of the two available technologies can be installed on each edge and all
   customers of the network need to be served by at least the lower level
   (secondary) technology. The decision maker is confronted with
   uncertainty regarding the set of primary customers, i.e., the set of
   nodes that need to be served by the higher level (primary) technology. A
   set of discrete scenarios associated with the possible realizations of
   primary customers is available. The network is built in two stages. In
   the first stage the network topology must be determined. One may decide
   to install the primary technology on some of the edges in the first
   stage, or one can wait to see which scenario will be realized, in which
   case, edges with the installed secondary technology may be upgraded, if
   necessary to primary technology, but at higher recovery cost. The
   overall goal then is to build a ``recoverable robust{''} spanning tree
   in the first stage that serves all customers by at least the lower level
   technology, and that minimizes the first-stage installation cost plus
   the worst-case cost needed to upgrade the edges of the selected tree, so
   that the primary customers of each scenario can be served using the
   primary technology. We discuss the complexity of the problem, provide
   mixed-integer programming models, and develop a branch-and-cut algorithm
   to solve it. Our extensive computational experiments demonstrate the
   efficacy of our approach.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to evaluate the physicochemical characteristics
   of commercially available dry fermented sausages from different origins
   tracing their nutritional composition and extrapolating their potential
   health benefits to consumers. There is a great diversity in sausages'
   proximal composition since each producer has their own formulation, type
   of manufacture and uses of pig genotype, with no differentiation
   regarding products' origin or diameter. The mineral contents of
   fermented sausages differ probably due to variations in raw materials
   and products' formulation as a consequence of natural mineral
   occurrence. In addition, the principal component analysis of fatty acid
   composition clearly discriminates the origin of dry fermented sausages.
   From the nutritional point of view, the fermented sausages provide
   37-40\% total fat, 13-14\% saturated fat, 0.48-0.52\% cholesterol as
   well as 0.03-0.10\% alpha-tocopherol, which are inside of the dietary

Abstract = {{Purpose: BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) extend survival in BRAF-mutant melanoma
   but can promote the growth of Ras-mutant neoplasms. This study
   determined if gastrointestinal polyps found in BRAFi-treated patients
   harbored Ras mutations.
   Experimental Design: Colonic and gastric polyps were identified and
   resected from BRAFi-treated melanoma patients. Next-generation
   sequencing (NGS) was performed on polyps. The ability of BRAFi to
   promote polyp formation was functionally characterized in Apc Min(+/-)
   mice. MAPK and beta-catenin pathway activity was assessed by
   immunohistochemistry in mouse and human polyps.
   Results: Fourteen patients treated with BRAFi underwent endoscopy to
   assess for polyps. Seven out of 7 patients >40 years of age and treated
   for >2 years were found to have colonic tubular adenomas with 4 out of
   the 7 patients having 5 or more polyps. One patient presented with
   bleeding from hyperplastic gastric polyps that recurred 6 months after
   BRAFi rechallenge. NGS performed on polyps found no mutations in MAPK
   pathway genes, but found APC mutations in all tubular adenomas. A
   significant increase in the number of polyps was observed in
   BRAFi-treated compared with control-treated Apc Min(+/-) mice (20.8 +/-
   9.2 vs 12.8 +/- 0.1; P = 0.016). No polyps were observed in
   BRAFi-treated wild-type mice.
   Conclusions: BRAFi may increase the risk of developing hyperplastic
   gastric polyps and colonic adenomatous polyps. Due to the risk of
   gastrointestinal bleeding and the possibility of malignant
   transformation, further studies are needed to determine whether or not
   endoscopic surveillance should be recommended for patients treated with
   BRAFi. (C) 2015 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{Based on primary sources, including documents obtained from Cameroon's
   Ministry of External Relations, oral interviews conducted in Cameroon,
   and local newspapers, and a variety of secondary sources, this article
   examines Cameroon's foreign policy and economic relations with China. It
   argues that Cameroon's engagement with China has resulted in short-term
   benefits for consumers but undermined long-term, sustainable economic
   development. The article concludes that unless China genuinely pursues
   its promised policies of mutual respect and win-win gain, voices of
   protest will only grow louder in Cameroon and other African nations.

   que l'engagement du Cameroun avec la Chine a entraine des avantages a
   court terme pour les consommateurs, mais a mine a long terme le
   developpement economique durable. L'article conclut que a moins que la

   paper offers the notion of ``space manufacturing{''} to characterize the
   relation between technology and space production in this particular
   context. A brief account of Singapore's economic expansion and its
   implication on space is presented. Following, the paper discusses the
   technical specifications of the underwater infrastructure to show how
   the new technology is designed to respond to space scarcity. Lastly, the
   paper examines how space manufacturing of the Underwater City reflects

Abstract = {{Objective: Unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA) is one of
   the main complications of pregnancy which is usually defined as three or
   more consecutive pregnancy losses before the 20th week of gestation
   without a known cause. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a
   potent angiogenic factor and shown, along with its receptors (VEGFR1,
   2), to play important roles in several physiologic processes including
   reproduction. The aim of the present study was to analyze gene
   expression of VEGF and VEGF receptors in endometrium of patients with a
   history of URSA compared with normal fertile women. In addition, serum
   VEGF concentration was assessed and compared between the two groups at
   the same time.
   Materials and Methods: In this case control study, endometrial and blood
   samples were obtained between day 19th and 24th of menstrual cycle
   (window of implantation) from 10 women with a history of URSA (case
   group) and 6 fertile women who had at least one successful pregnancy
   (control group). Expression of VEGF and VEGFRs was studied by reverse
   transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and then quantified by
   real time PCR. Normalization of expression levels was done by comparison
   with beta-actin expression level as an internal control. Relative VEGF,
   VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 expression quantities were compared between the two
   groups. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used for serum
   VEGF assay.
   Results: VEGF, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 gene expression was detected in
   endometrial samples of both groups. The mean relative expression of VEGF
   gene was lower in the case group compared with control women, however,
   both VEGF receptors were expressed higher in endometrium of the case
   group. In addition, the serum level of VEGF was significantly higher in
   the case group compared with the controls.
   Conclusion: Alteration in gene expression of VEGF and its receptors in
   endometrium and changes of serum VEGF might play important roles in
   pathogenesis of unexplained RSA.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of ZrB2 nanoparticles through reaction of Zr(n-PrO)(4)
   with H3BO3 and carbon has been studied with different ligands by
   carbothermal reduction at 1500 degrees C. In the first step, by
   introducing N,N'-bis (salicylidene)-1,3-diaminopropane (H(2)salpn) or
   salicylaldehyde (Hsal) species into reaction mixture, the reaction of
   the zirconium alkoxide using citric acid and boric acid yielded the
   zirconium diboride (ZrB2) sol gel precursors. In the second step, the
   mixture was heated by introducing the reactant compact into an argon
   furnace held at 1500 degrees C for 2 h to obtain the final pure phase
   ZrB2 nanocrystallites with a diameter of about 50 nm. The kind of
   chelating agent used in the preparation of ZrB2 nanoparticles plays the
   predominant role on the final product size. This demonstrates that the
   proper kind of donor atom and a very specific ligand structure are
   necessary for the reaction of Zr4+ complexes.'}},

Abstract = {{The process of developing effective science educators has been a
   long-standing objective of the broader education community. Numerous
   studies have recommended not only depth in a teacher's subject area but
   also a breadth of professional development grounded in constructivist
   principles, allowing for successful student-centered and inquiry-based
   instruction. Few programs, however, have addressed the integration of
   the scientific research laboratory into the science classroom as a
   viable approach to professional development. Additionally, while
   occasional laboratory training programs have emerged in recent years,
   many lack a component for translating acquired skills into reformed
   classroom instruction. Given the rapid development and demand for
   knowledgeable employees and an informed population from the biotech and
   medical industries in recent years, it would appear to be particularly
   advantageous for the physiology and broader science education
   communities to consider this issue. The goal of this study was to
   examine the effectiveness of a laboratory-based professional development
   program focused on the integration of reformed teaching principles into
   the classrooms of secondary teachers. This was measured through the
   program's ability to instill in its participants elevated academic
   success while gaining fulfillment in the classroom. The findings
   demonstrated a significant improvement in the use of student-centered
   instruction and other reformed methods by program participants as well
   as improved self-efficacy, confidence, and job satisfaction. Also
   revealed was a reluctance to refashion established classroom protocols.
   The combination of these outcomes allowed for construction of an
   experiential framework for professional development in applied science
   education that supports an atmosphere of reformed teaching in the
   classroom.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty seven crossbred (Karan-Fries) cows between second and fourth
   lactation with most probable production ability of around 4500 kg milk
   were divided into three similar groups. Animals in the Control group
   were offered with a basal diet consisting of threshed wheat straw,
   chopped green maize forage and compounded concentrate mixture as per
   their requirements. In addition to basal diet, animals in second group
   (rpMetLys) were fed with 5 g of rumen-protected methionine and 20 g of
   rumen-protected lysine, and in third group (rpCholine), 54 g of
   rumen-protected choline was supplemented 40 days before and 120 days
   after calving. Results revealed higher (P < 0.01) intake of various
   nutrients along with better body condition score in rpMetLys group.
   Furthermore, milk yield and milk component (fat, protein and lactose)
   yield were higher (P < 0.01) in both the treatment groups with higher (P
   < 0.01) milk choline concentration in rpCholine group. Monounsaturated
   fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids in milk tended to be higher (P <
   0.05) in rpCholine group. Plasma metabolites like glucose,
   non-esterified fatty acids, cholesterol and plasma urea nitrogen were
   similar among all groups. Concentration of triglycerides and very low
   density lipoproteins was lower (P < 0.01) in rpMetLys and rpCholine than
   Control group. However, phosphatidylcholine and vitamin E levels were
   higher (P < 0.01) in rpCholine than other two groups. Methionine levels
   were higher (P < 0.01) in rpMetLys and rpCholine groups, whereas lysine
   was increased (P < 0.01) only in the former. Moreover, days open
   (service period) was decreased (P < 0.01) in animals belonging to
   rpCholine group. It was concluded from the present study that
   supplementation of rpMetLys and rpCholine to high-yielding crossbred
   cows was beneficial in terms of improving milk yield, composition as
   well as metabolic health status during early lactation period under
   Indian situation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Several lines of evidence suggest that breast cancer (BC)
   and thyroid cancer (TC) occur together in the same female patients more
   frequently than would be expected by chance. This study investigated the
   prevalence and clinicopathological characteristics of second primary BC
   in TC patients and second primary TC in BC patients. Methods: A
   retrospective case-controlled study was performed in 4243 patients with
   differentiated TC and 6833 patients with BC. Age-matched control groups
   without second malignancies were selected. Results: Of the 4243 patients
   with TC, 55 patients developed subsequent BC during a five-year
   follow-up (range 2-40 years); the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was
   2.45 {[}confidence interval (CI) 1.83-2.96]. Among the 6833 patients
   with BC, 81 patients developed subsequent TC during a 6.2-year follow-up
   (range 2-40 years); the SIR was 2.18 {[}CI 1.43-2.82]. Subsequent second
   BC or TC diagnosed within five years of the initial primary malignancy
   showed more clinical characteristics consistent with early-stage cancer
   than did control BC or TC patients. Notably, the expression of both the
   estrogen and progesterone receptors was significantly higher in the
   tissues of BC patients with coexisting TC compared with those with BC
   alone. Conclusions: The overall risk of second primary TC or BC is
   increased in patients with prior BC or TC, respectively. The early
   detection of second cancer might have contributed to these findings.
   However, BC that coexisted with TC had a higher expression of hormone
   receptors, suggesting an association between the molecular pathogenesis
   of TC and BC.}},

Abstract = {{Potassium (K) plays an essential role to promote catalytic reactions in
   many established industrial catalytic processes. Here, we report a
   combined study using STM and DFT to understand the effect of the
   deposition of K on the atomic and electronic structures as well as
   chemical activities of CuxO/Cu(111) (x <= 2). The DFT calculations show
   a pseudomorphic growth of K on CuxO/Cu(111) up to 0.19 monolayer (ML) of
   coverage, in which K binds the surface by a strong ionic interaction
   with chemisorbed oxygen and relatively weak electrostatic interactions
   with Cu ions, the lower and upper oxygen atoms on the CuxO rings. The
   simulated STM pattern based on the DFT results agrees well with the
   experimental observations. The deposited K has a great impact on the
   surface electronic structure of u(x)O/Cu(111), which induces a
   significant reduction in the work function and leads to a strong
   electron polarization on the surface. The promotion of K on the surface
   binding properties is selective and varies depending on the nature of
   the adsorbates. According to our results, K has little effect on surface
   acidity but it enhances the surface basicity significantly.
   Consequently, the presence of K does not help CO adsorption on
   CuxO/Cu(111) but is able to accelerate the activation of CO2. Such a
   promotion depends strongly on the combinations from both geometric and
   electronic effects. Our results highlight the origin of the promoting
   effect of alkali metals in the design of catalysts for complex
   reactions.}},

   Tucker Decompositions with Structured Sparsity}},

Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{2643-2694}},

Abstract = {{Overcomplete latent representations have been very popular for
   unsupervised feature learning in recent years. In this paper, we specify
   which overcomplete models can be identified given observable moments of
   a certain order. We consider probabilistic admixture or topic models in
   the overcomplete regime, where the number of latent topics can greatly
   exceed the size of the observed word vocabulary. While general
   overcomplete topic models are not identifiable, we establish generic
   identifiability under a constraint, referred to as topic persistence.
   Our sufficient conditions for identifiability involve a novel set of
   ``higher order{''} expansion conditions on the topic-word matrix or the
   population structure of the model. This set of higher-order expansion
   conditions allow for overcomplete models, and require the existence of a
   perfect matching from latent topics to higher order observed words. We
   establish that random structured topic models are identifiable w.h.p. in
   the overcomplete regime. Our identifiability results allows for general
   (non-degenerate) distributions for modeling the topic proportions, and
   thus, we can handle arbitrarily correlated topics in our framework. Our
   identifiability results imply uniqueness of a class of tensor
   decompositions with structured sparsity which is contained in the class
   of Tucker decompositions, but is more general than the Candecomp/Parafac
   (CP) decomposition.}},

Title = {{A Model for Wettability Alteration in Fractured Reservoirs}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1261-1275}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We present a mathematical model for wettability alteration (WA) in
   fractured reservoirs. Flow in the reservoir is modeled by looking at a
   single fracture surrounded by matrix on both sides. Water is injected
   into the formation with a chemical component that enters the matrix and
   adsorbs onto the rock surface. These changes of the mineral surface are
   assumed to alter the wettability toward a more water-wet state, which
   leads to enhanced recovery by spontaneous imbibition. This can be viewed
   as a representation of ``smart water{''} injection in which the ionic
   composition of injection brine affects recovery. The WA is described by
   shifting curves for relative permeability and capillary pressure from
   curves representing preferentially oil-wet (POW) conditions toward
   curves representing more-water-wet conditions. The numerical code was
   successfully compared with ECLIPSE for the specific case in which a
   fixed wetting state is assumed. Also, the relevance of the WA model was
   illustrated by modeling a spontaneous-imbibition experiment in which
   only a modification of the brine composition led to a change in oil
   recovery. The model can predict sensitivity to matrix properties such as
   wettability, permeability, and fracture spacing and to external
   parameters such as schedule of brine compositions and injection rate.
   Our model illustrates that one cannot use conventional reservoir
   modeling to capture accurately the behavior we observe. The rate of
   recovery and the level of recovery have a strong dependency on the
   component chemistry and its distribution. A significant feature of
   gradual WA by injecting a component is that the rate of fluid transfer
   is maintained between matrix and fracture. The resulting recovery
   profile after water breakthrough can behave close to linear as opposed
   to the square-root-of-time profile that is observed when the wetting
   state is fixed (Rangel-German and Kovscek 2002). The water will
   typically break through early as dictated by the initial POW state, but
   a higher final recovery will be obtained because higher saturations can
   imbibe. Improved understanding of the coupling between WA controlled by
   water/rock chemistry and fracture/matrix flow is highly relevant for
   gaining more insight into recovery from naturally fractured reservoirs.}},

   solvability of linear programs can be expressed in fixed-point logic
   with counting (FPC) as long as the program is given by a separation
   oracle that is itself definable in FPC. We use this to show that the
   size of a maximum matching in a graph is definable in FPC. This settles
   an open problem first posed by Blass, Gurevich and Shelah {[}Blass et
   al. 1999]. On the way to defining a suitable separation oracle for the
   maximum matching program, we provide FPC formulas defining canonical
   maximum flows and minimum cuts in undirected capacitated graphs.}},

Abstract = {{We document a strong correlation in the brand of automobile chosen by
   parents and their adult children, using data from the Panel Study of
   Income Dynamics. This correlation could represent transmission of brand
   preferences across generations, or it could result from correlation in
   family characteristics that determine brand choice. We present a variety
   of empirical specifications that lend support to the former
   interpretation and to a mechanism that relies at least in part on state
   dependence. We then discuss implications of intergenerational brand
   preference transmission for automakers' product-line strategies and for
   the strategic pricing of vehicles to different age groups.}},

Journal = {{LAW AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study examined the effects of repeated questions (n = 12,169) on 6-
   to 12-year-olds' testimony in child sexual abuse cases. We examined
   transcripts of direct-and cross-examinations of 120 children,
   categorizing how attorneys asked repeated questions in-court and how
   children responded. Defense attorneys repeated more questions (33.6\% of
   total questions asked) than prosecutors (17.8\%) and repeated questions
   using more suggestive prompts (38\% of their repeated questions) than
   prosecutors (15\%). In response, children typically repeated or
   elaborated on their answers and seldom contradicted themselves.
   Self-contradictions were most often elicited by suggestive and
   option-posing prompts posed by either type of attorney. Child age did
   not affect the numbers of questions repeated, the types of prompts used
   by attorneys to repeat questions, or how children responded to
   repetition. Most (61.5\%) repeated questions were repeated more than
   once and, as repetition frequency increased, so did the number of
   self-contradictions. ``Asked-and-answered{''} objections were rarely
   raised (n = 45) and were more likely to be overruled than sustained by
   judges. Findings suggest that attorneys frequently ask children
   ``risky{''} repeated questions. Both attorneys and the judiciary need
   more training in identifying and restricting the unnecessary repetition
   of questions.}},

Title = {{A Protocol to Reduce Interobserver Variability in the Computed

Journal = {{CRANIOMAXILLOFACIAL TRAUMA \& RECONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{289-298}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Orbital fracture detection and size determination from computed
   tomography (CT) scans affect the decision to operate, the type of
   surgical implant used, and postoperative outcomes. However, the lack of
   standardization of radiological signs often leads to the false-positive
   detection of orbital fractures, while nonstandardized landmarks lead to
   inaccurate defect measurements. We aim to design a novel protocol for CT
   measurement of orbital floor fractures and evaluate the interobserver
   variability on CT scan images. Qualitative aspects of this protocol
   include identifying direct and indirect signs of orbital fractures on CT
   scan images. Quantitative aspects of this protocol include measuring the
   surface area of pure orbital floor fractures using computer software. In
   this study, 15 independent observers without clinical experience in
   orbital fracture detection and measurement measured the orbital floor
   fractures of three randomly selected patients following the protocol.
   The time required for each measurement was recorded. The intraclass
   correlation coefficient of the surface area measurements is 0.999
   (0.997-1.000) with p-value<0.001. This suggests that any observer
   measuring the surface area will obtain a similar estimation of the
   fractured surface area. The maximum error limit was 0.901 cm(2) which is
   less than the margin of error of 1 cm(2) in mesh trimming for orbital
   reconstruction. The average duration required for each measurement was 3
   minutes 19seconds (ranging from 1 minute 35seconds to 5 minutes).
   Measurements performed with our novel protocol resulted in minimal
   interobserver variability. This protocol is effective and generated
   reproducible results, is easy to teach and utilize, and its findings can
   be interpreted easily.}},

   equilibrium in the gut (i. e., dysbiosis) has been associated with
   several pathological processes, including obesity and its related
   comorbidities, with diet being a strong determinant of gut microbial
   balance. In this review, we discuss the potential prebiotic effect of

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic eutrophication conditioned frequent and-more pronounced

   microalgae species from Curonian Lagoon that could be prospective
   candidates for cultivation in Lithuania, and statistically determine how
   the accumulation of their biomass correlated with the changes in
   environmental conditions, using five years monitoring data. Five
   species, frequently acquiring a much larger biomass (up to 70 mg/L) over
   other species, were identified: Aphanizonzenon flos-aquae, Planktothrix

   semiconductor equipments. The X-ray diffraction for these oxidized
   copper powders is performed to identify the different oxide phases and
   its crystal structures. The morphology of the oxidized and pure copper
   particles has been observed using the scanning electron microscopy. The
   EDX analysis has been carried out to determine the oxide phases. The
   different oxide phases present in the oxidized samples are confirmed
   from Raman spectra analysis. The dielectric properties of these powdered
   samples are evaluated using the transmission coefficient data measured
   by the vector network analyzer in the X-band of microwave frequency
   range. The dielectric constant and the effective conductivity
   (dielectric loss) are increased with the increase in powder density of
   pure as well as oxidized copper powders. However, the real part of the
   complex permittivity and the effective conductivity (dielectric loss)
   are getting reduced with increasing the volume fraction of oxide phases.
   The prepared dendrite shaped oxidized electrolytic copper is the unique
   candidate in the preparation of composite which is used as a
   heatradiating board of the semiconductor equipment, an electrostatic
   adsorption device, and a dielectric board of the electrostatic
   adsorption device. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Greater plant defence is predicted to evolve at lower latitudes in
   response to increased herbivore pressure. However, recent studies
   question the generality of this pattern. In this study, we tested for
   genetically based latitudinal clines in resistance to herbivores and
   underlying defence traits of Oenothera biennis. We grew plants from 137
   populations from across the entire native range of O. biennis.
   Populations from lower latitudes showed greater resistance to multiple
   specialist and generalist herbivores. These patterns were associated
   with an increase in total phenolics at lower latitudes. A significant
   proportion of the phenolics were driven by the concentrations of two
   major ellagitannins, which exhibited opposing latitudinal clines. Our
   analyses suggest that these findings are unlikely to be explained by
   local adaptation of herbivore populations or genetic variation in
   phenology. Rather greater herbivory at high latitudes can be explained
   by latitudinal clines in the evolution of plant defences.}},

Abstract = {{This paper re-investigates public debt sustainability in the case of
   five European Union ( EU) countries, i.e. Greece, Ireland, Italy,
   Portugal, and Spain, under bailout programmes or under fiscal
   consolidation measures, spanning the period 1980-2014. The empirical
   analysis makes use of methodologies in non-linear unit root testing and
   the results provide robust evidence in favour of public debt
   sustainability only for two countries, Ireland and Portugal. These
   findings suggest that the current austerity programmes implemented by
   these economies, especially the Greek government, is expected to trigger
   upward debt spirals, contributing to further fiscal unsustainability.
   Growth oriented policies should be the primary ingredient of a different
   programme for these countries to fiscally and economically survive.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization has the potential to dramatically affect insect populations
   worldwide, although its effects on pollinator populations are just
   beginning to be understood. We compared the immunocompetency of honey
   bees sampled from feral (wild-living) and managed (beekeeper-owned)
   honey bee colonies. We sampled foragers from feral and managed colonies
   in rural, suburban, and urban landscapes in and around Raleigh, NC, USA.
   We then analyzed adult workers using two standard bioassays for insect
   immune function (encapsulation response and phenoloxidase activity). We
   found that there was far more variation within colonies for
   encapsulation response or phenoloxidase activity than among rural to
   urban landscapes, and we did not observe any significant difference in
   immune response between feral and managed bees. These findings suggest
   that social pollinators, like honey bees, may be sufficiently robust or
   variable in their immune responses to obscure any subtle effects of
   urbanization. Additional studies of immune physiology and disease
   ecology of social and solitary bees in urban, suburban, and natural
   ecosystems will provide insights into the relative effects of changing
   urban environments on several important factors that influence
   pollinator productivity and health.}},

Abstract = {{Power and energy measurement and monitoring is a key factor for many
   industries in terms of energy and cost efficiency evaluation. Due to
   trends of Smart Grid concept application in industrial environment,

   industry-widely uses industrial robots that have dynamic
   load-characteristics for which faster measurement equipment is-needed.
   This paper gives a brief description of the developed power measurement
   equipment, its structure and interconnection with industrial Profinet
   network. Further as a testing method steady state and dynamic loads are
   selected and analyzed. For testing, specially created industrial DC-Grid
   testing environment and equipment was used. Testing results show that
   the selected method and idea is working and is able to measure dynamic
   loads with high resolution. For other industrial load types there is a
   discussion going on about the issue of how detailed the resolution is

Abstract = {{Background: Gastrojejunocolic fistula (GJCF) is a late and severe
   complication of a stomal ulcer after gastrojejunostomy, which develops
   as a result of inadequate resection of stomach or incomplete vagotomy.
   The occurrence of perforation in a GJCF is even more a rare complication
   because long evolution time or latent period is required for its
   appearance. Patients with this condition usually present with diarrhea,
   weight loss, feculent vomiting, under-nutrition and features of
   peritonitis that require immediate surgical intervention.
   Case presentation: We described two cases of gastrojejunocolic fistula
   in men aged 60 and 40, first cases of gastrojejunocolic fistula seen in
   our referral hospital and in the whole region following more than a
   decade after gastrojejunostomy. Both patients initially presented with
   watery diarrhea, vomiting of fecal materials, poor appetite and weight
   loss. Upper GI series or barium enema studies allowed a conclusive
   diagnosis to be made. Both patients underwent one-stage en bloc
   resection, and their postoperative course and outcome was one cure and
   one death.
   Conclusion: As it is rare phenomenon, high clinical suspicion is very
   important in the diagnosis of GJCF on patients who manifest with chronic
   diarrhea, vomiting of fecal matter, abdominal pain and features of
   malnutrition. Careful preoperative preparation is mandatory before any
   type of surgical procedure is carried out. Pre-operative nutritional
   status should be evaluated in patients undergoing corrective surgery.
   Adequate resection of the stomach after Gastrojejunostomy and complete
   vagotomy is important to prevention development of GJCF. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{The present article deals with the nonlinear vibration and instability
   analysis of a bonded double-smart composite microplate system (DSCMPS)
   conveying microflow based on nonlocal piezoelasticity theory. Two
   microplates are connected together by visco-Pasternak medium and both of
   them made of poly-vinylidene fluoride reinforced by double walled boron
   nitride nanotubes (DWBNNTs). Modified Navier-Stokes relation is used to
   evaluate fluid-microplate interaction considering the effects of bulk
   viscosity and slip boundary condition. Energy method and Hamilton's
   principle are employed to derive motion equations with regard to von
   Karman geometric nonlinearity. Also, charge equation is used to consider
   electromechanical coupling. Due to existence of nonlinear terms, the
   governing equations are solved with the help of the differential
   quadrature method (DQM). A detailed parametric study is conducted to
   elucidate the effects of the flow velocity, fluid viscosity, Knudsen
   number, type of elastic medium, temperature change, small scale, aspect
   ratio, volume fraction, and orientation angle of the DWBNNTs on the
   vibration and instability behaviors of the coupled DSCMPS. This study
   might be helpful for the design of nano-electro-mechanical systems/

Abstract = {{In many microeconometric models we use distances. For instance, in
   modelling the individual behavior in labor economics or in health
   studies, the distance from a relevant point of interest (such as a
   hospital or a workplace) is often used as a predictor in a regression
   framework. However, in order to preserve confidentiality, spatial
   micro-data are often geo-masked, thus reducing their quality and
   dramatically distorting the inferential conclusions. In particular in
   this case, a measurement error is introduced in the independent variable
   which negatively affects the properties of the estimators. This paper
   studies these negative effects, discusses their consequences, and
   suggests possible interpretations and directions to data producers, end
   users, and practitioners.}},

Abstract = {{Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) has been studied in many
   models of injury, healing, and infective processes, but its role in
   development has not been explored. In our study of the sciatic nerve in
   SLPI null mutant (SLPI KO) mice, we observed a large aberrant blood
   vessel within the sciatic nerve and conducted a histological survey to
   characterize the morphology of this vessel. We first compared the gross
   morphology of the sciatic nerve in wild type and SLPI KO mice and
   attempted to identify the origin of the aberrant vessel. We then
   examined the cross-sectional morphology of the aberrant blood vessel in
   SLPI KO mice at several stages of postnatal development using
   histological staining and electron microscopy. We observed that the
   vessel is very prominent, being as large as or larger than the
   individual fascicles in the sciatic nerve, and that the vessels are
   frequently found bilaterally in both sciatic nerves. We believe the
   vessel to be an artery due to its morphological characteristics. In
   addition, the aberrant vessel is present as early as post-natal day 1
   and at all ages surveyed in SLPI KO mice, which suggests that SLPI may
   play a role in the development of blood vessels. This work may have
   implications for the study of angiogenesis in cancer, peripheral
   vascular disease, diabetes, and the revascularization of tissue after
   injury.}},

Volume = {{79}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore the association between depressive symptom history
   and cancer incidence.
   Methods: Affective/emotional depressive symptoms were assessed using the
   General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-30) depression sub-scale across phase
   1 (1985-1988), phase 2 (1989-1990), and phase 3 (1991-1994) of the
   Whitehall II prospective cohort study; `chronic' = depressive episode at
   phase 1,2 and 3; `new' = depressive episode at phase 3 only. Cancer
   incidence was obtained from the National Health Service Central Register
   with an average follow-up of 15.6 years (range 0.08-17.4). The study
   sample consisted of 6983 participants, aged 35-55 years at baseline.
   Results were adjusted for age, sex, socio-economic position, health
   behaviours, health status/conditions, medication, and social support.
   Results: Over a 17.4 year follow-up, chronic depressive symptoms did not
   increase the risk of cancer incidence compared to those who never
   experienced symptoms (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.03, 95\% confidence interval
   (CI): 0.71-1.49). Participants who experienced new depressive symptoms
   had an increased risk of cancer incidence in the first 9 years of
   follow-up (HR = 1.89, 95\% Cl: 123-2.90) but no increased risk in later
   years (HR = 0.84, 95\% CI: 0.52-135).
   Conclusion: Chronic depressive symptoms were not associated with cancer
   incidence. In contrast, new-onset symptoms were associated with a
   substantially increased risk, possibly due to reverse causality. (C)

Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{182-190}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{David Malouf's novel Remembering Babylon did not, like Athena, spring
   fully formed from the head of Zeus. It is equally doubtful that the
   novel was inspired by some mystic muse. Malouf seems to have employed
   the scholarly methodology of practice-led research to write Remembering
   Babylon, gathering information from historical and literary sources,
   selecting and rejecting specific elements from these sources, then
   subjecting what he had chosen to his creative imagination. In the
   afterword, Malouf acknowledges the historical Gemmy Morrell's name and
   his actual words as the `seed of this fiction' but `otherwise this novel
   has no origin in fact.' This article will investigate specific citations
   included by the author and reflect on their relationship to imaginings
   of `nature.' The selections will be chosen because of their particular
   resonance with the human-nature relationship. While the post-colonial
   implications of the novel are well established, the exploration of the
   unusual citation inclusions and exclusions extends understanding of
   another preoccupation within the work's creative construction: an
   explicit focus on human relationships with the natural world. The
   attitude to nature in Remembering Babylon can be read eco-critically as
   establishing the impossibility of eco-poiesis, enacting Kate Rigby's
   notion that the literary text can `save the earth by disclosing the
   non-equation of the word and thing, poem and place'. In this sense,
   Remembering Babylon is a transcendent act of eco-critical world-making,
   not because it reflects the natural world in mimetic veracity, but
   because it represents moments of the natural world as beyond language
   and creates brief moments of human collapse into, and synthesis with,
   nature.}},

Abstract = {{This article takes its title from a 1973 letter in which Gilles Deleuze
   describes ``the history of philosophy as a kind of buggery{''} that

   which would be his and which would at the same time be a monster.{''} My
   suggestion is that we keep this in mind when considering Deleuze's
   engagement with Beckett, particularly as Deleuze becomes increasingly
   important in Beckett territory. Deleuze's readings of Beckett neglect
   Beckett's early work-work that demonstrates a parodic engagement with
   the very idea of Deleuze-esque philosophies of movement and freedom.
   What Deleuze celebrates as the rhizomatic place where things pick up
   speed, Beckett describes as ``an unsurveyed marsh of sloth.{''} I return
   to Beckett's More Pricks Than Kicks and Dream of Fair to Middling Women
   to sketch a line between thinking philosophically and the concretion of
   ideas and method into a philosophy.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Epidermal growth factor receptor variant Ill is
   a common mutation in glioblastoma, found in approximately 25\% of
   tumors. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III may accelerate
   angiogenesis in malignant gliomas. We correlated T1-weighted dynamic
   contrast-enhanced MR imaging perfusion parameters with epidermal growth
   factor receptor variant III status.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-two consecutive patients with glioblastoma
   and known epidermal growth factor receptor variant III status who had
   dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging before surgery were evaluated.
   Volumes of interest were drawn around the entire enhancing tumor on
   contrast T1-weighted images and then were transferred onto coregistered
   dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging perfusion maps. Histogram analysis
   with normalization was performed to determine the relative mean, 75th
   percentile, and 90th percentile values for plasma volume and contrast
   transfer coefficient. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was applied to assess the
   relationship between baseline perfusion parameters and positive
   epidermal growth factor receptor variant III status. The receiver
   operating characteristic method was used to select the cutoffs of the
   dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging perfusion parameters.
   RESULTS: Increased relative plasma volume and increased relative
   contrast transfer coefficient parameters were both significantly
   associated with positive epidermal growth factor receptor variant Ill
   status. For epidermal growth factor receptor variant III positive
   tumors, relative plasma volume mean was 9.3 and relative contrast
   transfer coefficient mean was 6.5; for epidermal growth factor receptor
   variant III negative tumors, relative plasma volume mean was 3.6 and
   relative contrast transfer coefficient mean was 3.7 (relative plasma
   volume mean, P<.001, and relative contrast transfer coefficient mean,
   P=.008). The predictive powers of relative plasma volume histogram
   metrics outperformed those of the relative contrast transfer coefficient
   histogram metrics (P<=.004).
   CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging shows greater
   perfusion and leakiness in epidermal growth factor receptor variant III
   positive glioblastomas than in epidermal growth factor receptor variant
   III negative glioblastomas, consistent with the known effect of
   epidermal growth factor receptor variant III on angiogenesis.
   Quantitative evaluation of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging may be
   useful as a noninvasive tool for correlating epidermal growth factor
   receptor variant III expression and related tumor neoangiogenesis. This
   potential may have implications for monitoring response to epidermal
   growth factor receptor variant III targeted therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Apple snails, P. canaliculata and P. maculata are the two most
   successful invaders of many macrophytes especially rice in many
   countries of the world particularly Southeast Asia. Many studies have
   been conducted on ecology and management of P. canaliculata but little
   is known about the life cycle of P. maculata especially on rice.
   Therefore, comparative life cycle studies of P. maculata and P.
   canaliculata were conducted on rice. Results suggested that P.
   canaliculata showed significantly higher growth than P. maculata and
   matured during the 27th week of development, whereas the latter matured
   during the 32nd week. At maturity, no difference was recorded between
   two species for shell length and width. However, individuals of both
   species started consuming rice during the 4th week of the development.
   Shell length and width of both species were highly correlated with each
   other during the entire growth. Egg diameter was significantly higher in
   P. canaliculata than P. maculata, however, no significant difference was
   observed in the number of eggs, hatching period and rate for the two
   species. The results obtained can be utilized for the rearing technique
   of Pomacea spp. on rice to maintain cultures of different stages to
   study their unique features contributing to their successful invasion,
   and suggest appropriate management strategies to reduce their damage and

Abstract = {{We present a local convergence analysis of an eighth order three step
   method in order to approximate a locally unique solution of nonlinear
   equation in a Banach space setting. In an earlier study by Sharma and
   Arora (2015), the order of convergence was shown using Taylor series
   expansions and hypotheses up to the fourth order derivative or even
   higher of the function involved which restrict the applicability of the
   proposed scheme. However, only first order derivative appears in the
   proposed scheme. In order to overcome this problem, we proposed the
   hypotheses up to only the first order derivative. In this way, we not
   only expand the applicability of the methods but also propose
   convergence domain. Finally, where earlier studies cannot be applied, a
   variety of concrete numerical examples are proposed to obtain the
   solutions of nonlinear equations. Our study does not exhibit this type
   of problem/restriction.}},

Volume = {{159}},

Abstract = {{A regolith map for the Lawra Belt has been developed by categorising the
   regolith-landform units by processing and interpreting remote sensing
   data. Regolith landform units were extracted from Landsat band ratios
   3/1 and 5/4 to map ferruginous saprolite and lags; band ratio 5/7 was
   used to identify residual regolith and band ratio 4/2 was employed to
   separate ferruginous units from non-ferruginous regolith. Additional
   regolith landform units' discrimination was provided by compiling and
   interpolating radiometric data particularly for Landsat TM poorly
   defined areas. SRTM images were used to mark out the extent of the
   alluvial plains. High topographical terrains were marked from DEM image
   to represent the residual areas. Regolith landform unit (RLU) map that
   showed residual (relict and erosional), ferruginous, and depositional
   domains of the Lawra Belt was developed by superimposing the extractions
   made from the remote sensed data. Interpretive map generated from the
   remote sensed image analysis was validated by first creating a
   non-genetic regolith map through ground truth survey. The non-genetic
   map based on spatial distributions of the different regolith mapping
   units were classified on genetic classes or regimes based on
   regolith-landform similarities to develop a genetic map. The
   interpretive and the genetic map were superimposed to develop the
   regolith map for the Lawra Belt. The inliers and outliers presenting
   compositional overlaps within broad regolith classes were rectified from
   the field mapping information. Thecombined approach of image analysis
   and the ground truth mapping grouped the regolith of Lawra Belt into
   ferruginous (F), relict (R), erosional (E) and depositional (D) regimes.

Abstract = {{Accurately identifying malignant components in patients with pancreatic
   intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) remains challenging.
   Preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a marker of poor
   prognosis in patients with several types of malignancy. This study
   assessed whether NLR was predictive of intraductal papillary mucinous
   carcinoma (IPMC) in patients with IPMN.
   This study retrospectively assessed 76 patients who underwent curative
   resection for IPMN from 1995 to 2015. The correlation between the
   presence of malignant components and preoperative NLR was analyzed.
   Preoperative NLR in IPMC was significantly higher in patients with in
   IPMC (2.51 +/- 0.84) than in patients with intraductal papillary
   mucinous adenoma (2.01 +/- 0.71, P = 0.0079) and healthy volunteers
   (1.37 +/- 0.33, P < 0.0001). NLR was significantly reduced after
   curative tumor resection. The main duct type (P = 0.0231) and NLR >
   2.074 (P = 0.0329) were independent predictors of IPMC in all patients.
   Combined criteria including international consensus guidelines, CA19-9 >
   37 IU/ml, and NLR > 2.074 shows a high positive predictive value of 78
   \% and high specificity of 96 \%.
   Preoperative NLR is a useful supportive marker to predict IPMC in
   patients with IPMN.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{A methodology is developed for the design of an air-cooled 55-kW-rated
   inverter heat sink. The design constraints are that the power density
   (PD) must meet or exceed the values associated with liquid-cooled
   systems of the same power rating, and that the maximum surface
   temperatures be less than 200 degrees C. To keep the pressure drop low
   relative to turbulent flow designs, a laminar flow regime is chosen. A
   preliminary design that satisfies the PD constraint exactly, and the
   thermal requirements approximately, is determined. To ensure that the
   thermal requirements are met by the design configuration, a
   thermal-fluid analysis based on a three-dimensional conjugate heat
   transfer model is conducted. Overall, energy balance errors (OEBEs) as
   high as 15\% were encountered in the numerical models. These errors are
   reduced by taking advantage of the symmetry between fins using a typical
   unit cell model. A new simplified approach for the simulations was
   identified which involved modeling fins as highly conductive layers
   instead of solid domains. This further reduced the OEBEs to less than
   0.004\%. The design factors considered in this study include effective
   cooling surface area, fin thickness, fin spacing, and fin height. The
   results show that the maximum surface temperatures can be kept below 200
   degrees C for safe operation of SiC devices in the inverter module while
   increasing the PD.}},

Abstract = {{Separation of biopolymers is one of increasingly important applications
   of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes. The efficiency of separation is often
   evaluated through pilot experiments and seldom predicted. Available
   predictions focus on correlations between UF pore width and biopolymer
   hydrodynamic diameter, while overlooking key operational parameters
   including transmembrane pressure (TMP). The role of TMP in the retention
   of biopolymers is revealed, i.e., magnification of TMP leads to
   decreased retention of the particulates. No full retention of the
   biopolymers without a rigid outer shell has been observed.
   Pressure-induced stretching of flexible biopolymers and expansion of
   membrane pores are the possible reasons of deteriorating selectivity. A
   division into flexible and rigid biopolymers provides a better
   prediction of membrane selectivity.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Kangaroos and kin (superfamily Macropodoidea) are the principal endemic
   herbivores of Australia and the most diverse radiation of marsupial
   herbivores ever to have evolved. As is typical of other herbivore groups
   (e.g. bovids), dietary niches span fruit, fungi, dicot leaves and
   monocot grasses in both specialists and generalists, but to date dietary
   classification has been largely ad hoc and poorly tied to actual dietary
   ecological data. Here we provide a simple dietary classification of the
   Macropodoidea based on an extensive literature survey. Intake of four
   major dietary items - grasses, dicot leaves, fruits and seeds, and fungi
   - was assessed using proportional intake for 19 species and categorical
   (ranked intake) data for 37 species. Statistical comparisons with
   cluster and principal components analyses aligned species into four
   dietary groups. Members of the first group have diets that primarily
   consist of fungi and fruits. Relative proportions of grasses to dicot
   leaves separate the remaining species into browser (more than 70\%
   dicots), grazer (more than 70\% grasses) and mixed feeder groups.
   Comparison of our diet-based classification with a prevailing scheme
   based on dental morphology suggests that most species with what has
   traditionally been viewed as a browser-grade dentition' are actually
   mixed feeders. This suggests that either morphology and diet are not
   tightly linked or that morphological differences between the dentitions
   of browsers and mixed feeders are subtle and have been overlooked. A
   positive correlation was found between body mass and average
   proportional intake of grass in the diet of macropodoids. This parallels
   the situation found in bovids, as well as the percentage cut-off between
   dietary groups. These trends suggest that some underlying
   ecophysiological constraints may influence food choice in mammalian
   herbivores providing useful pointers to the diets of extinct taxa.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveWe model Pickett's Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg to see
   whether the Confederates could have achieved victory by committing more
   infantry, executing a better barrage, or facing a weaker defense.
   MethodsOur mathematical modeling is based on Lanchester equations,
   calibrated using historical army strengths. We weight the Union
   artillery and infantry two different ways using two sources of data, and
   so have four versions of the model.
   ResultsThe models estimate that a successful Confederate charge would
   have required at least one to three additional brigades. An improved
   artillery barrage would have reduced these needs by about one brigade. A
   weaker Union defense could have allowed the charge to succeed as
   executed.
   ConclusionsThe Confederates plausibly had enough troops to take the
   Union position and alter the battle's outcome, but likely too few to
   further exploit such a success.}},

Abstract = {{The design and control of power take-off systems (PTO) of wave energy
   converters (WECs) require in-depth analysis in order to ascertain their
   energy capabilities and operation boundaries. However, many of the
   properties of the PTO system can be difficult to replicate in numerical
   simulations. The use of electrical research test infrastructures
   incorporating hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation can be used instead
   to investigate the operation of the device using real electrical
   equipment and measured signals, in combination with the simulated
   numerical model. This paper will demonstrate the methodology of
   integrating a WEC into an electrical test infrastructure incorporating
   HIL, and adapting the WEC to fit to the physical limitations of the
   infrastructure. Four case studies of oscillating water column devices,
   at various stages of development progress, are used to illustrate the
   procedures. The results show the benefits and limitations of using the
   electrical test infrastructure, and the lessons learned that must be
   taken into account for future tests. Finally, recommendations are made
   on how electrical test infrastructures may be advanced in order to
   accelerate the development of WECs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Podophyllotoxin (PPT) is a plant natural product that serves as a
   precursor for the synthesis of many well-known chemotherapeutic drugs.
   The limited availability and high demand for the source plants of PPT
   have led to the exploration of alternative sources for this compound. In
   this study, we utilized the endophytic fungus Phialocephala podophylli
   (strain PPE7) that we isolated from the rhizomes of Podophyllum peltatum
   and is known to produce detectable amounts of PPT in broth culture. To
   date, the complete PPT biosynthetic pathway has yet to be determined in
   any species. Since fungi are well known for clustering genes that belong
   to secondary metabolite pathways, use of a fungal system for
   investigation of the PPT biosynthesis genes may ultimately lead to
   elucidation of the entire pathway. In this study, we investigated the
   secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase (SD) gene that facilitates the
   dehydrogenation of secoisolariciresinol to form matairesinol, a
   mid-pathway intermediate product in PPT biosynthesis. We utilized PCR
   amplification to acquire the complete SD gene sequence in PPE7 and opted
   to synthesize the P. peltatum SD sequence for expression. Through
   western blotting, we confirmed the expression of the recombinant SD
   (PpSD) and verified protein functionality with a bioconversion assay
   followed by HPLC and LC-MS analyses. Here, we report the identification
   of the SD gene in PPE7; this is the first report of the SD gene in an
   endophytic fungus. Additionally, we established the groundwork for the
   future expression of the complete PPT biosynthetic pathway in the
   heterologous host Pichia pastoris.}},

Volume = {{784}},
Pages = {{252-273}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulation are used to
   investigate the evolution of a symmetrically unstable uniform frontal
   zone. Simulations in a three-dimensional computational domain capable of
   resolving near-symmetric currents develop strong nonlinearities without
   the emergence of pure symmetric instability. Linear stability analysis
   demonstrates that for ft > 1 (f is the Coriolis parameter and t denotes
   time) the flow generates strongly asymmetric structures which become
   nearly symmetric when ft >> 1. Unlike the currents generated during pure
   symmetric instability, near-symmetric instability generates currents
   that do not align with isopycnals. This greatly modifies their
   energetics and evolution, leading to regions of the flow that are
   unstable to gravitational instability and energized by the reservoir of
   available potential energy. A high-resolution simulation demonstrates
   the flow evolution from near-symmetric currents to secondary
   shear-convective instabilities and finally, through tertiary
   instabilities, to fully three-dimensional turbulence. The effect of this
   sequence of instabilities is quantified through velocity and vorticity
   statistics as well as budgets for turbulent kinetic and potential
   energy. It is not until ft similar to 10 that the energy source for
   fluctuations is primarily shear, in contrast to the purely symmetric
   instability which draws its energy exclusively from shear production.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Administrative data can be used to determine optimal
   management of febrile infants and aid clinical practice guideline
   development.
   OBJECTIVE: Determine the most accurate International Classification of
   Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis coding strategies for
   identification of febrile infants.
   DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study.
   SETTING: Eight emergency departments in the Pediatric Health Information
   System.
   PATIENTS: Infants aged <90 days evaluated between July 1, 2012 and June
   30, 2013 were randomly selected for medical record review from 1 of 4
   ICD-9 diagnosis code groups: (1) discharge diagnosis of fever, (2)
   admission diagnosis of fever without discharge diagnosis of fever, (3)
   discharge diagnosis of serious infection without diagnosis of fever, and
   (4) no diagnosis of fever or serious infection.
   EXPOSURE: The ICD-9 diagnosis code groups were compared in 4
   case-identification algorithms to a reference standard of fever >= 100.4
   degrees F documented in the medical record.
   MEASUREMENTS: Algorithm predictive accuracy was measured using
   sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values.
   RESULTS: Among 1790 medical records reviewed, 766 (42.8\%) infants had
   fever. Discharge diagnosis of fever demonstrated high specificity
   (98.2\%, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 97.8-98.6) but low sensitivity
   (53.2\%, 95\% CI: 50.0-56.4). A case-identification algorithm of
   admission or discharge diagnosis of fever exhibited higher sensitivity
   (71.1\%, 95\% CI: 68.2-74.0), similar specificity (97.7\%, 95\% CI:
   97.3-98.1), and the highest positive predictive value (86.9\%, 95\% CI:
   84.5-89.3).
   CONCLUSIONS: A case-identification strategy that includes admission or
   discharge diagnosis of fever should be considered for febrile infant
   studies using administrative data, though underclassification of
   patients is a potential limitation. (C) 2015 Society of Hospital

Abstract = {{We report the fabrication and characterization of a prototype integrated
   photonic-lantern for operation in the mid-IR (lambda = 3.39 mu m). The
   device was fabricated in a commercial gallium lanthanum sulphide
   chalcogenide glass substrate using ultrafast laser inscription. It was
   formed by inscribing a two-dimensional array of single-mode waveguides,
   which were then brought increasingly close together to form a single
   multimode waveguide. We demonstrate that the lantern successfully
   transforms particular single-mode states into well-defined coherent
   multimode states, with a loss comparable to that of a straight
   single-mode waveguide of the same length as the lantern (similar to 1.6
   dB). We conclude, therefore, that the device should also work equally
   well in the reverse direction, thus enabling the low-loss conversion of
   mid-IR multimode states of light into discrete single-modes. This
   technology may be useful in a variety of emerging areas, including
   free-space laser communications and mid-infrared heterodyne
   spectroscopy.}},

Title = {{An efficient finite-difference scheme for computation of electron states
   in free-standing and core-shell quantum wires}},

Abstract = {{The electron states in axially symmetric quantum wires are computed by
   means of the effective-mass Schrodinger equation, which is written in
   cylindrical coordinates phi, rho, and z. We show that a direct
   discretization of the Schrodinger equation by central finite differences
   leads to a non-symmetric Hamiltonian matrix. Because diagonalization of
   such matrices is more complex it is advantageous to transform it in a
   symmetric form. This can be done by the Liouville-like transformation
   proposed by Rizea et al. (2008), which replaces the wave function
   psi(rho) with the function F(rho) = psi(rho)root rho and transforms the
   Hamiltonian accordingly. Even though a symmetric Hamiltonian matrix is
   produced by this procedure, the computed wave functions are found to be
   inaccurate near the origin, and the accuracy of the energy levels is not
   very high. In order to improve on this, we devised a finite-difference
   scheme which discretizes the Schrodinger equation in the first step, and
   then applies the Liouville-like transformation to the difference
   equation. Such a procedure gives a symmetric Hamiltonian matrix,
   resulting in an accuracy comparable to the one obtained with the finite
   element method. The superior efficiency of the new finite-difference
   scheme (FDM) is demonstrated for a few p-dependent one-dimensional
   potentials which are usually employed to model the electron states in
   free-standing and core shell quantum wires. The new scheme is compared
   with the other FDM schemes for solving the effective-mass Schrodinger
   equation, and is found to deliver energy levels with much smaller
   numerical error for all the analyzed potentials. It also gives more
   accurate results than the scheme of Rizea et al., except for the ground
   state of an infinite rectangular potential in freestanding quantum
   wires. Moreover, the PT symmetry is invoked to explain similarities and
   differences between the considered FDM schemes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: The objectives of this study were, first, to
   explore the prevalence of aggressors with lifetime intimate partner
   violence (IPV) among patients in the Proyecto Hombre of Navarra (Spain)
   addiction treatment programme; and second, to know the specific and
   differential characteristics of patients presenting IPV as aggressors.
   Methods: A sample of 162 patients (119 men and 43 women) was assessed.
   Data on socio-demographic and substance consumption characteristics, IPV
   variables, psychopathological symptoms, and personality variables were
   obtained. The profiles of patients in addiction treatment with and
   without a history of violence towards their partners were compared.
   Results: The results showed that 33.6\% of people in treatment for
   addiction had committed violence against their partners. This prevalence
   was significantly higher (x(2) = 15.6, p<. 001) in women (63.3\%) than
   in men (24.2\%). In the 98.4\% of the cases the IPV was bidirectional.
   Patients with a history of IPV perpetration showed greater severity in
   substance consumption variables, psychopathological symptoms, and
   personality traits. Gender, the family scale on the European version of
   the Addiction Severity Index (EuropASI), and the aggressive-sadistic
   scale on the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI-III) were the
   main variables related to the presence of IPV as aggressors.
   Conclusions and Scientific Significance: There was a differential
   profile in patients with IPV perpetration, showing more
   psychopathological and personality symptoms. Moreover, in this study
   being a woman was one of the main predictors of committing IPV.}},

Abstract = {{Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), originally identified as a longevity gene, is induced
   by caloric restriction, and regulates various cellular functions
   including DNA repair, cell survival and metabolism via the deacetylation
   of target proteins such as histone and p53. These functions are
   considered to act dualistically as preventing or facilitating cancer.
   This study aimed to clarify the expression and role of SIRT1 in
   endonnetrial carcinoma. Because a high-calorie diet was a well-known
   risk factor for endometrial carcinoma, we first hypothesized that SIRT1
   might be downregulated in normal endometrial glandular cells of obese
   women. However, no correlation was observed between the expression of
   SIRT1 and body mass index (BMI). In contrast, regardless of BMI, the
   immunohistochemical expression of SIRT1 was significantly higher in
   endometrial carcinoma (108 cases) than in normal endonnetria (60 cases)
   (P<0.05), and its overexpression was associated with a shorter survival
   (P<0.05). Our experiments in vivo revealed that SIRT1 accelerated the
   proliferation of endometrial carcinoma cell lines (HHUA, HEC151, and
   HEC1B). SIRT1 overexpression significantly enhanced the resistance for
   cisplatin and paclitaxel in HHUA cells. Although p53 is an important
   target protein for SIRT1, the selective SIRT1 inhibitor (EX527)
   significantly suppressed the proliferation and cisplatin resistance of
   three endonnetrial carcinoma cell lines regardless of the p53 mutation
   status. In addition, SIRT1 overexpression in HHUA cells accelerated
   tumor growth and cisplatin resistance in nude mice, and EX527
   significantly suppressed the growth of tumors of HHUA and HEC1B cells.
   No adverse effect of EX527 was observed in these mice. In conclusion,
   SIRT1 is involved in the acquisition of the aggressive behavior
   associated with endometrial carcinoma, and the SIRT1 inhibitor, EX527,
   may be a useful agent for the treatment of this malignancy.}},

Abstract = {{Phenobarbital is a phenobarbiturate used as a sedative, anticonvulsant
   or hypnotic with the doses prescribed and can cause teratogenic effects.
   The goal of this study was to examine an alternative method for the
   recognition of the mechanism or the bimolecular potential changes in
   mice fetus caused by Phenobarbital using FTIR micro spectroscopy. The
   mice were injected with Phenobarbital (120 mg/Kg) on gestation day 9.
   Fetuses were dissected on day 15 of gestation and morphological and
   histological studies on the fetus were carried out. Sections (10 mu m)
   of normal and Phenobarbital treated fetus brains and livers were used
   for FTIR measurement in the wave number region of 400-4000 cm. The
   results were shown by 2 derivatization of spectra and also subtracting
   from control spectra. In liver, the intensity at 1054 cm, 1155 cm, 1353
   cm, 1453cm, 1645 cm, 1622 cm, 2944 cm, 2913 cm and 2845 cm were shifted
   and increased. In the brain, the intensity at 879 cm, 911 cm, 955 cm,
   1223 cm, 1256 cm, 1304 cm, 1360 cm, 1453 cm, 1529 cm, 1636 cm, 2845 cm,
   2915 cm and 2950 cm were increased and shifted. The most important
   changes of the fetus brain tissue are on the beta structure of proteins
   due to the amide I bands at 1636 cm, while extensive effects on the DNA
   structure were obvious for the Phenobarbital treated liver tissues. As a
   conclusion, FTIR spectroscopy might well be assumed as a potentially
   powerful teratogenic measurement instrument with a unique ability to
   identify the modified bimolecular structures.}},

   percentages of PEI to alkylated-PLL as core. The properties of modified
   polymers including size, surface charge density, DNA condensation
   ability, buffering capacity and cytotoxicity were evaluated. According
   to transfection results, aptamer conjugated PLL-alkyl-10\%-PEI (PLPE8\%)
   was selected for further gene silencing study by plasmid shRNA. Decrease
   in Bcl-XL gene expression was estimated by both RT-PCR and westernblot
   experiments. The obtained results revealed that the new copolymers had
   appropriate nano-scale size (117-128 nm) even after aptamer conjugation
   (168-183 nm). Moreover, they exhibited increased transfection
   efficiencies by up to 1.8-5 folds and acceptable cytotoxicity. The
   apoptosis was induced in transfected cells by shRNA-aptamer-copolymer
   due to the down-regulation of mRNA and protein levels. This study
   suggested a new vector for targeted non-viral gene delivery with high
   transfection efficiency in lung cancer or pulmonary systems. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This article attempts to offer a picture of the state of the economic
   reform in Ukraine in the summer of 2015, assessing what has been done.
   It offers a periodisation of Ukraine's economic policy since its
   independence in 1991, suggesting that Ukraine has seen three periods of
   significant reform and this is by far the most important. The main cause
   of Ukraine's current economic decline is Russian warfare. The present
   situation differs greatly from that after the Orange Revolution in late
   2004. These reform efforts are more far-reaching than earlier attempts,
   especially in the energy and banking sectors. Finally, four risks to the
   present reform wave are discussed. The four big risks to this reform
   wave lie in Russian warfare, insufficient international funding, lagging
   reforms in the judicial sector, and the wearing out of the coalition
   because of economic hardship.}},

Abstract = {{Increased exposure of birds to endocrine disrupting compounds has
   resulted in developmental and reproductive dysfunctions. We have
   recently identified the flame retardants, ally1-2,4,6-tribromophenyl
   ether (TBP-AE), 2-3-dibromopropy1-2,4,6-tribromophenyl ether (TBP-DBPE)
   and the TBP-DBPE metabolite 2-bromoallyI-2,4,6-tribromophenyl ether
   (TBP-BAE) as antagonists to both the human androgen receptor (AR) and
   the zebrafish AR. In the present study, we aimed at determining whether
   these compounds also interact with the chicken AR. In silico modeling
   studies showed that TBP-AE, TBP-BAE and TBP-DBPE were able to dock into
   to the chicken AR ligand-binding pocket. In vitro transfection assays
   revealed that all three brominated compounds acted as chicken AR
   antagonists, inhibiting testosterone induced AR activation. In addition,
   qRT-PCR studies confirmed that they act as AR antagonists and
   demonstrated that they also alter gene expression patterns of apoptotic,
   anti-apoptotic, drug metabolizing and amino acid transporter genes.
   These studies, using chicken LMH cells, suggest that TBP-AE, TBP-BAE and
   TBP-DBPE are potential endocrine disrupters in chicken. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Aim This study aimed to investigate the association between obesity and
   major depression disorder (MDD) in a nationally representative sample of
   Black adolescents in the USA. The study also tested the effects of
   ethnicity and gender as possible moderators.
   Method Data came from the National Survey of American Life
   (NSAL)-Adolescents, a representative household mental health survey of
   Black adolescents in the USA. Participants consisted of 1170 Black
   adolescents (810 African Americans and 360 Caribbean Blacks). Obesity
   was defined determined by the cutoff points based on the body mass index
   (BMI) appropriate for age and gender. Twelve-month MDD was measured
   using the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic
   Interview (CIDI). In the first step, the association between obesity and
   MDD in the pooled sample, controlling for the main effects of gender and
   ethnicity. In the next steps, two interactions were tested: (1) obesity
   and ethnicity and (2) obesity and gender.
   Results Although any associations between obesity and MDD in the pooled
   sample of Blacks were not found, there was a significant interaction
   between ethnicity and obesity on MDD. Upon testing the associations
   across intersections of ethnicity and gender, a positive association was
   found among Caribbean Black females but not Caribbean Black males,
   African American males, or African American female.
   Conclusion The link between BMI and MDD among Blacks depends on
   ethnicity and gender, and risk of comorbid depression among Black youth
   with obesity is highest among Caribbean Black females.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To measure plasma nucleosome levels and expression of
   toll-like receptors (TLRs) in a pilot cohort of patients with severe
   acute kidney injury (AKI) within a randomised controlled trial of
   continuous venovenous haemofiltration with high cut-off filters
   (CVVH-HCO) v standard filters (CVVH-std).
   Methods: We measured plasma nucleosome levels using the Cell Death
   Detection ELISA PLUS (10X) assay kit. We analysed plasma levels for
   correlation with disease severity and compared the effects of CVVH-HCO
   and CVVH-std on plasma nucleosome levels over the first 72 hours. We
   studied cell surface TLR expression on CD14-positive monocytes in a
   subcohort of CVVH-HCO patients.
   Results: We did not detect nucleosomes in normal human plasma, but found
   elevated nucleosome levels in patients with severe AKI. Nucleosome
   levels at randomisation correlated weakly with Acute Physiology and
   Chronic Health Evaluation Ill scores (Pearson rho =0.475, P=0.016).
   Treatment with CVVH-HCO or CVVH-std had no effect on nucleosome levels
   over 72 hours. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) ratios of TLR2 and
   TLR4 expression were elevated throughout the 72-hour period (range for
   TLR2, 0.97-3.98; range for TLR4, 0.91-10.18) and did not appear to
   decrease as a result of treatment with CVVH-HCO.
   Conclusions: Nucleosome concentration was elevated in the plasma of
   patients with severe AKI and mildly correlated with disease severity,
   but was not affected by treatment with CVVH-HCO or CVVH-std. Similarly,
   levels of TLR2 and TLR4 expression did not decrease over time during
   CVVH-HCO treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is one of the most important marine
   resources for aquaculture in Europe, and Galicia (NW Spain) is the EU's
   leading region for production. Variation in environmental and ecological
   factors exists in Northern and Southern estuaries of this region, and
   natural selection could have modulated genetic variation among
   populations with adaptation to local conditions as the driving force.
   Results from a previous genetic study using neutral markers suggested
   subtle genetic differentiation between mussel populations from both
   estuarine areas. In this new study, mussel samples from Northern and
   Southern estuaries were brought into a common environment to test for
   proteome differences due to genetic and permanent non-genetic effects in
   populations from both estuarine areas, using both foot and mantle border
   tissues. Because the sex of the mussels was determined through
   histological tests, sex-specific effects were also examined. Evidence of
   subtle differences in the foot proteome, dependent on mussel sex, were
   detected between populations from both estuaries. These differences were
   more marked for female samples. No evidence of proteome differences was
   found for the factors estuaries and sex in mantle border tissue.
   Candidate proteins with a potential role in local adaptation were
   identified and point to molecular functions that might be involved in
   responses to different stressors.}},

Abstract = {{The work output capacity of the two-way shape memory effect (TWSME) in a
   Ni50.3Ti29.7Hf20 (at\%) high-temperature shape memory alloy (HTSMA) was
   investigated and compared to that of binary Ni49.9Ti50.1 (at\%). TWSME
   was induced through a training procedure of 100 thermomechanical cycles
   under different tensile stresses. It was observed that TWSME in
   as-extruded and trained Ni50.3Ti29.7Hf20 could produce 0.7\% strain
   against a compressive stress of 100 MPa, corresponding to a maximum work
   output of 0.08 J g(-1), compared to a maximum value of 0.06 J g(-1) for
   binary NiTi. A peak aging heat treatment of 3 h at 550 degrees C, which
   previously has been shown to result in near-perfect functional stability
   in Ni50.3Ti29.7Hf20 during isobaric thermal cycling, did not improve the
   TWSME and actually resulted in a decrease in the magnitude and stability
   of the TWSME and its work output capacity. Nevertheless, the magnitude
   of TWSM behavior of Ni50.3Ti29.7Hf20, in the absence of an aging heat
   treatment, renders it an attractive candidate for high-temperature TWSM
   actuation.}},

Abstract = {{Silica nanoparticles were synthesized and coated with goethite, creating
   a nanocomposite. The nanocomposite was tested for removal of arsenic,
   As(V), from aqueous solutions. We used scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and a Zetasizer to
   characterize particle size, surface morphology, functional groups, and
   surface charge of the nanocomposite. SEM results showed that the size of
   the synthesized silica nanoparticles ranged from 150 to 250 nm. Batch
   sorption studies were carried out on the adsorption of As(V) as a
   function of pH, contact time, initial concentration, and ionic strength.
   Maximum adsorption occurred at pH 3.0. The adsorption capacity did not
   change significantly with increasing ionic strength. A kinetics study
   revealed that adsorption of As(V) by the goethite/silica nanocomposite
   was rapid: Equilibrium was reached within 120 min. Adsorption kinetics
   followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The adsorption data were
   analyzed by both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The
   maximum adsorption capacity of goethite/silica nanocomposite for As(V)
   from the Langmuir isotherm was 17.64 mg g(-1), which is larger than that
   of several other adsorbents. The nanocomposite adsorbent showed high
   efficiency in removing arsenic from aqueous solutions, even at low
   initial concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) production has increased in Canada
   in recent years, and interest for this multipurpose crop remains high.
   The lack of agronomic guidelines for Eastern Canada represents, however,
   a limiting factor for local hemp production. This study assessed biomass
   and seed yields and composition of two hemp cultivars (CRS-1 and Anka),
   following various N, P, and K fertilization treatments (0, 50, 100, 150,
   and 200 kg N or K ha(-1); 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 kg P ha(-1)). The
   experiment was conducted in multiple environments in the province of
   Quebec. Positive linear and quadratic responses of biomass yield, seed
   yield, and seed crude protein concentration to N fertilization were
   observed in all environments; the magnitude of the response depended,
   however, on the environment and cultivar. Across environments and
   cultivars, biomass and seed yields increased from 1674 to 4209 kg ha(-1)
   and from 519 to 1340 kg ha(-1), respectively, with the application of
   200 kg N ha(-1) when compared with the unfertilized control. Nitrogen
   fertilization affected biomass cellulose and hemicellulose
   concentrations, but the overall response remained minimal. Phosphorus
   and potassium fertilizations had very limited effect on biomass and seed
   yields and composition in all environments. In conclusion, while
   industrial hemp responded to N fertilization up to 200 kg N ha(-1),
   response to P and K fertilization remained limited.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: DPP-4/CD26 degrades the incretins GLP-1 and GIP. The localization
   of DPP-4 within the human pancreas is not well documented but is likely
   to be relevant for understanding incretin function. We aimed to define
   the cellular localization of DPP-4 in the human pancreas from cadaveric
   organ donors with and without diabetes.
   Methods: Pancreas was snap-frozen and immunoreactive DPP-4 detected in
   cryosections using the APAAP technique. For co-localization studies,
   pancreas sections were double-stained for DPP-4 and proinsulin or
   glucagon and scanned by confocal microscopy. Pan-creata were digested
   and cells in islets and in islet-depleted, duct-enriched digests
   analyzed for expression of DPP-4 and other markers by flow cytometry.
   Results: DPP-4 was expressed by pancreatic duct and islet cells. In
   pancreata from donors without diabetes or with type 2 diabetes,
   DPP-4-positive cells in islets had the same location and morphology as
   glucagon-positive cells, and the expression of DPP-4 and glucagon
   overlapped. In donors with type 1 diabetes, the majority of residual
   cells in islets were DPP-4-positive.
   Conclusion: In the human pancreas, DPP-4 expression is localized to duct
   and alpha cells. This finding is consistent with the view that DPP-4
   regulates exposure to incretins of duct cells directly and of beta cells
   indirectly in a paracrine manner. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Although the distinction between positive and negative facial
   expressions is assumed to be clear and robust, recent research with
   intense real-life faces has shown that viewers are unable to reliably
   differentiate the valence of such expressions (Aviezer, Trope, \&
   Todorov, 2012). Yet, the fact that viewers fail to distinguish these
   expressions does not in itself testify that the faces are physically
   identical. In Experiment 1, the muscular activity of victorious and
   defeated faces was analyzed. Higher numbers of individually coded facial
   actions-particularly smiling and mouth opening-were more common among
   winners than losers, indicating an objective difference in facial
   activity. In Experiment 2, we asked whether supplying participants with
   valid or invalid information about objective facial activity and valence
   would alter their ratings. Notwithstanding these manipulations, valence
   ratings were virtually identical in all groups, and participants failed
   to differentiate between positive and negative faces. While objective
   differences between intense positive and negative faces are detectable,
   human viewers do not utilize these differences in determining valence.
   These results suggest a surprising dissociation between information
   present in expressions and information used by perceivers.}},

Abstract = {{Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) have the ability to completely retain
   biomass and are thus suitable for slowly growing anammox bacteria. In
   the present study, an anammox MBR was operated to investigate whether
   the anammox activity would remain stable at low temperature, without
   anammox biomass washout. The maximum nitrogen removal rates were 6.7 and
   1.1 g-N L-1 day(-1) at 35 degrees C and 15 degrees C, respectively.
   Fluorescence in situ hybridization and 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic
   analysis revealed no change in the predominant anammox species with
   temperature because of the complete retention of anammox biomass in the
   MBR. These results indicate that the predominant anammox bacteria in the
   MBR cannot adapt to a low temperature during short-term operation.
   Conversely, anammox activity recovered rapidly after restoring the
   temperature from the lower value to the optimal temperature (35 degrees
   C). The rapid recovery of anammox activity is a distinct advantage of
   using an MBR anammox reactor.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: 15-30\% of patients with lung cancer will have
   supraclavicular and cervical lymphadenopathy (SCLN). Ultrasound
   (US)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is regarded as an
   effective diagnostic tool in small size lymph nodes (LNs) and impalpable
   positron emission tomography detected nodes. We evaluated our diagnostic
   service performance in relation to the adequacy of samples for epidermal
   growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation.
   Methods: Retrospective data analysis from electronic records, searching
   for all suspected lung cancer referrals that underwent US of the neck -
   FNA, over a continuous period of 4 years.
   Results: Of 306 cases with suspected lung cancer referred to our
   department for US FNA of SCLN, 228 patients underwent the procedure. Of
   the remaining 78 patients, LNs were not detected in 52 cases and
   appeared benign in 26. Cytological diagnosis was established in 171
   patients (75\%) for treatment decisions without further investigations.
   The remaining 57 patients had further investigations; 45 reconfirmed the
   US-guided FNA diagnosis. The average LN size was 12.9 mm, and positive
   cytology was obtained in LNs ranging from 3 to 45 mm. Of 57
   adenocarcinoma cases, 34 were tested for EGFR confirming 4 positive, 25
   negative and 5 insufficient samples. No complications were recorded.
   Conclusions: US-guided FNA of SCLN remains an important diagnostic tool
   in lung cancer. Adequate tissue can be obtained for reliable diagnosis
   from LNs and for EGFR mutational analysis, without the need for more
   invasive and expensive investigations in more than 80\% of cases.}},

Title = {{Effect of semi-open impeller side clearance on the centrifugal pump
   performance using CFD}},
Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{247-255}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Centrifugal pumps (CP) are probably among the most often used machinery
   in industrial facilities as well as in common practice. Compared to
   other types of rotating pumps, CP yield higher efficiency. In aerospace
   application, reducing the weight of the CP impeller has the advantage of
   reducing mechanical stresses and enable using the CP at the high number
   of revolutions. In order to minimize the impeller weight the
   requirements to study and develop the CP with semi-open impeller appear.
   The present paper is devoted to revealing more details about the impact
   of CP side clearance on its performance. This is done by numerically
   investigating the influence of the variation of the CP side clearance
   width (0:0.2 impeller width) on the CP performance parameters at
   different flow rates (0:5 L/s). These CP performance parameters include
   the pump head, efficiency, slip factor, blade loads and the internal
   flow structure.
   The numerical simulation has been compared with own experimental results
   and a published empirical formula to verify the numerical solution. The
   CFD results show an acceptable agreement with the results of the
   experimental work and the empirical formulas. It has been shown that the
   impeller side clearance has a great regression effect on the centrifugal
   pump performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A hydrometallurgical process is proposed in this paper to recover
   manganese from silicomanganese slag. The paper reports the
   digestion-leaching experiments and precipitation and electrowinning
   assays to recover Mn from this residue. Silicomanganese slag was first
   treated with sulfuric acid in a furnace at 200 degrees C. It was then
   leached with water, Cab and KOH, and finally filtered to dissolve the
   manganese. Sulfuric liquor needs a purification step in order to remove
   Zn, Ni, Co and Cu. Na2S was used to remove pollutants, a 5\% excess with
   respect to the stoichiometric amounts of sulfide required for the
   reaction being employed for this purpose. The purified liquor is
   suitable for electrolysis. alpha-manganese is obtained with a purity of

Abstract = {{Objective: Upper airway obstruction and sleeping disorders are important
   issues in syndromic children, including mouth, lower-upper jaw, or all
   facial abnormalities. Tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy is required
   because of systemic problems and upper airway obstruction that increase
   the existing systemic problems, except those anomalies. However,
   tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy are mostly avoided because of the
   tendency to cause both intubation/perioperative systemic problems and
   respiratory complications in the postoperative period and in delays in
   the oral intake. However, these surgeries are sometimes required. In
   this context, we present our experience related with performing
   tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy in syndromic children admitted to our
   hospital.
   Methods: We retrospectively examined the data on tonsillectomy and/or
   adenoidectomy performed in syndromic patients in our clinic between 2001
   and 2011.
   Results: We did not observe any postoperative complications in
   adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy performed by the same surgeon in 14
   syndromic cases.
   Conclusion: It should be noted that respiratory problems may arise from
   many different anatomical regions in syndromic patients. Therefore,
   surgery should be performed taking into consideration all of these
   factors in these patients. These patients must be hospitalized in the
   postoperative period.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the nutritional and psychological factors
   associated with the occurrence of the practice of pica in pregnant women
   attending a public hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. METHODS: The
   study was based on a descriptive design with exploratory features, and
   conducted on 13 adult and adolescent pregnant women aged 16 to 40 years
   with a diagnosis of pica in the current pregnancy. Pica was diagnosed by
   a nutritionist in a standardized interview situation, when questions
   about the occurrence and frequency of pica, and types of substance
   ingestion were investigated. After signing the Informed Consent Form
   (ICF), all participants were evaluated by a nutritionist and seven of
   them were submitted to psychological assessment with standardized
   instruments to evaluate stress and anxiety, and to assess coping
   strategies. RESULTS: The type of pica most frequently reported was
   pagophagia (30.8\%) and the consumption of fruit with salt ( 30.8\%).
   The most prevalent coping strategies were ``religious
   practice-focused{''} and ``seeking social support{''}, both presented by
   42\% of the pregnant women. We observed the occurrence of some degree of
   stress and anxiety in all pregnant women, as well as comorbidities
   (69.2\%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (84.6\%). CONCLUSION: Considering
   that pica may be associated with increased perinatal risk, it is very
   important to investigate this disorder during prenatal care, and to dopt
   obstetric, psychological and nutritional preventive practices to reduce
   the complications for mother and fetus.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter is unique in its focus on infections that are acquired in
   water. For those who like to swim and spend time in water parks and
   pools, the exposure to water and therefore the risk of infection is
   higher. Recreational water illnesses are illnesses related to recreation
   in water. Of these recreational water illnesses, infections are the most
   common because water laden with microorganisms or contaminated by human
   activity gains access to healthy tissue through the skin and body
   orifices. Infection occurs by inhalation, ingestion, or direct invasion
   of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal
   infections are the most common. This chapter discusses skin and soft
   tissue infections, ocular infections, urinary tract infections,
   pulmonary infections, central nervous system infections, and
   disseminated infections that can occur as people come into contact with
   natural nonmarine water bodies as well as manmade aquatic environments.
   Most of these infections are mild but can occasionally be life
   threatening. There is a focus on the latest methods to treat these
   infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a very common pathogen in water.
   The chapter discusses P. aeruginosa dermatitis at length and also looks
   at keratitis and pneumonia caused by this organism. The chapter also
   discusses the latest treatments for primary amoebic meningoencephalitis,
   a severe life-threatening illness with a high mortality, caused by
   Naegleria fowleri. Finally, there is an in-depth discussion of the
   notorious gastrointestinal illnesses such as norovirus and
   Cryptosporidium parvum that can affect large numbers of people at a
   time.}},

   studied using UV-vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra. The
   capping of MSA molecules over CdTe QDs was confirmed by the FTIR and XPS
   analyses. Thermogravimetric analysis confirms that the prepared QDs were
   thermally stable up to 600 degrees C. The photovoltaic performance of
   alloyed CdTe QDs sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes were studied using J-V

Journal = {{CITIES}},

Volume = {{49}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rapid urban growth and urbanization in recent decades have caused
   changes in the structure of human habitations such as social and
   economic changes that would further clarify the importance of
   sustainable development and urban sustainability. Urban sustainability
   should create a balance between different aspects of economic,
   environmental, and social development. Therefore, this study aimed to
   determine various aspects of unsustainability in Iranian middle-large
   cities in order to provide strategies to improve the indicators and to
   achieve sustainability by finding the causes of failure to develop these
   indicators. Accordingly, first, urban sustainability indicators in four
   social, economic, physical and environmental aspects were presented.
   Then, the process of changing was determined through the study of these
   indicators in Sanandaj during two different periods; and indicators such
   as jobs, green urban economics, housing, nongovernmental organizations
   (NGOs), social participation, culture, public services and facilities,
   transportation, leisure, and medical care and health services were
   specified as unsustainability indicators in Sanandaj and other similar
   cities. Then, the following strategies are provided to improve urban
   sustainability in order to analyze the reasons for the decline or
   stagnation of these indicators: (1) strategies to revise the urban
   planning system in Iran; (2) strategies to improve the city's economy;
   and (3) strategies to improve the condition and status of poor people.
   The declining trend of unsustainability indicators could be reversed by
   applying these strategies. Furthermore, with the promotion of
   indicators, sustainable cities could be achievable. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we evaluate if REDD + initiatives might be financially
   viable to be used to achieve a more sustainable balance between timber
   production and ecosystem health in a mangrove forest area in Malaysia.
   The focus of our study is on a 40,466 ha mangrove forest in Malaysia
   known as the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve. The Matang Mangrove Forest
   Reserve has been used for charcoal and pole production for over 100
   years and is often described as a good example of a sustainably managed
   multi-use mangrove forest. However, recent research shows that the
   health of various components of the ecosystem is in decline (notably
   some bird species and the blood cockle fishery). We use opportunity cost
   analysis to determine that the minimum compensation required to offset
   the production revenue currently derived from timber production in the
   forest is less than US\$0.83 tCO2e. At these relatively low costs we
   demonstrate that REDD + is financially viable to be strategically used
   to support the conservation of some parts of the Matang Mangrove Forest
   Reserve which could result in better sustainable outcomes for the forest
   area and its stakeholders as a whole. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Fair allocation of indivisible objects under ordinal preferences is an
   important problem. Unfortunately, a fairness notion like envy-freeness
   is both incompatible with Pareto optimality and is also NP-complete to
   achieve. To tackle this predicament, we consider a different notion of
   fairness, namely proportionality. We frame allocation of indivisible
   objects as randomized assignment but with integrality requirements. We
   then use the stochastic dominance relation to define two natural notions
   of proportionality. Since an assignment may not exist even for the
   weaker notion of proportionality, we propose relaxations of the concepts
   optimal weak proportionality and optimal proportionality. For both
   concepts, we propose algorithms to compute fair assignments under
   ordinal preferences. Both new fairness concepts appear to be desirable
   in view of the following: they are compatible with Pareto optimality,
   admit efficient algorithms to compute them, are based on
   proportionality, and are guaranteed to exist.}},

Title = {{Economical-environmental impact of subsidised renewable energy sources

Abstract = {{In 2012, Spain obtained 68.5 TWh of its electricity (25\% of the total)
   from renewable energy sources excluding large hydroelectric power
   (RES-E). Subsidies, through feed-in-tariffs, for various forms of RES-E
   ranged from 40.2 (sic)/MWh to 321.1 (sic)/MWh and totaled 6.1 billion E,
   an amount that has motivated substantial criticism. This paper examines
   the effects of RES-E on the market price of electricity considering the
   merit order effect in Spain's power auction system. The M5P algorithm
   developed by Quinlan (1992) is used to calculate changes in the settling
   price in daily power auctions. Also, the value of emissions of CO2, NOx,
   and SOx avoided through RES-E is calculated. They are valued at \$10/t,
   \$478/t, and \$1460/t, respectively. Results of the analysis show that,
   in 2012, RES-E caused an estimated 3.1 B(sic) savings in electricity
   expenditures due to market effects and a 0.7 B(sic) saving in emission
   costs. When subtracted from the total subsidy a net cost of RES-E of 2.3
   B(sic) is derived. Wind, biomass, and small hydroelectric had negative
   net costs (i.e., net benefits) while photovoltaic and solar-thermal
   power had net costs. Alternative scenarios in which the production of
   gas-fired and coal-fired electric power are individually curtailed by
   30\% in comparison to the baseline scenario, while RES-E is held at the
   2012 level, yielded a net cost decrease of about 300 M(sic) for gas
   curtailment and a net cost increase of about 300 M(sic) for coal
   curtailment. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of

Abstract = {{Introduction Cetuximab is registered for use in colorectal cancer (CRC)
   patients with RAS wild-type tumours only. Simvastatin blocks the
   mevalonate pathway and thereby interferes with the post-translational
   modification (prenylation) of KRAS. We hypothesize that the activitated
   KRAS pathway in KRAS mutant tumors can be inhibited by simvastatin
   rendering these tumors sensitive to the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab.
   Methods A Simon two-stage, single-arm, phase II study was performed to
   test the efficacy and safety of the addition of simvastatin to cetuximab
   in patients with a KRAS mutation in their CRC tumour who were previously
   treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan based
   regimens. The primary endpoint was to test the percentage of patients
   alive and free from progression 12.5 weeks after the first
   administration of cetuximab. Our hypothesis was that at least 40 \% was
   free from progression, comparable to, though slightly lower than in KRAS
   wild-type patients. Results Four of 18 included patients (22.2 \%) were
   free from progression at the primary endpoint time. The time to
   progression in these 4 patients ranged from 20.3 to 47 weeks. Conclusion
   Based on the current study we conclude that the theoretical concept of
   KRAS modulation with simvastatin was not applicable in the clinic, as we
   were not able to restore sensitivity to cetuximab in CRC patients
   harbouring a somatic KRAS mutation.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: We sought to assess awareness of, exposure to and interest
   in general practitioner (GP) surgery and enhanced surgical skills (ESS)
   among family practice residents in British Columbia, Alberta and
   Saskatchewan.
   Methods: We distributed a survey to all family practice residents at 4
   universities in BC, Alberta and Saskatchewan. The survey assessed
   demographic information, awareness of and exposure to GP surgery or ESS
   during training, and interest in pursuing formal ESS training.
   Results: We received 174 responses (27.2\% response rate). Numerous
   respondents were unaware of GP surgery (9.9\% +/- 4.5\%) and ESS (17.9\%
   +/- 5.7\%). Awareness was higher among respondents from rural hometowns
   (GP surgery and ESS awareness 100\% and 94.1\%, respectively), and with
   prior exposure to GP surgery (GP surgery and ESS awareness 96.9\% and
   95.4\%, respectively). A minority (38.2\%) had been exposed to GP
   surgery, with exposure higher in respondents from rural training sites
   and in their second postgraduate year (72.5\% and 47.4\%, respectively).
   A quarter (25.1\%) of respondents were considering ESS training. Factors
   encouraging training included increased procedures, challenging medicine
   and impact on patient outcomes. The importance of ESS training
   opportunities and service was rated highly.
   Conclusion: Many respondents were unaware of ESS as a career option.
   Exposure to GP surgery during training was associated with increased
   awareness. Furthermore, exposure fostered interest in this important
   field. These results may be helpful in the development of formal ESS
   training programs and in curricula for family practice residency
   programs.}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{539-555}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{We consider criticisms of business school education and the values it
   propounds in the context of wisdom. We ask whether the perceived wisdom
   relating to what business should be is ``wise,{''} and whether the
   models and frameworks used in management education enable wisdom to
   flourish. The distinction between means and ends (i. e., terminal goals,
   such as human welfare and instrumental goals, such as money) is
   highlighted. We argue that management models that measure success in
   purely financial terms demonstrate foolishness by conflating the means
   with the end. If business is to retain its legitimacy and benefit
   society, profit needs to be seen as a means to the end of sustainable
   business not an end in itself. This should in turn be reflected in the
   metrics used to measure success in management models and theories.
   Cross-cultural comparisons with economies based on different value
   systems offer insight into alternative approaches. We highlight examples
   of how business schools are adjusting their curriculum and conclude that
   changes need to go beyond superficial inclusion of ethical issues.
   Recommendations include updating the business curriculum with more
   prosocial management theories and a reprioritization of the goal of
   social welfare over individual business profit maximization.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) where the integrated
   continuous-time Markov chain can be observed at discrete time points
   perturbed by a Brownian motion. The aim is to derive a filter for the
   underlying continuous-time Markov chain. The recursion formula for the
   discrete-time filter is easy to derive, however involves densities which
   are very hard to obtain. In this paper we derive exact formulas for the
   necessary densities in the case the state space of the HMM consists of
   two elements only. This is done by relating the underlying integrated
   continuous-time Markov chain to the so-called asymmetric telegraph
   process and by using recent results on this process. In case the state
   space consists of more than two elements we present three different ways
   to approximate the densities for the filter. The first approach is based
   on the continuous filter problem. The second approach is to derive a PDE
   for the densities and solve it numerically. The third approach is a
   crude discrete time approximation of the Markov chain. All three
   approaches are compared in a numerical study.}},

Abstract = {{The loss of estrogen during menopause causes changes in the female body,
   with wide-ranging effects on health. Estrogen-containing hormone
   replacement therapy (HRT) leads to a relief of typical menopausal
   symptoms, benefits bone and muscle health, and is associated with
   tissue-specific gene expression profiles. As gene expression is
   controlled by epigenetic factors (including DNA methylation), many of
   which are environmentally sensitive, it is plausible that at least part
   of the HRT-associated gene expression is due to changes in DNA
   methylation profile. We investigated genome-wide DNA methylation and
   gene expression patterns of white blood cells (WBCs) and their
   associations with body composition, including muscle and bone measures
   of monozygotic (MZ) female twin pairs discordant for HRT. We identified
   7,855 nominally significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs)
   associated with 4,044 genes. Of the genes with DMRs, five (ACBA1, CCL5,
   FASLG, PPP2R2B, and UHRF1) were also differentially expressed. All have
   been previously associated with HRT or estrogenic regulation, but not
   with HRT-associated DNA methylation. All five genes were associated with
   bone mineral content (BMC), and ABCA1, FASLG, and UHRF1 were also
   associated with body adiposity. Our study is the first to show that HRT
   associates with genome-wide DNA methylation alterations in WBCs.
   Moreover, we show that five differentially expressed genes with DMRs
   associate with clinical measures, including body fat percentage, lean
   body mass, bone mass, and blood lipids. Our results indicate that at
   least part of the known beneficial HRT effects on body composition and
   bone mass may be regulated by DNA methylation associated alterations in
   gene expression in circulating WBCs.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing demand of the food industries and research
   institutes to have means of measurement allowing the characterization of
   foods. Ice cream, as a complex food system, consists of a frozen matrix
   containing air bubbles, fat globules, ice crystals, and an unfrozen
   serum phase. Some deficiencies in conventional methods for testing this
   product encourage the use of alternative techniques such as rheometry,
   spectroscopy, X-ray, electro-analytical techniques, ultrasound, and
   laser. Despite the development of novel instrumental applications in
   food science, use of some of them in ice cream testing is few, but has
   shown promising results. Developing the novel methods should increase
   our understanding of characteristics of ice cream and may allow online
   testing of the product. This review article discusses the potential of
   destructive and non-destructive methodologies in determining the quality
   and characteristics of ice cream and similar products. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A novel method for the preparation of composites based on poly(vinyl
   alcohol) (PVA) and micro- and nano-fibrillated cellulose (M/NFC) is
   reported. The addition of crosslinking HEMA monomers and a
   photo-initiator enabled the formation of an interpenetrated polymer
   network that displayed enhanced interfacial adhesion and dispersion of
   (M/NFC) in the matrix. Photo-crosslinked PVA/(M/NFC)/polyHEMA composite
   films produced by casting followed by UV polymerization of HEMA were
   characterized by using several approaches. These included Fourier
   transform infrared and UV-Vis spectroscopies, differential scanning
   calorimetry, X-ray diffractometry, thermogravimetric analysis and
   dynamic mechanical analysis. The thermo-mechanical and optical
   properties as well as water absorption and vapor barrier abilities of
   the developed photo-crosslinked PVA/(M/NFC)/polyHEMA films were measured
   and the benefit of photo-crosslinking determined. The major degradation
   peak of photo-crosslinked PVA/(M/NFC)/polyHEMA composites increased
   substantially compared to that of the PVA/(M/NFC) system (from similar
   to 300 to similar to 350 A degrees C). The water vapor permeability of
   PVA/(M/NFC)/polyHEMA composite films was reduced with HEMA loading (5.44
   x 10(-11), 5.10 x 10(-11), 4.12 x 10(-11), 4.31 x 10(-11) g/m h Pa for
   0, 5, 10 and 15 \% HEMA, respectively). Overall, a new and facile method
   for the synthesis of PVA/(M/NFC)-based composite networks
   interpenetrated with cross-linked poly(HEMA) is demonstrated, offering
   excellent prospects for packaging applications.}},

Abstract = {{There is ongoing policy debate about the potential for malpractice
   liability reform to reduce the use of defensive medicine and slow the
   growth of health care spending. The effectiveness of such policy levers
   hinges on the degree to which physicians respond to liability pressures
   by prescribing medically unnecessary care. Many estimates of this
   relationship are based on physician reports. We present new survey
   evidence on physician assessment of their own use of medically
   unnecessary care in response to medical liability and other pressures,
   including a randomized evaluation of the sensitivity of those responses
   to survey framing. We find that while use of such care is potentially
   quite prevalent, responses vary substantially based on survey framing,
   with the way the question is phrased driving differences in responses
   that are often as great as those driven by physician specialty or
   whether the physician has personally been named in a lawsuit. These
   results suggest that self-reported use of medically unnecessary care
   ought to be used with caution in the formulation of malpractice
   liability system reform.}},

Abstract = {{A generalization of unequal error protection (UEP) rateless codes and
   distributed rateless codes for distributed relay networks is proposed.
   We consider a two-hop relaying network where a single source transmits
   UEP rateless coded data to a destination via multiple relays. At the
   relays, the UEP rateless coded symbols are re-encoded by distributed
   rateless codes (DRC) to minimize the redundancy at the second hop.
   Previously introduced UEP rateless codes (URC) have supported a limited
   number of importance classes, mostly two classes, and targeted
   importance levels suited to a specific application. In this paper,
   however, we formulate an optimization problem to provide optimal URC in
   terms of the symbol error rate (SER) given any specific number and
   strengths of importance levels. Next, another optimization is proposed
   to obtain DRC with the minimum SER at a given overhead, which utilizes
   information of common symbols among the relays. The optimization methods
   are based on the AND-OR tree analysis and sequential quadratic
   programming. In addition, we evaluate the minimum achievable end-to-end
   symbol error rates over the wireless relay networks.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Insulinoma is a neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas, with
   an estimated prevalence of 4 cases per 1 million people/year. In most
   patients, neuropsychiatric symptoms, secondary to hypoglycemia, are the
   initial presentation.
   Objectives: We reviewed the neuropsychiatric manifestations secondary to
   insulinoma. Additionally, we report a patient case whose severe
   psychiatric symptoms proved to be the first clinical manifestation of an
   insulinoma.
   Methods: We performed a systematic search of published literature from
   1992 to 2013, through PubMed and reviewed in detail the patient medical
   files.
   Discussion: This case report portrays the difficulty in diagnosing
   medical conditions that present with clinical symptoms that overlap with
   neurological/psychiatric syndromes.
   Conclusion: The insulinomas may present with neuropsychiatric symptoms,
   which leads to the complexity and difficulty of an early diagnosis.
   Thus, we believe that it is critical to conduct a detailed clinical
   history in order to prevent potential misdiagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{While the public is concerned that emphasizing research performance
   among university faculty results in inadequate attention to
   undergraduate teaching, research on the relationship between research
   and teaching in higher education has failed to confirm or deny the
   validity of this concern. To empirically test this popular concern, we
   examined how the change in performance-based incentive systems to
   improve faculty publications influenced student evaluations of their
   teaching in a Korean university. The analysis of a panel dataset of
   individual faculty members shows that financial incentives on research
   rather than teaching could have redirected attention of some professors
   from teaching to research, thus reducing teaching quality, as proposed
   by advocates of multitasking theory. Therefore, these findings suggest
   that, when multiple tasks are significant to organizational values, the
   incentive structure must assure that each task or activity offers
   professors the same marginal return on their efforts.}},

Abstract = {{An array of scintillation detectors of the MONICA Spectrometer, whis is
   aimed at investigating fluxes of cosmic-ray ions (from H to Ni) in the
   extraterrestrial space within the energy range from 10 to 300 MeV per
   nucleon, is considered. The basic goal of the MONICA experiment is the
   measurement of the ionic and isotopic composition of cosmic rays of the
   galactic and solar origin, as well as the measurement of their energy
   spectrum. This problem was intensely studied by numerous investigators
   {[}1-10]; nevertheless, a lot of questions remain unsolved up to now, in
   this field of science. The array of scintillation detectors plays the
   important role in achieving the goals of the MONICA experiment. The
   composition of the array, tuning procedure, and characteristics of
   scintillation detectors are discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a fully integrated transceiver IC as part of a
   self-sustained, microfluidic-CMOS platform for miniaturized dielectric
   spectroscopy (DS) from MHz to GHz. Fabricated in AMS 0.35 mu m 2P/4M RF
   CMOS, the transmitter (TX) part of the IC generates a single-tone
   sinusoidal signal with frequency tun ability in the range of similar to
   9 MHz-2.4 GHz to excite a three-dimensional (3D), parallel-plate,
   capacitive sensor with a floating electrode and 9 mu L microfluidic
   channel for sample delivery. With a material-under-test (MUT) loaded
   into the sensor, the receiver (RX) part of the IC employs broadband
   frequency response analysis (bFRA) methodology to measure the amplitude
   and phase of the RF excitation signal after transmission through the
   sensor. A one-time, 6-point sensor calibration algorithm then extracts
   both the real and imaginary parts of the MUT complex permittivity,
   epsilon(r), from IC measurements of the sensor transmission
   characteristics in the voltage domain. The ``sensor + IC{''} is fully
   capable of differentiating among de-ionized (DI) water,
   phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and alcoholic beverages in tests
   conducted at four excitation frequencies of rs) similar to 50 MHz, 500
   MHz, 1.5 GHz, and 2.4 GHz generated by the TX. Moreover, permittivity
   readings of PBS by the sensor interfaced with the IC at six excitation
   frequencies in the range of similar to 50 MHz-2.4 GHz are in excellent
   agreement (rms error of 1.7\% (real) and 7.2\% (imaginary)) with those
   from bulk solution reference measurements by commercial benchtop
   equipment. The total power consumption of the IC is < 100 mW with 1.5 V
   (analog) and 3.3 V (digital) supplies.}},

Abstract = {{A novel optimization algorithm is proposed to solve single and
   multi-objective optimization problems with generation fuel cost,
   emission, and total power losses as objectives. The proposed method is a
   hybridization of the conventional cuckoo search algorithm and arithmetic
   crossover operations. Thus, the non-linear, non-convex objective
   function can be solved under practical constraints. The effectiveness of
   the proposed algorithm is analyzed for various cases to illustrate the
   effect of practical constraints on the objectives' optimization. Two and
   three objective multi-objective optimization problems are formulated and
   solved using the proposed non-dominated sorting-based hybrid cuckoo
   search algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method in confining
   the Pareto front solutions in the solution region is analyzed. The
   results for single and multi-objective optimization problems are
   physically interpreted on standard test functions as well as the IEEE-30
   bus test system with supporting numerical and graphical results and also
   validated against existing methods. (C) 2015 Karabuk University.

Abstract = {{At a time of strong challenges for shipping in relation to economic and
   environmental performance, the potential of waste heat recovery has been
   identified as among the most important technologies to lower fuel
   consumption. This paper presents the comparison of four different
   procedures for the optimisation of a combined Diesel and organic Rankine
   cycle system with increasing attention to the ship operational profile
   and to the inclusion of engine control variables in the optimisation
   procedure. Measured data from two years of operations of a chemical
   tanker are used to test the application of the different procedures. The
   results indicate that for the investigated case study the application of
   an optimisation procedure which takes the operational profile into
   account can increase the savings of the installation of an organic
   Rankine cycle from 7.3\% to 11.4\% of the original yearly fuel
   consumption. The results of this study further show that (i) simulating
   the part-load behavior of the ORC is important to ensure its correct
   operations at low engine load and (ii) allowing the engine control
   strategy to be part of the optimisation procedure leads to significantly
   larger fuel savings than the optimisation of the waste recovery system
   alone.

Abstract = {{Background: Laryngomalacia (LM) is the most common congenital anomaly of
   larynx that causes stridor in children. We evaluated the efficacy of
   epiglottic suture and laser epiglottopexy for treatment of infants with
   severe LM.
   Methods: Surgical intervention was performed in 19 patients with severe
   LM, after the diagnosis was established using flexible
   laryngotracheobronchoscopy. Five patients had isolated type 1 LM, and 14
   patients had a combination of type 1 and 3 LM. Indication for surgical
   treatment was the presence of LM with at least one of the following:
   malnutrition (body mass index {[} BMI] Z score<-2 SD), dysphagia or
   symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux and mean oxygen saturation (SaO(2))
   < 92\% with oxygen desaturation index (ODI) > 3.
   Results: Epiglottic suture was performed in 11 patients, and laser
   epiglottopexy in eight, at mean age 3.95 +/- 2.4 months. Rate of
   operation was 2.2-fold greater for more severe anomaly (combination of
   type 1 and 3 LM) than for isolated type 1. At 6 month follow up symptoms
   had gradually improved, as well as nutritional status, with increase of
   mean BMI Z score from -3.7 to -0.9 (P < 0.01). Mean preoperative SaO2
   was 89.4 +/- 4.3\% with mean ODI of 5.8. At 6month follow up, mean
   SaO(2) was 96.7 +/- 1.1\%, and mean ODI was 1.2 (P < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Epiglottic suture and laser epiglottopexy are efficient
   surgical techniques that lead to significant improvement of symptoms,
   oxygenation and nutritional status in patients with LM.}},

Abstract = {{The pre-eminence of logical dynamics, over a static and purely
   propositional view of Logic, lies at the core of a new understanding of
   both formal epistemology and the logical foundations of quantum
   mechanics. Both areas appear at first sight to be based on purely static
   propositional formalisms, but in our view their fundamental operators
   are essentially dynamic in nature. Quantum logic can be best understood
   as the logic of physically-constrained informational interactions (in
   the form of measurements and entanglement) between subsystems of a
   global physical system. Similarly, (multi-agent) epistemic logic is the
   logic of socially-constrained informational interactions (in the form of
   direct observations, learning, various forms of communication and
   testimony) between ``subsystems{''} of a social system. Dynamic
   Epistemic Logic (DEL) provides us with a unifying setting in which these
   informational interactions, coming from seemingly very different areas
   of research, can be fully compared and analyzed. The DEL formalism comes
   with a powerful set of tools that allows us to make the underlying
   dynamic/interactive mechanisms fully transparent.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, carbon/epoxy composites were employed as a potential
   candidate for spacecraft structural shielding along with the new concept
   of geometric configurations according to the threat severity to maximize
   the impactor energy absorption to improve performance. Carbon/epoxy
   composites of quasi-isotropic 16 layers {[}0/+/- 45/90](2s) were
   manufactured using an autoclave, and the specimens were exposed to a low
   Earth orbit environment, which produced an average total mass loss of
   0.42\%, mainly due to outgassing. Al2017-T4 spherical projectiles with a
   diameter of 5.56mm weight of 0.25g were used as the impactor in the
   velocity range of 1500 +/- 500m/s. Earlier experimentations showed the
   superiority of obliquity towards energy absorption for single bumpers.
   Double bumpers with one 45 degrees obliquity at 100mm standoff absorbed
   14\% more specific energy than double bumpers with one at 30 degrees;
   both of them were found to be superior to normal-normal bumpers by 40\%
   and 30\% on average, respectively. By CSCAN, it was also found that

Abstract = {{Introduction. Pterygoid hamulus syndrome (PHS) is a rare cause of
   orofacial and oropharyngeal pain. PHS can be associated with a hamulus
   hypertrophy or with a bursitis of the palatosalpingeus but it has not
   always an anatomic cause.
   Observation. A 36-year-old woman was seen for a constant posterior
   palatal pain spreading towards oropharynx, increasing during swallowing
   and lasting for more than 6 months. Physical examination showed an
   erythema of the soft palate, medially to the hamulus. Hamulus palpation
   was painful and revealed hamulus hypertrophia on both sides. A bilateral
   PHS was evocated.
   Discussion. This observation is typical of a PHS. We propose a review of
   the literature of this little-known syndrome. Treatment is initially
   conservative (corticosteroids) but surgery can be proposed in case of
   morphological anomalies of the hamulus. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract = {{This work addresses the spread of a disease within an urban system,
   defined as a network of interconnected cities. The first step consists
   of comparing two different approaches: a macroscopic one, based on a
   system of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)
   Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) systems exploiting populations on
   nodes and flows on edges (so-called metapopulational model), and a
   hybrid one, coupling ODE SIR systems on nodes and agents traveling on
   edges. Under homogeneous conditions (mean field approximation), this
   comparison leads to similar results on the outputs on which we focus
   (the maximum intensity of the epidemic, its duration and the time of the
   epidemic peak). However, when it comes to setting up epidemic control
   strategies, results rapidly diverge between the two approaches, and it
   appears that the full macroscopic model is not completely adapted to
   these questions. In this paper, we focus on some control strategies,
   which are quarantine, avoidance and risk culture, to explore the
   differences, advantages and disadvantages of the two models and discuss
   the importance of being hybrid when modeling and simulating epidemic
   spread at the level of a whole urban system.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in women with the
   incidence rising in young women. GST gene polymorphisms are significant
   because of their role in the detoxification of both environmental
   carcinogens and also cytotoxic drugs used in therapy for breast cancer.
   The present study has been designed to identify the role of
   polymorphisms in GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes in the risk of development of
   breast cancer, in the prognostication of breast cancer, and in the
   prediction of response towards chemotherapy. Ninety-nine patients with
   breast cancer and 100 healthy controls with no history of cancer were
   taken from blood donors after informed consent. Epidemiological and
   clinical data was collected from participants and 5 ml of peripheral
   venous blood was collected for genotype analysis. Null genotype of GSTT1
   was detected in 51.04 \% of the controls in comparison to 20.2 \% of
   patients with carcinoma breast, which was found to be statistically
   significant (OR 4.18; 95 \% CI 2.01-8.75; P=0.0001). GSTM1 gene deletion
   was also significantly more common among controls (60 \%) than in
   patients with breast cancer (33 \%) (OR 4.57; 95\% CI 2.20-9.51;
   P=0.0001). Tumors more than 5 cm in size had greater tendency for GSTM1
   gene expression (P value=0.019), but other clinicopathological
   parameters did not show any correlation. GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes status
   did not show any association with response to chemotherapy. The results
   indicated the null genotype of both GSTT1 and GSTM1 to be protective for
   the development of carcinoma breast. None of the known etiological
   factors have any correlation with GSTT1 and GSTM1 gene deletion.
   Patients with small tumor size expressed GSTM1 gene deletion. Other
   tumor characteristics and clinicopathological parameters did not have
   any correlation with gene deletion.}},

Abstract = {{Age-related declines in photosynthesis and water potentials of
   revegetated Caragana korshinskii in arid desert regions are likely
   related to both reduced soil water availability and increased hydraulic
   resistance in xylem.
   In addition to soil water depletion, the degradation of revegetated
   sand-binding shrubs may be attributed to specific biological traits of
   the plant itself, such as aging. To improve our understanding of the
   physiological basis of observed age-related changes in photosynthetic
   capacity and water relations in drought-stressed xerophytic shrubs, we
   conducted in situ field experiments on juvenile, young-mature and
   relatively old-growth Caragana korshinskii Kom. during the 2013 growing
   season. Our results revealed significant age-related changes in gas
   exchange and water-use characteristics, including decreases in the rates
   of photosynthesis and transpiration, stomatal conductance, shoot water
   potential and leaf relative water content and increase in water use
   efficiency with increasing age. We also found that the gas exchange and
   water relations of all three age classes of C. korshinskii were
   similarly and significantly affected by soil and atmospheric water
   availabilities. We conclude that the age-related changes in
   photosynthetic capacity and water relations which occur in C.
   korshinskii are likely related to reduced soil water availability and
   increased hydraulic resistance in xylem, both of which result in a
   decline in water potential, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic
   capacity with increasing age of the shrub.}},

Abstract = {{A better knowledge of the effect of non-conventional extraction
   technologies, which can avoid the use of high temperatures and toxic
   solvents, on the antioxidant compounds recovery from blackberries, is
   necessary. Thus, high voltage electrical discharges (HVED), pulsed
   electric fields (PEF), and ultrasounds (USN) treatments were applied in
   order to evaluate the effects of processing on protein, total phenolics
   and anthocyanins extraction from blackberries. Moreover, two-stage
   extraction involving the use of HVED, PEF and USN as pre-treatments and
   supplementary extraction during 5 h with hot water at mild temperature
   (50 degrees C) or an hydroalcoholic solution (30\% ethanol, w/w) was
   evaluated. The impacts of both hot water (50 degrees C) and ethanol had
   a positive influence in total phenolics and anthocyanin recovery,
   although the yield was clearly influenced by the treatment applied and
   the targeted compound. The highest protein (37.95 +/- 130 mg/100 g) and
   TPC (932.69 +/- 33.45 mg/100 g) yields were obtained after HVED and
   supplementary extraction during 5 h, using ethanol and hot water at 50
   degrees C, respectively. However, the maximum anthocyanin yield (98.46
   +/- 4.92 mg/100 g) was found after applying PEF treatment and
   supplementary extraction with hot water at 50 degrees C. These promising
   findings open the doors to a potential multi-stage green recovery, which
   can improve the selectivity and the amount of high-added value compounds
   recovered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy involves both affective and cognitive processes: experiencing
   the other person's emotion and the attribution of theory of mind, which
   refers to the ability to ascribe an independent mental life to oneself
   and others. Strategies of engagement used in film and television can
   invite viewers to apply empathic processes to fictional characters. Such
   empathic engagement provides stimulation and enjoyment, and prompts
   viewers to anticipate and integrate information about characters and the
   narrative. This article examines the ways in which empathic engagement
   is developed in various Japanese film or television texts. These texts
   encourage viewers to empathise with young male protagonists who embody
   forms of marginalised or subordinated masculinity. As a result, the
   texts not only create a space for viewers to empathise in
   thought-provoking ways with fictional others, but also invite readers to
   interpret the protagonists as models of behaviour for dealing with
   common problems faced by young people, such as the pressure of social
   expectations and rejection by peers. Further, the films present a
   challenge to established gender norms through positive portrayals of
   marginalised or subordinated male protagonists.}},

Title = {{The effect of cirrhosis on the risk for failure of nonoperative

Journal = {{SURGERY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{158}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1677-1686}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background. The purpose of this study was to delineate the association
   between cirrhosis and failure of nonoperative management (F-NOM) after
   blunt liver trauma.
   Methods. We carried out a review of the National Trauma Databank from
   2007 to 2011 including patients >= 16 years old admitted after a blunt
   injury. Propensity score was used to match each cirrhotic to 3
   noncirrhotic patients. Primary outcome was F-NOM (liver procedure >2
   hours after admission and/or operative intervention directed at the
   liver after angiography).
   Results. A total of 57 cirrhotic patients who met inclusion criteria
   were matched with 171 noncirrhotic patients. Splenic injury was present
   in 41\% (35\% vs 43\%; P =.31) and 28\% had a high-grade liver injury
   III/VI/V (26\% vs 29\%; P =. 73). The majority of patients in both
   groups were selected for a trial of NOM (77\% vs 85\%; P =.15). There
   was no difference in the rate of F-NOM between the 2 groups (14\% vs
   14\%; P = 1.00), even for high-grade injuries (13\% vs 20\%; P =.72).
   Cirrhotic patients had a greater overall mortality (28\% vs 7\%; P
   <.01), especially if they required a laparotomy (58\% vs 17\%; P <.01)
   or if they failed NOM (50\% vs 4\%; P <.01).
   Conclusion. Cirrhosis has no effect on the selection of patients with
   blunt liver injuries for a trial of nonoperative management and does not
   seem to be associated with a greater risk for failure of nonoperative
   management within the constraints of our study. Nonoperative management
   in this population is highly successful and failure is rarely related
   directly to the liver injury itself Failure of non-operative management
   increases the already high mortality risk in this population.}},

   study}},
Journal = {{SUPERLATTICES AND MICROSTRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{403-416}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The article takes a new look at the process of atomic segregation by
   considering the influence of surface relaxation on the segregation
   parameters; the activation energy (Q), segregation energy (Delta G),
   interaction parameter (Omega) and the pre-exponential factor (D-0).
   Computational modelling, namely Density Functional Theory (DFT) and the
   Modified Darken Model (MDM) in conjunction with Auger Electron
   Spectroscopy (AES) was utilized to study the variation of the
   segregation parameters for S in the surface region of Fe(100). Results
   indicate a variation in each of the segregation parameters as a function
   of the atomic layer under consideration. Values of the segregation
   parameters varied more dramatically as the surface layer is approached,
   with atomic layer 2 having the largest deviations in comparison to the
   bulk values. This atomic layer had the highest Q value and formed the
   rate limiting step for the segregation of S towards the Fe(100) surface.
   It was found that the segregation process is influenced by two sets of
   segregation parameters, those of the surface region formed by atomic
   layer 2, and those in the bulk material. This article is the first to
   conduct a full scale investigation on the influence of surface
   relaxation on segregation and labelled it the ``surface effect{''}. (C)

Abstract = {{Peak union bodies in Australia have a long and influential history, and
   most recently have developed an approach to union revitalisation based
   on community-based campaigning strategies. In responding to labour
   market changes, declining union membership and hostile governments and
   employers, peak union bodies have developed new ways to strengthen the
   collective ability of their affiliated unions to successfully represent
   members at the workplace level. They have embraced local-level
   strategies that tap into community concerns and are aimed at capacity
   building across the labour movement. The resulting grass-roots
   organisations have the potential to shape both the workplace and the
   public domain. We explore one example of this approach: the
   establishment of Local Union Community Councils by Unions NSW. We argue
   that although peak bodies are well placed to spearhead community
   campaigning, the grass-roots councils being created will need to
   progress through several stages of development, if they are to become
   self-sustaining organisations, contributing effectively over the long
   term to community mobilisation and stronger, more coordinated union
   campaigns.}},

Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel solution to the problem of noun
   incorporation constructions in which both an incorporated noun and a
   nominal double, hyponymous object, or stranded modifier are present.
   Such doubling constructions have been difficult to reconcile with a
   syntactic approach to noun incorporation. I propose that doubling
   constructions arise from an underlying structure in which the
   incorporated nominal and the double are merged as a constituent. In
   doing so, I argue against the parameterized phi-deletion analysis
   proposed in Baker etal. (2005), pointing out some shortcomings of their
   analysis. This proposal also ties together doubling and stranding into a
   unified phenomenon, a result I show is supported by cross-linguistic
   evidence. I also tie doubling/stranding in with the availability of NI

Abstract = {{Calcium (Ca2+)-signaling-based molecular communication is a short-range
   communication process that diffuses and propagates ions between the
   cells of a tissue. The communication process is initiated via
   stimulation and amplification of the production of Ca2+ ions within a
   cell; these ions then diffuse through a physical connection between
   cells called a gap junction. Ca2+ signaling can be found in different
   classes of cell. In excitable cells, initiation of the Ca2+-signaling
   process is accompanied by an electrical component; for nonexcitable cell
   types, the electrical component is absent; while hybrid cells exhibit
   both behaviors. This paper provides a comparison and analysis of the
   communication behavior in tissues comprised three specific cell types
   that utilize Ca2+ signaling: epithelium cells (nonexcitable), smooth
   muscle cells (excitable), and astrocytes (hybrid). The analysis focuses
   on spatiotemporal Ca2+ concentration dynamics and how they are
   influenced by the intracellular signaling process, the molecular
   diffusion delay, the gain and capacity of the communication channel, as
   well as intracellular signaling interference. This analysis of the
   communication behavior in the context of tissues provides insights
   useful for, inter alia, the design of nanomachines that are situated
   within tissues and that use analysis of the communication channel to
   infer tissue health.}},

Abstract = {{The paper discusses and compares different abstract state-space
   representations for a class of linear hyperbolic systems defined on a
   one-dimensional spatial domain. It starts with their PDE representation
   in both weakly and strongly coupled forms. Next, the homogeneous state
   equation including the unbounded formal state operator is presented.
   Based on the semigroup approach, some results of well-posedness and
   internal stability are given. The boundary and observation operators are
   introduced, assuming a typical configuration of boundary inputs as well
   as pointwise observations of the state variables. Consequently, the
   homogeneous state equation is extended to the so-called boundary control
   state/signal form. Next, the classical additive state-space
   representation involving (A, B, C)-triple of state, input and output
   operators is considered. After short discussion on the appropriate
   Hilbert spaces, state-space equation in the so-called factor form is
   also presented. Finally, the resolvent of the system state operator A is
   discussed.}},

   Unemployment Rate}},
Journal = {{GROWTH AND CHANGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{529-557}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article estimates how effects of local labor demand shocks on labor
   market outcomes vary with the initial local unemployment rate, which has
   not been previously studied. The data are on 23 large U.S. metro areas
   from 1979 to 2011. The article finds that demand shocks to local job
   growth have greater effects in increasing real wages if the local
   economy initially has low unemployment. However, demand shocks have
   greater effects in reducing unemployment, and increasing labor force
   participation, if the local economy initially has high unemployment,
   although these differences are only of modest statistical significance.
   The estimates are based on a new econometric approach to determining the
   correct dynamic structure for how local labor markets respond to demand
   shocks. This new approach finds that demand shocks have persistent
   effects on labor force participation and real wages, but not on
   unemployment, which contradicts some previous research.}},

   decide whether to accept, postpone, or even reject the admission from a
   random stream of non-emergency elective patients. We formulate the
   control process as a Markov decision process to maximize expected
   contribution net of overbooking costs, develop bounds using approximate
   dynamic programming, and use them to construct heuristics. We test our

Abstract = {{Placental hypoxia, a major component of the pathophysiology of
   preeclampsia, is associated with various maternal vascular and
   endothelial dysfunctions. The higher incidence of preeclampsia at high
   altitude remains incompletely explained. The aim of the present study
   was to investigate the effect of high altitude on some endothelial and
   vascular dysfunction markers in normal and preeclamptic pregnancies.
   Eighty pregnant women (Paras 2-4) were enrolled in this study, which
   included four groups (each n = 20): normal pregnancies at low altitude
   (NL), normal pregnancies at high altitude (NH), preeclamptic pregnancies
   at low altitude (PL), and preeclamptic pregnancies at high altitude
   (PH). In normal pregnancies at high altitude serum ET-1, plasma TXA(2),
   and serum TNF-alpha levels increased significantly with a significant
   reduction in plasma PGI(2) (66.81 +/- 7.36, 122.86 +/- 13.37, 102.23 +/-
   13.31, 191.57 +/- 19.68, respectively) compared with the NL group (48.92
   +/- 4.58, 89.03 +/- 10.67, 69.86 +/- 7.97, 238.01 +/- 24.55,
   respectively). In preeclampsia at low altitude serum ET-1, plasma
   TXA(2), and serum TNF-alpha levels increased significantly with a
   significant reduction in plasma PGI(2) (88.39 +/- 9.54, 162.73 +/-
   15.92, 142.39 +/- 15.37, 149.155 +/- 15.66, respectively) compared with
   both NL and NH groups. High altitude significantly augmented these
   changes in preeclamptic patients (117.75 +/- 12.96, 211.01 +/- 22.69,
   196.86 +/- 17.64, 111.92 +/- 10.74) compared with PL, NH and NL groups.
   In conclusion hypoxia at high altitude aggravated the disturbances in
   the levels of ET-1, TXA(2), PGI(2) and TNF-alpha associated with
   preeclampsia. This may contribute to the higher risk of preeclampsia at
   high altitude.}},

   be of the second order, the specific reaction rate of which increases

Abstract = {{We revisit the choice of product differentiation in the Hotelling model,
   by assuming that competing firms are vertically separated, and that
   retailers choose products' characteristics. The principle of
   differentiation does not hold because retailers with private information
   about their marginal costs produce less differentiated products in order
   to increase their information rents. Hence, information asymmetry within
   vertical hierarchies may increase social welfare by inducing them to
   sell products that appeal to a larger number of consumers. We show that
   the socially optimal level of transparency between manufacturers and
   retailers depends on the weight assigned to consumers' surplus and
   trades off two effects: higher transparency reduces price distortion but
   induces retailers to produce excessively similar products.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Warm inflation includes inflaton interactions with other fields
   throughout the inflationary epoch instead of confining such interactions
   to a distinct reheating era. Previous investigations have shown that,
   when certain constraints on the dynamics of these interactions and the
   resultant radiation bath are satisfied, a low-momentum-dominated
   dissipation coefficient proportional to T-3/m(chi)(2) can sustain an era
   of inflation compatible with CMB observations. In this work, we extend
   these analyses by including the pole-dominated dissipation term
   proportional to root m(chi)T exp(-m(chi)/T). We find that, with this
   enhanced dissipation, certain models, notably the quadratic hilltop
   potential, perform significantly better. Specifically, we can achieve 50
   e-folds of inflation and a spectral index compatible with Planck data
   while requiring fewer mediator field (O(10(4)) for the quadratic hilltop
   potential) and smaller coupling constants, opening up interesting
   model-building possibilities. We also highlight the significance of the
   specific parametric dependence of the dissipative coefficient which
   could prove useful in even greater reduction in field content.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, and both low-grade
   inflammation and cathepsins might have important roles in breast cancer.
   We questioned whether prediagnostic circulating levels of C-reactive
   protein (CRP), cathepsin B, and cathepsin S were associated with breast
   cancer risk. Sixty-nine incident breast cancer cases diagnosed after
   blood collection and 719 controls from the Swedish Mammography Cohort
   were analyzed for systemic CRP, cathepsin B, and cathepsin S. Cathepsin
   S and inflammation (high-sensitivity CRP {[}hsCRP])-adjusted cathepsin S
   were inversely associated with breast cancer risk (cathepsin S: odds
   ratio {[}OR] for top vs. bottom tertile=0.46; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]=0.23-0.92; p(trend)=0.02; hsCRP-adjusted cathepsin S: OR of 0.44;
   95\% CI=0.22-0.87; p(trend)=0.02). hsCRP was significantly associated
   with increased breast cancer risk (OR for top vs. bottom tertile=2.01;
   95\% CI=1.02-3.95; p(trend)=0.04). No significant association was
   observed between cathepsin B and breast cancer risk (OR for top vs.
   bottom tertile=0.67; 95\% CI=0.32-1.40; p(trend)=0.30). These
   observations lead to the hypothesis that levels of cathepsin S and hsCRP
   observed in women who later developed breast cancer may provide
   prognostic information regarding tumor development and need to be
   evaluated in prospective studies. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 23, 1298-1302.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate the effect of maternal iron deficiency anemia
   (IDA) on fetal thrombopoiesis.
   Methods In this prospective observational study, maternal and cord blood
   iron status parameters (serum iron, serum ferritin, total iron-binding
   capacity, and transferrin saturation), and platelet indices, such as,
   absolute platelet count (APC), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet
   distribution width (PDW) and plateletcrit, were estimated in a
   convenient sample of 142 mothers with IDA (hemoglobin <11 g/dl and serum
   ferritin <12 ng/ml) and an equal number of healthy non-anemic
   (hemoglobin >= 11 g/dl) mothers, who delivered singleton live neonates
   at term gestation. Mothers with antenatal thrombocytopenia, infections,
   inflammatory conditions, pregnancy-induced hypertension and neonates
   with perinatal asphyxia, sepsis and congenital malformations were
   excluded.
   Results For statistical analysis, the IDA group was further subdivided
   into mild-to-moderate (hemoglobin 7-10.9 g/dl) and severe (hemoglobin <7
   g/dl) anemia. Cord blood APC and PDW were comparable between non-anemic
   and mild-to-moderate anemic mothers (242,550 +/- 54,320/mu L vs. 235,260
   +/- 34,620/mu L for APC and 16.2 +/- 1.4 vs. 16.4 +/- 1.8 fl for PDW,
   respectively), but in severe IDA group, cord blood APC and PDW were
   significantly lower (74,520 +/- 12,380/mu L and 17.8 +/- 2.1 fl,
   respectively, p<0.001). MPV and plateletcrit were comparable. None of
   the study neonates had a platelet count <30,000/mu L or showed any
   evidence of clinical bleeding.
   Conclusions Neonates born to mothers with severe IDA had moderate
   thrombocytopenia with increased PDW, though no change was observed in
   MPV and plateletcrit. Further studies should be carried out to identify
   the cause and consequences of this observation.}},

Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Littering constitutes a major societal problem, and any simple
   intervention that reduces its prevalence would be widely beneficial. In
   previous research, we have found that displaying images of watching eyes
   in the environment makes people less likely to litter. Here, we
   investigate whether the watching eyes images can be transferred onto the
   potential items of litter themselves. In two field experiments on a
   university campus, we created an opportunity to litter by attaching
   leaflets that either did or did not feature an image of watching eyes to
   parked bicycles. In both experiments, the watching eyes leaflets were
   substantially less likely to be littered than control leaflets (odds
   ratios 0.22-0.32). We also found that people were less likely to litter
   when there other people in the immediate vicinity than when there were
   not (odds ratios 0.04-0.25) and, in one experiment but not the other,
   that eye leaflets only reduced littering when there no other people in
   the immediate vicinity. We suggest that designing cues of observation
   into packaging could be a simple but fruitful strategy for reducing
   littering.}},

Title = {{A framework for the assessment of MPA effectiveness based on life
   history of fishes}},
Journal = {{OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{A, SI}},
Pages = {{75-87}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Changes in ecosystems structure and function due to the high impacts
   human pressures on oceans have led to the increasing numbers of Marine
   Protected Areas (MPA), since MPA are widely accepted as adequate tools
   to protect, maintain, and restore ocean ecosystems. Increases in
   density, size and biomass of organisms within protected areas have often
   been found. However, their worldwide effectiveness is compromised by the
   interaction of several factors, such as inadequate conduction of
   processes (e.g. due to political reasons) and the common lack of
   appropriate scientific datasets to support planning and management
   decisions. This study proposes a framework for assessing the potential
   effectiveness of an already implemented MPA and identifying major gaps.
   The framework is based on three components: species habitat association,
   species' life history and functional groups and pressures affecting the
   MPA. The potential of the MPA to support the lifecycle of fish species
   was assessed in order to identify effective management actions. The
   theoretical framework was applied to Arrabida MPA (Portugal) in order to
   exemplify its practical results. Arrabida MPA showed potential to
   support the lifecycle of most species, although some key life phases
   (spawning and nursery) are not efficiently protected by the actual
   limits/level of protection of the MPA, namely for some of the most
   important fisheries' target species. This framework is particularly
   useful as an alternative or a complementary support to early decisions
   for MPA management and the identification of priority actions needed to
   ensure the accomplishment of initial objectives or the suitability of
   their adaptation. This approach can be implemented in MPA worldwide,
   although the accuracy of results will be closely related with the
   quality of input data. The present framework can contribute to improve
   the effectiveness of global MPA networks and to fulfill international
   conservation targets, such as OSPAR, Convention for Biological Diversity
   and European Natura 2000 network. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is a winter crop in the southeastern
   United States that has potential in double cropping systems. This
   research was conducted to provide estimates of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Zn
   removal in the harvested portions of the crop (straw and grain). Four
   fiber-type cultivars and one seed-type cultivar were grown with and
   without irrigation for 2 years. The four fiber-types were grown without
   irrigation in the third year. Nutrient concentrations were determined on
   the straw and grain in the first 2 years when the crop was harvested at
   seed maturity. In the third year, only nutrient concentrations in the
   straw were measured. Irrigation had a very limited impact on straw and
   grain nutrient concentrations. Differences among years were greatest for
   K concentration in the straw as K concentration in 2011 to 2012 was
   >1.00\% and almost five times greater than in the other two years.
   Higher K concentration in that year is likely due to differences in the
   amount of K leached from the straw before it was harvested. Differences
   occurred between the fiber-type cultivars and the seed-type cultivars
   for both straw and seed nutrient concentration, but these were generally
   small. Nutrient removal in the flax straw and grain were primarily
   dependent on biomass. Our results indicate a flax straw crop of 5000 lb
   per acre will remove 48 lb N, 8 lb P, 13 to 56 lb K, 17 lb Ca, 9 lb Mg,
   and 0.28 lb Zn per acre.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Reconstruction of orbital deformities is a challenging task.
   Virtual 3-dimensional (3D) planning and the use of patient-specific
   implants (PSIs) could improve anatomic and functional outcomes in the
   orbital region.
   Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was performed of patients
   who underwent late orbital reconstruction from 2009 to 2013. To be
   included in the study, patients had a unilateral orbital deformity by
   involvement of at least 2 orbital wall defects. Noorbital osteotomies
   could be used to correct the deformity. All patients underwent 3D
   virtual treatment planning. The unaffected orbit was mirrored onto the
   affected orbit. The PSI was fabricated according to this plan.
   Navigation was used to check the implant position.
   Results: Six patients were included in this study. All patients had
   diplopia or motility limitations and enophthalmos. The ophthalmic
   parameters showed improvement in all patients. Enophthalmos was
   corrected adequately by the PSI. Four patients received a
   poly-ether-ether-ketone PSI. Two patients received a titanium mesh PSI.
   The position of the PSI was controlled by intraoperative navigation.
   Superimposition of the planned and postoperative positions of the PSI
   showed good correlation.
   Conclusion: PSIs placed with intraoperative navigation facilitate late
   or secondary correction of orbital deformities. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the issue of model selection in the beta regression
   model focused on small samples. The Akaike information criterion (AIC)
   is a model selection criterion widely used in practical applications.
   The AIC is an estimator of the expected log-likelihood value, and
   measures the discrepancy between the true model and the estimated model.
   In small samples, the AIC is biased and tends to select
   overparameterized models. To circumvent that problem, we propose two new
   selection criteria, namely: the bootstrapped likelihood quasi-CV and its
   632QCV variant. We use Monte Carlo simulation to compare the finite
   sample performances of the two proposed criteria to those of the AIC and
   its variations that use the bootstrapped log-likelihood in the class of
   varying dispersion beta regressions. The numerical evidence shows that
   the proposed model selection criteria perform well in small samples. We
   also present and discuss and empirical application.}},

Abstract = {{This research was performed to determine the efficiency effect of
   sedimentary environment of Kerman City area on soil structure by
   comparing natural and reconstituted consolidation curves. In this
   regard, four different criteria such as sensitivity strength, stress
   sensitivity, Schmertman criteria and the result of the uniaxial
   compression test were used. The base of these criteria is to compare the
   results of natural and undisturbed soil consolidation tests. The
   position of undrained shear strength of Kerman City soils in Iv-Su space
   was located on the left side of the intrinsic strength line and this
   confirms that the stress sensitivity of soils is less than the unit.
   Therefore, the soils in the city subzone are mostly over consolidated,
   and cementation and chemical bonds have not developed. The swelling
   sensitivity of fine grained soils based on Schmertman criteria are often
   less than 2 or slightly larger than 2.5 indicating that the soils of
   Kerman City subzones have underdeveloped swelling sensitivity due to
   poor cementation.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays total inlet temperature of gas turbine is far above the
   permissible metal temperature; as a consequence, advanced cooling
   techniques must be applied to protect from thermal stresses, oxidation
   and corrosion the components located in the high pressure stages, such
   as the blade trailing edge. A suitable design of the cooling system for
   the trailing edge has to cope with geometric constraints and aerodynamic
   demands; state-of-the-art of cooling concepts often use film cooling on
   blade pressure side: the air taken from last compressor stages is
   ejected through discrete holes or slots to provide a cold layer between
   hot mainstream and the blade surface. With the goal of ensuring a
   satisfactory lifetime of blades, the design of efficient trailing edge
   film cooling schemes and, moreover, the possibility to check carefully
   their behavior, are hence necessary to guarantee an appropriate metal
   temperature distribution. For this purpose an experimental survey was
   carried out to investigate the film covering performance of different
   pressure side trailing edge cooling systems for turbine blades. The
   experimental test section consists of a scaled-up trailing edge model
   installed in an open loop suction type test rig. Measurements of
   adiabatic effectiveness distributions were carried out on three trailing
   edge cooling system configurations. The baseline geometry is composed by
   inclined slots separated by elongated pedestals; the second geometry
   shares the same cutback configuration, with an additional row of
   circular film cooling holes located upstream; the third model is
   equipped with three rows of in-line film cooling holes. Experiments have
   been performed at nearly ambient conditions imposing several blowing
   ratio values and using carbon dioxide as coolant in order to reproduce a
   density ratio close to the engine conditions (DR=1.52). To extend the
   validity of the survey a comparison between adiabatic effectiveness
   measurements and a prediction by correlative approach was performed to
   compare the experimental results with 1D methodologies. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Introduction: Earlier studies indicated that bevacizumab could favorably
   be combined with radiation. However excessive damage to tumor
   vasculature can result in radioresistance and clinical data suggest that
   treatment sequencing may be important when combining bevacizumab with
   radiation. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether alpha v beta 3
   scintigraphic imaging could provide information to determine the optimal
   combination schedule of bevacizumab and radiotherapy on a lung
   adenocarcinoma model in mice.
   Methods: The tumor volume and angiogenesis changes induced after
   bevacizumab and radiation treatment were evaluated using Tc-99m-RGD on a
   microSPECT/CT. First, we determined the optimal dose regimen for
   bevacizumab and radiotherapy alone.
   Second, the combined effects of bevacizumab and radiation were evaluated
   according to the combination timing (radiation 2, 24, 48 hours after
   bevacizumab and 48 hours before bevacizumab).
   Results: The optimal dose regimen is 20 mg/kg for bevacizumab and 12.5
   Gy for radiotherapy with a significant decrease of tumoral-uptake and
   volume at day 9 compared to the controls- (+8.8\%, +7.7\%, and
   +44\%-volume, respectively, and +9.8\%, +3.8\%, and +207\% uptake,
   respectively). Scintigraphic imaging showed a significant increased RGD
   tumor uptake two hours after bevacizumab treatment compared to 24 hours
   and controls (p = 0.02). When bevacizumab treatment was combined with
   radiation, the best combination appears to be the administration of
   bevacizumab two hours prior to radiation with better results than single
   treatments (p < 0.05). On the contrary, bevacizumab given 24 hours prior
   to radiation led to less tumor growth delay compared to a single agent,
   without significant difference compared to the controls. Histological
   results confirmed these data with an increased percentage of necrosis (p
   = 0.04) and a decrease of angiogenesis (p = 0.04) in the optimal
   combination group.
   Conclusions: The RGD tracer helps us identify the vascular normalization
   window and it shows a supra-additive effect of bevacizumab when
   administered two hours before radiotherapy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Exposure to bullying affects around 3-5 percent of adolescents in
   secondary school and is related to various mental health problems. Many
   different anti-bullying programmes are currently available, but economic
   evaluations are lacking. The aim of this study is to identify the cost
   effectiveness of the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program (OBPP). We
   constructed a decision-tree model for a Swedish secondary school, using
   a public payer perspective, and retrieved data on costs and effects from
   the published literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis to reflect
   the uncertainty in the model was conducted. The base-case analysis
   showed that using the OBPP to reduce the number of victims of bullying
   costs 131 250 Swedish kronor ((sic)14 470) per victim spared. Compared
   to a relevant threshold of the societal value of bullying reduction,
   this indicates that the programme is cost-effective. Using a relevant
   willingness-to-pay threshold shows that the OBPP is a cost-effective
   intervention. (C) 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Involving users/carers in mental health care-planning is
   central to international policy initiatives yet users frequently report
   feeling excluded from the care planning process. Rigorous explorations
   of mental health professionals' experiences of care planning are
   lacking, limiting our understanding of this important translational gap.
   Objectives: To explore professional perceptions of delivering
   collaborative mental health care-planning and involving service users
   and carers in their care.
   Design: Qualitative interviews and focus groups with data combined and
   subjected to framework analysis.
   Setting: UK secondary care mental health services.
   Participants: 51 multi-disciplinary professionals involved in care
   planning and recruited via study advertisements.
   Results: Emergent themes identified care-planning as a meaningful
   platform for user/carer involvement but revealed philosophical tensions
   between user involvement and professional accountability. Professionals
   emphasised their individual, relational skills as a core facilitator of
   involvement, highlighting some important deficiencies in conventional
   staff training programmes.
   Conclusions: Although internationally accepted on philosophical grounds,
   user-involved care-planning is poorly defined and lacks effective
   implementation support. Its full realisation demands greater recognition
   of both the historical and contemporary contexts in which statutory
   mental healthcare occurs. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The New Zealand GDL includes a time-discount at the
   restricted license stage, for attendance at an approved driver education
   course. This is despite international evidence showing that earlier
   licensure associated with a time-discount can increase risk for newly
   licensed drivers. Objective: To examine participation in driver
   education courses and especially those that qualify for a time-discount;
   compare the profiles of course participants with non-participants;
   examine reasons for participation; and examine the association between a
   time-discount and traffic offenses once fully licensed. Method: This
   study was based on the New Zealand Drivers Study (NZDS), a prospective
   cohort study of newly licensed drivers. Data on driver education courses
   were obtained at the full license interview (n = 1763), driver license
   and traffic offense data from the NZ Driver Licence Registry, and other
   data at the NZDS interviews. Results: 94\% had heard of and 49\% (n =
   868) participated in a defensive driving course (DDC). No other course
   had more than 1\% participation. Compared with the others, the DDC group
   were young, non-Maori, and from an area of relatively low deprivation.
   Through GDL, the DDC group were relatively more compliant with the
   conditions, and less likely to crash or receive a traffic offense
   notice. The groups did not differ on personality, alcohol and drug use.
   The reason most (85\%) attended a DDC was to get their full license
   sooner; 86\% (n = 748) received a time-discount. The time-discount group
   were 40\% more likely to receive a traffic offense notice on their full
   license; this reduced to 10\% after controlling for other factors.
   Conclusion and practical implications: The results of this study, when
   viewed in conjunction with other NZ crash evidence, indicate that a
   time-discount should not be given for completing a DDC or Street Talk
   course. (C) 2015 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The severe winter haze episode that occurred in Shanghai from December
   2013 to January 2014, characterized by elevated levels of particulate
   matter (PM), received considerable international attention because of
   its impacts on public health and disruption of day-to-day activities. To
   examine the characteristics of PM during this haze episode and to assess
   the chemistry behind formation of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) and
   associated health impacts due to exposure of toxic elements, we
   characterized eight water soluble inorganic (WSI) ions and twenty four
   trace elements in twelve size-fractionated PM (10 nm-9.9 mu m). The
   average mass concentrations of coarse (1.8 mu m < Dp <9.9 mu m), fine
   (Dp < 2.5 mu m), ultrafine (0.01 mu m < Dp < 0.10 mu m) and nano (0.01
   mu m < Dp < 0.056 mu m) particles during hazy days were 2.8, 5.2, 5.3
   and 5.1 times higher than those during non-hazy days, respectively. The
   in-situ pH (pH(IS)), as predicted by the Aerosol Inorganic Model
   (AIM-IV) in all sizes of PM, was observed to be lower during hazy days
   (average of -0.64) than that during non-hazy days (average of 0.29);
   there was an increased acidity in haze aerosols. Based on the measured
   concentrations of particulate-bound toxic elements, health risk
   assessment was conducted, which revealed that the excess lifetime
   carcinogenic risk to individuals exposed to fine particles under haze
   events increased significantly (P < 0.05) to 69 +/- 18 x 10(-6) compared
   to non-hazy days (34 10 x 10(-6)). The qualitative source attribution
   analysis suggested that the occurrence of haze could be due to a
   combination of increased emissions of PM from multiple anthropogenic
   sources followed by its accumulation under unfavourable meteorological
   conditions with lower mixing heights and less wind speeds and the
   formation of secondary aerosols. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry
   through formation of secondary particulate nitrate that contributes a
   major portion to the mass of particulate matter (PM) that has several
   impacts on the environment in the scales of local, regional and global.
   NO2 is regulated in most of the countries, because it acts as a
   precursor for nitrate formation and it shows significant negative
   effects on human health. The present study was conducted for measurement
   of NO2 concentration at 204 and 101 sampling locations in two Indian
   large cities (population more than 4 million), Delhi and Kanpur,
   respectively by using passive samplers. From the experimental results,
   an average concentration of 68.6 +/- 20.1 mu g/m(3) was observed in
   Delhi and it was 36.9 +/- 12.1 mu g/m(3) in Kanpur. The observed data
   from all sampling sites were utilized on the platform of Geographic
   Information System (GIS) to generate spatially distributed pollution
   maps (using Kriging interpolation method) and maps of probability of
   exceedences of air quality standards. Based on the survey results on
   emission activities, meteorology and pollution maps, this study proposed

   effect of varying cholesterol levels in Tris based extenders on the
   freezability of sexually healthy Malabari buck semen.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 48 ejaculates from two adults healthy
   sexually healthy Malabari bucks were utilized for the study. The
   collected and pooled ejaculates were divided into four groups with Group
   I serving as Control - I, Group II and III were treated with 1 mg and 2
   mg of cholesterol-loaded-cyclodextrin (CLC)/120 x 10(6) spermatozoa,
   respectively, and Group IV treated with 1 mg methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (M
   beta CD) served as Control - II. Manual freezing was carried out to
   cryopreserve the treated and control spermatozoa.
   Results: Treatment of semen samples with CLC resulted in improved
   maintenance of sperm motility at pre-freeze and post-thaw stages of
   cryopreservation without affecting hypo-osmotic swelling response.
   Treatment of semen with 1 mg of CLC/120 x 10(6) spermatozoa was observed
   to be better than treatment with 2 mg of CLC/120 x 10(6) spermatozoa. In
   general, M beta CD treatment was found to result in significantly lower
   sperm characteristics than those of Control - I and CLC treatment at
   pre-feeze and post-thaw stages and when incubated up to 4 h.
   Conclusion: Cholesterol treatment of sexually healthy Malabari buck
   semen was found to hold promise for improving cryopreservability of
   spermatozoa.}},

Abstract = {{Digital image processing, an innovative cost-effective technique, was
   employed to investigate the hydrodynamics of a rectangular internal loop
   airlift reactor with double downcomer. The whole reactor was divided
   into two downcomers and a riser by means of two vertical blades to
   achieve a new geometry. Air and water served as gas and liquid media.
   Experimental measurements were performed by visualizing the
   concentration of a colored tracer by a digital camera. The captured
   successive images at specified time intervals were analyzed by the
   ImageJ software to turn images into quantifiable data. For four reactor
   geometries, the residence time distribution curves in individual
   sections and the liquid mixing performance were determined by this
   noninvasive method. The speed of this technique to capture real-time
   data of flow patterns may be one of the most important concerns for
   imaging multiphase flows in process industries.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropologic age estimation techniques are currently limited to teeth

   matrices such as buccal swabs are equally relevant in forensic
   investigations. We demonstrate that the same set of 4 genes which we
   previously used for age determination of blood and dentin provides
   highly accurate age prediction results for buccal swabs too. A quadratic
   regression using DNA methylation values of specific CpG sites within the
   genes APSA, PDE4C, EDARADD and ELOVL2 provided age estimation accuracies

Abstract = {{Background Severe cerebral vasospasm is a major cause of death and
   disability in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. No
   causative treatment is yet available and hypertensive hypervolemic
   therapy (HHT) is often insufficient to avoid delayed cerebral ischemia
   and neurological deficits. We compared patients receiving continuous
   intra-arterial infusion of the calcium-antagonist nimodipine with a
   historical group treated with HHT and oral nimodipine alone.
   MethodsBetween 0.5 and 1.2 mg/h of nimodipine were continuously
   administered by intra-arterial infusion via microcatheters either into
   the internal carotid or vertebral artery or both, depending on the areas
   of vasospasm. The effect was controlled via multimodal neuromonitoring
   and transcranial Doppler sonography. Outcome was determined by means of
   the Glasgow Outcome Scale at discharge and 6 months after the hemorrhage
   and compared to a historical control group.
   ResultsTwenty-one patients received 28 intra-arterial nimodipine
   infusions. Six months after discharge, the occurrence of cerebral
   infarctions was significantly lower (42.6 \%) in the nimodipine group
   than in the control group (75.0 \%). This result was reflected by a
   significantly higher proportion (76.0 \%) of patients with good outcome
   in the nimodipine-treated group, when compared to 10.0 \% good outcome
   in the control group. Median GOS was 4 in the nimodipine group and 2 in
   the control group (p = 0.001).
   ConclusionsContinuous intra-arterial nimodipine infusion is an effective
   treatment for patients with severe cerebral vasospasm who fail to
   respond to HHT and oral nimodipine alone. Key to the effective
   administration of continuous intra-arterial nimodipine is multimodal
   neuromonitoring and the individual adaptation of dosage and time of
   infusion for each patient.}},

   their background knowledge of cardiac physiology. Next, they acquired
   ultrasound video loops of the heart. Faculty members taught them
   nonelectrical aspects of cardiac physiology using those loops. Finally,
   students took a posttest to evaluate for improvements in their
   knowledge. Students also completed an anonymous questionnaire about
   their experience. The mean pretest score was 4.8 of 9 (53.3\%). The mean
   posttest score was 7.35 of 9 (81.7\%). The mean difference was
   significant at P < 0.0001. Student feedback was very positive about the
   ultrasound laboratory. Ninety-five percent of the students agreed or
   strongly agreed that the ultrasound laboratory was a valuable teaching
   tool and that it improved their understanding of cardiac physiology. All
   students agreed or strongly agreed the laboratory was helpful from a

Abstract = {{Availability and rapid growth of microarray databases have made an
   integrated analysis of these databases computationally challenging. We
   present a novel approach to content-based searching in microarray
   databases, using binary vector representations, that is inspired from
   the Chemoinformatics field. A benchmark compendium of microarray
   datasets is established for evaluation of content-based searching.
   Differential expression profiles from microarray experiments are
   represented either as floating point vectors or as concise binary
   vectors. The benchmark compendium is searched using several distance
   measures for determining similarity. We demonstrate that the use of
   binary vector representations achieves accuracies equivalent to or
   better than the use of floating point measures, while at the same time
   significantly reducing the time required to search a microarray
   database, owing to the fast bitwise operations and the reduction in
   memory requirements. Experiments on a large database of binary vector
   representations demonstrate that a modified Tanimoto distance measure is
   best suited for content-based search of differential microarray
   profiles.}},

   Type I error. In this article, the information about ACs is used only
   for the partitioning of administered items into two disjoint subtests:
   items where ACs did not occur, and items where ACs did occur. A new
   statistic is based on the difference in performance between these
   subtests (measured as Kullback-Leibler divergence between corresponding
   posteriors of latent traits), where, in order to avoid the uncertainty,
   only final responses are used. One of the subtests can be filtered such
   that the asymptotic distribution of the statistic is chi-square with one
   degree of freedom. In computer simulations, the presented statistic
   demonstrated a strong robustness to the uncertainty and higher detection
   rates in contrast to two popular statistics based on wrong-to-right ACs.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{In the recent year, social networks have revolutionized the ways of
   interacting and exchanging information on the Internet. Millions of
   users interact frequently and share variety of digital content with each
   other. They express their feelings and opinions on every topic of
   interest. These opinions carry import value for personal, academic, and
   commercial applications, but the volume and the speed at which these are
   produced make it a challenging task for researchers and the underlying
   technologies to provide useful insights into such data. We attempt to
   extend the established online analytical processing (OLAP) technology to
   allow multidimensional analysis of social media data. In this paper, we
   pursue a goal of providing a generic multidimensional model dedicated to
   the OLAP of social media and specially Twitter. The proposed model
   reflects on some specifics such as recursive references between tweets,
   Empty dimension, and different types of hierarchies. It is implemented
   using NetBeans IDE platform. We present also some experimental results.
   We expect our proposed approach to be applicable for analyzing the data
   of other social networks as well.}},

Journal = {{THROMBOSIS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{136}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cancer patients have a significantly higher risk of
   developing a venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared to non-cancer
   patients and yet studies suggest VTE risk among ambulatory cancer
   patients varies widely. Recently, predictive models capable of
   risk-stratifying a broad range of ambulatory cancer outpatients have
   been developed. Using the Khorana model a score of 2 was
   intermediate-high risk for VTE as reported by Ay and colleagues.
   However, validation in a broader population and methods to implement
   this model seamlessly into clinical practice are lacking.
   Objective: To create and assess the feasibility of an innovative
   computerized Care Process Management System (CPMS) that would
   automatically access electronic medical records to calculate in
   real-time the risk of VTE in patients with active cancer using an
   established VTE risk scoring system.
   Methods: A prospective observational study of all newly referred cancer
   patients at the Ottawa Regional Cancer Center, the sole cancer care
   provider for 1.2 million inhabitants, was conducted.
   Results: 699 new referrals were determined to have a cancer diagnosis
   for the first time as identified by the computer software and qualified
   for our study and 580 were eligible. In total 25\% had intermediate-high
   risk for VTE and during the 3-month follow up period, 16 of the 143
   (11\%) developed a VTE which further validates the Khorana model for
   identifying intermediate-high risk patients. Of the 437 patients in the
   low risk group 19 (4\%) developed a VTE.
   Conclusion: Newly diagnosed cancer patients can be readily stratified
   into intermediate-high and low risk of VTE using our novel CPMS system.
   This innovative tool can be used to facilitate customized management
   decisions regarding VTE prophylaxis for intermediate-high risk patients
   based their individual risk factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Primary Cerebellar Gliosarcoma with Extracranial Metastases: An Orphan
   Differential Diagnosis}},
Journal = {{WORLD NEUROSURGERY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Gliosarcomas are rare, malignant primary brain tumors, most
   commonly located in the temporal lobe, that contain both glial and
   mesenchymal elements. Gliosarcomas located within the cerebellum are
   exceedingly rare. The previously unreported finding of a cerebellar
   gliosarcoma concurrently with an extracranial metastasis to the lungs is
   discussed here.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 57-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of
   chest pain, weight loss, headaches, and vomiting. Physical examination
   revealed a left cerebellar dysfunction, and the radiological work-up
   revealed a 6 3 6-cm right apical pulmonary tumor and a 4 x 3.5 x 3.8-cm
   peripherally enhancing left cerebellar mass. On the basis of a smoking
   history in the setting of a lung lesion and cerebellar mass, the
   presumptive diagnosis was primary lung cancer with metastasis to the
   cerebellum. Gross total resection of a firm pseudo-encapsulated
   cerebellar mass was performed. The microscopic features and the
   immunohistochemical profile confirmed the diagnosis of Gliosarcoma. The
   thoracic lesion was removed subsequently, and pathology confirmed it as
   an extracranial metastasis from the cerebellar gliosarcoma. Adjuvant
   radiation and chemotherapy were then administered. No clinical or
   radiographic evidence of recurrence was observed during one year of
   follow-up monitoring.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, a primary infratentorial
   gliosarcoma with extracranial metastases has not been previously
   described.}},

Abstract = {{Besides generating faster solutions, parallel computers can be used to
   solve bigger or more complex problems. In particular, they can be
   utilized to run simulations at finer resolutions and to model physical
   phenomena more realistically. We describe in this article the
   development of a parallel cellular automata algorithm used in the
   three-dimensional simulation of multicellular tissue growth.
   Computational models of this genre are becoming ever more important
   because they provide an alternative approach to continuous models and an
   ability to describe the dynamics of complex biological systems evolving
   in time. We report on the different components of the model where
   cellular automata is used to model different types of cell populations
   that execute persistent random walks on the computational grid, collide,
   aggregate, and proliferate until they reach confluence. We elaborate on
   the main issues encountered in the parallelization of the algorithm as
   well as its implementation on a parallel machine with a particular focus
   on maintaining determinism. By delaying the exchange of cells in the
   shared boundaries between neighboring processors till after all events
   related to cell division and motion are accounted for in a given time
   step, good parallel performance results are obtained on a
   high-performance cluster.}},

Abstract = {{The Land Surface Albedo (LSA) was estimated in the broader Mediterranean
   area, on an 8-day basis, for the period 2001-2012. MODIS (Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) albedo product parameters, at 1 km
   x 1 km spatial resolution, were used. LSA changes during the above study
   period were also estimated, based on annual average values. Results
   revealed increasing LSA trends dominating in the Levant region and
   decreasing in NW Africa, of the order of 3.3\% and -6.6\%, respectively,
   while mixed signs were observed in southern Europe. Three factors that
   can determine the LSA changes were investigated: land cover changes,
   rainfall changes and Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) spatio-temporal
   variability. The analysis made clear that land cover and rainfall
   changes affect LSA at local and regional scales, while the effect of AOT
   was not important. Land cover changes revealed deforestation hot spots,
   where LSA was increased by 13\%-14\%, while an increase in rainfall over
   many areas in NW Africa appears to have caused a corresponding decrease
   in LSA by over 5\%. These findings highlight the importance of a global
   and continuous LSA monitoring at both regional and local scales, which
   is necessary for both climate monitoring and modeling studies.}},

Abstract = {{Rh-based structured catalysts for the Catalytic Partial Oxidation of CH4
   to syngas were prepared by electrosynthesis of Rh/Mg/Al
   hydrotalcite-type compounds on FeCrAlloy foams and calcination. The
   effects of Rh content, total metal concentration, and partial
   replacement of Mg2+ by Ni2+ in the electrolytic solution on coating
   thickness, Rh speciation, metallic particle size, and catalytic activity
   were investigated by SEM/EDS, mu-XRF/XANES and tests under diluted and
   concentrated reaction conditions.
   The amount of Rh species, present as Mg (RhxAl1-x)(2)O-4, depended on
   the thickness of the electrosynthesised layer as well as the Rh particle
   size and dispersion. Smaller and more dispersed particles were obtained
   by decreasing the Rh concentration in the electrolytic solution from
   Rh/Mg/Al=11/70/19 to 5/70/25 and 2/70/28 atomic ratio\% (a.r.\%) and in
   thinner rather than thicker layers. Despite the improvement in metallic
   particles features, the CH4 conversion was negatively affected by the
   low amount of active sites in the coating, the high metal support
   interaction and possibly the oxidation of metallic particles and carbon
   formation.
   A larger amount of solid containing well dispersed Rh particles was
   deposited by increasing the total metal concentration from 0.03 M to
   0.06 M with the Rh/Mg/Al=5/70/25 a.r.\%, and the catalytic performances
   were enhanced. The partial replacement of Mg2+ by Ni2+ gave rise to a
   very active bimetallic Rh/Ni catalyst, CH4 conversion and selectivity to
   syngas were above 90\%, however, it slightly deactivated with
   time-on-stream. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Aspiration events (AEs) are a well-recognized complication in
   trauma patients and have traditionally been considered a risk factor for
   pneumonia. Despite this, there is no consensus on the incidence or
   clinical significance of AE in the trauma population.
   METHODS All patients admitted as trauma team activations at our Level I
   trauma center who were intubated in the field or on arrival from
   September 2013 to August 2014 were prospectively collected. Field and
   admission data including witnessed AEs were analyzed. Additional
   hospital data included imaging, associated injuries, laboratory, and
   clinical data. Early respiratory failure, pneumonia, and hospital
   mortality were collected.
   RESULTS During the study period, 228 patients met inclusion criteria.
   Median age was 35.5 years, and Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 21.0.
   Overall, 58 patients (25.4\%) had witnessed AEs. Patients with AE had
   significantly higher ISS (26.0 vs. 17.0, p = 0.027) and lower Glasgow
   Coma Scale (GCS) score on admission (median, 4.0 vs. 7.0; p = 0.003),
   despite similar field GCS score (p = 0.946). Body mass index (median,
   27.2 vs. 26.2; p = 0.374) and intoxication rates (86.2\% vs. 83.5\%, p =
   0.835) were similar between groups. Early pneumonia and respiratory
   failure were rare in all patients and were not higher in those with AE.
   Although mortality was higher after AE in patients who died directly
   after admission (51.7\% vs. 30.0\%, p = 0.004), in patients who survived
   to intensive care unit admission, there was no longer a difference
   between groups and aspiration was not an independent predictor of
   mortality (p = 0.107) on multivariable regression analysis.
   CONCLUSION The rate of aspiration in trauma is high and more likely to
   occur in patients with increased injury burden or depressed GCS score.
   In patients who survive past admission, early pneumonia rates are
   similar, regardless of AE. These data suggest that aspiration is a
   marker of severe illness and is associated with but not an independent
   predictor of mortality.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach for robust control against unmodeled
   system dynamics and additive noises based on the introduction of
   fractional order functions in the control loop. An intensive research
   effort is focusing nowadays on fractional order control (FOC). The main
   reason for this rapidly growing interest is their advantageous
   properties allowing the improvement of the plant performance and
   robustness versus external noises and disturbance. The proposed design
   approach for fractional order systems and their application in control
   engineering is symmetrically opposed to the classical methodologies
   which approximate the fractional order operators by a finite set of
   integer order transfer elements. This new concept consists in
   approximating integer order transfers by a set of fractional order
   filters, allowing the system designer to introduce fractional order
   dynamics and properties to the rational control system under study. The
   integrator in the PID control algorithm and the classical model
   reference adaptive control (MRAC) law is fractionalized in order to
   robustify the control system. The implementation of the fractionalized
   terms is realized by means of the singularity function numerical
   approximation method. Illustrative simulation examples show that the
   disturbance rejection has been significantly improved for both fixed and
   adaptive controllers. This technique may be easily implemented to a
   large variety of control schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Architects have long held that visual encounters with designed spaces
   bring viewers into new worlds and generate new sensations and attitudes.
   As Peter Kraftl and Peter Adey write, spaces are made in an ongoing,
   contingent sense, in styles that are not only symbolic, but more than
   representational - haptic, performative, material, and affective.'
   Designed spaces interact with and affect the bodies they come in contact
   with; in short, they generate affect, including horror. By examining two
   very different types of built worlds - namely Lee Bontecou's mixed-media
   wall-mounted sculptures (1959-1966) and the Nostromo set of Ridley
   Scott's Alien (1979) - the author explores how visual encounters with
   the horror of the void unveil horror's operation as a non-narrative zone
   of intensity. These examples reveal the differences between horror and
   fear, dread, and disgust (affects typically evoked by horror narratives)
   and horror's independence from narrative and even figuration.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes, for the first time, the genetic and phenotypic
   diversity among 93 Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus, GBS)
   isolates collected from Guelma, Algeria and Marseille, France. All
   strains were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The molecular support
   of antibiotic resistance and serotyping were investigated by polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR). The phylogenetic lineage of each GBS isolate was
   determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and grouped into clonal
   complexes (CCs) using eBURST. The isolates represented 37 sequence types
   (STs), 16 of which were novel, grouped into five CCs, and belonging to
   seven serotypes. Serotype V was the most prevalent serotype in our
   collection (44.1 \%). GBS isolates of each serotype were distributed
   among multiple CCs, including cps III/CC19, cps V/CC1, cps Ia/CC23, cps
   II/CC10, and cps III/CC17. All isolates presented susceptibility to
   penicillin, whereas resistance to erythromycin was detected in 40 \% and
   tetracycline in 82.2 \% of isolates. Of the 37 erythromycin-resistant
   isolates, 75.7 \% showed the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B
   (MLSB)-resistant phenotype and 24.3 \% exhibited the macrolide
   (M)-resistant phenotype. Constitutive MLSB resistance (46 \%) mediated
   by the ermB gene was significantly associated with the Guelma isolates,
   whereas the M resistance phenotype (24.3 \%) mediated by the mefA/E gene
   dominated among the Marseille isolates and belonged to ST-23.
   Tetracycline resistance was predominantly due to tetM, which was
   detected alone (95.1 \%) or associated with tetO (3.7 \%). These results
   provide epidemiological data in these regions that establish a basis for
   monitoring increased resistance to erythromycin and also provide insight
   into correlations among clones, serotypes, and resistance genes.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores, in greater detail than has been done before, Jean
   Warin's public criticism of Bernini's marble bust of Louis XIV (1665)
   and his own contending portrait in the same material (16651666).
   Chantelou's Journal is the primary source for Warin's negative comments,
   which were focused on the forehead of Bernini's bust. The forehead was
   precisely the area that Bernini based on coins of Alexander the Great,
   thus creating a link between the King and the ancient conqueror, but
   Warin apparently did not recognize this. His rival bust is
   proto-neo-classical: Louis is dressed in ancient Roman armor, not
   contemporary dress and armor as in the Italian work, without the
   suggested movement of the latter, and with a forehead more covered with
   hair a pointed riposte. The two busts were displayed as a pair in
   changing royal locations (Louvre, Palais des Tuileries, Versailles).
   Warin's enjoyed a place of honor in the Escalier des Ambassadeurs at
   Versailles for a few years from 1679 on, but eventually lost favor,
   whereas Bernini's (after which many casts were made) was set up in the
   Salon de Diane at Versailles in 1684, where it has remained ever since.
   Documents indicate that although Warin made the model, it was Gerard
   Leonard Herard, his collaborator, who actually carved the rival marble
   bust. The article also discusses the evidence for a bronze bust of Louis
   XIV by Warin, which remains untraced.}},

Abstract = {{At the end of 2014, more than 23\% of the foreign currency denominated
   mortgage portfolio in Hungary was overdue; about 20\% was classified as
   non-performing and the tendency is worsening. In this paper, we propose
   a solution to effectively reduce the credit and systemic risk inherent
   to this portfolio - the proposed model can be applied to other mortgage
   portfolios in trouble as well. The main element of our proposal is
   income-contingent repayment complemented with effective incentives to
   motivate debtors to repay their debt. We demonstrate that the proposed
   scheme is attractive for both the debtors and the lenders; therefore,
   contrary to some recent policy measures, in this case there is no need
   for direct state intervention to force modifications to the existing
   legal contracts. In order to evaluate the possible effects, we simulated
   a realistic population of borrowers with different age, debt,
   loan-to-value, and income. Then we calculated the expected income paths,
   the repayments of the borrowers as well as the profit of the lenders on
   the basis of the non-performing FX mortgage portfolio. The results
   underpin that the proposed scheme creates significant value added and,
   most importantly, that it can effectively reduce the vulnerability of
   the entire economy to future shocks.}},

Abstract = {{Tortuous saphenous vein graft (SVG) hemodynamics was investigated using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. Computed tomography (CT)
   technology is used for non-invasive bypass graft assessment seven days
   after surgery. CT investigation shows two regions with severe shape
   remodeling, one is an angle type contortion and the other one is a sharp
   curvature with tortuous area reduction. The numerical analysis carefully
   examines the effect of an SVG geometry remodeling through flow
   separation, particle deposition, and wall shear stress (WSS). During the
   cardiac cycle, overall pressure drop increases from 2.6 mm Hg to 4.4
   mmHg. In the accelerating part of the systolic phase, particles released
   in the inlet section move downstream toward the first narrowed part
   (elbow type contortion) with a helical motion. WSS range along the
   cardiac cycle varies from 2Pa to 42 Pa, enough to damage the endothelial
   cells. Vessel torsion induced helical flow can reduce the flow
   disturbance and separation. Additionally, in the distal end of the
   graft, the high particle concentrations can promote the inflammatory
   processes in the vessels.}},

Title = {{Hexavalent chromium removal in contaminated water using reticulated

Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Pages = {{100-111}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Chitosan particles (CH) were obtained from seafood processing wastes
   (shrimp shells) and physicochemically characterized; deacetylation
   degree of CH was measured by Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and
   potentiometric titration; polymer molecular weight was determined by
   intrinsic viscosity measurements. Reticulated micro/nanoparticles of
   chitosan (MCH) with an average diameter close to 100 nm were synthesized
   by ionic gelation of chitosan using tripolyphosphate (TPP), and
   characterized by SEM, size distribution and Zeta-potential.
   Detoxification capacities of CH and MCH were tested analyzing the
   removal of hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) from contaminated water, at
   different initial chromium concentrations. The effect of pH on
   adsorption capacity of CH and MCH was experimentally determined and
   analyzed considering the Cr(VI) stable complexes (anions) formed, the
   presence of protonated groups in chitosan particles and the addition of
   the reticulating agent (TPP). Chitosan crosslinking was necessary to
   adsorb Cr(VI) at pH < 2 due to the instability of CH particles in acid
   media. Langmuir isotherm described better than Freundlich and Temkin
   equations the equilibrium adsorption data. Pseudo-second order rate
   provided the best fitting to the kinetic data in comparison to
   pseudo-first order and Elovich equations. Chemical analysis to determine
   the oxidation state of the adsorbed Cr, showed that Cr(VI) was adsorbed
   on CH particles without further reduction; in contrast Cr(VI) removed
   from the solution was reduced and bound to the MCH as Cr(III). The
   reduction of toxic Cr(VI) to the less or nontoxic Cr(III) by the
   reticulated chitosan micro/nanoparticles can be considered a very
   efficient detoxification technique for the treatment of Cr(VI)
   contaminated water. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The master agreements that nominally govern the transactions between
   mid-western OEMs and their suppliers are not, for the most part,
   designed to create legal obligations. Rather, like the role played by
   firm boundaries in the Coase-Williamson theory of the firm, they create
   a space in which private order can flourish. This article explores how
   sophisticated transactors in this market have combined governance
   techniques associated with arm's-length contracting, intra-firm
   hierarchy, and trust-based relational contracting to create
   relationships that are long-term, highly cooperative, and characterized
   by significant relationship-specific investment. It suggests that these
   transactors have been able to accomplish these outcomes with only
   minimal reliance on the legal system, in large part because they operate
   in a market of highly interconnected firms-a network that itself
   functions as a contract governance mechanism. It then explores the
   implications of these contract structures and the availability of
   network governance for firms' make-or-buy decisions and the likelihood
   of innovation.}},

Abstract = {{The histopathologic presentation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV)
   infection of the central nervous system is varied and is not well
   understood. Here we report a case of VZV encephalomyelitis with
   prominent demyelinating pathology in a patient with a history of
   follicular lymphoma treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
   The patient presented with waxing and waning bilateral limb weakness and
   mental status changes. MRI showed leptomeningeal, peripheral spinal cord
   and periventricular cerebral white matter lesions in the brain, and
   polymerase chain reaction on cerebrospinal fluid detected VZV DNA. The
   patient expired from developing atrial fibrillation that rapidly
   progressed to ventricular fibrillation 10days after admission to our
   hospital. Autopsy revealed macrophage-rich areas of demyelination in the
   spinal cord and cerebrum with relative preservation of axons associated
   with inclusion bodies and positive immunostaining for VZV. This case
   represents a rare example of VZV encephalomyelitis presenting with a
   predominantly demyelinating, multiple sclerosis-like pathology. The
   clinical and histopathologic findings and relevant literature are
   presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of host species identity and spatial variability
   on animals inhabiting subtidal coralline algal turfs, by comparing the
   assemblages of small (1-8 mm) mobile invertebrates associated with five
   coralline turf species across a number of subtidal rocky reefs in
   northeastern New Zealand. Coralline turf fauna were abundant (average of
   16,000 to 80,000 ind.m(-2)) and diverse (129 taxa in total), with
   assemblages dominated by arthropods, gastropods and polychaetes. Despite
   substantial differences in the morphologies of the coralline turf
   species, host identity had little effect on total abundance and richness
   of the fauna, and a moderate effect on taxonomic composition. Spatial
   variation at the scale of 10(2)-10(3) m had a stronger influence than
   host identity on all three assemblage-level properties, with wave
   exposure and depth having the most explanatory power of the
   environmental factors measured. Host-specificity was low, probably due
   to the close taxonomic relatedness of the host algal species and their
   inedibility (with consequent lack of dietary specialisation by fauna).
   For our study system, the results justify the common practice of lumping
   coralline turf species in ecological studies with regard to the
   description of the total abundance and richness of the associated fauna,
   but not the taxonomic composition of the fauna.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: HNA-3a antibodies induce severe transfusion-related acute
   lung injury (TRALI) in which neutrophils play a major role. As
   neutrophil passage through the pulmonary microvasculature is a critical
   step in the pathogenesis of TRALI, we investigated the impact of HNA-3a
   antibodies on two important factors that could impair granulocyte
   passage through lung capillaries: the elasticity of neutrophils and the
   expression and activation of adhesion molecules.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The impact of HNA-3a antibodies on the
   elasticity of neutrophils was investigated using atomic force microscopy
   (AFM). Neutrophils were settled on
   poly-2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate-coated glass slides before treatment
   with anti-HNA-3a plasma samples, control plasma, or control plasma
   containing formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). Elasticity
   measurements were carried out in a temperature-controlled perfusion
   chamber using an atomic force microscopy (AFM) device. The impact of
   HNA-3a antibodies on the surface expression of total CD11b, activation
   of CD11b, and L-selectin (CD62L) shedding was investigated by flow
   cytometry. The functional impact of HNA-3a antibodies on neutrophil
   adhesion was assessed using fibrinogen-coated plates.
   RESULTS: HNA-3a antibodies induced stiffening of neutrophils
   (124\%-40\%; p<0.05) to a similar extent as fMLP. This effect was
   blocked by treatment of neutrophils with cytochalasin D. While total
   surface expression of CD11b and L-selectin on neutrophils was largely
   unaffected, HNA-3a antibodies induced alloantigen-specific activation of
   CD11b (172\%-107\%; p<0.05) and increased adhesion of neutrophils to
   fibrinogen.
   CONCLUSION: Accumulation of neutrophils in the pulmonary
   microvasculature during severe TRALI is likely mediated by increased
   rigidity and CD11b-mediated adhesion of neutrophils leading to retention
   of neutrophils.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, coherent risk measure minimization was formulated as robust
   optimization and the correspondence between coherent risk measures and
   uncertainty sets of robust optimization was investigated. We study
   minimizing coherent risk measures under a norm equality constraint with
   the use of robust optimization formulation. Not only existing coherent
   risk measures but also a new coherent risk measure is investigated by
   setting a new uncertainty set. The norm equality constraint itself has a
   practical meaning or plays a role to prevent a meaningless solution, the
   zero vector, in the context of portfolio optimization or binary
   classification in machine learning, respectively. For such advantages,
   the convexity is sacrificed in the formulation. However, we show a
   condition for an input of our problem which guarantees that the
   nonconvex constraint is convexified without changing the optimality of
   the problem. If the input does not satisfy the condition, we propose to
   solve a mixed integer optimization problem by using the or -norm. The
   numerical experiments show that our approach has good performance for
   portfolio optimization and binary classification and also imply its
   flexibility of modelling that makes it possible to deal with various
   coherent risk measures.}},

Abstract = {{Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are simple model membrane systems of
   cell-size, which are instrumental to study the function of more complex
   biological membranes involving heterogeneities in lipid composition,
   shape, mechanical properties, and chemical properties. We have devised a
   method that makes it possible to prepare a uniform sample of ternary
   GUVs of a prescribed composition and heterogeneity by mixing different
   populations of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). The validity of the
   protocol has been demonstrated by applying it to ternary lipid mixture
   of DOPC, DPPC, and cholesterol by mixing small unilamellar vesicles
   (SUVs) of two different populations and with different lipid
   compositions. The compositional homogeneity among GUVs resulting from
   SUV mixing is quantified by measuring the area fraction of the liquid
   ordered liquid disordered phases in giant vesicles and is found to be
   comparable to that in GUVs of the prescribed composition produced from
   hydration of dried lipids mixed in organic solvent Our method opens up
   the possibility to quickly increase and manipulate the complexity of GUV
   membranes in a controlled manner at physiological buffer and temperature
   conditions. The new protocol will permit quantitative biophysical
   studies of a whole new class of well-defined model membrane systems of a
   complexity that resembles biological membranes with rafts. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. This study reports tear compensation observed in rabbits with
   bilateral resection of main lacrimal gland (LG) and explored the
   potential mechanisms.
   METHODS. Dry eye conditions were created by resection of nictitating
   membrane (NM), Harderian gland (HG), and main LG in eight (16 eyes) male
   New Zealand White rabbits. In addition to Schirmer test, Periodic
   acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, and ocular surface staining with fluorescein
   and rose Bengal, conjunctival impression cytology was employed before
   and up to 4 months after excision (AE). Using reverse
   transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR),
   expression of inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and matrix
   metalloproteinase-9) were monitored. Further, involvement of ionic and
   water transporters were investigated in conjunctival epithelium.
   RESULTS. Significant dry eye phenotypes in rabbits were observed 1 month
   AE, which corroborated with elevated biomarker mRNA expression. However,
   Schirmer test score and goblet cell numbers never decreased AE in
   conjunctival epithelium. Moreover, ocular surface staining, and
   biomarker expression declined to baseline in over 4 months AE. No
   upregulation was observed of the following conjunctival ionic
   transporters: cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator,
   sodium potassium chloride cotransporters, sodium potassium ATPase, and
   epithelial sodium channels. Instead, aquaporin (AQP) 4 and AQP5 were
   upregulated. Immunolocalization and immune blotting of AQP4 was
   demonstrated in rabbit conjunctival epithelium.
   CONCLUSIONS. In the absence of NM, HG, and main LG in rabbits, tear
   secretion was not decreased and significant improvement of dry eye
   phenotypes observed with time AE. Conjunctival AQPs are possibly
   involved in a compensatory tear fluid production.}},

Abstract = {{Life is a series of experiences and responses woven in the chain of
   causality that builds the knowledge system in the universe, a complex
   system altogether. When we observe the subatomic system or the quantum
   field, the very act of measurement perturbs the quantum field within.
   The interaction produces change in the ground state of the quantum
   field. The mind field is treated as the quantum field as envisaged by
   various eminent scientists. The theory of perturbation helps us to
   compute the amount of energy change in the form of unitary time
   evolution operator followed by the Hamiltonian of the system. The Linear
   Response Theory helps us to compute not only the amount of energy
   responsible for the perturbation but to estimate the Probable responses
   from such quantum field of the mind subjected to the perturbation. Thus
   the continuous series of measurements, perturbations and responses build
   the chain of causality within the mind field itself to perceive the
   continuity of the life. We will see in this attempt. the formulation of
   functionality of mind field part identity of the observer, kind of
   observable, the process of realization of being experienced and null

Abstract = {{A hybrid power plant wherein solar steam reforming of natural gas and a
   steam injected gas turbine power plant are integrated for solar syngas
   production and use has been developed by the authors. In this plant a
   gas turbine is fed by a mixture of natural gas and solar syngas, which
   is mainly composed of hydrogen and water steam, from mid-low temperature
   steam reforming reaction whose heat duty is supplied by a parabolic
   trough Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plant. The paper shows an
   economic assessment of the proposed solution if applied, in particular,
   in North-African Countries: a comparison is made between a traditional
   system and the innovative proposed one. The Levelized Cost of Energy
   (LCOE) computation shows how the solar hybridization can contribute to a
   reduction of electric energy production costs of about -2.7\%. Net
   Present Value (NPV) analysis shows how, at the end of plant life, the
   hybrid plant produces a higher NPV, thus producing a net benefit about
   11\% higher than the traditional one. Moreover, the hybrid power plant
   LCOE and NPV have been computed at different electric energy revenues

Abstract = {{External hemipelvectomy associated with trauma or during the operative
   management of musculoskeletal sarcomas may yield a soft tissue defect
   that can only be sufficiently covered by free tissue transfers. The
   application of ``spare-parts surgery,{''} such as a fillet of leg or
   thigh flap, uses distal uninvolved parts that are otherwise viable
   tissues as donor tissues to cover defects. This concept has great
   utility to achieve soft tissue coverage in challenging cases, such as
   hemipelvectomy. However, during such complicated and time-consuming
   cases, prolonged ischemia time of the proposed donor tissues can be
   problematic. We describe a technique developed by the senior author
   (SJK) that minimizes the ischemia time of donor free tissues during
   external hemipelvectomy. This technique is applicable to other surgeries
   where filleted spare parts are the donor-site source for free tissue
   transfer. (C) 2015 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and

Abstract = {{This article addresses issues related to paid work, unpaid work, and
   economic viability in alternative food initiatives (AFIs) by comparing
   three urban agriculture entities in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. The
   discussion is framed in terms of what constitutes alternative economic
   practices. Three standards of assessment are used in the analysis:
   First, that of whether the AFIs are able to provide ``good jobs{''}
   along with ``good food{''}; second, the extent to which the AFIs engage
   in alternative economic practices by relying on non-exploitative forms
   of work; and third, the extent to which they foster spaces for enabling
   progressive social change by engaging in a reflexive local politics
   oriented toward creating sustainable, democratic, and equitable
   community food systems. Preliminary research indicates that the three
   AFIs surveyed represent a spectrum with respect to their ability to
   provide ``good jobs,{''} their non-exploitative economic practices, and
   the extent to which they foster spaces for enabling a reflexive food
   politics. Given that the economic viability of all three AFIs depends on
   a significant amount of unpaid work, the discussion concludes by
   reflecting on the nature and implications of unpaid work by addressing
   three questions: How is unpaid work understood and fostered by these
   AFIs; what are the conditions that enable it; and is it indicative of
   alternative, noncapitalist economic logics and practices?}},

   content or 28\% of sugar content. Biscuit consumers were recruited to
   eat either the fat (n = 113) or the sugar-reduced set of biscuits (n =

   laboratory conditions. During each session, they rated their liking of
   the 5 variants. At the end of each of the 4 first sessions, consumers
   were given 16 biscuits for their home consumption during the week.
   Participants were split into 3 groups of exposure: every week, a control
   group received the standard variant, a ``direct{''} group received the
   most reduced variant and a ``stepwise{''} group received a more and more
   reduced variant. After both control and stepwise exposure, almost no

Abstract = {{Ultrasonography is considered the most appropriate initial imaging study
   in the evaluation of acute appendicitis in children but has recently
   come under criticism with reports of low specificity and high
   indeterminate study rates, particularly when used in obese patients and
   patients early in the course of their disease, or when performed by
   sonographers with limited experience.
   To (1) assess the impact of patient factors (gender, age, body mass
   index, and symptom duration) and system factors (call status or year of
   exam) on pediatric appendiceal US accuracy and indeterminate study rate,
   (2) assess the impact of indeterminate study results on follow-up CT and
   negative laparotomy rates and (3) present strategies to reduce the rate
   of indeterminate US studies and improve accuracy.
   We retrospectively reviewed all US reports performed for the assessment
   of acute appendicitis in children < 18 years old at Mayo Clinic
   Rochester from January 2010 to June 2014.
   A total of 790 US examinations were performed in 452 girls (57\%) and
   338 boys (43\%). The prevalence of appendicitis was 18.5\% (146/790).
   There were 109 true-positive, 440 true-negative, 17 false-positive, 6
   false-negative, 218 equivocal and 41 technically inadequate US studies.
   A definitive interpretation was made in 72\% of the studies, with an
   accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 0.960, 0.948 and 0.963,
   respectively. No patient or system factors significantly affected US
   accuracy. Indeterminate studies (28\%) had significantly higher CT
   utilization (46\% vs. 11\%) and normal appendectomy rates (6.9\% vs.
   3.5\%).
   US should be the initial imaging study of choice for pediatric
   appendicitis. When a definitive interpretation was given, the accuracy
   was 96\%, was independent of patient and system factors and resulted in
   reduced follow-up CTs and negative laparotomies. Accuracy can be
   increased by requiring the presence of periappendiceal inflammatory
   changes prior to interpreting a mildly distended appendix as positive
   for acute appendicitis. The indeterminate study rate can be reduced by
   not requiring visualization of the normal appendix for the exclusion of
   acute appendicitis.}},

Abstract = {{The value of internship as a form of experiential learning in library
   and information science education has been debated for many years in

   Participants include national libraries, associations, and academic
   library and information science programs from 69 different countries
   around the world. Results indicate that outside of American Library
   Association accredited institutions, internship is more often required
   and that when it is not, participation rates are low. Further, there was
   much stronger support for international experiences. Despite the
   increasing use of online tools to deliver library and information
   science education, there is a decided lack of institutional support for
   virtual internships. Suggestions for further research are proposed that
   address the interdisciplinary, intentional, interconnected, and

Title = {{Friction in macroscopic thermodynamics: A kinetic point of view}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{363}},
Pages = {{457-475}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To provide a solid support to a macroscopic framework developed to
   explicitly account for friction in thermodynamics, a kinetic description
   of frictional dissipation is developed. Using either a dissipative
   Fokker-Planck equation for Brownian motion or a Boltzmann equation with
   a friction-force term added, it is shown that both approaches lead to
   the emergence of the macroscopic thermodynamic relations that state the
   first and second laws with friction. The analysis is directly applied to
   the problem of determining the minimum amount of heating generated by
   memory erasure, known in computer science as Landauer's bound, and leads
   to a better understanding of the energetics behind the latter. A
   generalisation of Boltzmann's H theorem to include friction explicitly
   is also recovered, and the thermodynamics of granular rotators acted by
   a frictional torque and of radio-frequency (RF) current drive of fusion
   plasmas, in which collisional drag is present, are addressed as well.
   Various physics results are revisited employing the first and second
   laws with friction that have been derived from the appropriate
   dissipative kinetic equations, lower bounds for entropy production rates
   being derived both for granular rotators and for RF current drive. (C)

Abstract = {{Major corporations may as part of their communication strategy present a
   number of core values in the form of abstract property nouns, for
   example, integrity. Such nouns are rich in meaning, which gives rise to
   a corporate discourse associated with their interpretation.
   Multinational companies tend to use English as a lingua franca (ELF) to
   formulate these values in order to reach a global workforce, which in
   some cases may lead to a need for explicitation as a translation
   strategy to capture any cultural differences. To our knowledge, there is
   little prior in-depth research on corporate values, taking into account
   the linguistic material used, nor research into the linguistic
   expressions designating these as instances of discourse in their own
   right. The same applies to research into the implications of conveying
   these expressions by using ELF. On this background, we discuss corporate
   values from a linguistic perspective, adopting a semantic-pragmatic
   approach, including cultural factors and the implications of using ELF
   to convey their meaning. To illustrate our approach, we will present a
   case study of a Norwegian MNC with subsidiaries in 12 different

Abstract = {{Safety and security applications benefit from better situational
   awareness. Radar micro-Doppler signatures from an observed target carry
   information about the target's activity, and have potential to improve
   situational awareness. This article describes, compares, and discusses
   two methods to classify human activity based on radar micro-Doppler
   data. The first method extracts physically interpretable features from
   the time-velocity domain such as the main cycle time and properties of
   the envelope of the micro-Doppler spectra and use these in the
   classification. The second method derives its features based on the
   components with the most energy in the cadence-velocity domain (obtained
   as the Fourier transform of the time-velocity domain). Measurements from
   a field trial show that the two methods have similar activity
   classification performance. It is suggested that target base velocity
   and main limb cadence frequency are indirect features of both methods,
   and that they do often alone suffice to discriminate between the studied
   activities. This is corroborated by experiments with a reduced feature
   set. This opens up for designing new more compact feature sets.
   Moreover, weaknesses of the methods and the impact of non-radial motion
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{With a dataset from all 20 Finnish regions spanning a time period from
   1950 to 2010, this article analyses how the market share mobility index
   in newspaper circulation and ownership has developed over time and
   whether entry and exit have played any significant role therein. It
   compares the results obtained at the ownership level with those of the
   newspaper level and infers whether the market share mobility index
   complements or substitutes the conventional concentration measures. The
   results show that entry and exit of newspapers have not contributed
   significantly to the market share mobility index and that analysis of
   ownership and newspaper circulation yields remarkably different results.
   Our conjecture that market share mobility would peak in the decade of a
   severe economic downturn was not indisputably upheld. The results
   indicate that traditional concentration measures and compound market
   indices should rather be seen as allies than rivals.}},

Abstract = {{The Antillean Cenozoic fossil record of asteroids comprises mainly
   dissociated ossicles. Most common among isolates from upper Oligocene
   deposits of Jamaica and Antigua are marginal ossicles of an extinct,
   indeterminate species of Pycinaster. This is the youngest known
   occurrence of the genus and the first from beyond Europe. A number of
   relatively complete fossils have been assigned to Pycinaster and (sub)
   familial status proposed for it together with Phocidaster. The latter
   proposition is based solely on a few marginals, but available diagnoses
   are judged insufficient to justify such recognition. The taxon
   Pycinasteridae is here synonymized with the Goniasteridae, although
   future study of added features (such as the ventral surface) might
   justify recognition at a higher taxonomic level. In addition to ossicles
   assigned to Pycinaster, many marginals are tentatively assigned to the
   surviving goniasterid Nymphaster. Numerous generic and many species
   names have been based on asteroid isolates, but the practice demands
   assumptions that are not readily justified. Linkage of discrete isolates
   under a single taxon name assumes derivation from a single source, an
   inference that can be verified only rarely (if ever), therefore reducing
   names to the single holotype ossicle. Availability of only isolates
   encourages comparison with extant taxa and biogeography, biasing
   interpretations with a Holocene overlay. Because of these constraints, a
   new nominal species of Pycinaster is not justified and assignment of
   ossicles to Nymphaster is tentative. However, given the importance of
   asteroids in marine communities, we emphasize the significance, largely
   ignored, of their presence in Cenozoic deposits of the wider Caribbean.}},

Abstract = {{Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a fatal disease where monoclonal
   immunoglobulin light chains deposit as insoluble amyloid fibrils. For
   many years it has been considered that AL amyloid deposits are formed
   primarily by the variable domain, while its constant domain has been
   considered not to be amyloidogenic. However recent studies identify full
   length (FL) light chains as part of the amyloid deposits. In this
   report, we compare the stabilities and amyloidogenic properties of two
   light chains, an amyloid-associated protein AL-09 FL, and its germline
   protein kappa I O18/O8 FL (IGKV 1-33). We demonstrate that the thermal
   unfolding for both proteins is irreversible and scan rate dependent,
   with similar stability parameters compared to their V-L counterparts. In
   addition, the constant domain seems to modulate their amyloidogenic
   properties and affect the morphology of the amyloid fibrils. These
   results allow us to understand the role of the kappa constant domain in
   AL amyloidosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{F-18-FLT PET/CT in the Evaluation of Pheochromocytomas and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE}},

Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{F-18-FDG PET/CT has been proven to be a highly sensitive method for
   pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas (PHEOs/PGLs) associated with succinate
   dehydrogenase (SDH) mutations. This finding has been attributed to
   altered tumor cell metabolism resulting from these mutations and does
   not provide additional prognostic information to genotype. Therefore,
   identification of new biomarkers for aggressiveness is needed. A high
   Ki-67 index was proposed to be an additional prognostic factor. This
   pilot study aimed to evaluate 3'-deoxy-3'-F-18-fluorothymidine
   (F-18-FLT) PET/CT, a PET proliferation tracer, as a potential imaging
   agent in a series of 12 PHEO/PGL patients with different genetic
   backgrounds, to compare F-18-FLT uptake with F-18-FDG PET/CT, and to
   evaluate classic factors of aggressiveness. Methods: Twelve patients (7
   metastatic and 5 nonmetastatic) were prospectively evaluated with
   F-18-FDG and F-18-FLT and followed for at least 2 y after the initial
   imaging work-up. Uptake was assessed at a lesion level, visually and
   quantitatively by maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) for both
   tracers. F-18-FLT uptake was compared with risk factors known to be
   linked with a poor prognosis in PGLs (SDHB-mutated status, lesion size,
   dopaminergic phenotype) and with F-18-FDG uptake. Results: In 12
   patients, 77 lesions were assessed. All lesions had low F-18-FLT uptake
   (median SUVmax, 2.25; range, 0.7-4.5). There was no apparent superiority
   of F-18-FLT uptake in progressive lesions, and most of the lesions
   showed a mismatch, with high F-18-FDG uptake (median SUVmax, 10.8;
   range, 1.1-79.0) contrasting with low F-18-FLT uptake. Conclusion: This
   study suggests that PHEOs/PGLs-even those that progress-do not exhibit
   intense F-18-FLT uptake. It provides the first in vivo demonstration
   that proliferation may not be a major determinant of F-18-FDG uptake in
   these tumors. These findings provide new insight into the biologic
   behavior of PGL and suggest that antiproliferative agents may be
   suboptimal for treatment of these tumors.}},

   network increases and show that, under certain assumptions, the
   algorithm has polynomial-expected termination time. Our methodology
   includes procedures that are of interest beyond steady-state simulation

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{785}},
Pages = {{219-247}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The internal structure of vortex rings and helical vortices is studied
   using asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations in cases where the
   core size of the vortex is small compared to its radius of curvature, or
   to the distance to other vortices. Several configurations are
   considered: a single vortex ring, an array of equally-spaced rings, a
   single helix and a regular array of helices. For such cases, the
   internal structure is assumed to be at leading order an axisymmetric
   concentrated vortex with an internal jet. A dipolar correction arises at
   first order and is shown to be the same for all cases, depending only on
   the local vortex curvature. A quadrupolar correction arises at second
   order. It is composed of two contributions, one associated with local
   curvature and another one arising from a non-local external 2-D strain
   field. This strain field itself is obtained by performing an asymptotic
   matching of the local internal solution with the external solution
   obtained from the Biot-Savart law. Only the amplitude of this strain
   field varies from one case to another. These asymptotic results are
   thereafter confronted with flow solutions obtained by direct numerical
   simulation (DNS) of the Navier-Stokes equations. Two different codes are
   used: for vortex rings, the simulations are performed in the
   axisymmetric framework; for helices, simulations are run using a
   dedicated code with built-in helical symmetry. Quantitative agreement is
   obtained. How these results can be used to theoretically predict the
   occurrence of both the elliptic instability and the curvature
   instability is finally addressed.}},

   counts, as opposed to the phase hologram-based mode conversion
   technique. The aperture-sampling approach is also found to be robust to
   small input fiber alignment errors and fiber geometrical distortions.}},

Abstract = {{Atherosclerosis development is associated with morphological changes to
   intimal cells, leading to a stellate cell phenotype. In this study, we
   aimed to determine whether and how key pro-atherogenic cytokines present
   in atherosclerotic plaques (IL-1 beta, TNF alpha and IFN gamma) could
   induce this phenotype, as these molecules are known to trigger the
   transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We found
   that, IL-1 beta was the only major inflammatory mediator tested capable
   of inducing a stellate morphology in VSMCs. This finding was confirmed
   by staining for F-actin and vinculin at focal adhesions, as these two
   markers were disrupted only by IL-1 beta. We then investigated the
   possible association of this IL-1 beta-dependent change in morphology
   with an increase in intracellular CAMP concentration ({[}cAMP]), using
   the FRET-based biosensor for CAMP (T)Epac(VV). Experiments in the
   presence of IL-1 beta or medium conditioned by IL-1 beta-treated VSMCs
   and pharmacological tools demonstrated that the long-term increase in
   intracellular cAMP concentration was induced by the secretion of an
   autocrine/paracrine mediator, prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)), acting through
   the EP4 receptor. Finally, by knocking down the expression of the
   regulatory subunit PKAR1 alpha, thereby reproducing the effects of IL-1
   beta and PGE(2) on VSMCs, we demonstrated the contribution of PICA
   activity to the observed behavior of VSMCs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We would like to share our experience of reducing pediatric radiation
   exposure. Much of the recent literature regarding successes of reducing
   radiation exposure has come from dedicated children's hospitals.
   Nonetheless, over the past two decades, there has been a considerable
   increase in CT imaging of children in the USA, predominantly in
   nonpediatric-focused facilities where the majority of children are
   treated. In our institution, two general hospitals with limited
   pediatric services, a dedicated initiative intended to reduce children's
   exposure to CT radiation was started by pediatric radiologists in 2005.
   The initiative addressed multiple issues including eliminating
   multiphase studies, decreasing inappropriate scans, educating referring
   providers, training residents and technologists, replacing CT with
   ultrasound or MRI, and ensuring availability of pediatric radiologists
   for consultation. During the study period, the total number of CT scans
   decreased by 24 \%. When accounting for the number of scans per visit to
   the emergency department (ED), the numbers of abdominal and head CT
   scans decreased by 37.2 and 35.2 \%, respectively. For abdominal scans,
   the average number of phases per scan decreased from 1.70 to 1.04. Upon
   surveying the pediatric ED staff, it was revealed that the most
   influential factors on ordering of scans were daily communication with
   pediatric radiologists, followed by journal articles and lectures by
   pediatric radiologists. We concluded that a non-pediatricfocused
   facility can achieve dramatic reduction in CT radiation exposure to
   children; however, this is most effectively achieved through a
   dedicated, multidisciplinary process led by pediatric radiologists.}},

Journal = {{BIOELECTROCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{B}},
Pages = {{276-289}},

Abstract = {{The present study examines the efficacy of a high strength pulsed
   magnetic field (PMF) towards bacterial inactivation in vitro, without
   compromising eukaryotic cell viability. The differential response of
   prokaryotes {[}Staphylococcus aureus (MESA), Staphylococcus epidermidis,
   and Escherichia coli], and eukaryotes {[}C2C12 mouse myoblasts and human
   mesenchymal stem cells, hMSCs] upon exposure to varying PMF stimuli (1-4
   T, 30 pulses, 40 ms pulse duration) is investigated.
   Among the prokaryotes, similar to 60\% and similar to 70\% reduction was
   recorded in the survival of staphylococcal species and E. coli,
   respectively at 4 T PMF as evaluated by colony forming unit (CPU)
   analysis and flow cytometry. A 2-5 fold increase in intracellular ROS
   (reactive oxygen species) levels suggests oxidative stress as the key
   mediator in PMF induced bacterial death/injury. The 4 T PMF treated
   staphylococci also exhibited longer doubling times. Both TEM and
   fluorescence microscopy revealed compromised membranes of PMF exposed
   bacteria. Under similar PMF exposure conditions, no immediate
   cytotoxicity was recorded in C2C12 mouse myoblasts and hMSCs, which can
   be attributed to the robust resistance towards oxidative stress. The ion
   interference of iron containing bacterial proteins is invoked to
   analytically explain the PMF induced ROS accumulation in prokaryotes.
   Overall, this study establishes the potential of PMF as a bactericidal
   method without affecting eukaryotic viability. This non-invasive
   stimulation protocol coupled with antimicrobial agents can be integrated
   as a potential methodology for the localized treatment of prosthetic
   infections. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Amyloid-beta (A beta) oligomers have emerged as the most toxic species
   in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other amyloid pathologies. Also, A
   beta-42 peptide is more aggregation-prone compared to other A beta
   isoforms. Thus, we synthesized a small peptide of repeated sequence
   containing the last three amino acids, Val-40, Ile-41, and Ala-42 of A
   beta-42 that was subsequently aggregated and used to generate a novel
   antibody, VIA. In this study, we examined human AD and Tg2576 mouse
   brain samples using VIA in combination with other amyloid-specific
   antibodies and confirmed the specificity of VIA to oligomeric A beta-42.
   Moreover, we found that VIA does not recognize classic amyloid plaques
   composed of fibrillar A beta or A beta-40 ex vivo. Since VIA recognizes
   a distinct epitope specific to A beta-42 oligomers, it may have broad
   use for examining the accumulation of these oligomers in AD and other
   neurodegenerative diseases. VIA may also be used in immunotherapy
   studies to prevent neurodegenerative effects associated with A beta-42
   oligomers.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Loss of response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
   drugs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is likely due to low
   drug serum levels, and dosing anti-TNF drug concentrations may improve
   patients' outcome. However, there are limited data on the diagnostic
   accuracy and utility of currently available assays for measuring
   anti-TNF levels. In this study, our aim was to compare serum adalimumab
   concentrations with two different techniques.
   Methods: We assessed serum adalimumab concentrations in 23 patients with
   Crohn's disease during a 96-week follow-up period. Adalimumab trough
   levels were assessed using a sandwich principle-based enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a homogeneous mobility shift assay
   (HMSA).
   Results: At week 48, adalimumab trough levels were significantly lower
   in patients who experienced relapse compared to patients in remission,
   using both ELISA and HMSA methods: 4.8 mcg/mL (2.4-7.2 mcg/mL) vs. 7.5
   mcg/mL (6.6-8.4 mcg/mL) (P=0.01) and 6.5 mcg/mL (3-10 mcg/mL) vs. 11.6
   mcg/mL (7-16.2 mcg/ml) (P=0.004), respectively. Similar results were
   obtained at week 96: 5.9 mcg/mL (3.3-8.5 mcg/mL) vs. 12.8 mcg/mL
   (9.4-16.2 mcg/mL) (P=0.001) and 4.1 mcg/mL (1.6-6.6 mcg/mL) vs. 7.5
   mcg/mL (5.7-9.3 mcg/mL) (P=0.009), respectively. There was a significant
   correlation between ELISA and HMSA adalimumab trough levels at both 48
   (r = 0.691, P=0.0003) and 96 week (r = 0.822, P=0.0001).
   Conclusions: ELISA and HMSA assays are accurate methods to assess
   adalimumab trough levels in patients with Crohn's disease and those who
   experience loss of response. The preferential use of one of the two
   techniques should be based on local availability and physicians'
   experience.}},

Abstract = {{Background. After the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for human
   immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Africa, increasing numbers of
   patients have pretreatment drug resistance.
   Methods. In a large multicountry cohort of patients starting standard
   first-line ART in six African countries, pol genotyping was
   retrospectively performed if viral load (VL) >= 1000 cps/mL.
   Pretreatment drug resistance was defined as a decreased susceptibility
   to >= 1 prescribed drug. We assessed the effect of pretreatment drug
   resistance on all-cause mortality, new AIDS events and switch to
   second-line ART due to presumed treatment failure, using Cox models.
   Results. Among 2579 participants for whom a pretreatment genotype was
   available, 5.5\% had pretreatment drug resistance. Pretreatment drug
   resistance was associated with an increased risk of regimen switch
   (adjusted hazard ratio {[}aHR] 3.80; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   1.49-9.68; P = .005) but was not associated with mortality (aHR 0.75,
   95\% CI, .24-2.35; P = .617) or new AIDS events (aHR 1.06, 95\% CI,
   .68-1.64; P = .807). During three years of follow up, 106 (4.1\%)
   participants switched to second-line, of whom 18 (17.0\%) switched with
   VL < 1000 cps/mL, 7 (6.6\%) with VL >= 1000 cps/mL and no drug
   resistance mutations (DRMs), 46 (43.4\%) with VL >= 1000 cps/mL and >= 1
   DRMs; no HIV RNA data was available for 32 (30.2\%) participants.
   Conclusions. Given rising pretreatment HIV drug resistance levels in
   sub-Saharan Africa, these findings underscore the need for expanded
   access to second-line ART. VL monitoring can improve the accuracy of
   failure detection and efficiency of switching practices.}},

Abstract = {{1-Aminobenzotriazole (ABT) is regularly used in vivo as a nonspecific
   and irreversible cytochrome P450 inhibitor to elucidate the role of
   metabolism on the pharmacokinetic profile of xenobiotics. However, few
   reports have considered the recent findings that ABT can alter drug
   absorption or have investigated the possible differential inhibition of
   ABT on intestinal and hepatic metabolism. To address these
   uncertainties, pharmacokinetic studies under well controlled and defined
   ABT pretreatment conditions (50 mg/kg, 1 hour ABT i.v. and 16 hours ABT
   p.o.) were conducted prior to the oral administration of metoprolol, a
   permeable P450 probe that undergoes extensive intestinal and hepatic
   metabolism. The pharmacokinetic profile of metoprolol was affected
   differently by the two ABT pretreatments. An increase in area under the
   curve of 16-fold with ABT p.o. and 6.5-fold with ABT i.v. was observed
   compared with control. Based on in vitro studies, this difference could
   not be attributed to a differential inhibition of intestinal and hepatic
   metabolism. In the ABT i.v. pretreatment group, the increase in area
   under the curve was also associated with a prolonged time at maximal
   concentration (24-fold versus control), suggesting a delay in
   absorption. This was further confirmed by the administration of a
   charcoal meal, which resulted in a 7-fold increase in stomach weights in
   the 1-hour ABT pretreated groups compared with the untreated or 16-hour
   ABT pretreated rats. Based on these results, we recommend pretreating
   rats with ABT p.o. 16 hours before the administration of a test compound
   to preserve the inhibitory effect on intestinal and hepatic metabolism
   and avoid the confounding effect on drug absorption.}},

Abstract = {{The radiolytic decomposition of the drug diclofenac (DCF), and in
   limited extent, also two other widely used drugs, ibuprofen and
   carbamazepine, was examined using liquid chromatography (LC) methods.
   The efficiency of DCF decomposition was examined in function of the
   absorbed dose of gamma radiation, and also in the presence of selected
   scavengers of radicals, which are commonly present in natural waters and
   wastes. Three different tests were employed for the monitoring of
   toxicity changes in the irradiated DCF solutions. The LC/mass
   spectrometry (MS) was used for the determination of products of DCF
   radiolysis. Using pulse-radiolysis method with the spectrophotometric
   detection, the rate constant values were determined for reactions of DCF
   with the main products of water radiolysis: hydroxyl radicals (1.24 +/-
   0.02) x 10(10) M-1 s(-1) and hydrated electrons (3.1 +/- 0.2) x 10(9)
   M-1 s(-1). Their values indicate that both oxidative and reductive
   processes in radiolytic decomposition of DCF can take place in
   irradiated diluted aqueous solutions of DCF. The possibility of
   decomposition of all examined analytes was investigated in samples of
   river water and hospital waste. Compared to the previous studies, the
   conducted measurements in real samples were carried out at the
   concentration levels, which are close to those reported earlier in
   environmental samples.}},

Abstract = {{Animal studies have shown that Listeria monocytogenes can probably
   access the brain through a peripheral intraneural route, and it has been
   suggested that a similar process may occur in humans. However, thus far,
   its spreading through the central nervous system (CNS) has not been
   completely elucidated. The authors present a case of multiple L.
   monocytogenes cerebral abscesses characterized by a pattern of
   distribution that suggested spread along white matter fiber tracts and
   reviewed the literature to identify other cases for analysis. They
   elected to include only those cases with 3 or more cerebral abscesses to
   make sure that the distribution was not random, but rather followed a
   pattern. In addition, they included those cases with abscesses in both
   the brainstem and the cerebral hemispheres, but excluded cases in which
   abscesses were located solely in the brainstem.
   Of 77 cases of L. monocyto genes CNS abscesses found in the literature,
   17 involved multiple abscesses. Of those, 6 were excluded for lack of
   imaging and 3 because they involved only the brainstem. Of the 8
   remaining cases from the literature, one was a case of bilateral
   abscesses that did not follow a fiber tract; another was also bilateral,
   but with lesions appearing to follow fiber tracts on one side; and in
   the remaining 6, to which the authors added their own case for a total
   of 7, all the abscesses were located exclusively in the same hemisphere
   and distributed along white matter fiber tracts.
   The findings suggest that after entering the CNS, L. monocyto genes
   travels within the axons, resulting in a characteristic pattern of
   distribution of multiple abscesses along the white matter fiber tracts
   in the brain. This report is the first description suggesting
   intraaxonal CNS spread of L. monocytogenes infection in humans following
   its entry into the brain. This distinct pattern is clearly seen on
   imaging and its recognition may be valuable in the di'agnosis of
   listeriosis. This finding may allow for earlier diagnosis, which may
   improve outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Acute appendicitis represents the commonest cause of acute
   intra-abdominal pathology. Appendectomy and antibiotics are the mainstay
   of therapy for appendicitis. Evidence is emerging that antibiotics alone
   may adequately treat most cases of appendicitis. Decision analysis is a
   quantitative method of examining alternate treatment strategies. This
   study describes a modelled decision analysis comparing operative and
   conservative management of appendicitis.
   The base case patient is a healthy, 23-year-old male presenting with
   migratory pain to the right iliac fossa (RIF) and elevated inflammatory
   markers. A decision tree was constructed comparing operative and
   conservative treatment. Rates of complications, failure of conservative
   therapy, recurrence and utilities were calculated via a systematic
   literature review. Variables were tested for sensitivity.
   Overall, conservative management gives a significantly better outcome
   (51.51 vs 49.87 QALYs). Three variables proved sensitive. Once operative
   complication rates are lower than 11.5 \%, surgical treatment becomes
   the optimal strategy. If rates of failure of conservative management
   exceed 12.9 \%, surgery becomes optimal. If the utility assigned to a
   post-operative complication exceeds 0.44, surgery becomes optimal.
   This decision analysis supports a conservative strategy, albeit with
   caveats. If operative complications are low or rates of failure of
   conservative management remain high, surgery is the preferable strategy.}},

Title = {{Encapsulated sodium supplementation of 4 weeks does not alter salt taste
   preferences in a controlled low sodium and low potassium diet}},

Pages = {{58-65}},

Abstract = {{Preference for saltiness is learned by oral exposure to salt taste;
   however, some data suggest a role for bodily sodium and potassium levels
   on salt taste preferences as well. The objective was to investigate
   whether encapsulated sodium and potassium supplementation lead to
   altered salt taste responses among adults with high blood pressure on a
   low sodium and low potassium diet. Twenty-six participants with
   untreated upper-range prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension were on a
   fully controlled low sodium and low potassium diet (both targeted at 2
   g/day) for 13 weeks. Participants received capsules with sodium (3 g/d),
   potassium (3 g/d), or placebo, for 4 weeks each, in randomized order in
   a double blind crossover design. Sensory evaluation was done before and
   after each supplementation period and involved ratings of pleasantness
   and intensity in different salt (NaCl) concentrations in food and water,
   desire-to-eat salty food, and detection threshold for NaCI. Neither
   sodium supplementation nor potassium supplementation led to alterations
   in salt taste responses in food and water, and did not affect detection
   threshold (P = 0.59). There was no clear role for sodium or potassium
   supplementation on desire-to-eat salty food. In addition, we did not
   find effects of reduced oral exposure to salt over weeks, through the
   sodium-reduced diet, on salt taste preferences, in contrast to earlier
   studies. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest preference for
   saltiness is independent of changes in bodily sodium or potassium
   levels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background Patients with Streptococcus bovis infective endocarditis have
   an increased prevalence of advanced colonic neoplasia; however, an
   association with fecal carriage of the organism is unclear. S. bovis has
   been shown to promote colonic neoplasia in preclinical studies. The aim
   of this study was to examine the effect of S. bovis fecal carriage on
   the long-term risk of colonic neoplasia.
   Patients and methods Patients were prospectively recruited before
   colonoscopy. S. bovis was detected by culture in stool, colonic fluid
   aspirates, and biopsies. Patients continued colonoscopic surveillance at
   intervals according to accepted guidelines. The National Cancer Registry
   was checked for diagnoses of colorectal cancer on 31 December 2014.
   Results A total of 118 patients were recruited {[}75 (72.8\%) men, aged
   64.59.3 years] including 15 with S. bovis. The mean duration of
   follow-up was 190.7 +/- 123.5 months. Colonic neoplasia was detected at
   colonoscopy in six (40.0\%) and 49 (47\%) patients with and without S.
   bovis, respectively (P=0.78). At the end of follow-up, colorectal cancer
   had developed in one (6.7\%) S. bovis-positive and six (5.8\%) S.
   bovis-negative patients (P=1.00).
   Conclusion Fecal carriage of S. bovis at baseline is not associated with
   an increased long-term risk of developing colonic neoplasia in this
   longitudinal study. Copyright (C) 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All

Title = {{Determination of the dynamic complex modulus of viscoelastit materials
   using a time domain approach}},
Journal = {{POLYMER TESTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{89-96}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Viscoelastic and poroelastic materials are widely used in multilayer
   panels for noise control. They are usually used as an inner decoupling
   layer in double wall systems in order to increase the sound transmission
   loss of a bare plate. In order to correctly simulate the acoustical
   behaviour of such systems, it is necessary to measure the elastic
   parameters of these materials (storage and loss moduli, and Poisson's
   ratio). Physical properties related to pore morphology also need to be
   determined for open cell structures. Most of the materials used in
   trimmed panels can show elastic parameters that vary with frequency,
   thus a quasi-static measurement technique is not accurate enough to
   consider such viscoelasticity effects. This paper focuses on the
   estimation of complex modulus as a function of the frequency of
   isotropic viscoelastic materials. In particular, the tested material is
   positioned between two plates, with one of them being excited by an
   electromagnetic shaker. Using a sine burst as an excitation signal, the
   accelerometric response in the time domain is measured at the top and
   bottom plates. The time of flight between the plates and the envelope
   function of time domain acceleration at the top plate are then found. A
   transfer matrix model of the experimental setup is used to inversely
   estimate the complex modulus of the materials once the remaining
   mechanical and physical properties have been fixed. The results will be
   presented and discussed for different materials and compared with
   wellestablished quasi-static and dynamic techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of dietary Terbutaline, a beta adrenergic agonist, on carcass

   of Terbutaline {[}0 (T-0), 1 (T-1), 3 (T-3), and 5 (T-5) mg/Kg of the
   diet]. Quails were bled at the end of the trial for biochemical assays
   and the carcass characteristics were then measured. The relative weights
   of breast and drumstick muscles were increased in birds treated with 3
   and 5 mg/Kg diet of Terbutaline (P<0.05). Regardless of Terbutaline
   dietary levels included, the weight of subcutaneous and abdominal fat
   pad was significantly decreased in treated birds (P<0.05). The relative
   weight of heart was increased in T-3 treatment group and that of liver
   was increased in all birds receiving Terbutaline as compared with the
   control group (P<0.05). Irrespective of the dosing level, the percentage
   of protein in breast muscle was higher in Terbutaline-treated birds
   (P<0.05). However, the fat percentage in drumstick muscle was reduced in
   birds treated with 3 and 5 mg/Kg diet of Terbutaline, but its protein
   percentage was increased in T-1, T-3, and T-5 (P<0.05). A significant
   increase in plasma levels of free fatty acids was found in all birds
   that received Terbutaline (P<0.01) as compared with the control.
   Overally, the data suggested that dietary Terbutaline had a profound
   positive effect on carcass composition, but a minimal one on the plasma
   metabolites (glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride) of Japanese quails.}},

   albicans). The films were produced by one-step reactive DC magnetron
   sputtering followed by heat-treatment The samples revealed a composition
   of 83 at.\% of Au and a stoichiometric TiO2 matrix. The annealing
   promoted grain size increase of the Au NPs from 3 nm (at 300 degrees C)
   to 7 nm (at 500 degrees C) and a progressive crystallization of the TiO2
   matrix to anatase. A broad localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)
   absorption band (lambda = 580 - 720 nm) was clearly observed in the
   sample annealed at 500 degrees C, being less intense at 300 degrees C.
   The biological tests indicated that the BSA adhesion is dependent on
   surface nanostructure morphology, which in turn depends on the annealing
   temperature that changed the roughness and wettability of the films. The
   Au:TiO2 thin films also induced a significant change of the microbial
   cell membrane integrity, and ultimately the cell viability, which in
   turn affected the adhesion on its surface. The microstructural changes
   (structure, grain size and surface morphology) of the Au:TiO2 films
   promoted by heat-treatment shaped the amount of BSA adhered and affected
   cell viability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Baile Boghis resort in Salaj county is situated in the Barcau
   depression, at 15 km distance from Simleu Silvaniei, in a
   sedative-indifferent climate of hills, at an altitude of 300 m, without
   excessive temperatures, with a mean annual rainfall of 650 mm.
   The first evidence of the climate and thermal mineral waters of the
   resort dates back to the 18th century. The Nusfalau-Boghis thermal
   mineral water reservoir is confined to deep permeable aquiferous layers
   that correspond to the altered zone of crystalline basement and
   sedimentary formations of Miocene and Pliocene age.
   It is an all-season spa and climatic resort; the bicarbonate, sodium,
   sulfur, iodine hypotonic hyperthermal mineral springs (with a total
   mineralization of 1016.2-1432.8 mg/l) come from hydrogeological wells,
   producing over 1900 m3/day waters with a temperature of 40-42 degrees C.
   The spa has 2 outdoor pools (in summer time), bathtubs (in the process
   of being rehabilitated) and an indoor pool.
   The peat mud from Stoboru (Cuzaplac commune) is another therapeutic
   factor used in the resort.
   Therapeutic indications are related to the following disorders:
   osteoarticular system diseases, abarticular and degenerative rheumatic
   diseases, posttraumatic, peripheral neurological, gynecological,
   endocrine, nutrition and metabolic disorders, treated by external use
   (pool or bathtubs), while cooled water is used for crenotherapy.
   A specific feature is that thermal water, which has a temperature of
   40-42 degrees C, can be used without being successively cooled or heated
   in pools or bathtubs, which allows to maintain its initial qualities.
   This paper includes early and recent data on a resort that is
   progressing from a local level to the national circuit, having an
   important extension potential.}},

Abstract = {{Background Utility of questionnaires to estimate the probability of
   obstructive sleep apneas (OSA) is varying, and it is challenging to know
   the performance of STOP (Snore, Tired, Observed apnea, and
   Pressure)-BANG (BMI, Age, Neck and Gender) with simplified methods. To
   assess the performance of STOP-BANG and its ability to predict sleep
   apnea in patients with high pre-test like-hood to present OSA referred
   for a home respiratory polygraphy (RP) were studied.
   A cross-sectional study of patients recruited over 26 months was
   performed. They were asked to complete the STOP-BANG questionnaire
   during evaluation prior to RP and were evaluated according to different
   apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) cut-offs. Areas under receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curves and multiple logistic regression models were
   calculated.
   Eight hundred sixty-nine patients were studied; 557 were male (64.1 \%)
   with a median age of 52.82 +/- 14.43 years, a body mass index (BMI) of
   32.88 +/- 8.51, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of 7.95 +/-
   5.17. The performance for AHI >= 5/h (ROC area) was: STOP 0.62, BANG
   0.66, and STOP-BANG 0.69. The best sensitivity (S)-specificity (Sp)
   relationship for AHI >= 5/h was found with 5 components in any
   combination (S 56.02 \%; Sp 70 \%). For AHI >= 30/h, STOP was 0.68, BANG
   0.66 and STOP-BANG 0.73 and the best S-Sp relationship was obtained with
   5 components (S 68 \%; Sp 63.6 \%). Six variables (snoring, observed
   apneas, high blood pressure (HBP), BMI > 35, neck perimeter > 40 cm, and
   male gender) showed the best performance for AHI > 30/h; ROC area 0.76.
   STOP-BANG shows different discrimination power for AHI > 5 and >= 30/h
   using RP. Five components in any combination have acceptable diagnostic
   S to identify patients with severe OSA. STOP-BANG performed best to
   identify AHI >= 30/h.}},

   dynamic that the changes resulting from scientific and technological
   progress, which we experience, do not allow for the identification of
   goals over longer time intervals. For this reason, forecasting up to
   2035, 2040, 2060 is devoid of its fundamental value, which is the
   reliability of results obtained. Are predictions to be conservative
   (this applies to richer countries) or are they to produce a paradigm
   shift by, for example, strongly imposing the requirement of increasing
   energy security, which is important for our country? In light of the
   broadness of the issues, this paper is limited to considerations
   relating to forecasting the primary energy demand. Detailed examples are

Abstract = {{This article draws on data from various sources for 190 developed and
   developing nations and uses them to examine gender regimes, or forms of
   patriarchal structures, at the regional level. I argue for multiple,
   rather than single, measures of gender inequality and illustrate that
   using many inequality measures exposes a wider range of outcomes within
   the Global South than the North, also suggesting the inefficacy of this
   geographic dichotomy. Then I re-examine the outcomes with nations
   grouped into seven regions, showing that each region has different
   variables that define their gender inequalities. Finally, I link
   gendered social institutions (e.g., laws on violence/physical integrity,
   family codes, civil liberties, and ownership rights) and implicitly
   gendered political-economic structures (e.g., IMF debt, armed conflict,
   ever having been a colony, and electoral democracy) to
   gender-inequitable outcomes in six regions to reveal three different
   gender regimes across the regions.}},

Abstract = {{Risk mitigation plans (RMP) are an innovative and important strategy for
   monitoring the sanitary risks of medication. The scope of the study was
   to identify RMPs for drugs registered with the Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA) and the actions to minimize risks established by
   the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) and the manufacturers
   of these drugs. This is a quantitative and descriptive study including a
   survey together with the pharmaceutical industries and research on sites
   and databases of Anvisa, the FDA and pharmaceutical industries. Forty
   drugs with RMPs filed with the FDA were also registered with Anvisa.
   Only 4 laboratories (10\%) reported RMPs developed in Brazil. Safety
   information for 15 drugs (37.5\%) were located on the Anvisa site. In
   91.4\% of Brazilian user package leaflets there is safety information
   equivalent to actions to promote safe use described in RMPs available on
   the FDA website. The actions of communication on drug safety and
   sanitary risk of drugs needs to be expanded by Anvisa. The RMP is an
   important strategy in public health for managing new risks, monitoring
   known risks and, especially, for promoting the safe use of medication.}},

Abstract = {{The Santa Marta Foliage-gleaner Automolus rufipectus is one of 19
   endemic bird species found in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM) in
   northern Colombia but until recently it was considered a sub-species of
   the Ruddy Foliage-gleaner Automolus rubiginosus. Consequently, published
   information on its distribution and ecology is lacking, and while it is
   classified as near- threatened, this designation was based on limited
   quantitative data. To improve our knowledge of the Santa Marta
   Foliage-gleaner's geographical distribution, elevation range, population
   density, habitat use and conservation status, we analysed both
   historical and recent site locality records and carried out variable
   distance transects within forested habitats and shade coffee
   plantations. We modelled the environmental niche of the species and
   subsequently estimated its extent of occurrence and area of occupancy,
   as well as population size. Our results consistently showed that the
   distribution of the Santa Marta Foliage-gleaner is more restricted than
   previously considered, both geographically and by elevation (we redefine
   elevation range as 600-1,875 m). This suggests that the species is more
   at risk of habitat transformation and combined with our estimates of
   population size (< 10,000 individuals), it is likely that the species
   will be uplisted to a higher threat category. More positively, and
   contrary to published accounts, we found that approximately 40\% of the
   species' range lies within protected areas. Nevertheless, we recommend
   the implementation of strategies to maintain forest cover on the western
   flank of the SNSM and further research to better define the species'
   habitat needs and population dynamics.}},

   assigns to the notion of order in the mathematical sciences, before
   describing the circulation of his writings on the order in the
   nineteenth century. Poinsot is one of the main sources of Cournot, who
   places the notions of order and form as the basis of his knowledge

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine patients' comprehension and application of
   alternative versions of patient medication information handouts for a
   fictitious drug, and whether patient characteristics influence patients'
   ability to understand the handouts.
   Methods: A web-based experiment was conducted in which 1397 adults with
   rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or plaque psoriasis were
   randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) a one-page
   ``Bubbles{''} format; (2) a one-page ``Over-The-Counter{''} (OTC)
   format; and (3) a four-page document modeled after MedGuides used in
   2009 which served as the control arm. Comprehension and application of
   information in the handouts were the key outcomes of interest.
   Results: Participants who viewed either the Bubbles or OTC formats had
   greater comprehension than participants who viewed the MedGuide, but did
   not have better application scores. No significant differences were
   noted between the Bubbles and OTC formats. Patient characteristics did
   not moderate the results.
   Conclusion: Both formats resulted in better comprehension than the
   MedGuide format used in the study.
   Practice implications: Results provide valuable information on how to
   design patient information to improve patients' understanding of the
   risks and benefits of the drugs they are prescribed. Results could be
   extended to inform the content of other types of patient education
   materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting tools in surgical videos is an important ingredient for
   context-aware computer-assisted surgical systems. To this end, we
   present a new surgical tool detection dataset and a method for joint
   tool detection and pose estimation in 2d images. Our two-stage pipeline
   is data-driven and relaxes strong assumptions made by previous works
   regarding the geometry, number, and position of tools in the image. The
   first stage classifies each pixel based on local appearance only, while
   the second stage evaluates a tool-specific shape template to enforce
   global shape. Both local appearance and global shape are learned from
   training data. Our method is validated on a new surgical tool dataset of
   2 476 images from neurosurgical microscopes, which is made freely
   available. It improves over existing datasets in size, diversity and
   detail of annotation. We show that our method significantly improves
   over competitive baselines from the computer vision field. We achieve
   15\% detection miss-rate at false positives per image (for the suction
   tube) over our surgical tool dataset. Results indicate that performing
   semantic labelling as an intermediate task is key for high quality
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{As part of the process optimization project of CMG (Mining Company of
   Guemassa-Marrakech, Morocco), a preliminary study on the effect of water
   quality on the flotation of galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and
   pyrrhotite was carried out using asymmetrical fractional factorial
   design. The multivariable analysis showed that of ten studied factors,
   six (Cu2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, SO42-, and PAX) have a significant
   influence on the flotation of these sulphide minerals. Graphical
   analysis showed that high concentrations of Cu2+ (7-14 mg/L) in
   synthetic process water increased the recovery of galena, chalcopyrite,
   sphalerite, and pyrrhotite. At low Cu2+ concentrations (0-7 mg/L),
   sphalerite was depressed. Zn2+ at low concentrations (0-20 mg/L)
   decreased the recovery of all studied minerals. However, at high
   concentrations (20-40 mg/L), an increase in chalcopyrite, sphalerite,
   and pyrrhotite recoveries was observed. Mg2+ (100-200 mg/L) decreased
   the recovery of galena, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite. Ca2+ (1200-2000 mg
   /L) depressed sphalerite flotation. Sulphate ions (SO42-) enhanced
   recovery of all the studied minerals. Potassium amyl xanthate (PAX)
   promoted sphalerite recovery at high concentrations (10-20 mg/L).}},

Abstract = {{Background: Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a parasitic disease
   resulting from the intrahepatic growth of Echinococcus multilocularis
   larva. This zoonotic helminthic disease is rare but, if left untreated
   or treated too late, can be severe or even fatal. In France, endemic
   areas containing infected foxes have become larger, spreading towards
   western regions of the country and leading to an increased risk of
   environmental contamination. An observational survey was undertaken in
   2014 to assess the level of knowledge of AE among primary care
   physicians (PCPs) and pharmacists in the Franche-Comte region. Methods:
   Standardized questionnaires were sent to a random sample of 183 PCPs and
   236 pharmacists practicing in the Franche-Comte region (eastern France),
   requesting their voluntary and anonymous participation. The
   questionnaires collected socio-demographic details, self-evaluation and
   asked multiple choice questions (MCQs) about epidemiology, prevention,
   diagnosis and management of AE. Results: The crude response rate was
   37.5\% of the PCPs and pharmacists questioned. Responses to MCQs showed
   that most of the participating PCPs and pharmacists had acceptable basic
   knowledge of AE, especially concerning epidemiology and prevention of
   the disease. However, a serious lack of knowledge was observed
   concerning the management of AE. Conclusion: PCPs are often the first
   health professionals to suspect latent AE, which is still a rural
   disease in France. Both PCPs and pharmacists play an important role in
   informing and referring patients potentially exposed to AE. This study
   shows that although AE is rare, PCPs and pharmacists of the
   Franche-Comte region have a satisfactory level of knowledge of AE.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{530-547}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article traces the contours of an inconspicuous kind of state power
   in the form of sovereign safety. This power is articulated, more
   precisely, in a combination of four elements: the historical term of
   public credit, the liquid government bond, the risk-free asset of
   financial textbooks and the safe-haven function assumed by the bond
   market in times of uncertainty. All of these involve a peculiar
   translation from sovereign debt as the most risky asset to sovereign
   creditworthiness, circulating unsecured. If critical security studies
   has largely limited itself to a critique of the relatively recent sense
   of political state security, this article explores the relevance of a
   far older financial sense of security' and securitization' for
   contemporary studies of security. So far, the Foucault-inspired
   finance-security literature has emphasized the risk calculus as a
   principal mechanism in securing circulation'. This article argues that
   sovereign safety constitutes an important overlooked factor in securing
   circulation in two ways: As the main form of collateral for financial
   transactions, its capacity to secure derives from being considered
   secure itself. As an epistemic variable, it constitutes the bedrock of
   modern finance theory. Moreover, rather than neatly complementary to the
   liberal security dispositif, sovereign safety can to some extent be said
   to represent the very object of the Foucaultian divesture of power.}},

Abstract = {{THIS STUDY EXPLORED HOW educators implement policies that support

   in five Australian early childhood (EC) centres. In early childhood

   that is highly processed and packaged. Interview data from children,
   parents and educators from five EC centres where parents provide
   children's food was analysed. The key findings demonstrate that the
   differing perspectives by the educators, parents and children produced
   challenges for enactment of healthy food choices and sustainable
   practices, even though EC centres sought advice from government
   agencies. Parents' food decisions were often misaligned with centre
   policies and children were frequently caught between the EC centre's
   policies and parents' choices of food. Educators felt ineffective
   influencing parents' food choices and sustainable practices regarding
   waste minimisation. A holistic educational approach is required where
   all stakeholders have social responsibility towards this approach.}},

   Cooperative Congressional Election Study, we examine the Tea Party
   movement's role in crystallizing attitudes and shaping voting behavior

   Republicans, Tea Party sympathizers were notably more hostile to Obama,
   more receptive to bogus notions about his origins and religion, and more
   conservative across a broad range of issues and issue dimensions
   including those related to racial and ethnic minorities. Voters'
   opinions of the Tea Party were linked to their presidential vote choice
   directly as well as through their association with the core values,
   opinions, and attitudes that underlie opinions of the Tea Party. Tea
   Party sympathizers form the Republican coalition's largest, most loyal,

Abstract = {{Background: Breast milk volume has never been evaluated when the
   etonogestrel (ENG) implant was inserted immediately postpartum. Thus,
   this study evaluated if the immediate postpartum insertion of the ENG
   implant alters breast milk volume.
   Study design: Twenty-four postpartum women and their newborns (NBs) were
   randomized into two groups: Implant group (ENG implant inserted within
   48 h after delivery) and Control group (absence of contraceptive
   method). The primary outcome was the amount of breast milk intake by the
   NBs in the first 6 weeks after delivery. Five and ten grams of deuterium
   (D2O) were orally administered to the postpartum women on the day of
   randomization (day 0) and on the 29th study day, respectively. Saliva
   samples were collected from the mother NB pairs prior to each D2O dose
   administration and after D2O ingestion (periodic collection). The amount
   of breast milk ingested by the NBs was estimated by the amount of
   deuterium (D2O) ingested by the NBs through breastfeeding, using mass
   spectrometry in the saliva samples.
   Results: Twenty-four postpartum women and their NB were randomized (12
   per group). The median of breast milk intake by NBs following the two
   D2O doses were similar between groups \{first D2O dose {[}Implant: 340
   mL/day (240-420 mL/day) vs. Control: 330 mL/day (300-530 mL/day),
   p=.54]; second D2O dose {[}Implant: 845 mL/day (770-980 mL/day) vs.
   Control: 785 mL/day (680-980 mL/day), p=.63]\}. The exclusive
   breastfeeding rate and NB weight were similar between groups in the
   first 6 weeks postpartum.
   Conclusion: ENG implant insertion immediately postpartum does not alter
   the volume of breast milk intake by NBs.
   Implications: Considering the benefits of immediate postpartum
   initiation of ENG implant on reducing unintended pregnancy and pregnancy
   recurrence, especially in vulnerable populations, our study adds safety
   data on breastfeeding effect of this practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Limestone samples were deformed up to 5\% inelastic axial strain at an
   effective confining pressure P-eff = 50 MPa in the cataclastic flow
   regime and subsequently maintained under constant static stress
   conditions (either isostatic of triaxial) for extended periods of time
   while elastic wave speeds and permeability were continuously monitored.
   During deformation, both seismic wave speeds and permeability decrease
   with increasing strain, due to the growth of subvertical microcracks and
   inelastic porosity reduction. During the static hold period under
   water-saturated conditions, the seismic wave speeds recovered gradually,
   typically by around 5\% (relative to their initial value) after 2 days,
   while permeability remained constant. The recovery in wave speed
   increases with increasing confining pressure but decreases with
   increasing applied differential stress. The recovery is markedly lower
   when the samples are saturated with an inert fluid as opposed to water.
   The evolution in wave speed is interpreted quantitatively in terms of
   microcrack density, which shows that the post-deformation recovery is
   associated with a decrease in effective microcrack length, typically of
   the order to 10\% after 2 days. The proposed mechanism for the observed
   damage recovery is microcrack closure due to a combination of
   backsliding on wing cracks driven by time-dependent friction and closure
   due to pressure solution at contacts between propping particles or
   asperities and microcrack walls. The recovery rates observed in the
   experiments, and the proposed underlying mechanisms, are compatible with
   seismological observations of seismic wave speed recovery along faults
   following earthquakes.}},

Abstract = {{Reconstruction of fossil teleost faunas can provide important
   information on palaeoenvironments, palaeogeography and evolution, and
   otoliths are particularly useful for that purpose. Here we present an
   otolith-based fish fauna from the middle Miocene of the Eastern
   Paratethys, i.e. the Karagaily section of the Mangyshlak Peninsula in
   Western Kazakhstan, and report on the accompanying nannoplankton,
   foraminifera, molluscs and ostracods. A total of 30 teleost species are
   described and figured, including ten new species: Alosa paulicrenata
   n.sp., Morone? bannikovi n.sp., Centracanthus pobedinae n.sp.,
   Genyonemus? karagiensis n.sp., Trewasciaena suzini n.sp., Parablennius
   prokofievi n.sp., Aphia djafarovae n.sp., Neogobius udovichenkoi n.sp.,
   Ponticola zosimovichi n.sp., Pomatoschistus bunyatovi n.sp.
   Nannoplankton and gastropods indicate a Konkian (late Badenian, early
   Serravallian) age for this fish assemblage. The dominance of Gadidae and
   Gobiidae, together with the composition of the nannoplankton, indicates
   an inner-neritic to coastal environment with high productivity. The
   Konkian fish fauna of the Eastern Paratethys shows a high degree of
   autonomy relative to approximately contemporaneous fish faunas from the
   Central Paratethys and other European basins. This confirms that the
   Konkian was a time of limited faunal exchange between the Central and
   Eastern Paratethys, while a marine connection may have persisted between
   the Central Paratethys and the northern Mediterranean. We conclude that
   the fish fauna reported here records an early endemic development in the
   Eastern Paratethys during the middle Miocene (Konkian). The
   disappearance of Bregmacerotidae and Gonostomatidae (Bonapartia) during
   the preceding stage of the Karaganian and the first appearance of
   Palimphemus minusculoides in the Konkian are important
   biostratigraphical markers.}},

Abstract = {{Murine contact hypersensitivity (CHS) is a dendritic cell (DC)-dependent
   T-cell-mediated inflammation with CD8(+) T cells as effectors and CD4(+)
   T cells as regulators (Treg cells) that models human allergic contact
   dermatitis. The integrin alpha(E)(CD103) is expressed by some T-cell and
   DC subsets and has been implicated in epithelial lymphocyte
   localization, but its role in immune regulation remains enigmatic. We
   have identified a function for CD103 in the development of cutaneous
   allergic immune responses. CHS responses, but not irritant contact
   dermatitis, were significantly augmented in CD103-deficient mice in
   hapten-challenged skin. Phenotype and function of skin DCs during
   sensitization were normal, whereas adoptive transfer experiments
   revealed that the elevated CHS response in CD103-deficient mice is
   transferred by primed T cells and is independent of resident cells in
   recipient mice. While T-cell counts were elevated in challenged skin of
   CD103-deficient mice, the FoxP3 expression level of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg
   cells was significantly reduced, indicating impaired functionality.
   Indeed, Treg cells from CD103-deficient mice were not able to suppress
   CHS reactions during the elicitation phase. Further, CD103 on FoxP3(+)
   Treg cells was involved in Treg retention to inflamed skin. These
   findings indicate an unexpected dichotomous functional role for CD103 on
   Treg cells by modulating FoxP3 expression.}},

Abstract = {{Whole-pelvis radiotherapy or a short-course (approximately 4 months) of
   androgen deprivation therapy yield an all-cause mortality benefit among
   patients with unfavorable-risk prostate cancer. However, the combination
   of these 2 treatments does not further improve mortality outcomes,
   suggesting a shared therapeutic mechanism.
   Background: The purpose of the study was to determine whether the extent
   of prostate radiotherapy (ie, whole-pelvic radiotherapy {[}WPRT] vs.
   prostate and seminal vesicle radiotherapy {[}PSVRT]) is associated with
   all-cause mortality (ACM) in men treated with or without androgen
   deprivation therapy (ADT). Patients and Methods: A multiple-institution
   cohort of 3709 prostate cancer patients was prospectively assembled from
   1991 to 2006. The median age was 72 years and all patients had
   T1c-T3N0M0 adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Patients were treated with
   WPRT or PSVRT followed by a brachytherapy boost, with or without
   neoadjuvant ADT (median duration, 4.2 months). Seventy percent of
   patients had unfavorable-risk disease (Gleason score >= 7;
   prostate-specific antigen >= 10 ng/mL; or stage >= T2b). Cox regression
   was applied to determine whether the radiation treatment volume affected
   the risk of ACM. The interaction between radiation volume and ADT use
   was assessed. Results: After a median follow-up of 3.3 years, 561 deaths
   were observed. A decreased risk of ACM was noted with the use of WPRT
   versus PSVRT (adjusted hazard ratio {[}AHR], 0.58; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI], 0.38-0.89; P = .01), or with ADT use (AHR, 0.71; 95\%
   CI, 0.58-0.90; P = .004). However, a combination of WPRT and ADT did not
   further improve ACM compared with either WPRT alone or PSVRT with ADT.
   Moreover, there was a significant interaction between the
   radiotherapeutic treatment volume and ADT (AHR, 1.61; 95\% CI,
   1.004-2.58; P = .048). Conclusion: Treatment with WPRT or short-course
   ADT is associated with a decreased risk of ACM, although a combination
   of the two does not yield greater benefit. This observation suggests a
   shared mechanism for this risk reduction, which we hypothesize to be via
   the treatment of micrometastatic disease within the pelvic lymph nodes.

Abstract = {{The use of neonicotinoid seed treatments is a nearly ubiquitous practice
   in sunflower (Helianthus annuus) pest management. Sunflowers have a
   speciose pest complex, but also harbor a diverse and abundant community
   of beneficial, nontarget organisms which may be negatively affected by
   pest management practices. Here, we investigate how the foliar and
   subterranean arthropod pest communities in sunflower fields were
   affected by a thiamethoxam seed treatment over three site years (two
   years on one farm, and another year at an additional field in the second
   year). Thiamethoxam and its metabolite clothianidin in leaf tissue were
   quantified throughout the growing season, and yield differences between
   treatments were measured. Across site years, foliar herbivores and key
   pests of sunflowers were unaffected by the seed treatment. Likewise,
   subterranean herbivores were unaffected. Thiamethoxam was measurable in
   leaf tissue through the R1 plant stage, while its metabolite
   clothianidin was detected throughout flowering (R6). No difference in
   sunflower yield was observed between treatments across site years. This
   research suggests that neonicotinoid seed treatments in sunflowers do
   not always provide economic benefits to farmers in the form of pest
   reductions or yield improvements. Future research should focus on
   sunflower integrated pest management strategies that limit nontarget
   effects of agrochemicals, while providing greater economic returns to
   farmers.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Patterns of end-of-life cancer care differ in Canada and the
   United States; yet little is known about differences in service-specific
   and overall costs.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to compare end-of-life costs in Ontario,
   Canada, and the United States, using administrative health data.
   Design: Advanced-stage nonsmall cell lung cancer patients who died from
   cancer at age 65.5years in 2001-2005 were selected from the US
   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database (N=16,858)
   and the Ontario Cancer Registry (N=8643). We estimated total and
   service-specific costs (2009US dollars) in each of the last 6months of
   life from the public payer perspectives for short-term and long-term
   survivors (lived<180 and 180days post-diagnosis, respectively). Services
   were defined for comparisons between systems.
   Results: Mean monthly costs increased as death approached, were higher
   in short-term than long-term survivors, and were generally higher in the
   United States than in Ontario until the month before death, when they
   were similar (long-term survivors: US\$10,464 and US\$10,094 (p=0.53),
   short-term survivors US\$14,455 and US\$12,836 (p=0.11), in
   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare and Ontario,
   respectively). Costs for Medicare hospice and Ontario's palliative care
   components were similar and increased closer to death. Inpatient
   hospitalization was the main cost driver with similar costs in both
   cohorts, despite lower utilization in the United States. The
   compositions of many services and costs differed.
   Conclusion: Costs for nonsmall cell lung cancer patients were slightly
   higher in the United States than Ontario until 1month before death.
   Administrative data allow exploration and international comparisons of
   reimbursement policies, health-care delivery, and costs at the end of
   life.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a common procedure for
   the treatment of cervical degenerative diseases. However, cage
   subsidence remains a frequent problem. We therefore investigated if cage
   design and site-specific bone mineral density (BMD) contribute to the
   rate and direction of subsidence following ACDF.
   Patients were prospectively included and received two different cages
   (groups 1 and 2) using minimization randomization. The degree and
   direction of cage subsidence were determined using plain radiographs.
   Neck pain intensity on the visual analogue scale (VAS), the neck
   disability index (NDI), and the patient satisfaction index were recorded
   up to 12 months after surgery.
   88 patients were analysed with a mean age of 53.7 +/- A 11.8 years. BMD
   values decreased in craniocaudal direction from 302.0 +/- A 62.2 to
   235.5 +/- A 38.9 mg/cm(3). Both groups showed significant height gain
   after the operation (both p < 0.001), followed by height loss at 3
   months (both p < 0.05) and at 3-12 months after the operation (both p >
   0.05). Both groups showed improvement of VAS neck pain intensity (both p
   < 0.05) and NDI (both p < 0.05). The direction of cage subsidence was
   similar, no correlations were found between cage subsidence and BMD or
   various clinical parameters.
   Implant geometry of both cages and variations of the operative procedure
   promoted a relatively high degree of cage subsidence. Further studies
   are necessary to identify a relation of BMD and subsidence using
   optimized implant geometry and by controlling additional intraoperative
   variables.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the changes in corneal higher-order aberrations
   (HOAs) and their impact on corneal higher-order Strehl ratio after
   aberration-free ablation profile.
   SETTING: Verter Institute, H. Olhos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   DESIGN: Prospective interventional study.
   METHODS: Eyes that had aberration-free myopic ablation were divided into
   3 groups, based on the spherical equivalent (SE). The corneal HOAs and
   higher-order Strehl ratios were calculated before surgery and 3 months
   after surgery.
   RESULTS: The postoperative uncorrected-distance visual acuity,
   corrected-distance visual acuity, and SE did not present statistical
   differences among groups (88 eyes, P >.05). For a 6 mm pupil, the
   corneal HOA showed a mean increase of 0.17 mu m (range 0.39 to 0.56 mu
   m) (P <.001) and the corneal higher-order Strehl ratio presented a
   reduction of 0.03 (from 0.25 to 0.22) (P =.001). The following
   consistent linear predictive model was obtained: corneal HOA induction =
   1.474 0.032 x SE - 0.225 x OZ, where OZ is the optical zone (R-2 = 0.49,
   adjusted R-2 = 0.48, P <.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: The corneal HOAs and the higher-order Strehl ratios
   deteriorated after moderate and high myopic ablations. The worsening in
   corneal aberrations and optical quality were related to the magnitude of
   the intended correction and did not affect high-contrast visual
   performance. The OZ was the only modifiable parameter capable to
   restrain the optical quality loss. Financial Disclosure: The author has
   no financial or proprietary interest in any material or method

Abstract = {{This paper presents about error minimization in OFDM system. In
   conventional system, usually using channel coding such as BCH Code or

   not good in implementation of OFDM System. Error bits of OFDM system
   without channel coding is 5.77\%. Then, we used convolutional code with
   code rate 1/2, it can reduce error bitsonly up to 3.85\%. So, we
   proposed OFDM system with Modified Convolutional Code. In this
   implementation, we used Software Define Radio (SDR), namely Universal
   Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) NI 2920 as the transmitter and
   receiver. The result of OFDM system using Modified Convolutional Code
   with code rate is able recover all character received so can decrease
   until 0\% error bit. Increasing performance of Modified Convolutional
   Code is about 1 dB in BER of 10(-4) from BCH Code and Convolutional
   Code. So, performance of Modified Convolutional better than BCH Code or

Title = {{Autophagy, which is decreased in labouring fetal membranes, regulates
   IL-1 beta production via the inflammasome}},
Journal = {{PLACENTA}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: IL-1 beta plays a vital role in the terminal processes of
   human labour and delivery. Inflammasome activation is required to
   process pro IL-1 beta to an active, secreted molecule. Recent studies
   have shown that autophagy regulates IL-1 beta via the inflammasome. The
   aims were to determine the effect of (i) human spontaneous term and
   preterm labour on the expression of autophagy proteins in fetal
   membranes; and (ii) autophagy inhibition on IL-1 beta release.
   Methods: Fetal membranes, from term and preterm, were obtained from
   non-labouring and labouring women. Tissue explants were used to
   determine the effect of inhibition of autophagy on IL-1 beta secretion.
   Results: Expression of the autophagy proteins Beclin-1, Atg3, Atg5,
   Atg7, Atg12, Atg16L1 were lower after spontaneous term labour. Beclin-1
   and Atg7 expression were lower after spontaneous preterm labour.
   Beclin-1, Atg3, and Atg7 expression were lower after preterm pre-labour
   rupture of membranes (PPROM) compared to preterm with intact membranes.
   LOB-I expression was higher after spontaneous term and preterm labour
   and with PPROM; there was no difference in LC3B-II expression between
   the two groups. The autophagy inhibitor LY290042 increased IL-1 beta
   secretion in the presence of bacterial endotoxin LPS; IL-1 beta
   secretion was ameliorated in the presence inflammasome inhibitors.
   Discussion: Autophagy is decreased in fetal membranes after spontaneous
   labour and delivery, and PPROM. Inhibition of autophagy regulates the
   secretion of IL-1 beta via inflammasome activation. IL-1 beta is a major
   contributor to the pathophysiology of spontaneous preterm birth.
   Therefore activation of autophagy may be a potential therapeutic
   mechanism to delay or prevent infection-induced preterm birth. (C) 2015

   source of DNA to the identification of bodies without evident signs of
   decomposition by comparing two different methods of DNA extraction
   (organic versus Chelex (R) resin). Our results showed the viability of
   using swabs from the inner mucosa of the urinary bladder as DNA source
   of human identification, because besides showing reproducible and

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this prospective study was to estimate the effects
   of Erbium substituted: Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (Er:YAG) laser, compared
   with traditional scalpel, on the early postoperative sequelae of
   nondysplastic oral lesion removal. Background data: There is limited
   evidence that laser surgery could exhibit advantages over scalpel in
   oral mucosal surgery. Methods: The investigators studied a cohort of 344
   patients; 394 lesions were randomized and treated. Outcome statistically
   evaluated variables were: age, gender, the site and size of investigated
   lesions, visual analogue score (VAS) of pain, the Oral Health Impact
   Profile questionnaire (OHIP-14) and the Quality of Life test (QOL), and
   number of analgesics taken in the 1st week after surgery. Results:
   Significant differences were found if considering the surgical time,
   VAS, and QOL and OHIP-14 questionnaires; regarding those data, the
   Er:YAG laser appeared to be faster and less painful than traditional
   scalpel (p<0.05). For bigger lesions, patients statistically took more
   painkillers if they had undergone traditional surgery. Considering the
   site of the treated lesions, Er:YAG laser was less painful, especially
   in the gingiva and palate (p<0.05). Conclusions: This is the first
   randomized controlled surgical trial reported for the management of
   nondysplastic oral lesions with the use of an Er:YAG laser. With many
   limitations, the present report identifies significant difference in the
   immediate postoperative surgical period between the two treatments,
   meaning that the Er:YAG laser seemed to be less painful, and better
   accepted by patients, than traditional scalpel.}},

   crack growth in Ti-6242}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{For low-cycle fatigue tests with smooth bars the number of cycles to
   initiation is commonly defined from a measured relative drop in maximum
   load. This criterion cannot be directly related to the crack length,
   which is the actual measure of interest. In order to establish a
   relation between load drop and crack length for the high strength
   titanium alloy Ti-6242, this investigation compares data from controlled
   low-cycle fatigue crack growth tests and numerical simulations of these
   tests. To achieve sufficient accuracy in this relation, focus is given
   to modelling of mean stress relaxation. Three constitutive models, the
   Chaboche, the Ohno-Wang and the Chaboche with threshold, are evaluated
   with respect to experiments. Furthermore, a straightforward method with
   cycle-scaling of the material parameters are used to efficiently reduce
   calculation cost. It is shown that it is possible to determine the
   relationship between load drop and crack length from numerical
   simulations, provided that care is taken to relevant aspects of the
   materials stress-strain response. These results are also used to
   numerically evaluate the effect on load drop of the extensometer
   position relative to the crack. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Introduction: Despite smoking fewer cigarettes per day, African American
   smokers have greater difficulty quitting compared to Caucasian smokers.
   Further elucidating the impact of smoking motivations on smoking
   behaviour would contribute to understanding the factors that maintain
   smoking.
   Aims: This study examined the factor structure of a brief assessment
   examining smoking dependence motives among a sample of African American
   light smokers.
   Methods: Data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised smoking
   cessation trial involving 540 participants. Results were analysed using
   an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and a randomly split EFA.
   Results/Findings: Findings from the initial EFA analysis produced an
   eight-factor model, explaining 69\% of the variation in responses. The
   overall Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA) was 0.88 with item level MSA
   ranging 0.68-0.94 across the 30 items. Results from the randomly split
   EFA replicated the findings of the original EFA; with the exception of
   the item `I smoke within the first 30 minutes of awakening in the
   morning'.
   Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis of a multidimensional
   approach to conceptualising nicotine dependence, and provide information
   regarding characteristics of nicotine dependence in African American
   light smokers which may be helpful in identifying targets for cessation
   treatment in this population of smokers.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: When a dental practitioner is brought before a disciplinary
   body, a common finding is that dental records were poorly kept and
   inadequate to establish issues of consent for treatment or the nature of
   the treatment undertaken. Often this finding may be incidental to the
   actual issue that brought the practitioner before a regulatory body or
   the Courts. The aim of this study was to examine recent cases reported
   in the State of Victoria involving dental practitioners, specifically
   seeking those cases where the record keeping was found to be inadequate
   as an incidental finding.
   Methods: Published rulings of formal complaints and notification cases
   brought before disciplinary hearings in the State of Victoria for the
   period January 2000 to June 2014 were analysed with regards to orders
   made in respect to record keeping.
   Results: Complaints and notifications specific to dental record keeping
   accounted for less than 2\% of formal complaints. And yet up to 75\% of
   cases have made a finding of unprofessional conduct against a dental
   practitioner on the basis of inadequate record keeping, most often in
   combination with other breaches of conduct.
   Conclusions: Adherence to the traditional format of handwriting or
   typing entries into patient records may contribute to the problem of
   poor record keeping in a clinical dental setting. Newer technologies
   such as digital intraoral and extraoral photography and audio-recording
   of patient interactions may offer a solution to the problems of record
   keeping.}},

Abstract = {{American Indian women have lower cancer survival rates compared to
   non-Hispanic White women. Increased cancer screening fostered by
   culturally sensitive education and community programs may help decrease
   this disparity. This study assesses the effectiveness of Hopi Cancer
   Support Services (HCSS) in maintaining high rates of breast and cervical
   cancer screening among Hopi women and evaluates the impact of
   participation in HCSS programs on colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. A
   population-based survey was conducted on the Hopi reservation in 2012 (n
   = 252 women). Frequency of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer
   screenings, participation in HCSS programs and barriers to screening
   were evaluated. Unconditional multiple logistic regression estimated the
   independent effect of the HCSS program on CRC screening. Approximately
   88 \% of Hopi women 40+ reported ever having had a mammogram; 71 \% did
   so within the past 2 years. Approximately 66 \% of women 50+ were ever
   screened for colorectal cancer (FOBT and/or colonoscopy). Women who had
   their last mammogram through HCSS were 2.81 (95 \% CI 1.12, 7.07) times
   more likely to have been screened for CRC. Breast and cervical cancer
   screening continues at a high rate among Hopi women and is substantially
   greater than that reported prior to the inception of HCSS. Furthermore,
   participation in programs offered by HCSS is strongly associated with
   increased colorectal cancer screening. This tribal health program (HCSS)
   has strongly influenced cancer screening among Hopi women and is a model
   of a tribally run cancer prevention program.}},

Journal = {{DISCOURSE CONTEXT \& MEDIA}},

Abstract = {{In this genre-based study I examined the discursive enactment of
   resistance to neoliberal ideology through the writing of Polly Toynbee
   in her regular commentary column in the Guardian newspaper. Using my
   social genre/cognitive genre model as the analytical framework (Bruce,
   2008a), I examined a sample of 30 examples of Toynbee's column in terms
   of the knowledge elements of context, epistemology, writer stance,
   content structuring and cognitive genres (text types). I found that,
   Toynbee's challenge to neoliberalism is two-pronged, involving the use
   of key generic elements to communicate themes that broadly fall within
   the areas of critique of the neoliberal shrinking of the state and
   advocacy of policy alternatives to strengthen social democracy and help
   the disadvantaged. Concerned with the embedded nature of neoliberalism
   in the British national psyche, which is reinforced by the powerful
   media organs, Toynbee, through her column presents a forceful, vigorous
   challenge to this prevailing ideology, a challenge achieved through a
   complex, discourse-constructing task. That complexity is revealed by the
   genre analysis undertaken here. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{This article situates the establishment of the Bundeswehr and the
   implementation of compulsory military service in the 1950s and early
   1960s within contemporary efforts to define a sexual-moral order for the
   Federal Republic of Germany. It argues that West Germany's rearmament
   offered contemporaries an opportunity to stipulate not only acceptable
   soldierly behavior, but also adequate male behavior in general. In the
   context of heightened concerns about juvenile delinquents (so-called
   Halbstarken), female prostitution, homosexuality, and the distribution
   of pornographic materials, West German citizens became interested in the
   social and sexual conduct of Bundeswehr soldiers and officers. Whereas
   some still considered the military to be a school of the nation and of
   proper masculinity, others worried about the armed forces as a possible
   breeding ground for immorality. Partly sharing these concerns,
   government representatives, members of the Bundestag, church officials,
   and military commanders sought to guide soldiers' behavior, emphasizing
   the ideal of the complete (vollkommene) Christian male-breadwinner
   family.
   Dieser Artikel situiert die Grundung der Bundeswehr und die Einfuhrung
   der Wehrpflicht in den 1950er und fruhen 1960er Jahren innerhalb
   zeitgenossischer Bemuhungen, eine sexualmoralische Ordnung fur die
   Bundesrepublik zu definieren. Dabei wird behauptet, dass die
   westdeutsche Wiederbewaffnung den Zeitgenossen eine Moglichkeit bot,
   nicht nur akzeptables Verhalten der Soldaten, sondern auch angemessenes
   mannliches Verhalten im Allgemeinen festzulegen. Im Zusammenhang mit
   gesteigerten Angsten vor sogenannten Halbstarken, weiblicher
   Prostitution, Homosexualitat und der Verbreitung pornographischer
   Materialien begann sich die westdeutsche Bevolkerung fur das soziale und
   sexuelle Verhalten der Bundeswehrsoldaten und Offiziere mehr zu
   interessieren. Wahrend einige das Militar noch immer als eine Schule der
   Nation und ein Vorbild angemessener Maskulinitat betrachteten, sorgten
   sich andere daruber, dass die Bundeswehr zum potentiellen Nahrboden
   einer Unmoral werden konnte. Regierungsvertreter, Bundestagsmitglieder,
   Kirchenbeamte und Militarbefehlshaber, welche diese Bedenken teilweise
   auch hatten, bemuhten sich das Verhalten der Soldaten zu lenken, indem
   man das Ideal des vollkommenen, christlichen und mannlichen
   Brotgewinners fur die Familie hochhielt.}},

Abstract = {{During the early twentieth century, amid growing interest in the
   pedagogical significance of heritage landscapes, Pennsylvanians took a
   leading role in demonstrating the value of teaching with -historic
   places. A forward-looking Pennsylvania Historical Commission (the
   Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission since 1945) and
   significant investments by the federally sponsored Works Progress
   Administration paved the way. This essay reflects on that history toward
   assessing the role of historic places in education today. It suggests
   that historic places offer important lessons beyond what they reveal
   about how Americans lived in the past. Most significantly, we gain new
   insight into Pennsylvania history by interrogating the reasons why
   historic sites are preserved and how their management changes over time.
   Several examples illustrate how challenging students with nuanced
   considerations of historic places encourages all of us to be mindful of
   persistent threats to Pennsylvania's public historical resources.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{531}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{892-901}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{During the last few decades, Europe has seen a faster increase of
   observed temperature than that simulated by models. The air temperature
   over Western Europe showed an abrupt shift at the end of the 1980s,
   still insufficiently documented. The aim of this study is to assess the
   characteristics of this shift and its potential impacts on the
   hydrological cycle over France. Such an assessment is essential for a
   better understanding of past and future climatic changes and their
   impact on water resources.
   A subset of 119 temperature, 122 rainfall, and 30 hydrometric stations
   was studied, over the entire French metropolitan territory. Several
   change-point detection tests were applied to temperature, rainfall and
   runoff time series.
   A shift in annual mean air temperature was detected in 1987/88, for more
   than 75\% of the stations, and for both minimum and maximum
   temperatures. An abrupt increase of about 1 degrees C in minimum and
   maximum temperature provides evidence of this shift, which shows strong
   seasonality, with significant increases for DJF, MAM and JJA. Its
   detection is not affected by the length of the time series or any
   potential artefacts associated to the conditions of measurement.
   Cluster analysis of the rainfall stations was used to take account of
   regional variability in rainfall evolution. Two climate areas were
   obtained from this analysis: Mediterranean and temperate. No shift was
   detected in rainfall for either area. However, at annual and quarterly
   scales, several changes in runoff were observed between the periods
   1969-87 and 1988-09. The significant changes occurred from January to
   July, in agreement with maximum increases in temperature.
   Evapotranspiration could well play a key role in these changes in the
   hydrological cycle, as a response to temperature increases in the
   watersheds studied.}},

Abstract = {{Due to pension reforms, minimum retirement age in Italy increased
   substantially above age 50 between the second part of the 1990s and the
   early 2000s. We evaluate whether these reforms affected training
   participation by private sector employees aged 40-54, who entered their
   fifties during the relevant years. We find evidence of a sizeable
   effect: our estimates suggest a 9\% increase in training incidence
   following a one-year increase in minimum retirement age. We also show
   that, while policies that increase the residual working horizon are
   effective in increasing training participation by senior workers in
   their forties and early fifties, traditional training policies that aim
   at reducing training costs by providing subsidies are ineffective. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper studies the multi-objective optimization of space station
   short-term mission planning (STMP), which aims to obtain a
   mission-execution plan satisfying multiple planning demands. The
   planning needs to allocate the execution time effectively, schedule the
   on-board astronauts properly, and arrange the devices reasonably. The
   STMP concept models for problem definitions and descriptions are
   presented, and then an STMP multi-objective planning model is developed.
   To optimize the STMP problem, a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm
   II (NSGA-II) is adopted and then improved by incorporating an iterative
   conflict-repair strategy based on domain knowledge. The proposed
   approach is demonstrated by using a test case with thirty-five missions,
   eighteen devices and three astronauts. The results show that the
   established STMP model is effective, and the improved NSGA-II can
   successfully obtain the multi-objective optimal plans satisfying all
   constraints considered. Moreover, through contrast tests on solving the
   STMP problem, the NSGA-II shows a very competitive performance with
   respect to the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm II (SPEA-II) and
   the Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPS 0).}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a reported complication for
   patients undergoing chemotherapy, particularly immunochemotherapy with
   anti-CD20 agents such as rituximab. However, as the use of molecularly
   targeted agents increases, the risk of viral reactivation is less
   clearly defined. Here, we present the case of a 62-year-old woman with
   newly diagnosed EGFR mutation-positive metastatic non-small-cell lung
   cancer (NSCLC).
   Per interview, our patient had a remote history of HBV infection. She
   was started on erlotinib and developed profound diarrhea leading to
   renal failure that required hospital admission and temporary
   discontinuation of erlotinib. At 8 days after erlotinib cessation, she
   had a marked spike in her liver function tests, with viral serologies
   that were consistent with HBV reactivation. Although erlotinib and other
   tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIS) are not classically associated with
   HBV reactivation, HBV reactivation can occur even in the setting of TKI
   withdrawal. Before TKI initiation, careful patient screening in those at
   risk for HBV should be performed to attenuate preventable hepatotoxicity
   and to differentiate between other causes of hepatotoxicity (for
   example, drug-induced toxicity).}},

Title = {{The evolution of streams in a time-dependent potential}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{584}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We study the evolution of streams in a time-dependent spherical
   gravitational potential. Our goal is to establish what are the imprints
   of this time evolution on the properties of streams as well as their
   observability. To this end, we have performed a suite of test-particle
   experiments for a host system that doubles its mass during the
   integration time and for a variety of initial conditions. In these
   experiments we found that the most striking imprint is a misalignment of
   similar to 10 degrees in the angular location of the apocentres of the
   streams compared to the static case (and to the orbit of the centre of
   mass), which only becomes apparent for sufficiently long streams. We
   have also developed an analytic model using action-angle variables which
   allows us to explain this behaviour and to identify the most important
   signature of time evolution, namely a difference in the slope defined by
   the distribution of particles along a stream in frequency and in angle
   space. Although a difference in slope can arise when the present-day
   potential is not correctly modelled, this shortcoming can be by-passed
   because in this case, streams are no longer straight lines in angle
   space, but depict a wiggly appearance and an implausible energy
   gradient. The difference in slope due to time evolution is small,
   typically similar to 10(-2) and its amplitude depends on the growth rate
   of the potential, but nonetheless we find that it could be observable if
   accurate full-space information for nearby long streams is available. On
   the other hand, disregarding this effect may bias the determination of
   the present-day characteristics of the potential.}},

Journal = {{ALLERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1580-1587}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The incidence of anaphylaxis in South Asians (Indian,
   Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnicity) is unknown. Birmingham is a British
   city with a disproportionately large population of South Asians (22.5\%)
   compared with the rest of the UK (4.9\%). The main aims of this study
   were to determine the incidence and severity of anaphylaxis in this
   population and to investigate the differences between the South Asian
   and White populations.
   Methods: A retrospective electronic search of emergency department
   attendances at three hospitals in Birmingham during 2012 was carried
   out. Wide search terms were used, medical notes were scrutinized, and
   the World Allergy Organization diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis were
   applied. Patients' age, sex, ethnicity and home postal code were
   collected, reactions were graded by severity, and other relevant details
   including specialist assessment were extracted. Multivariate analysis
   was undertaken using 2011 UK census data.
   Results: Age-, sex- and ethnicity-standardized incidence rate of
   anaphylaxis was 34.5 per 100 000 person-years. Multivariate logistic
   regression which controlled for the confounders of age, sex and level of
   socioeconomic deprivation showed that incidence was higher in the South
   Asian population (OR 1.48, P = 0.005). Incidence rate in the South Asian
   population was 58.3 cases per 100 000 person-years compared to 31.5 in
   the White population. South Asian children were more likely to present
   with severe anaphylaxis (OR 5.31, P = 0.002).
   Conclusions: Incidence of anaphylaxis is significantly higher in British
   South Asians compared to the white population. British South Asian
   children are at a greater risk of severe anaphylaxis than White
   children.}},

Title = {{Is Housing First for Mental Health Community Support Possible During a
   Housing Shortage?}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL POLICY \& ADMINISTRATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Supported housing programmes for people with chronic mental health needs
   have shifted towards approaches that rely on housing first, which
   prioritizes access to a permanent home in the community. How do support
   programmes with this assumption manage the market constraints of a
   shortage of affordable housing? The article examines empirical mixed
   method data (interviews and programme data) about the experience of
   managing this problem in the Mental Health Housing and Accommodation
   Support Initiative (HASI) in New South Wales, Australia. HASI provides
   clinical mental health services, housing support and housing if needed,
   for people who are not yet living independently in the community.
   It found that the housing shortage affected the ability of the providers
   to implement the intended programme design at three early steps in the
   support: determining eligibility; prioritizing access between people
   with and without housing; and managing entry to the programme when they
   did not have housing. As a result, some otherwise suitable applicants
   were not prioritized for entry into the programme or their entry was
   delayed until they were housed.
   The providers adjusted the programme to the housing market realities,
   which compromised the programme intentions. The policy lessons are that
   programmes need strategies to provide housing for people who require it;
   assist people to find or apply for housing; and support people while
   they wait for housing. These approaches enhance the coherence of
   programmes, build on integration mechanisms and respond to the housing
   context.}},

Title = {{Language recovery after left hemispherotomy for Rasmussen encephalitis}},
Journal = {{EPILEPSY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{51-57}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Hemispherotomy (H) is the gold standard treatment to cure
   epilepsy in Rasmussen encephalitis (RE). Linguistic prognosis after
   surgery remains the main issue when the dominant hemisphere is involved.
   The topic of the present research is to specify the long-term linguistic
   profile of the right hemisphere after left dominant H for RE.
   Methods: We followed 6 children 8.4 to 14.6 years of age who underwent
   left H for RE. Preoperatively, four children experienced aphasia, but
   for two, worsening occurred after surgery. Age at H ranged from 4.1 to
   8.4 years. Themean duration of epilepsy was 1.2 years and 5.6 years for
   follow-up. Neuropsychological evaluation included longitudinal follow-up
   of intellectual efficiency measurement and a long-term outcome of
   language using various components of receptive and expressive oral
   speech with computerized tasks.
   Key findings: Preoperatively, verbal comprehension index (VCI) was
   dramatically decreased in 4/6 patients, and performance reasoning index
   (PRI) was low in 5/6 participants, demonstrating a global impact of RE
   itself. Post-operatively, all children recovered sufficiently to attend
   a regular VCI (above 70) in a mean of 5 years after H, and 5/6 recovered
   normal or adapted school. There was a dissociation in favor of VCI,
   while PRI decreased in 5/6 patients. We found a specific linguistic
   profile for these children recovering language in the right hemisphere:
   normal verbal comprehension, and weakness of grammatical judgment, word
   repetition, statement production, semantic verbal fluency and
   metaphonological abilities. Language recovery scores were statistically
   correlated with those ofWorking Memory Index.
   Significance: This study emphasizes for the first time the ability of
   the right hemisphere to functionally reorganize language over a long
   period of time following left H for RE. Syntactic abilities and
   phonology remain low and support the hypothesis of an early left
   hemispheric specialization. Nevertheless, lexico-semantic processes
   recover in the right hemisphere that could reflect a pre-existing
   potential of both hemispheres. Our results support a decision to proceed
   to H in classical left RE disease until the late childhood even if there
   is no complete aphasia before surgery. These data should be taken in
   account in the overall postoperative follow-up and rehabilitation
   strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   report a significant role for DNA breaks and DDR signalling in the
   mechanisms of transcriptional elongation in stimulus-inducible genes in
   humans. Our data show the enrichment of TRIM28 and gamma H2AX on
   serum-induced genes and the important function of DNA-PK for Pol II
   pause release and transcriptional activation-coupled DDR signalling on
   these genes. gamma H2AX accumulation decreases when P-TEFb is inhibited,
   confirming that DDR signalling results from transcriptional elongation.
   In addition, transcriptional elongation-coupled DDR signalling involves
   topoisomerase II because inhibiting this enzyme interferes with Pol II
   pause release and gamma H2AX accumulation. Our findings propose that DDR
   signalling is required for effective Pol II pause release and
   transcriptional elongation through a novel mechanism involving TRIM28,
   DNA-PK and topoisomerase II.}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses the phenomenology of aesthetic experience. It
   first, critically, considers one of the most influential approaches to
   the psychophysics of aesthetic perception, viz. neuroaesthetics.
   Hereafter, it outlines constitutive tenets of aesthetic perception in
   terms of a particular intentional relation to the object. The argument
   comes in three steps. First, I show the inadequacies of the
   neuroaesthetics of beauty in general and Semir Zeki's and V.J.
   Ramachandran's versions of it in particular. The neuroaesthetics of
   beauty falls short, because it develops hypotheses of aesthetic
   experience which have no consequences for the understanding of what art
   is, that is, how artists produce visual meaning effects in their works.
   This is so because they make the rewarding feeling of beauty the
   cornerstone of aesthetic experience. Next, I show why and how aesthetic
   experience should be defined relative to its object and the tools for
   meaning-making specific to that object, and not relative to the feeling
   (of beauty) it may elicit. Finally, I sketch the import this fact may
   have on a research program in empirical aesthetics.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Fulfillment of patient preferences for location of dying is
   of continued end-of-life care interest. Of those voicing a preference,
   most prefer home. However the majority of deaths occur in an
   institutional setting. Objectives: The study objective was to report on
   the congruence between the last preferred and actual location of death
   among adult Nova Scotians who died from chronic disease, and to identify
   individual, illness-related, and environmental factors associated with
   achieving a preferred home death. Methods: The study employed a
   population-based mortality follow-back telephone survey interview.
   Subjects were eligible death certificate identified informants
   (next-of-kin) of adults (aged 18+) (n=1316) who died of advanced chronic
   diseases in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia between June 2009 and
   May 2011 who were knowledgeable about the decedent's care over the last
   month of life. Congruence was assessed as to whether or not the decedent
   died in their preferred death location. Among decedents preferring a
   home death, individual, illness-related, and environmental risk factor
   multivariable analyses were used to identify predictors of home death
   achievement. Results: Among all who voiced a preference (n=606), 52\%
   died in their preferred location (kappa: 0.29). Factors contributing
   independently to achievement of a preferred home death were emotional
   needs being met, nursing and family physician home visits, palliative
   care program involvement, and being at home for the majority of the last
   month. Conclusions: This study identifies elements of primary and
   integrated care that address the gap between preferred and actual place

Abstract = {{This article focuses on knowledge management in UK hospitals as an area
   in which organizational ambidexterity (OA) is a necessary condition. In
   contrast to much of the literature on OA that looks at senior managers,
   we focus on the role of hybrid middle managers, professional workers who
   hold managerial responsibilities, in ensuring that the quality of care
   delivered is at an optimum safe level for patients. We examine the
   influence of prevailing tensions and competing agendas characteristic of
   a professionalized, public-sector context upon knowledge exploitation
   and exploration at the middle levels of the organization. Our study
   investigates how these tensions are experienced and reconciled at the
   individual level. We examine the contextual and personal circumstances
   that enable hybrid middle managers to forge workable compromises between
   exploration and exploitation to facilitate OA. We find that this process
   is contingent on professional legitimacy, social capital, and a holistic
   professional orientation. This has wider implications for human resource
   practice to support the discretion and motivation of hybrid middle
   managers to facilitate OA for enduring performance and advancement of
   best practice. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{Perinatal influences on the uptake of newborn Vitamin K prophylaxis - a

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{573-576}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To describe rates of newborn vitamin K prophylaxis uptake
   according to method of administration (intramuscular {[}IM], oral,
   refused) and identify predictors for the choice of oral administration
   and for refusal of vitamin K prophylaxis.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study examined the relationship between
   method of vitamin K administration and various exposure factors (infant,
   maternal, socio-demographic and healthcare professional). Written and
   electronic data for births from a single tertiary birthing unit in New
   Zealand (NZ) were examined over a four- year period from January 2009 to
   December 2012.
   Results: Records for 7,089 mothers/babies were examined. Of these,
   92.9\% of infants received IM and 5.4\% oral vitamin K. Refusal of
   vitamin K was associated with (OR {[}95\% CI]): Asian ethnicity (5.87
   {[}3.61 to 9.53] p<0.001); vaginal delivery (2.85 {[}1.83 to 4.43]
   p<0.001); and gestational age, per additional week, (1.24 {[}1.10 to
   1.39) p< 0.001). Oral vitamin K was associated with (OR {[}95\% CI]):
   Asian ethnicity (2.61 {[}1.80 to 3.79] p< 0.001); obstetric nurse as the
   Lead Maternity Carer (LMC) (2.65 {[}1.73 to 4.06] p< 0.001); vaginal
   delivery (2.34 {[}1.84 to 2.96] p< 0.001); gestational age, per week,
   (1.14 {[}1.07 to 1.21] p< 0.001); and LMC experience, per decade (0.61
   {[}0.51 to 0.74] p< 0.001).
   Conclusions: This study reveals several important and novel associations
   with mode of administration of newborn vitamin K prophylaxis. IM vitamin
   K uptake was also lower than international data, largely due to
   increased oral uptake.
   Implications: Uptake of vitamin K is associated with ethnicity and also
   factors in the infant that might imply a perceived protection against
   vitamin K deficiency bleeding. Further investigation is required for a
   fuller understanding of the motivations for choosing differing routes of
   vitamin K administration in newborns, with particular emphasis on
   factors influencing parental choice.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1102-1107}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Altered gait mechanics are common following stroke and may
   increase the risk of falls. Paretic gait impairments have been
   previously compared to the non-paretic limb or control participants.
   Unfortunately, the biomechanical parameters underlying instances of
   naturally occurring unsuccessful foot clearance (trips) have yet to be
   examined in individuals with chronic stroke.
   Methods: Gait data from 26 participants with chronic stroke were
   obtained on a dual-belt instrumented treadmill. Instances of successful
   and unsuccessful foot swing were identified. Temporal, kinematic, and
   kinetic measures of the paretic limb occurring during late stance,
   toe-off, and swing were compared between trip and non-trip steps using
   paired samples t-tests. An alpha = 0.004 was used to adjust for multiple
   comparisons.
   Findings: In the paretic limb, the ankle angle at toe off (P = 0.003; d
   = 0.64), knee flexion velocity at toe off (P < 0.001; d = 0.73), and
   peak knee extension moment during terminal stance (P < 0.001; d = 0.74)
   were significantly different between trips and non-trip steps. During
   trip steps, ankle plantarflexion at toe-off was 1.0 degrees greater,
   knee flexion velocity was reduced by 17.6 degrees/sec, and peak knee
   extension moment was increased by 0.011 Nm/kg . m compared to non-trip
   steps.
   Interpretation: It appears to take only minor changes in the movement of
   the paretic limb to result in a trip in individuals with chronic stroke.
   Although small, the multi-joint biomechanical changes occurring in the
   paretic limb during unsuccessful foot clearance result in a functionally
   longer limb. Thus, interventions targeting multiple joints in the
   paretic limb may be needed to reduce the risk of trips following stroke.

Abstract = {{Objectives: In this study, we address the healthy worker hire effect
   that arises when people with greater than average health are recruited
   to work in industrial jobs. Methods: Epidemiologists have used both
   general and working population reference rates to gauge influence of
   healthy worker hire effect on the standardized mortality ratio. We
   propose a Bayesian procedure that uses information derived from general
   and working population reference rates to calculate standardized
   mortality ratio. Results: The procedure is illustrated in the context of
   heart disease and lung cancer mortality analyses of a cohort of workers
   from a fluoropolymer production facility. Conclusions: Application of
   our method should allow for fuller discussions of the healthy worker
   effect when one of its components, the healthy worker hire effect, is
   evaluated quantitatively. Our method can be utilized to improve risk
   estimates for a cohort with occupational exposure.}},

Abstract = {{The phenolic antioxidant resveratrol, which is naturally produced by
   plants under stress conditions, was seen to exhibit high thermal
   stability and strong antioxidant capacity in
   2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays. The antioxidant behavior
   was compared to the benchmark food contact permitted butylated
   hydroxytoluene (BHT). Active linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE)
   composites were manufactured by immobilization of resveratrol in the
   polymeric matrix and also by pre-incorporation of the resveratrol into a
   food contact permitted montmorillonite clay prior to melt mixing with
   the polymer. Migration tests from active films in water and isooctane
   showed extremely low migration levels in water (below 0.01 mg/kg) and
   was not detectable in isooctane. The resulting composites not only
   showed strong antioxidant activity, but also antimicrobial activity. The
   Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances method (TBARS) was also applied
   to assess the comparative oxidative behavior in air of fresh meat in
   direct contact with the LLDPE film containing the active clay. The
   results suggested that this technology could potentially extend the
   shelf-life of red meat over a few days by a mechanism of free radicals
   trapping and the subsequent arrest in food oxidation processes. (C) 2015

   process using microfluidic technology. An analytical evaluation using
   blood samples from patients with leukemia showed that the while blood
   cell (WBC) depletion and NRBC loss rates of the positive enrichment
   process were 93.98 \% and 6.02 \%, respectively. Through the two-step
   cascade enrichment method, 1-396 NRBCs and only 0-6 WBCs were isolated
   from 1 mL of 18 maternal blood samples. Experimental results also showed
   that the WBC depletion rate of the proposed two-step method was more
   than 625,000-fold, and the purity of enriched NRBCs ranged from 20 \% to
   100 \%. Furthermore, SRY (the sex-determining region of the Y

Abstract = {{Virtual reality welding simulations have been, and continue to be, a

   examine the use of virtual reality simulations as an assessment tool for

   VRTEX (R) 360, to assess the existing skills of experienced and trained
   novice welders. This study also used the shielded metal arc welding
   (SMAW) process to perform simple and complex welds. Performance was
   evaluated through a quality score, which was based on the following five
   welding parameters: arc length, position, work angle, travel angle, and
   travel speed. The virtual reality welding simulator was able to evaluate
   performance, but it could not distinguish between experienced and
   trained novice welders. On average, experienced welders as a group
   scored 10 quality points higher than trained novice welders. Welding
   experience also had a large to very large effect on the quality score
   for each weld type. One identified trend for both experienced and
   trained novice welders was as weld difficulty increased, the quality
   score decreased. It is recommended that industries use virtual reality
   simulators to evaluate welders for ensuring high-quality welding in
   production practices.}},

Abstract = {{The EU Regulation 517/2014 has recently been approved in a further
   attempt to curb the effects of Global Warming. As a consequence, the

   regulations (150). In this regard, the old refrigerant R152a attracts
   renewed interest due to its low GWP (138) and its similarity to R134a.
   The present work shows the results of using R152a in a vapour
   compression plant equipped with a hermetic compressor and an IHX
   designed for R134a. The refrigerant was replaced by a conventional
   ``drop-in{''} process in order to carry out an energy comparison. The
   results have revealed an improvement in the COP with R152a up to 13\%
   despite a reduction in the cooling capacity of about 10\%. During the

Title = {{Evaluation of impacts of management in an anthropogenic peatland using
   field and remote sensing data}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Peatlands are a type of wetland characterized by the accumulation of
   organic matter, called peat, and are important carbon reservoirs. In
   areas with poor drainage, human-induced forest fires and logging can
   produce flooded conditions and organic matter accumulation, which
   generates an ecosystem called anthropogenic peatland. Productive
   management activities such as Sphagnum moss harvesting and livestock
   grazing take place there. Our hypothesis was that productive management
   has a strong impact on the aboveground C reservoir and increases the
   presence of exotic species. We established 44 sampling points in a 16-ha
   anthropogenic peatland on Chiloe Island, Chile, comparing productive and
   conservation types of managements. Carbon stocks, vegetation structure
   and composition variables were quantified. These variables were used to
   classify the ecosystem into microsites to analyze the different
   locations in the peatland. In addition, predictive models of aboveground
   carbon were created using Landsat 8 OLI and Pleiades images. The results
   revealed a carbon stock of 11.99 +/- 0.77 kg C m(-2), which is smaller
   than in natural peatlands, and showed a wide variability of conditions
   within the peatland itself. This variability, mainly expressed in
   aboveground carbon, produces microsites dominated by either shrubs,
   species of the genus Juncus or grasses. Productive management reduced
   accumulated carbon in the aboveground stock and in the woody debris.
   However, the strongest impact was found on the vegetation variables,
   with a decrease in total cover, cover of shrubs and herbaceous plants,
   and in vegetation height. There was also an increase in the richness and
   presence of exotic species. The spatial prediction of aboveground carbon
   yielded significant results using only spectral indices, showing also
   that the impact of productive management is not homogenous, being less
   intense in waterlogged areas. This study is the first to quantify carbon
   reservoirs in this type of ecosystem and to propose variables that can
   be used as indicators of the impact of human activities.}},

Title = {{A Latent Profile Analysis of drinking motives among heavy drinking

Abstract = {{Introduction: Positively (Enhancement and Social) and negatively
   (Coping) reinforcing drinking motives have been shown to be associated
   with alcohol use, alcohol-related problems, and depression among college
   students. Although prior studies of drinking motives have mostly
   consisted of variable-centered analyses, the current study used a
   person-centered approach where individuals were grouped into categories
   based on shared characteristics using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA). We
   investigated the utility of drinking motive profiles to determine how
   different profiles were associated with alcohol outcomes and depressive
   symptoms.
   Method: Participants were 648 undergraduate students who had violated a
   university alcohol policy and who endorsed consuming alcohol in the past
   month. Social, Coping, and Enhancement subscales from the Drinking
   Motives Questionnaire were used as indicators.
   Results: After examining one-through-eight class LPA solutions, the
   six-class solution provided the best empirical and clinically meaningful
   fit to the data. Classes with high coping and high positive reinforcing
   drinking motives consumed more alcohol than profiles of students with
   high coping and low positive reinforcing motives. Classes high on both
   coping and positively reinforcing motives reported the most alcohol
   related problems. Classes with higher levels of coping motives and
   either high or low positive reinforcing motives reported the highest
   depression symptoms.
   Conclusions: Drinking motive profiles differ in terms of alcohol
   outcomes and depressive symptoms. We encourage researchers to explore
   motives for drinking with individuals, especially assessing the
   relationship between coping motives and depression in the presence or
   absence of positively reinforcing motives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Hierarchically structured porous anatase TiO2 spheres have been
   fabricated by a facile chemical route. The TiO2 spheres are constructed
   by interconnected nanorods and possess a three-dimensional (3D)
   interpenetrating porous framework. When evaluated as an electrode
   material in lithium half-cells, such hierarchically porous TiO2
   nanostructures exhibit high lithium storage capacity (225 mA h g(-1) at
   0.5 C), excellent rate performance (141 mA h g(-1) at 5 C), and long
   cycle life (an initial Li+ storage capacity of 187 mA h g(-1) at 1 C and
   a capacity retention of ca. 95\% after 100 cycles). The improved
   electrochemical properties of TiO2 spheres can be attributed to the
   synergetic effects of their unique hierarchical structure, high surface
   area, large and opened pore structure and interconnected 3D network.
   These unique structural characteristics effectively improve the mass
   transfer capability of electrolyte, reduce the Li ions diffusion paths
   and increase the electronic conduction as well as structural stability.

Abstract = {{The spatial variation, potential sources, and ecological risk of heavy
   metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in surface sediments
   from the typical inflow rivers in Taihu Basin were investigated in June
   2010. The results showed that the heavy metal concentrations varied
   greatly and spatially, and higher metal contamination mainly occurred in
   the northern and northwestern regions in Taihu Basin. Multivariate
   statistical analysis demonstrated that Mn might originate from natural
   sources, whereas Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn were primarily
   delivered from anthropogenic activities. The geoaccumulation index and
   enrichment factor values indicated that Cd, Cu, Cr, and Zn were
   moderately severe enriched, Ni and Pb were moderate enriched, while Co
   and Hg were at a minor enrichment level, which indicated that their
   contamination was not a major concern in the inflow rivers of the basin.
   Compared with the ``Consensus-Based Sediment Quality Guidelines,{''} Cr,
   Cu, Ni, and Zn were most likely to result in ecological toxicity for
   aquatic organisms. Although Cd was at moderately severe enrichment
   level, the probable effect concentration quotients of Cd < 1 implied it
   had no or low adverse effects on organisms. The results also suggest
   that Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn contamination in the north and northwest of the
   basin should be addressed as the first priority.}},

Abstract = {{Porphyromonas gingivalis causes inflammation, and leads to the
   periodontitis in gingival tissue damage and bone resorption.
   Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a major polyphenol extract from
   green tea with plenty of pharmacological functions. The aim of this
   study was to determine whether continuous oral intake of EGCG would
   alleviate P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis. Eight-week BALB/c mice
   were administered with EGCG (0.02\%) or vehicle in drinking water. They
   were fed normal food and orally infected with P. gingivalis every 2
   days, up to a total of 20 times, and then sacrificed at 15 weeks of age.
   The P. gingivalis-challenged group markedly increased alveolar bone
   resorption of the maxillae in BALB/c mice by Micro-CT detection, and
   administration of EGCG resulted in a significant reduction in bone loss.
   Inflammation cytokine antibody array and enzyme linked immunosorbent
   assay revealed that some inflammatory mediators in serum were increased
   by P. gingivalis infection, but were lowered after EGCG treatment. High
   positive areas of IL-17 and IL-1 beta in the gingival tissue were
   observed in the P. gingivalis-challenged mice, and were reduced by EGCG
   treatment. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses also
   showed the expressions of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-17, IL-23, TNF-alpha and
   other mediators in gingival tissue were higher in P.
   gingivalis-challenged mice, and were down-regulated with EGCG treatment,
   except IL-23. Our results suggest that EGCG, as a natural healthy
   substance, probably alleviates P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis by
   anti-inflammatory effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{In this work we study the intrinsic geometry of the space of Kahler
   metrics under various Riemannian metrics and the corresponding
   variational structures. The first part is on the Dirichlet metric. A
   motivation for the study of this metric comes from Chen and Zheng (J
   Reine Angew Math, 674:195-251, 2013); there, Chen and the second author
   showed that the pseudo-Calabi flow is the gradient flow of the -energy
   when is endowed precisely with the Dirichlet metric. The second part is
   on the family of weighted metrics, whose distinguished element is the
   Calabi metric studied in Calamai (Math Ann 353:373-402, 2012). We
   investigate as well their geometric properties. Then we focus on the
   constant weight metric. We use it to give an alternative proof of
   Calabi's uniqueness of the Kahler-Einstein metrics (cf. Theorem 5.9),
   when . We also introduce a new functional called -functional and we
   prove that its gradient flow has long time existence and also converges
   to the Kahler-Einstein metric when (cf. Theorem 5.10).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common cancer and an
   important reason of cancer specific death. The incidence of patients who
   diagnosed at low stage increased because of widespread using Prostate
   Specific Antigen (PSA) testing. We evaluated the patients who were
   diagnosed single microscopic focus of adenocarcinoma and treated radical
   prostatectomy at final pathology.
   Methods: The patients who underwent transrectal ultrasound guided
   prostate biopsy between January 2004 and January 2012 were enrolled
   retrospectively. We extracted the patients who were diagnosed single
   microscopic focus of adenocarcinoma and treated with RP. Single
   microscopic adenocarcinoma was defined as one single focus measuring 3
   mm or less, well differentiated (Gleason <= 6) adenocarcinoma. 37
   patients were included at the study. Clinical data; including age, serum
   PSA levels, PSA density and prior biopsy and prostatectomy specimen
   results were recorded. In pathological examination; high molecular
   weight cytokeratin (HMW-CK), p63, and alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase
   (AMACR) were used for differential diagnosis.
   Results: The patients' ages were between 42 and 77 with a mean age of
   64.9 +/- 7.57 years. Mean PSA levels and prostate volumes were 8.03 +/-
   5.21 ng/ml and 54 +/- 25.51 cc. T0, T2a, T2c and T3a were reported in 2
   patients, 17 patients, 17 patients and 1 patient after pathological
   evaluation. According to the Gleason grading system; 6 patients were 7
   (3 + 4), one patient was 7 (4 + 3), one patient was 5 (3 + 2) and 27
   patients were 6 (3 + 3).
   Conclusion: Small volume of cancer at prostate biopsy is not necessarily
   small cancer in radical prostatectomy. The treatment choice may be over
   or under treatment for some patients, so the patients must be informed
   when choosing the treatment. Copyright (C) 2015 Asian Pacific Prostate

   radio which allowed a wider public to hear their poetry and sometimes
   even their voice is the element that most clearly shows the importance
   of poets in public space. She examines poetry broadcasts hosted by
   Robert Choquette and L'heure provinciale to understand the status of
   poetry and poets in Quebec society in the 1930s, and the role played by
   the oralization of poetry through radio broadcasts in making poetry
   accessible and providing it with legitimacy.}},

Abstract = {{Scientific communication (SciComm) skills are indispensable for success
   in biomedical research, but many trainees may not have fully considered
   the necessity of regular writing and speaking for research career
   progression. Our purpose was to investigate the relationship between
   SciComm skill acquisition and research trainees' intentions to remain in
   research careers. We used social cognitive career theory (SCCT) to test
   a model of the relationship of SciComm skills to SciComm-related
   cognitive variables in explaining career intentions. A sample of 510
   graduate students and postdoctoral fellows at major academic health
   science centers in the Texas Medical Center, Houston, Texas, were
   surveyed online. Results suggested that interest in performing SciComm
   tasks, SciComm outcome expectations (SCOEs), and SciComm productivity
   predicted intention to remain in a research career, while SciComm
   self-efficacy did not directly predict career intention. SCOEs also
   predicted interest in performing SciComm tasks. As in other SCCT
   studies, SciComm self-efficacy predicted SCOEs. We conclude that social
   cognitive factors of SciComm skill acquisition and SciComm productivity
   significantly predict biomedical trainees' intentions to pursue research
   careers whether within or outside academia. While further studies are
   needed, these findings may lead to evidence-based interventions to help
   trainees remain in their chosen career paths.}},

Abstract = {{The present study developed the Law Enforcement Officer Stress
   Survey-Revised (LEOSS-R) to identify types of police stressors, then it
   examined which stressors were most associated with negative psychosocial
   outcomes for police officers. Participants included 232 Turkish police
   officers who completed anonymous surveys to describe work and home
   characteristics, to rate the 25 police stressors included in the LEOSS
   (Van Hasselt et al., 2008), and to report negative psychosocial outcomes
   that might be associated with exposure to police stressors. Factor
   analysis produced the 18-item LEOSS-R with four dimensions of police
   stressors: Critical Incidents, Department Politics, Daily Hassles, and
   Work-Home Conflicts. The LEOSS-R subscales showed goodness-of-fit,
   strong internal reliability, and support for validity in expected
   associations with work and home variables (work hours, police support,
   marital status, family support). Critical Incidents and Work-Home
   Conflicts were unrelated to negative psychosocial outcomes, perhaps
   because police officers expect and train for them. The stressor of
   Department Politics was associated with more police partner aggression.
   Daily Hassles were associated with more anger, poor self-esteem, and
   more romantic partner aggression. Future research could examine how
   departmental policy or leadership may reduce the negative impact of
   Daily Hassles for its officers.}},

Abstract = {{The role played by expert witnesses in legal adjudication has been at
   the centre of a lively debate over the past few years. This debate has
   focused on the reliability of expert opinions, their impact on
   fact-finding, and the relevance of scientific knowledge for legal
   adjudication in general. In this paper I argue that expert witnesses
   play a significant role not only in fact-finding but also in legal
   interpretation. More precisely, the use of expert opinions by judges may
   give rise to an interpretive problem that I call the ``opacity of
   law.{''} A legal norm becomes opaque if the judge can fix its reference
   on the basis of what some experts tell him, but he is not able to grasp
   the content of the norm he applies. When this occurs, expert witnesses
   determine the content of authoritative legal texts, giving rise to a
   number of interpretive problems. Here I analyse the source of this
   phenomenon, its peculiar characteristics and consequences, and the
   different sorts of opacity we can face in legal adjudication.}},

Abstract = {{A series of ethylene/4-methyl-1-pentene (E/4M1P) copolymers is
   synthesized, using the Ti (IV) diisopropoxy complex bearing a dianionic
   {[}O-, S, O-] bis(phenolato) ligand, in combination with
   methylalumoxane, as catalyst system. The semicrystalline copolymers are
   characterized by NMR, DSC, WAXD and SAXS. The structure and the thermal
   behavior of the copolymers are strongly influenced by composition and
   monomer sequence distribution. The copolymer crystallinity decreases as
   a function of 4M1P content, while an increase of the periodicity due to
   the enhancement of the amorphous interlamellar thickness is registered.
   The non-homogeneous distribution of the 4M1P units along the polymer
   chains is evidenced by the multimodal crystallization and melting
   behavior. The chain heterogeneity of the copolymers is investigated by
   successive self-nucleation and annealing thermal fractionation
   evaluating the methylene sequence length, the short chain branching and
   the lamellar thickness. In order to get more information on the
   comonomer distribution in the copolymers, solvent extraction is
   performed and all the fractions are characterized by thermal and X-ray

Abstract = {{This paper presents an examination of the Xilinx 7-Series GTX
   transceiver for use in High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments with
   special emphasis on the environment expected in the ATLAS Liquid Argon
   (LAr) subsystem. Two Xilinx Kintex 325T devices were tested with a 180
   MeV proton beam at the TSL facility in Sweden. The beam test
   architecture monitors the GTX transceivers for lane failures and bit
   errors in the data streams from the 13 links sent from the Device Under
   Test (DUT). The DUT was exposed to 1.55 x 10(13) protons/cm(2) over a
   non-continuous period of 24 hours. The cross section of the GTX to any
   failure was calculated to be approximately cm lane which translates to
   an error every 17 minutes for a full LAr subsystem involving lanes. No
   permanent damage was observed on any of the GTX links or other parts of
   the FPGA. A slight increase in current on the VCCINT power supply was
   observed at the end of the test.}},

Title = {{Optimization instances for deterministic and stochastic problems on
   energy efficient investments planning at the building level}},
Journal = {{DATA IN BRIEF}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{805-809}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Optimization instances relate to the input and output data stemming from
   optimization problems in general. Typically, an optimization problem
   consists of an objective function to be optimized (either minimized or
   maximized) and a set of constraints. Thus, objective and constraints are
   jointly a set of equations in the optimization model. Such equations are
   a combination of decision variables and known parameters, which are
   usually related to a set domain. When this combination is a linear
   combination, we are facing a classical Linear Programming (LP) problem.
   An optimization instance is related to an optimization model. We refer
   to that model as the Symbolic Model Specification (SMS) containing all
   the sets, variables, and parameters symbols and relations. Thus, a whole
   instance is composed by the SMS, the elements in each set, the data
   values for all the parameters, and, eventually, the optimal decisions
   resulting from the optimization solution. This data article contains
   several optimization instances from a real-world optimization problem
   relating to investment planning on energy efficient technologies at the
   building level. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

   Control System}},

Abstract = {{The temperature control system is one of the most important subsystems
   of the strapdown airborne gravimeter. Because the quartz flexible
   accelerometer based on springy support technology is the core sensor in
   the strapdown airborne gravimeter and the magnet steel in the
   electromagnetic force equilibrium circuits of the quartz flexible
   accelerometer is greatly affected by temperature, in order to guarantee
   the temperature control precision and minimize the effect of temperature
   on the gravimeter, the SGA-WZ temperature control system adopts a
   three-level control method. Based on the design experience of the
   SGA-WZ-01, the SGA-WZ-02 temperature control system came out with a
   further optimized design. In 1st level temperature control,
   thermoelectric cooler is used to conquer temperature change caused by
   hot weather. The experiments show that the optimized stability of 1st
   level temperature control is about 0.1 degrees C and the max cool down
   capability is about 10 degrees C. The temperature field is analyzed in
   the 2nd and 3rd level temperature control using the finite element
   analysis software ANSYS. The 2nd and 3rd level temperature control
   optimization scheme is based on the foundation of heat analysis. The
   experimental results show that static accuracy of SGA-WZ-02 reaches 0.21
   mGal/24 h, with internal accuracy being 0.743 mGal/4.8 km and external
   accuracy being 0.37 mGal/4.8 km compared with the result of the GT-2A,
   whose internal precision is superior to 1 mGal/4.8 km and all of them
   are better than those in SGA-WZ-01.}},

Abstract = {{Underwater gliders take advantages of the net buoyancy to operate in the
   water column at low speed, but the dynamic models are highly nonlinear,
   highly coupled, and difficult to describe. Comparing with the saw-tooth
   motion in the vertical plane, the steady state solutions in spiral
   motion have become much more challengeable in navigation control and
   path planning. This paper presents an approximate semi-analytical
   solution to the steady state spiraling motion of a glider. The nonlinear
   multi-body dynamic model of an underwater glider actuated by a single
   internal movable and rotatable mass is established. The semi-analytical
   solution to any spiral trajectory is obtained after rational
   simplifications of the thorough equations of motion. The approximate
   solutions are proved sufficiently close to actual values by comparing
   with the simulating results of the full dynamic model.}},

Journal = {{COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{138-144}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Debris-rich ice is often encountered when drilling into basal ice and
   rock glaciers. The standard steel bits used for ice core drilling are
   not suitable because the cutters are very easily broken by rock
   particles as their hardness and abrasiveness are higher than that of the
   ice. The tool steel and tungsten carbide inserts are easily damaged in
   intermixed ice-rock formations. To obtain high-quality core samples in
   debris-rich ice, it is necessary to find drill bits that can drill
   ice-rock mixtures with minimal load and acceptable penetration rate and
   torque. A special testing stand has been designed and constructed to
   study both standard and custom-made carbide and polycrystalline diamond
   compact (PDC) drill bits. The results show that both the carbide and the
   PDC drill bits can drill with high penetration rates in debris-rich ice
   containing very hard and abrasive granite particles at low drill loads
   of 500-1200 N. When the rock volume content is 30\%, the penetration
   rates are 4.68 m/h, 5.9 m/h and 11.12 m/h for the standard six-tooth
   carbide drill bit, a PDC bit with a round compact and a PDC bit with a
   semi-round compact, respectively, under a drill load of 500 N with a
   rotation speed of 100 rpm. Within the range of drill loads of 500 to
   1200 N and rotation speeds of 50 to 200 rpm, the maximum torque is no
   more than 45 Nm, and the power consumption is less than 0.8 kW. In
   addition, the temperature changes of the bit cutters caused by their
   cutting action were also measured. Results of the preliminary tests show
   that temperature variations increase from 3.67 to 5.96 degrees C when
   the drill load increases from 450 to 1200 N and from 4.17 to 621 degrees
   C when the rotation speed increases from 50 to 200 rpm. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper examines attitude tracking problem with unknown friction
   torque of reaction wheels and external disturbances. A robust adaptive
   controller with parameter update law is proposed and analyzed. An
   indirect (nonregressor-based) approach to dealing with the effects of
   unknown friction torque and external disturbances is explored. This is
   done by not focusing on friction torque and external disturbances
   themselves, but on their bound, which allows the core information on
   friction torque and external disturbances to be extracted and used for
   control design. It is shown that the proposed controller guarantees not
   only stability of the resulting closed-loop system but also transient
   performance. Numerical simulations are presented to show the
   effectiveness of the proposed attitude tracking approach. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In spite of significant applications as starting materials for a variety
   of metallocorrole derivatives, free-base
   beta-octabromo-meso-triarylcorroles continue to be viewed as
   inaccessible. The reasons range from the need for tedious
   column-chromatographic purification to limitations of the reductive
   demetallation protocol for selected systems. Here we report that column
   chromatography may be entirely avoided for a number of
   beta-octabromo-meso-tris(p-X-phenyl)corrole derivatives, where X = CF3,
   NO2, F, H, CH3, and OCH3; instead, analytically pure products may be
   obtained by recrystallization from chloroform/methanol. In addition, we
   have presented an optimized synthesis of the heretofore inaccessible,
   sterically hindered ligand
   beta-octabromo-meso-tris(2,6-dichlorophenyl)corrole, H-3{[}Br8TDCPC],
   via reductive demetallation of the corresponding Mn(III) complex. With
   our earlier report of p-octabromo-meso-tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole,
   H-3{[}Br8TPFPC], a comprehensive set of optimized synthetic protocols
   are thus in place for a good number of
   beta-octabromo-meso-triarylcorrole ligands. Furthermore, we have
   illustrated the use of these ligands by synthesizing the iron complexes
   Fe{[}Br8TDCPC]Cl and Fe{[}Br8TDCPC](py)(2), of which the latter lent
   itself to single-crystal X-ray structure determination. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{AimsTo estimate trajectories of gambling variety from mid-adolescence to
   age 30years, and compare the different trajectory groups with regard to
   the type and the frequency of gambling activities practiced and
   gambling-related problems.
   DesignProspective longitudinal cohort study.
   SettingProvince of Quebec, Canada.
   ParticipantsA mixed-gender general population cohort assessed at ages 15
   (n=1882), 22 (n=1785) and 30 (n=1358).
   MeasurementsAdolescent and adult versions of the South Oaks Gambling
   Screen (SOGS).
   FindingsGroup-based trajectory analysis identified three distinct
   trajectories: a late-onset low trajectory (26.7\% of sample) initiating
   gambling at age 22, an early-onset low trajectory (64.8\% of sample),
   characterized by one to two different activities from age 15 onwards and
   a high trajectory (8.4\% of sample), with an average of four to five
   different activities from age 15 to 30. Males (14.2\%) were four times
   more likely to be on a high trajectory than females (3.5\%) (P<0.001).
   Preferred types of gambling activities were similar across the three
   trajectories. Participants on a high trajectory reported higher gambling
   frequency at ages 15 and 30, and were more likely to experience problem
   gambling at age 30: 3.09 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI)=1.66, 5.75]
   and 2.26 (95\% CI=1.27, 4.04) times more, respectively, than late-onset
   low and early-onset low participants, even when socio-economic status
   (SES), frequency of gambling and problem gambling in adolescence,
   gender, age 30 education, SES and frequency of gambling were controlled.
   ConclusionsEngaging in several different types of gambling in early
   adulthood appears to be a risk factor for emergence of problem gambling.}},

   accounts are supported as non-linear specifications suggest that once
   ethnic minorities reach a numerical majority in our sample of cities
   there is a decline in police killings. Findings also support

   reduce the use of lethal force by changing the overall culture of the

Abstract = {{By the end of the 19th century, Brazil experienced a series of
   political, economic and cultural transformations. This wave of changes
   reverberated into the constitution of the Cemiterio da Consolacao, in
   Sao Paulo/SP, which began to mirror the city elite in their tombs,
   conceived with a growing level of elaboration and aesthetic refinement.
   This way, the present article analyzes the tomb of Jose Vieira Couto de
   Magalhaes and the manner in which some elements of his life became
   present in the composition conceived by Nicolina Vaz de Assis.
   Highlighting the sculptural representation of the indigenous Brazilian,
   called ``The Savage{''}, we verify the aims of the artist in
   constructing the image of the Brigadier by means of the military,
   artistic and intellectual influence he played throughout his life,
   besides reiterating the time he lived among indigenous peoples. We also
   verify in the portrayal of the feminine figure the ideals of religion
   and fatherland, pillars of his identity construction. Thus, we seek to
   cross-reference data characteristic of the sculptor's artistic work,
   influenced by the principles of Art Nouveau, like the brigadier's life,
   in such a way to understand the meaning of the art present in the tomb,
   then fundamentally understood as a synthesis of the identity of the
   buried Couto de Magalhaes.}},

Journal = {{POLYMER TESTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{A reactive extrusion-calendering process was used in order to
   manufacture sheets with a nominal thickness of 1 mm of poly(lactic acid)
   and its nanocomposite with 2.5\% of an organo-modified montmorillonite.
   During processing, the properties of the melt were stabilized and
   enhanced by the addition of 0.5\% of a styrene-acrylic
   multi-functional-epoxide oligomeric reactive agent. The general
   analytical equation has been used in order to evaluate the kinetic
   parameters of the thermal degradation of poly(lactic acid) obtained by
   reactive extrusion and its nanocomposite. Various empirical and
   theoretical solid-state mechanisms have been tested to elucidate the
   best kinetic model. In order to reach this goal, master plots have been
   constructed by means of standardized conversion functions. Given that it
   is not always easy to visualize the best accordance between experimental
   and theoretical values of standardized conversion functions, a new index
   has been developed to quantitatively discern the best mechanism. By
   doing that, it has been possible to determine the right activation
   energy of the thermal degradation. It has been demonstrated that the
   best theoretical mechanism was the random scission of macromolecular
   chains within the polymer matrix. This was also in accordance with an
   empirical kinetic model based on an autocatalytic kinetic model. The
   presence of montmorillonite nanoparticles has been beneficial and has
   enhanced the thermal stability of poly(lactic acid). (C) 2015 Elsevier

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Hypoventilation is a defining feature of Rapid-onset Obesity with
   Hypothalamic dysfunction, Hypoventilation and Autonomic Dysregulation
   (ROHHAD), a rare respiratory and autonomic disorder. This chronic
   hypoventilation has been explained as the result of dysfunctional
   chemosensory control circuits, possibly affecting peripheral afferent
   input, central integration, or efferent motor control. However,
   chemosensory function has never been quantified in a cohort of ROHHAD
   patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the
   response to awake ventilatory challenge testing in children and
   adolescents with ROHHAD. The ventilatory, cardiovascular and
   cerebrovascular responses in 25 distinct comprehensive physiological
   recordings from seven unique ROHHAD patients to three different gas
   mixtures were analyzed at breath-to-breath and beat-to-beat resolution
   as absolute measures, as change from baseline, or with derived metrics.
   Physiologic measures were recorded during a 3-min baseline period of
   room air, a 3-min gas exposure (of 100\% O-2; 95\% O-2, 5\% CO2; or 14\%
   O-2, 7\% CO2 balanced with N-2), and a 3-min recovery period. An
   additional hypoxic challenge was conducted which consisted of either
   five or seven tidal breaths of 100\% N-2. While ROHHAD cases showed a
   diminished V-T and inspiratory drive response to hypoxic hypercapnia and
   absent behavioral awareness of the physiologic compromise, most
   ventilatory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular measures were similar
   to those of previously published controls using an identical protocol,
   suggesting a mild chemosensory deficit. Nonetheless, the high mortality
   rate, comorbidity and physiological fragility of patients with ROHHAD
   demand continued clinical vigilance. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We approach the problems of measuring the dimensionality of welfare and
   that of identifying the multidimensionally poor, by first finding the
   poor using the original space of attributes, and then reducing the
   welfare space. The starting point is the notion that the ``poor{''}
   constitutes a group of individuals that are essentially different from
   the ``non-poor{''} in a truly multidimensional framework. Once this

Abstract = {{The Campo River basin is located on the third plateau of the Parana
   State or trap plateau of Parana, at the middle portion between the
   rivers Ivai and Piquiri, southern Brazil, between the coordinates 23
   degrees 53 and 24 degrees 10' South Latitude and 52 degrees 15' and 52
   degrees 31' West Longitude. The basin has 384 Km(2) area, being 247
   km(2) in the municipality of Campo Mourao and 137 km(2) in the
   municipality of Peabiru, in Parana State. The Campo River is a left bank
   tributary of the Mourao River, which flows into the Ivai River. The
   objective of this study was to monitor water quality in the Km 119 River
   and the Campo River, tributaries of the Mourao River, with monthly
   collection of water samples to determine pH, temperature, turbidity,
   biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, fecal coliforms, total
   solids, total nitrogen, ammoniacal nitrogen, nitrite, nitrate and total
   phosphorus. The results obtained were compared with the indices
   established by the environmental legislation and applied in the
   determination of the Water Quality Index (WQI) used by the Water
   Institute of Parana State, regulating environmental agency. Poor water
   quality in these rivers presents a worrying scenario for the region,
   since this river is the main source of water supply for the public
   system. Results of organic matter, fecal coliforms and total phosphorus
   were higher than the limits established by Resolution CONAMA 357/2005 to
   river class 2, specially at downstream of the Km 119 River and the Campo
   River, due to the significant influence of the urban anthropic activity
   by the lack of tertiary treatment and also rural by the lack of basic
   sanitation in this area. Results of WQI of Km 119 River and do Campo
   River indicated that water quality can be classified as average in 71\%
   and good in 29\% of the sites evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular risk modification in terms of comprehensive medical
   therapy (antithrombotic therapy, lipid-lowering therapy,
   antihypertensive medication) and lifestyle modification (healthy diet,
   regular exercise, weight loss, smoking cessation) is the cornerstone of
   secondary prevention. It is now clear that even in those undergoing PCI
   or bypass surgery, appropriate lifestyle modification and aggressive
   medical therapy are paramount for optimizing long-term outcomes.
   However, what has emerged from studies that examined the role of medical
   therapy in the context of coronary heart disease is that only similar to
   50\% of the patients in these studies are achieving target treatment
   goals for blood pressure, lipid and glycemic control. Non-adherence is
   thought to be a very large contributor to this problem; across all
   health-care categories, non-adherence is estimated to account for \$290
   billion of annual health-care expenditure in the United States and
   (sic)1.25 billion in European Union, with poor adherence to CVD
   medication accounting for 9\% of all European CVD events. Socioeconomic
   factors may have a role in patients' discontinuing their medications,
   and a major initiative to combat this problem is the increasing focus on
   the polypill. The idea of combining numerous medications into a single
   tablet to reduce CV risk was first proposed more than a decade ago. This
   combined formulation not only significantly enhances patient convenience
   and adherence but also drives savings for the healthcare systems.
   Several randomized clinical trials have consistently demonstrated the
   effects of polypills on CV risk factors and adherence, and major trials
   are underway to study the effect on hard clinical outcomes. (C) 2015

Title = {{A Comparison of Line-transect Distance Sampling Methods for Estimating
   Gopher Tortoise Population Densities}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{804-812}},

Abstract = {{Line-transect distance sampling (LTDS) is increasingly used to estimate
   gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) densities. The process requires
   detecting tortoise burrows, and then determining occupancy. We compared
   3 LTDS approaches that differ in how burrow detection and occupancy data
   are integrated, and 2 search strategies. Surveys were conducted at Avon
   Park Air Force Range in South-central Florida, USA, from April through
   October 2009. These include 1) LTDS using data from occupied burrows
   only; 2) LTDS with burrows treated as ``clusters{''} of size 1 or 0
   depending on occupancy; 3) LTDS to estimate burrow densities, with
   occupancy modeling to estimate occupancy rates; and 4) 2 search
   strategies: standard versus expanded searches. The LTDS method produced
   reliable burrow density estimates, and tortoise densities were estimated
   most precisely and with least effort using data from occupied burrows
   only. However, any method could be biased if burrow occupancy is
   uncertain. Indeed, in the Florida scrub and pine flatwoods habitats,
   video-camera scoping was hindered by groundwater or obstructions,
   resulting in undetermined occupancy for 45\% of burrows. Improving scope
   technologies and surveying during the dry season has improved subsequent
   results for xeric habitats; however, research is needed to improve
   detectability of tortoises in mesic habitats with flooded burrows. If
   occupancy is uncertain, we recommend collecting data on all burrows,
   irrespective of occupancy, so that burrow densities can be estimated
   even if occupancy cannot. We do not recommend expanding the search area
   with sigmoid search paths adjacent to transects owing to potential
   violations of assumptions, nor use of occupancy modeling, because model
   requirements may lead to unacceptable exclusion of data. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{From 1640 to 1669, Madeleine de Scudery published epic novels that
   encountred great success. Her characters and imaginary castles were
   inspired by contemporary figures and private mansions. She exaggerated
   their beauty by insisting on the use of precious materials and elements
   repeatd infinitly, such as columns, porticos, fountains... It is
   striking to notice that some particularities of her imaginary castles
   and gardens actually infuenced the architecture of the initial
   Versailles ``maison de plaisance{''}. In Scudery's 1669 text, the castle
   appears as a place where realty passed beyond fiction and Louis XIV is
   portrayed as a novel's magician hero. Thirteen years later, Versailles
   became the official french Monarchy palace. Consequently, in 1684,
   Scudery described it as a unique castle and presented Louis XIV as the
   true ideal monarch. Notwithstanding, successive generations of writers
   did not use her ``novel mode{''} style and opted for more historical and
   rigorous descriptions: reality did not need fiction any more.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of silver-based catalysts in the simultaneous removal of
   particulate matter (soot) and NO is investigated in this work and
   compared with that of a model Pt-Ba/Al2O3 catalyst. The Ag (5 wt\%) - Ba
   (10 wt\%)/MO (MO = CeO2, ZrO2, Al2O3) and Ag (5 wt\%) - Sr (10
   wt\%)/CeO2 catalysts have been prepared by incipient wetness
   impregnation and characterized by BET, XRD, HRTEM, XPS and
   temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments. The behavior of the
   catalyst in the soot combustion (under loose conditions) and NO removal
   has been separately analyzed by means of temperature programmed
   oxidation (TPO) and isothermal concentration step change (ICSC)
   experiments, respectively. The results show that all the catalysts are
   active in soot combustion with a significant decrease of oxidation onset
   temperature compared to uncatalyzed soot oxidation. The removal of NO in
   the absence and in the presence of soot was investigated under cycling
   conditions, i.e. alternating lean-rich phases according to the LNT
   strategy. It has been found that the Ag-based samples are able to
   simultaneously remove soot and NOR. In particular, comparing the
   behavior of the prepared catalysts, the Ba-containing systems showed
   higher NO storage capacity than Sr-catalyst; also, the nitrogen
   selectivity increased even if resulted lower than the traditional LNT
   Pt-based catalyst. A detrimental effect of soot on the NO storage
   activity has been also observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses the short-term scheduling problem involved in the
   selection of a subset of elective surgeries from a large waiting list.
   In order to overcome the combinatorial complexity, a decomposition
   algorithm is proposed that relies on two continuous-time Generalized
   Disjunctive Programming (GDP) models. More specifically, there is an
   upper-level planning model to select surgical assignments to operating
   rooms and a lower-level constrained scheduling model to synchronize
   surgeons operating in different rooms on a given day. The GDP models are
   reformulated using standard convex hull and big-M techniques so as to
   generate the most efficient set of integer or mixed-integer linear
   programming constraints. Through the solution of a set of real-life
   instances from the literature, we show that the new algorithm
   outperforms a full-space discrete-time formulation and a genetic
   algorithm, improving the total surgical time as well as the number of
   performed surgeries by 5\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Energy Filtered Transmission Electron Microscopy (EFTEM) is an
   analytical tool that has been successfully and widely employed in the
   last two decades for obtaining fast elemental maps in TEM mode. Several
   studies and efforts have been addressed to investigate limitations and
   advantages of such technique, as well as to improve the spatial
   resolution of compositional maps. Usually, EFTEM maps undergo
   post-acquisition treatments by changing brightness and contrast levels,
   either via dedicated software or via human elaboration, in order to
   maximize their signal-to-noise ratio and render them as visible as
   possible. However, elemental maps forming a single set of EFTEM images
   are usually subjected to independent map-by-map image treatment. This
   post-acquisition step becomes crucial when analyzing materials that
   change composition over time as a consequence of an external stimulus,
   because the map-by-map approach doesn't take into account how the
   chemical features of the imaged materials actually progress, in
   particular when the investigated elements exhibit very low signals. In
   this article, we present a facile procedure applicable to whole sets of
   EFTEM maps acquired on a sample that is evolving over time. The main aim
   is to find a common method to treat the images features, in order to
   make them as comparable as possible without affecting the information
   there contained. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Study Objective: To assess whether the use of intraoperative opioids is
   associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival
   (OS) after lung cancer surgery.
   Design: Retrospective study.
   Setting: Academic hospital.
   Subjects: Patients with laryngeal primary or recurrent laryngeal
   squamous cell carcinoma who had surgery.
   Interventions: Intravenous opioids (remifentanil, fentanyl, sufentanil,
   and hydromorphone).
   Measurements: Univariate and multicovariate Cox proportional hazards
   models were applied to assess the effects of covariates of interest on
   OS and RFS.
   Main Results: A total of 195 patients were included. All received
   opioids intraoperatively. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that
   age (hazard ratio {[}HR], 1.03; P = .005), negative margin status (HR,
   0.163; P = .001], postoperative chemotherapy (HR, 7.38; P < .001), and
   concurrent chemotherapy and radiation (HR, 3.11; P < .001) treatment and
   fentanyl equivalent use (HR, 1.001; P = .02) were all predictor factors
   for 3- and 5-year RFS. The same variables were predictor factors for OS
   (age: HR, 1.03 {[}P=.003]; negative margin status: HR, 0.14 {[}P =
   .001]; postoperative chemotherapy: HR, 4 {[}P < .0001]; and fentanyl
   equivalent use: HR, 1.001 {[}P = .02]).
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates a very weak association between the
   use of intraoperative opioids and cancer recurrence after laryngeal
   squamous cell carcinoma surgery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Truly foldable flexible electronic components require a foldable
   substrate modified with a conducting material that can retain its
   electrical conductivity and mechanical integrity even after hard
   mechanical manipulations and multiple folding events. Here, such a
   material exploiting the combination of all-biodegradable components
   (substrate and the polymer matrix) and graphene nanoplatelets is
   designed and fabricated. A commercially available thermoplastic
   starch-based polymer (Mater-Bi) and graphene nanoplatelets are
   simultaneously dispersed in an organic solvent to formulate conductive
   inks. The inks are spray painted on pure cellulose sheets and
   hot-pressed into their fiber network after drying. The resultant
   nanostructured flexible composites display excellent isotropic
   electrical conductivity, reaching very low sheet resistance value
   approximate to 10 Omega sq(-1), depending on the relative concentration
   between the biopolymer and the graphene nanoplatelets. Transmission
   electron microscopy results indicated that during hot-pressing, graphene
   nanoplatelets are physically embedded into the cellulose fibers,
   resulting in high electrical conductivity of the flexible composite. The
   paper-like flexible conductors can withstand many severe folding events,
   maintaining their mechanical and electrical properties and showing only
   a slight decrease of their electrical conductivity with respect to the
   unfolded counterparts. Unlike conductive paper technologies, the
   proposed paper-like flexible conductors demonstrate both sides isotropic
   conductivity due to pressure-induced impregnation.}},

Abstract = {{Matricide is one of the rarest of reported murders and has always been
   considered one of the most abhorrent crimes. Psychiatric investigations
   as to why a son might murder his mother yield indications of a high rate
   of mental illness, primarily psychotic disorders, in perpetrators. In an
   attempt to gain an in-depth understanding of the role of the mother-son
   bond in the etiology of matricide by mentally disordered sons, this
   article presents a qualitative study of nine cases of matricide examined
   at two Italian Forensic Psychiatry Departments between 2005 and 2010 and
   retrospective analysis of forensic psychiatry reports on the offenders.
   Most matricides suffered from psychotic disorders, especially
   schizophrenia. Nevertheless, not all the perpetrators had psychotic
   symptoms at the time of the crime. A pathologic mother-son bond was
   found in all cases. However, mental illness is not the only variable
   related to matricide and, taken alone, is not enough to explain the
   crime. Several factors in the history of the mother and son need to be
   probed, especially how their relationship developed over the years. The
   peculiar dynamics of the mother-son relationship and the unique
   personalities and life experiences of both subjects are the real key to
   cases of matricide.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few years, the convincing forward steps in the development
   of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabling solutions are spurring the advent
   of novel and fascinating applications. Among others, mainly radio
   frequency identification (RFID), wireless sensor network (WSN), and
   smart mobile technologies are leading this evolutionary trend. In the
   wake of this tendency, this paper proposes a novel, IoT-aware, smart
   architecture for automatic monitoring and tracking of patients,
   personnel, and biomedical devices within hospitals and nursing
   institutes. Staying true to the IoT vision, we propose a smart hospital
   system (SHS), which relies on different, yet complementary,
   technologies, specifically RFID, WSN, and smart mobile, interoperating
   with each other through a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)/IPv6
   over low-power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/representational
   state transfer (REST) network infrastructure. The SHS is able to
   collect, in real time, both environmental conditions and patients'
   physiological parameters via an ultra-low-power hybrid sensing network
   (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities.
   Sensed data are delivered to a control center where an advanced
   monitoring application (MA) makes them easily accessible by both local
   and remote users via a REST web service. The simple proof of concept
   implemented to validate the proposed SHS has highlighted a number of key
   capabilities and aspects of novelty, which represent a significant step
   forward compared to the actual state of the art.}},

   creatinine and alkaline phosphatase levels were determined.
   ResultsThere were significant differences between test and control
   groups in ethnicity, gender and educational level (p<0.05). Patients
   with periodontitis showed a lower mean creatinine level (p<0.05) and
   higher mean alkaline phosphatase level (p<0.001) than the control group.
   There were significant correlations between periodontal parameters and
   serum creatinine and alkaline phosphatase levels.
   ConclusionSevere chronic periodontitis was associated to lower
   creatinine and higher alkaline phosphatase levels.}},

Abstract = {{SETTINGS: The new Anyplex (TM) II MTB/MDR/XDR PCR assay enables the
   joint analysis of mutations conferring resistance to first- and
   second-line antituberculosis drugs and the detection of Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis.
   OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of the new Anyplex assay in
   detecting mutations that confer resistance to first- and second-line
   drugs in M. tuberculosis cultures.
   DESIGN: Results obtained using the new technique were compared with
   those obtained by phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) and with
   two GenoType (R) tests for the detection of mutations: GenoType
   MTBDRp/us and GenoType (R) MTBDRsl.
   RESULTS: For rifampicin resistance mutations, Anyplex displayed 97\%
   sensitivity and 100\% specificity compared with 100\% and 100\% for
   MTBDRp/us. For isoniazid (INH) resistance, Anyplex displayed 61\%
   sensitivity and 98\% specificity compared with 62\% and 98\% for
   MTBDRplus. For second-line drugs, Anyplex recorded 95\% sensitivity and
   99\% specificity in the detection of resistance to quinolones compared
   with 100\% and 98\% for the MTBDRsl. While both techniques displayed
   100\% specificity for aminoglycoside resistance mutations, sensitivity
   was 100\% for Anyplex and 88\% for MTBDRsl.
   CONCLUSIONS: Results obtained using Anyplex agreed strongly with those
   obtained using the two GenoType molecular techniques and with phenotypic
   DST, except in the case of INH, due to the large number of genes
   involved in resistance to this drug.}},

   Adoption: A Case Study of a Large Owner Organization}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Building information modeling (BIM) has been presented as a potential
   solution to current facilities management problems related to
   information exchange during handover, and facilities information
   management during operations. However, implementing BIM in an owner
   organization is a complex challenge that necessitates reconfiguration of
   work practices and internal structures to fully realize the benefits.
   Owners are often unsure about how or whether they should go through the
   challenges related to implementation. Although previous studies have
   documented the potential benefits of BIM adoption for owners, such as
   improvements in work order processing, very little research has
   specifically looked at the transition to BIM and the scale of the effort
   required for large and diverse owner organizations. This paper presents
   the results of a long-term embedded case study analysis of a large
   owner-operator institutional organization that investigated the
   alignment of facility management (FM) practices across organizational
   and project contexts. The research objective was to examine current
   organizational practices in order to understand the potential, as well
   as the challenges, of transitioning from a paper-based to a model-based
   approach in handover and operations. We describe the current state of
   handover, information management and facility management practices and
   developed a framework to characterize the alignment between
   organizational constructs, available technology, project artifacts and
   owner requirements. This investigation of the current state of practice
   enables us to understand the gap between available and required
   information, processes and technology, and to better understand the
   enormous challenges owners face when considering the transition to BIM.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The search of HIV infected patients guided by indicator
   conditions (IC) is a strategy used to increase the early detection of
   HIV. The objective is to analyze whether a collaboration to raise
   awareness of the importance of early detection of HIV in 3 primary care
   centers influenced the proportion of HIV serology requested.
   Methods: Multicenter retrospective study was conducted comparing the
   baseline and a post-collaboration period. The collaboration consisted of
   training sessions and participation in the HIDES study (years 20092010).
   Patients between 18 and 64 years old with newly diagnosed herpes zoster,
   seborrheic eczema, mononucleosis syndrome, and
   leucopenia/thrombocytopenia in 3 primary care centers in 2008 (baseline
   period) and 2012 (post-collaboration period). The sociodemographic
   variables, HIV risk conditions, requests for HIV serology, and outcomes
   were evaluated.
   Results: A total of 1,219 ICs were included (558 in 2008 and 661 in
   2012). In 2008 the number of HIV tests in patients with an IC was 3.9\%,
   and rose to 11.8\% in 2012 (P < .0001). The HIV infection rate was 2.2\%
   (95\% CI: 0.4-7.3) (n = 2). It was estimated that 25 new cases (12 in
   2008 and 13 in 2012) would have been diagnosed if they had performed the
   test on all patients with IC. Predictors of HIV request were, having an
   IC in 2012, a younger age, having an mononucleosis syndrome, and not
   being Spanish.
   Conclusions: The HIV request demand tripled, after the collaboration
   with primary care centers, however in 88\% the test was not requested,
   resulting in diagnostic losses. New strategies are needed to raise
   awareness of the importance of early detection of HIV. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Many aspects of online social networks (OSN) have been studied in recent
   years. In this article, we focus on the question of interactions in
   large OSN. We propose methods to study these interactions, and apply
   them on a platform called Nico Nico Douga (NND), with the aim of
   understanding cooperative behaviors, taking the form of collective
   creation of music videos in NND. Our first contribution is a method
   that, starting from the network of interactions between users, evaluates
   three aspects: the impact of the social structure on these interactions,
   their concentration, and their reciprocity. We characterize the nature
   of interactions in NND, and compare it with four different datasets. We
   find that interactions in NND are more similar to a diffusion process,
   such as retweets in Tweeter, than to interpersonal communications, or
   even to cooperation in science. Our second contribution is a typology of
   roles for productions in a cooperative process. These roles are
   attributed based on the neighborhood of the nodes in the network of
   references between productions. We define direct roles, relative roles,
   and indirect roles. We subsequently study the frequency of these roles
   in NND. We show a correlation between the category of the contribution
   of a video (song, animation, etc.) and its probability of having a
   certain role. We also find a positive correlation between the most
   active users and the production of videos playing an important role in
   the cooperation process.}},

Abstract = {{To date, the preponderance of research on infertility in the United
   States has been conducted with affluent, White couples seeking advanced
   medical interventions. However, racial/ethnic minorities are equally, if
   not more, likely to experience infertility in the United States. Drawing
   on qualitative interviews with 50 African American women of different
   socioeconomic backgrounds, our study uses an intersectional framework to
   explore the experiences of African American women who cope with
   infertility. First, we found that experiencing infertility greatly
   impaired women's sense of self and gender identity. Moreover, the
   imperative to be an African American mother was influenced by an
   interplay of gendered, racial, and religious mandates. Second, women's
   relationships with friends and family members were characterized by a
   deep sense of silence and isolation; several explanations for this
   finding are proposed, including stereotypes about African American
   women's sexuality. Third, interactions with medical professionals were
   influenced by women's multiple social identities, with no single
   identity conferring an advantage in medical settings. Finally, we
   highlight several interventions, such as the dissemination of
   information featuring a greater range of African American women's
   reproductive experiences, and we underscore the clinical importance of
   normalizing African American women's experiences with infertility,
   thereby lessening women's sense of shame and isolation.}},

Abstract = {{In 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz announced they discovered 51
   Pegasi b, the first planet ever found around a star other than the Sun.
   This discovery turned out to be a milestone of recent astronomy, as it
   opened up a new field of research that is growing impressively these
   days. However, 51 Pegasi b has surprising properties as compared to the
   planets of the Solar System, as it is a giant planet on a very close-in
   orbit around its parent star. Hence, its discovery was unexpected and
   its actual existence did not go unchallenged. In the following years, a
   passionate debate sprang up, and finally astronomers accepted it, but at
   the price of a deep revision of our understanding of how planetary
   systems are formed and evolve. In the present paper, we reconstruct the
   dynamics of the discovery of 51 Pegasi b and the first exoplanets, the
   quarrel that arose among astronomers and the final acceptance of the
   existence of planets with unexpected characteristics. This remarkable
   story is recounted by means of published literature as well as
   interviews with several of its main protagonists.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{We investigate whether the positive relation between accounting accruals
   and information asymmetry documented for U.S. stock markets also holds
   for European markets, considered as-a whole and at the country level.
   This research is relevant because this relation is likely to be affected
   by differences in accounting standards used by companies for financial
   reporting, in the traditional use of the banking system or capital
   markets for firm financing, in legal systems and cultural environment.
   We find that in European stock markets discretionary accruals are
   positively related with the Corwin and Schultz high-low spread estimator
   used as a proxy for information asymmetry. Our results suggest that the
   earnings management component of accruals outweighs the informational
   component, but the significance of the relation varies across countries.
   Further, such association tends to be stronger for firms with the
   highest levels of positive discretionary accruals. Consistent with the
   evidence provided by the authors, our results also suggest that the
   high-low spread estimator is more efficient than the closing bid-ask
   spread when analysing the impact of information quality on information
   asymmetry.}},

   acid, total carotenoids and total phenolics in dried chili increased
   with increasing Na2S2O5 and citric acid concentrations. Antiradical
   activity of dried chili exhibited a high correlation with the amount of
   functional components. After storage, color parameters, ascorbic acid
   and total carotenoids of pretreated samples, especially with high

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Background Injury is the leading cause of death from birth to age 34 in
   Canada (Statistics Canada, 2008). In 2013, a national injury prevention
   organization in Canada initiated a research-practitioner collaboration
   to establish a framework for incorporating evidence in the
   organization's decision-making. In this study, we outline the
   development process and provide an overview of the framework.
   Methods The process of development of the evidence-synthesis framework
   included consultation with national and international injury prevention
   experts, a review of the research literature to identify existing models
   for incorporating research evidence into public health practice and
   extensive interactions with the organization's leadership and staff.
   Results A framework emphasizing four types of research evidence was
   recommended: (i) epidemiologic evidence describing the burden and cause
   of injury, (ii) evidence concerning the effectiveness of interventions,
   (iii) evidence on effective methods for implementing promising
   interventions at a population level, and (iv) evidence and theory from
   the behavioral sciences. Through the evidence-synthesis process the
   framework prioritizes highly synthesized evidence-based strategies and
   draws attention to important research gaps.
   Conclusions This study describes a novel opportunity to operationalize
   an organization's commitment to integrate evidence into practice. The
   framework provides guidance on how to use evidence strategically to
   maximize the potential impact of prevention efforts. Opportunities for
   further evaluation and dissemination are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Cryo-SEM is a high throughput technique for imaging biological
   ultrastructure in its most pristine state, i.e. without chemical
   fixation, embedding, or drying. Freeze fracture is routinely used to
   prepare internal surfaces for cryo-SEM imaging. However, the propagation
   of the fracture plane is highly dependent on sample properties, and the
   resulting surface frequently shows substantial topography, which can
   complicate image analysis and interpretation. We have developed a broad
   ion beam milling technique, called cryogenic triple ion gun milling
   (CiyoTIGM (TM) {[}'kr (i) over bar-(sic)-t (i) over barm]), for
   cryo-planing frozen-hydrated biological specimens. Comparing sample
   preparation by CryoTIGM (TM) and freeze fracture in three model systems,
   Baker's yeast, mouse liver tissue, and whole sea urchin embryos, we find
   that CryoTIGM (TM) yields very large (similar to 700,000 mu m(2)) and
   smooth sections that present ultrastructural details at similar or
   better quality than freeze-fractured samples. A particular strength of
   CryoTIGM (TM) is the ability to section samples with hard-soft contrast
   such as brittle calcite (CaCO3) spicules in the sea urchin embryo. (C)

Abstract = {{Aims and objectives. This study aimed to evaluate the level of care
   quality received by disabled older patients residing at home vs. those
   residing in institutions.
   Background. Taiwan has an aging society and faces issues of caring for
   disabled older patients, including increasing needs, insufficient
   resources and a higher economic burden of care.
   Design. Retrospective study extracting patient data from Taiwan's
   National Health Insurance database.
   Methods. We enrolled 76,672 disabled older patients aged 65 years and
   older who resided at home or institutions and had submitted claims for
   coverage of National Health Insurance for home care received for the
   first time between 2004-2006. Propensity score matching was applied to
   create a home-care group and an institutional-care group with 27,894
   patients each. Indicators of care quality (emergency services use,
   hospitalisation, infection, pressure ulcers, death) within the first
   year were observed.
   Results. The home care group had significantly higher emergency services
   use, fewer hospital admissions and fewer infections, but had
   significantly higher occurrence of pressure ulcers. The
   institutional-care group had significantly lower time intervals between
   emergencies, fewer deaths, lower risk of emergencies and lower pressure
   ulcer risk. Males had significantly higher emergency services use than
   females, and higher risk of hospital admission and death.
   Conclusions. Care quality indicators for elder care are significantly
   different between home care and institutional care. The quality of home
   care is associated with higher emergency services use and pressure ulcer
   development, and institutional care is associated with number of
   infections and hospitalisations.
   Relevance to clinical practice. Care quality indicators were
   significantly different between home-care and institutional-care groups
   and were closely associated with the characteristics of individual
   patients' in the specific settings. Nursing capabilities must be
   directed towards reducing unnecessary care quality-related events among
   high-risk disabled older patients.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate group medical visits using an
   integrative health approach for underserved women with chronic pelvic
   pain (CPP). We implemented an integrative medicine program to improve
   quality of life among women with CPP using Centering, a group-based
   model that combines healthcare assessment, education, and social
   support. Patients were from university-affiliated and public
   hospital-affiliated clinics. We evaluated the program with qualitative
   and quantitative data to address components of the RE-AIM framework:
   Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance.
   Participants of the Centering CPP Program participants (n = 26) were
   demographically similar to a sample of women with CPP who sought care at
   Bay Area hospitals (n = 701). Participants were on average 40 years of
   age, a majority of whom were racial/ethnic minorities with low household
   income (76\%). Women who attended four or more sessions (n = 16) had
   improved health-related quality of life, including decreases in average
   number of unhealthy days in the past month (from 24 to 18, p < .05),
   depressive symptoms (from 11.7 to 9.0, p < .05), and symptom severity
   (from 4.2 to 3.1, p < .01). Sexual health outcomes also improved (30.5
   to 50.3, p = .02). No improvements were observed for pain
   catastrophizing. Our pilot program provides preliminary data that an
   integrative health approach using a group-based model can be adapted and
   implemented to reach diverse women with CPP to improve physical and
   psychological well-being. Given these promising findings, rigorous
   evaluation of implementation and effectiveness of this approach compared
   with usual care is warranted. (C) 2015 by the American Society for Pain

Abstract = {{This study analysed femoral curvature in a population from Belgium in
   conjunction with other morphological characteristics by the use of
   three-dimensional (3D) quadric surfaces (QS) modelled from the bone
   surface.
   3D models were created from computed tomography data of 75 femoral
   modern human bones. Anatomical landmarks (ALs) were palpated in specific
   bony areas of the femur (shaft, condyles, neck and head). QS were then
   created from the surface vertices which enclose these ALs. The
   diaphyseal shaft was divided into five QS shapes to analyse curvature in
   different parts of the shaft.
   Femoral bending differs in different parts of the diaphyseal shaft. The
   greatest degree of curvature was found in the distal shaft (mean 4.5A
   degrees range 0.2A degrees-10A degrees) followed by the proximal (mean
   4.4A degrees range 1.5A degrees-10.2A degrees), proximal intermediate
   (mean 3.7A degrees range 0.9A degrees-7.9A degrees) and distal
   intermediate (mean 1.8A degrees range 0.2A degrees-5.6A degrees) shaft
   sections. The proximal and distal angles were significantly more bowed
   than the intermediate proximal and the intermediate distal angle. There
   was no significant difference between the proximal and distal angle. No
   significant correlations were found between morphological
   characteristics and femoral curvature. An extremely large variability of
   femoral curvature with several bones displaying very high or low degrees
   of femoral curvature was also found.
   3D QS fitting enables the creation of accurate models which can
   discriminate between different patterns in similar curvatures and
   demonstrates there is a clear difference between curvature in different
   parts of the shaft.}},

Abstract = {{Most algorithms for distributed averaging only guarantee asymptotic
   convergence. This paper introduces a distributed protocol that allows
   nodes to find the exact average of the initial values in a finite and
   minimum number of steps on interconnection topologies described by
   strongly connected directed graphs (digraphs). More specifically, under
   the assumption that each component has knowledge of the number of its
   outgoing links (i.e., the number of components to which it sends
   information), we show that the average value can be computed based on
   local observations over a finite time interval. The average can be
   obtained in a finite number of steps even when the information exchange
   is subject to delays. The proposed algorithm is the first in the
   literature that allows for distributed computation of the exact average
   in digraphs in finite time, with and without delays.}},

Abstract = {{Nostalgia, a theme that runs through Quebec literature, is generally
   associated with a certain conservatism. In the contemporary context of
   Marc Auge's ``surmodernite{''} (excessive modernity), however, this
   feeling takes on a new form that is particularly apparent in the work of
   Lise Tremblay. A detailed study of the novels La peche blanche and La
   danse juive, as well as the short story collection La heronniere, shows
   that nostalgia is not necessarily ``a sadness without an object{''}
   (Susan Stewart), an individual's sterile impetus toward a past that is
   both idealized and inaccessible. In Lise Tremblay's world, nostalgia is
   rather a desire for a transformed present, an impetus toward an ideal
   that would be supported by the community as a whole: it opens the doors
   of utopia.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperpolarizability of two electron atoms He, Li+, Be2+, B3+, and C4+
   embedded under quantum plasma environment has been calculated for the
   first time using exponential cosine screened coulomb potential (ECSCP)

   environment. Coupled Hartree-Fock theory within variational scheme has
   been utilised to estimate such nonlinear optical property for systematic
   variation of the screening parameter arising out of the coupling
   strength of the plasma with atomic charge cloud. Hyperpolarizability of
   the ions increases systematically with increase of the screening
   parameter. Results have been compared with respect to those obtained
   from the interaction of atomic systems with a Debye plasma environment
   giving rise to SCP. Interesting feature is observed for the
   polarizability and hyperpolarizability values under increasing screening
   parameters of ECSCP and SCP. Hyperpolarizability values for zero
   screening compare well with those available for the free ions. (C) 2015

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Observations of the venusian hydrogen corona on the nightside (8 PM
   local time) have been performed with SPICAV instrument on board Venus
   Express from 12 to 15 October 2011. These observations were associated
   with interplanetary observations obtained at apoapsis to subtract the
   interplanetary contribution. The observed brightness variation with
   altitude on the disk and above the limb shows that one part of the
   interplanetary emission is scattered out of the line of sight by the
   venusian hydrogen atoms above the CO2 absorption limb. The emission of
   the H corona beyond the cylindrical shadow is also scattered in the same
   way. Taking into account the geometry of the line of sight and this
   scattering in a radiative transfer model allows us to retrieve for the
   first time the vertical profile of the hydrogen density on the nightside
   of Venus from Lyman-alpha measurements. The derived cold hydrogen
   density at the exobase is similar to 40 times larger than the dayside
   hydrogen density derived by the same instrument, showing an evening
   bulge in agreement with in situ measurements of Pioneer Venus. The hot
   hydrogen density derived at the nightside is 5 times larger than the
   average dayside hot hydrogen density found previously with SPICAV/Venus
   Express. A decrease of the hot hydrogen content by a factor 2 is
   observed during these three days of observations. This decrease could be
   explained by a decrease of the hot hydrogen production rate on the
   nightside driven by a variation of the dayside ionosphere. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Nucleation mechanisms occurring during discontinuous dynamic
   recrystallization (DDRX) is investigated by Digital Image Correlation

   the columnar microstructure, discrimination of the nucleus can be done
   without ambiguity comparing pre- and post- deformation texture. In-situ
   DIC analyses are performed around a triple junction were nucleation
   occurred to follow strain field evolution. Strain field evolution
   appears strongly linked to nucleation mechanisms, local grain boundary
   migration and sub-grain boundary formation such as tilt sub-grain
   boundaries and kink bands. Nucleation processes are correlated with
   strong strain heterogeneities well characterized by the principal
   strains evaluated by DIC. It was possible to follow nucleus growth
   through the evolution of strain localization along the new grain
   boundaries. Kink bands act as a buffer zone close to the triple junction
   and accommodate shear parallel to the c-axis. The local strain field
   appears to be efficiently redistributed by recrystallization processes
   which create a new microstructure more compatible with the local

Abstract = {{Introduction: The aim of this study was to conduct a time-driven
   activity based costing (TDABC) analysis of the clinical pathway for
   total knee replacement (TKR) and to determine where the major cost
   drivers lay.
   Methods: The in-patient pathway was prospectively mapped utilising a
   TDABC model, following 20 TKRs. The mean age for these patients was 73.4
   years. All patients were ASA grade I or II and their mean BMI was 30.4.
   The 14 varus knees had a mean deformity of 5.32 degrees and the six
   valgus knee had a mean deformity of 10.83 degrees. Timings were
   prospectively collected as each patient was followed through the TKR
   pathway.
   Results: Pre-operative costs including pre-assessment and joint school
   were 163 pound. Total staff costs for admission and the operating
   theatre were 658 pound. Consumables cost for the operating theatre were
   1862 pound. The average length of stay was 5.25 days at a total cost of
   910 pound. Trust overheads contributed 1651 pound. The overall
   institutional cost of a `noncomplex' TKR in patients without substantial
   medical co-morbidities was estimated to be 5422 pound, representing a
   profit of 1065 pound based on a best practice tariff of 6487 pound.
   Conclusions: The major cost drivers in the TICR pathway were determined
   to be theatre consumables, corporate overheads, overall ward cost and
   operating theatre staffing costs. Appropriate discounting of implant
   costs, reduction in length of stay by adopting an enhanced recovery
   programme and control of corporate overheads through the use of elective
   orthopaedic treatment centres are proposed approaches for reducing the
   overall cost of treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Catalytic combustion over zeolite supported platinum catalysts is
   regarded as one of the efficient methods for removal of volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs). In this work, we show a preparation of Pt loaded
   mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolite (Pt/Meso-ZSM-5) with various cations. The
   sample N-2 sorption isotherms and TEM image show abundant mesoporosity
   existing in the zeolite crystals. The catalytic toluene combustion tests
   show that the Pt/Meso-ZSM-5 catalysts have higher activities than
   conventional ZSM-5 supported Pt-0 catalysts (Pt/ZSM-5), which is related
   to their difference in the concentration of active sites Pt and the rate
   of mass transfer. Particularly, after reduction with hydrogen at 300
   degrees C, the Pt nanoparticles supported on Meso-ZSM-5 with K+ and
   Cs+\textbackslash{} cations (Pt-R/Meso-KZSM-5 and Pt-R/Meso-CsZSM-5)
   exhibit much higher activities than those on Meso-ZSM-5 with Na+ and H+
   cations, which is well consistent with their order of the Pt-0
   concentration. For example, Pt-R/Meso-KZSM-5 gives the temperature for
   conversion of 98\% toluene (T-98) at only 175 degrees C, while
   Pt-R/Meso-HZSM-5 shows the T-98 at 190 degrees C. More importantly,
   Pt-R/Meso-KZSM-5 has a long life, and its activity cannot be influenced
   by the water and CO2. These features are critically important for
   practical applications of these catalysts in the future. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Cetuximab is a standard of care for treating EGFR-expressing metastatic
   colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) exclusive of those with KRAS mutations at
   codons 12/13. However, retrospective analysis has recently suggested
   that KRAS-G13D patients can still benefit, while only a fraction of KRAS
   wild-type patients can benefit, from the treatment. We set out to test
   this contradicting issue experimentally in an independent cohort of
   patient derived xenograft (PDX) diseases. We conducted a mouse clinical
   trial (MCT) enrolling a random cohort of 27 transcriptome sequenced
   CRC-PDXs to evaluate cetuximab activity. The treatment responses were
   analyzed against the KRAS 12/13 mutation alleles, as well as several
   other well-known oncogenic alleles. If the response is defined by >80\%
   tumor growth inhibition, 8/27 PDXs (similar to 30\%) are responders
   versus 19/27 non-/partial responders (similar to 70\%). We found that
   indeed there are no significantly fewer KRAS-12/13-allele responders
   (4/8 or 50\%) than non-/partial responders (7/19, or 37\%). In
   particular, there are actually no fewer G13D responders (4/8, or 50\%)
   than in non-/partial responders (2/19 or 10.5\%) statistically.
   Furthermore, majority of the non-/partial responders tend to have
   certain activating oncogenic alleles (one or more of the following
   common ones: K/N-RAS-G12V/D, -A146T, -Q61H/R, BRAF-V600E, AKT1-L52R and
   PIK3CA-E545G/K). Our data on an independent cohort support the recent
   clinical observation, but against the current practiced patient
   stratification in the cetuximab CRC treatment. Meanwhile, our data seem
   to suggest that a set of the six-oncogenic alleles may be of better
   predictive value than the current practiced stratification, justifying a
   new prospective clinical investigation on an independent cohort for
   confirmation.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the effect of forage:
   concentrate ratio (F:C) on growth performance, ruminal fermentation and
   blood metabolites of housing-feeding yaks. Thirty-two Maiwa male yaks
   (initial body weight = 207.99 +/- 3.31 kg) were randomly assigned to
   four dietary treatments (8 yaks per treatment). Experimental diets were:
   A, B, C, D which contained 70: 30, 60: 40, 50: 50 and 40: 60 F: C
   ratios, respectively. Dry matter intake and average daily gain in yaks
   fed the C and D diets were greater (p<0.05) than yaks fed the A and B
   diets. No differences were found in ruminal NH3-N, total volatile fatty
   acids, acetate, butyrate, valerate, and isovalerate concentrations. The
   propionate concentration was increased (p<0.05) in the C and D groups
   compared with the A and B diets. In contrast, the acetate to propionate
   ratio was decreased and was lowest (p<0.05) in the C group relative to
   the A and B diets, but was similar with the D group. For blood
   metabolites, no differences were found in serum concentrations of
   urea-N, albumin, triglyceride, cholesterol, low density lipoprotein,
   alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase (p>0.05) among
   treatments. Treatment C had a higher concentration of total protein and
   high density lipoprotein (p<0.05) than A and B groups. In addition,
   there was a trend that the globulin concentration of A group was lower
   than other treatments (p = 0.079). Results from this study suggest that
   increasing the level of concentrate from 30\% to 50\% exerted a positive
   effect on growth performance, rumen fermentation and blood metabolites
   in yaks.}},

Abstract = {{As a benefit of their inherent rateless nature, fountain codes
   constitute a favorable choice for protecting packet-based transmissions
   in the physical layer for wireless channels having varying quality.
   However, previous research has revealed that the performance of fountain
   codes substantially degrades as their block length is reduced. Three
   structural phenomena of the Tanner graph were identified by Mackay in
   the hard decoding of fountain codes on binary erasure channels (BECs),
   which may be referred to as having ``no degree-one check nodes
   (CNs),{''} ``no emerging degree-one CNs,{''} and `` uncovered variable
   nodes (VNs). ``In this paper, we explicitly analyzed how these
   structural phenomena influence their soft decoding algorithm.
   Furthermore, these phenomena are shown to be responsible for the high
   error floors when fountain codes are transmitted over noisy fading
   channels, particularly for the transmissions of short blocks. To
   eliminate the influence of these structural phenomena, we conceived a
   technique of generating a few specifically encoded bits with the aid of
   the associated Tanner graph. Simulation results have demonstrated that
   our improved Raptor (IRaptor) codes significantly reduce the packet loss
   ratio (PLR) of conventional fountain codes, despite imposing reduced low
   complexity. Finally, we conceive a novel adaptive hybrid automatic
   repeat request (HARQ) scheme based on a lookup table (LUT)-aided
   technique, which may adapt its coding rate for each transmission. Our
   simulation results demonstrated that the proposed IRaptor HARQ achieves
   a similar performance to the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) turbo-codedHARQ
   scheme or even outperforms the LTE arrangement for block length in
   excess of 1000 bits.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a new nomogram to predict the probability of a patient
   with 1-2 metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) to present further
   axillary disease.
   Data were collected from 480 patients who were diagnosed with 1-2
   positive lymph nodes and thus underwent axillary lymph node dissection
   between March 2005 and June 2011. Clinical and pathological features of
   the patients were assessed with multivariable logistic regression. The
   Shanghai Cancer Center Non-SLN nomogram (SCC-NSLN) was created from the
   logistic regression model. This new model was subsequently applied to
   481 patients from July 2011 to December 2013. The predictive accuracy of
   the SCC-NSLN nomogram was measured by calculating the area under the
   receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
   Based on the results of the univariate analysis, the variables that were
   significantly associated with the incidence of non-SLN metastasis in an
   SLN-positive patient included lymphovascular invasion, neural invasion,
   the number of positive SLNs, the number of negative SLNs, and the size
   of SLN metastasis (P < 0.05). Using multivariate analysis,
   lymphovascular invasion, the number of positive SLNs, the number of
   negative SLNs, and the size of SLN metastasis were identified as
   independent predictors of non-SLN metastasis. The SCC-NSLN nomogram was
   then developed using these four variables. The new model was accurate
   and discriminating on both the modeling and validation groups (AUC:
   0.7788 vs 0.7953). The false-negative rates of the SCC-NSLN nomogram
   were 3.54 and 9.29 \% for the predicted probability cut-off points of 10
   and 15 \% when applied to patients who have 1-2 positive SLNs.
   The SCC-NSLN nomogram could serve as an acceptable clinical tool in
   clinical discussions with patients. The omission of ALND might be
   possible if the probability of non-SLN involvement is < 10 and < 15 \%
   in accordance with the acceptable risk determined by medical staff and

Abstract = {{A wavelength converter between 1310 and 1550 nm bands is presented based
   on two-pump four-wave mixing (FWM) in a silicon waveguide. The principle
   of the inter-band wavelength conversion is analyzed. For an arbitrary
   incident signal, the converted idler wavelength can be freely assigned
   by suitably setting the two pump wavelengths to completely satisfy the
   phase-matching condition. Simulation results show that the signal can be
   flexibly converted between 1310 and 1550 bands. The conversion
   efficiencies for the signals with different wavelengths are very stable
   because the FWM phase-matching condition is completely met. Using this
   two-pump FWM configuration, channel-selective function can also be
   realized for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) signals by
   engineering the dispersion profile of the silicon waveguide according to
   the WDM channel spacing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Missing values and inconsistency of pairwise comparison matrices (PCM)
   in AHP are tackled with different methods in extant studies. In this
   article, we prove that connecting path method (CPM), which is a
   well-known approach of estimating missing judgments, also guarantees
   minimal geometric consistency index, and only involves elementary
   connecting paths by unraveling its connection with logarithmic least
   square method. The formal proofs suggest that CPM alone is sufficient to
   fix both missing judgments and inconsistency of PCM in AHP. Based on
   this well grounded merit, a procedure is proposed to improve consistency
   for incomplete PCM. The validity of the proposed procedure is
   illustrated by classical examples, and its advantages over other
   consistency improving approaches are also discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{The birefringence heterodyne interferometry for the angular measurement
   is presented. The advantage of the instrument is the large measurement
   range and high resolution. When p- and s-polarized beams pass through a
   birefringence crystal, the phase difference between these two polarized
   beams is sensitive to the incident angle. We can determine the angular
   variation with the heterodyne interferometer which can precisely detect
   the phase difference between these two polarized beams. Moreover, a new
   optical path is designed to enhance the sensitivity by means of a prism
   which combines the light to the birefringence crystal. There are two
   measurement modes in our system, a linear and a circular polarized mode.
   The experimental results show that the resolution of the linear
   polarized mode is 1.2 degrees x10(-4) and the resolution of the circular
   polarized mode is 3 degrees x10(-5).}},

Abstract = {{A reduced scale experiment has been conducted to investigate the icing
   accretion procedure on a rotating spinner of 60A degrees cone angle. The
   experiment was carried out in a small scale ice wind tunnel with three
   different rotating speeds of the spinner. The experimental conditions
   were determined from the actual icing condition of the spinner of a
   turbofan engine by using the similarity theory, which considers the
   rotating effects. The ice thickness on the spinner was got from the
   image taken by the high speed camera, by image processing. The results
   of this investigation show that under the experimental condition, ice on
   the spinner's tip of three different rotating speeds are all glaze ice
   and about the same thick. However, on the downstream surface of the
   spinner, ice shape on the rotating spinner is different from that on the
   stationary spinner. It is uneven glaze ice on the stationary spinner
   while it is `particle ice' when the rotating speed is 8240 rpm and it is
   `needle ice' when the rotating speed is 15,200 rpm. The experiment also
   reveals that when the rotating speed is higher, the ice layer is
   thicker.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Layer semiconductors with easily processed two-dimensional (2D)
   structures exhibit indirect-to-direct bandgap transitions and superior
   transistor performance, which suggest a new direction for the
   development of next-generation ultrathin and flexible photonic and
   electronic devices. Enhanced luminescence quantum efficiency has been
   widely observed in these atomically thin 2D crystals. However, dimension
   effects beyond quantum confinement thicknesses or even at the micrometer
   scale are not expected and have rarely been observed. In this study,
   molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) layer crystals with a thickness range of
   6-2,700 nm were fabricated as two-or four-terminal devices. Ohmic
   contact formation was successfully achieved by the focused-ion beam
   (FIB) deposition method using platinum (Pt) as a contact metal. Layer
   crystals with various thicknesses were prepared through simple
   mechanical exfoliation by using dicing tape. Current-voltage curve
   measurements were performed to determine the conductivity value of the
   layer nanocrystals. In addition, high-resolution transmission electron
   microscopy, selected-area electron diffractometry, and energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy were used to characterize the interface of the
   metal-semiconductor contact of the FIB-fabricated MoSe2 devices. After
   applying the approaches, the substantial thickness-dependent electrical
   conductivity in a wide thickness range for the MoSe2-layer semiconductor
   was observed. The conductivity increased by over two orders of magnitude
   from 4.6 to 1,500 Omega(-1) cm(-1), with a decrease in the thickness
   from 2,700 to 6 nm. In addition, the temperature-dependent conductivity
   indicated that the thin MoSe2 multilayers exhibited considerably weak
   semiconducting behavior with activation energies of 3.5-8.5 meV, which
   are considerably smaller than those (36-38 meV) of the bulk. Probable
   surface-dominant transport properties and the presence of a high surface
   electron concentration in MoSe2 are proposed. Similar results can be
   obtained for other layer semiconductor materials such as MoS2 and WS2.}},

Abstract = {{A software-defined radio receiver that is suitable for intra-band

   selectivity is enhanced by the combination of the passive mixer and a

   front-end. Current domain complex signal processing is explored to
   select and separate multiple channels concurrently. The receiver
   contains a variety of functional building blocks that can be connected
   in different ways to form various architectures. The fine-grained
   programmability of component parameters and reconfigurability of
   receiver schemes enable optimum performance under varying signal and
   blocker scenarios. A proof-of-concept CMOS chip fabricated in a 65 nm
   CMOS technology is presented that supports up to three-channel
   aggregation. The receiver operates at any frequency between 0.5 to 3
   GHz. The frequency separation between the concurrent RF channels can be
   tuned anywhere between 0 to +100 MHz. The concurrent receiver scheme can
   also be explored to reject large near-band blockers for high dynamic

Abstract = {{Background Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a histone/protein deacetylase, has been
   implicated in aging, metabolism, and stress resistance. SIRT1 regulates
   endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase, restores NO availability, and is
   involved in different aspects of cardiovascular disease. The aim of this
   study was to evaluate any abnormalities with regard to SIRT1 protein
   level in the blood, SIRT1 activity, and impaired endothelial function in
   patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We also
   investigated whether or not OSAS patients who received nasal continuous
   positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment showed improvements in the
   levels of SIRT1.
   Methods Thirty-five patients with moderately severe to severe OSAS who
   requested nasal CPAP treatment and 20 healthy controls were
   prospectively enrolled. The SIRT1 protein levels in blood and its
   activity, and the serum levels of nitric oxide derivative (NO (x) ) were
   assessed. All subjects participated in sleep studies, which were
   repeated 3 months after nasal CPAP treatment in the patients with OSAS.
   Results In the patients with OSAS, the level of SIRT1 in the blood, its
   activity, and that of NO (x) was lower than those of normal subjects
   before nasal CPAP treatment. After nasal CPAP treatment, the level of
   SIRT1 in the blood and its activity increased from 0.55 +/- 0.32 pg/mu g
   of total protein and 3085.53 +/- 1071.57 arbitrary fluorescence units
   (AFUs)/mu g of total protein to 1.13 +/- 0.43 pg/mu g of total protein
   and 5344.65 +/- 1579.71 AFUs/mu g of total protein. The serum levels of
   NO (x) in the patients with OSAS increased from 16.36 +/- 5.78 to 25.94
   +/- 5.17 A mu M.
   Conclusions Successful treatment for OSAS with nasal CPAP can restore
   blood levels of the SIRT1 protein and its activity and serum levels of
   NO (x) .}},

Abstract = {{A series of cellulose 3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamates (CDMPCs) with
   different degrees of substitution (DS) and degrees of polymerization
   (DP) were homogeneously synthesized in 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium
   chloride (AmimCl). Then, the CDMPCs were coated on silica gel and used
   as chiral stationary phases (CSPs), and their chiral recognition
   abilities for seven racemates were evaluated by high performance liquid
   chromatography. The results showed that DS and DP of CDMPCs had a great
   influence on chiral recognition abilities of the CSPs. The CSPs with the
   DS approximate to 1 gives a low chiral recognition to most racemates. On
   the contrast, the CSPs with the DS >= 2 exhibited high chiral separation
   abilities. For example, six racemates could be separated on the CSP with
   CDMPC of DS approximate to 2 (CSP-2). Especially, for the
   enantioseparation of 1-(2-naphthyl) ethanol and Troger's base, CSP-2
   gave the highest separation ability in all of CSPs. On the other hand,
   when the DP of cellulose was in a range from 39 to 220, the chiral
   separation abilities of CDMPCs increased as the DP increased. This work
   demonstrates that the structure of cellulose esters such as DS and DP
   has important effect on their chiral separation ability, and therefore
   provides a practical method to design and prepare desirable CSPs for
   different racemates.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the effects of polymer matrixes on the competition
   between energy and electron transfer, a covalently linked
   pyrene-perylenediimide dyad (PDI-PY) has been prepared. Competition
   between the energy and electron transfer from PY to PDI within PDI-PY is
   revealed by steady state absorption and fluorescence spectra, as well as
   time resolved fluorescence spectra. Polar solvents accelerate the
   electron transfer while non-polar solvents favor the energy transfer.
   When PDI-PY is embedded in a non-polar polymer matrix, the energy
   transfer becomes the only photoinduced process between PY and PDI,
   whereas the electron transfer is almost completely hindered. In a polar
   polymer matrix, the energy transfer is still a dominating process, but
   with a remarkably decreased efficiency. The electron transfer in a polar
   polymer matrix is much slower and less efficient with respect to that in
   solutions, but faster and more efficient than that in non-polar polymer
   matrixes. This result suggests that polymer matrixes are ideal
   environment for constructing light harvesting systems, which in some
   case can reduce the disturbance from electron transfer. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Myocardial infarction (MI) causes myocardial necrosis, triggers chronic
   inflammatory responses, and leads to pathological remodeling. Controlled
   delivery of a combination of angiogenic and immunoregulatory proteins
   may be a promising therapeutic approach for MI. We investigated the
   bioactivity and therapeutic potential of an injectable, heparin-based
   coacervate co-delivering an angiogenic factor, fibroblast growth
   factor-2 (FGF2), and an anti-inflammatory cytokine, Interleukin-10
   (IL-10) in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. Coacervate
   delivery of FGF2 and IL-10 preserved their bioactivities on cardiac
   stromal cell proliferation in vitro. Upon intramyocardial injection into
   a mouse MI model, echocardiography revealed that FGF2/IL-10 coacervate
   treated groups showed significantly improved long-term LV contractile
   function and ameliorated LV dilatation. FGF2/IL-10 coacervate
   substantially augmented LV myocardial elasticity. Additionally,
   FGF2/IL-10 coacervate notably enhanced long-term revascularization,
   especially at the infarct area. In addition, coacervate loaded with 500
   ng FGF2 and 500 ng IL-10 significantly reduced LV fibrosis, considerably
   preserved infarct wall thickness, and markedly inhibited chronic
   inflammation at the infarct area. These results indicate that FGF2/IL-10
   coacervate has notably greater therapeutic potential than coacervate
   containing only FGF2. Overall, our data suggest therapeutically
   synergistic effects of FGF-2/IL-10 coacervate, particularly coacervate
   with FGF2 and 500 ng IL-10, for the treatment of ischemic heart disease.

Journal = {{BRAIN AND COGNITION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{64-72}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aging has been associated with declines in sensory-perceptual processes.
   Sensory gating (SG), or repetition suppression, refers to the
   attenuation of neural activity in response to a second stimulus and is
   considered to be an automatic process to inhibit redundant sensory
   inputs. It is controversial whether SG deficits, as tested with an
   auditory paired-stimulus protocol, accompany normal aging in humans. To
   reconcile the debates arising from event-related potential studies, we
   recorded auditory neuromagnetic reactivity in 20 young and 19 elderly
   adult men and determined the neural activation by using minimum-norm
   estimate (MNE) source modeling. SG of M100 was calculated by the ratio
   of the response to the second stimulus over that to the first stimulus.
   MNE results revealed that fronto-temporo-parietal networks were
   implicated in the M100 SG. Compared to the younger participants, the
   elderly showed selectively increased SG ratios in the anterior superior
   temporal gyrus, anterior middle temporal gyrus, temporal pole and
   orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting an insufficient age-related gating to
   repetitive auditory stimulation. These findings also highlight the loss
   of frontal inhibition of the auditory cortex in normal aging. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Radiotherapy is widely applied for treatment of esophageal squamous cell
   carcinoma (ESCC). The Rad51-related protein XRCC3 plays roles in the
   recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks to maintain
   chromosome stability and repair DNA damage. The present study aimed to
   investigate the effect of XRCC3 on the radiotherapy response of ESCC and
   the underlying mechanisms of the roles of XRCC3 in ESCC
   radiosensitivity. XRCC3 expression in ESCC cells and tissues was higher
   than that in normal esophageal epithelial cells and corresponding
   adjacent noncancerous esophageal tissue. High XRCC3 expression was
   positively correlated with resistance to chemoradiotherapy in ESCC and
   an independent predictor for short disease-specific survival of ESCC
   patients. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy in vitro
   and in vivo was substantially increased by knockdown of XRCC3 in ESCC
   cells. Ectopic overexpression of XRCC3 in both XRCC3-silenced ESCC cells
   dramatically enhanced ESCC cells' resistance to radiotherapy. Moreover,
   radiation resistance conferred by XRCC3 was attributed to enhancement of
   homologous recombination, maintenance of telomere stability, and a
   reduction of ESCC cell death by radiation-induced apoptosis and mitotic
   catastrophe. Our data suggest that XRCC3 protects ESCC cells from
   ionizing radiation-induced death by promoting DNA damage repair and/or
   enhancing telomere stability. XRCC3 may be a novel radiosensitivity
   predictor and promising therapeutic target for ESCC.}},

Abstract = {{Seed reserve utilization is an important characteristic of seed quality.
   In this study, the rice varieties Jiucaiqing (Oryza sativa ssp.
   japonica) and IR26 (Oryza sativa ssp. indica) and their recombinant
   inbred lines were used to determine the physiological and genetic
   control of seed reserve utilization during the early seedling growth.
   Seedling dry weight and weight of mobilized seed reserve increased with
   seed germination, while seed reserve utilization efficiency decreased
   after the first rise. The early seedling growth is firstly determined by
   the mobilization of storage reserve followed by the conversion
   efficiency of utilized seed reserve into seedling tissues. The major
   soluble sugars in grains were fructose and glucose, while fructose in
   shoots and roots. Glucose content in grains and fructose in shoots and
   roots slightly decreased after the first rise with seed germination,
   while fructose content in grains increased and sucrose content in
   grains, shoots, and roots changed slightly. Seed reserve utilization was
   significantly and positively correlated with sugar contents. Amylase
   activity significantly associated with seed reserve utilization
   increased with seed germination, while there was a slight change in
   sucrose synthase activity. Each of the three a-amylase (OsAmy3B,
   OsAmy3C, and OsAmy3E) and sucrose synthase (OsSus2, OsSus3, and OsSus4)
   genes might be involved in seed reserve utilization. Two and seven
   quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for amylase and sucrose
   synthase activity, respectively, in which four were novel QTLs. The
   identified amylase and sucrose synthase genes/QTLs might be applicable
   to improve seed reserve utilization during the early seedling growth in
   rice by the transgenic and marker-assisted selection approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Lazy multi-label learning algorithms have become an important research
   topic within the multi-label community. These algorithms usually
   consider the set of standard k-Nearest Neighbors of a new instance to
   predict its labels (multi-label). The prediction is made by following a
   voting criteria within the multi-labels of the set of k-Nearest
   Neighbors of the new instance. This work proposes the use of two
   alternative strategies to identify the set of these examples: the Mutual
   and Not Mutual Nearest Neighbors rules, which have already been used by
   lazy single-learning algorithms. In this work, we use these strategies
   to extend the lazy multi-label algorithm BRkNN. An experimental
   evaluation carried out to compare both mutuality strategies with the
   original BRkNN algorithm and the well-known MLkNN lazy algorithm on 15
   benchmark datasets showed that MLkNN presented the best predictive
   performance for the Hamming-Loss evaluation measure, although it was
   significantly outperformed by the mutuality strategies when F-Measure is
   considered. The best results of the lazy algorithms were also compared
   with the results obtained by the Binary Relevance approach using three
   different base learning algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum-chemical and spectroscopic study of fluorine atoms as
   substituents in the trimethine and pentamethine chain influence on the
   electronic structure in polymethine dyes has been performed. According
   to the calculation data that were experimentally confirmed by RCA and
   C-13 NMR spectroscopy fluorination of polymethine chain leads to the
   small C-C bond lengths changes in chromophore and appreciably changes of
   the atomic charges. It was established that the introduction of fluorine
   atoms in the chromophore is accompanied by the significant shifting of
   the frontier and nearest levels and hence by changing the electronic
   transitions energies. The simultaneous analysis of the absorption and
   fluorescence excitation anisotropy spectra as well as results of the
   calculations of electronic transitions has shown that the S-0 -> S-1
   transition is more sensitive to the fluorine substituents than the S-0
   -> S-2 transition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The residential sector accounts for a significant and increasing portion
   of the national energy use. Cooling energy reduction in the public
   housing sector is one of the key success factors for sustainable
   building development measures especially in the sub-tropics. This study
   proposes a hybrid EnergyPlus (EP) - artificial neural network (ANN)
   model, which is more flexible and time-efficient than the conventional
   cooling energy simulation methods, for simulating the cooling energy
   consumption in the Hong Kong public housing sector and evaluates the
   cooling energy impacts related to building materials, window sizes,
   indoor-outdoor temperature variations and apartment sizes. The results
   show that climate changes and temperature set-points have the greatest
   impact on cooling energy use (-19.9\% to 24.1\%), followed by flat size
   combinations (-13.4\% to 27.9\%). The proposed model can be a useful
   tool for policymakers to establish sustainable public housing

Abstract = {{Online social shopping communities are transforming the way customers
   communicate and exchange product information with others. To date, the
   issue of customer participation in online social shopping communities
   has become an important but underexplored research area in the academic
   literature. In this study, we examined how online social interactions
   affect customer information contribution behavior. We also explored the
   moderating role of customer reputation in the relationship between
   observational learning and reinforcement learning as well as customer
   information contribution behavior. Analyses of panel data from 6,121
   customers in an online social fashion platform revealed that they are
   significant factors affecting customer information contribution behavior
   and that reinforcement learning exhibits a stronger effect than
   observational learning. The results also showed that customer reputation
   has a significant negative moderating effect on the relationship between
   observational learning and customer information contribution behavior.
   This study not only enriched our theoretical understanding of
   information contribution behavior but also provided guidelines for
   online social shopping community administrators to better design their
   community features.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a staggered discontinuous Galerkin method for

   method combines the advantages of discontinuous Galerkin methods and
   staggered meshes, and results in many good properties, namely local and
   global conservations, optimal convergence and superconvergence through
   the use of a local postprocessing technique. Another key feature is that
   our method provides a skew-symmetric discretization of the convection
   term, with the aim of giving a better conservation property compared
   with existing discretizations. We will present extensive numerical
   results, including Kovasznay flow, Taylor vortex flow, lid-driven cavity
   flow, parallel plate flow and channel expansion flow, to show the
   performance of the method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Failure to rescue (FTR) is a key metric of perioperative
   morbidity and mortality. We review perioperative medical comorbidities
   (MCMs) to determine what factors are associated with complications and
   rates of FTR.
   STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of a NSQIP database including
   general, vascular, and surgical subspecialty patients from a tertiary
   referral center between March 2008 and March 2013 was performed.
   Demographics, MCMs, complications, 30-day mortality, and risk of FTR
   associated with specific complications and MCM were evaluated.
   RESULTS: A total of 7,763 patients were included; 52.6\% had MCMs and
   14\% (n = 1,099) experienced a complication. Patients with complications
   were older (64.9 vs 55 years; p < 0.001), more likely male (54\% vs
   44\%; p < 0.001), and had more MCMs per patient (1.6 vs 1.4; p < 0.001).
   Complications were also associated with renal failure (odds ratio {[}OR]
   = 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.0-2.0), steroid use (OR = 1.9; 95\% CI, 1.4-2.5), CHF
   (OR = 2.5; 95\% CI, 1.2-5.1), and ascites (OR = 9.1; 95\% CI, 3.7-21.7),
   but not diabetes, hypertension, or COPD. There were 117 (11\%) deaths
   among patients with complications. Adjusting for age, sex, American
   Society of Anesthesiologists class, and number of comorbidities, FTR was
   associated with postoperative respiratory failure, sepsis, and renal
   failure, as well as comorbid CHF, renal failure, ascites, and
   disseminated cancer.
   CONCLUSIONS: Specific comorbidities are associated with higher rates of
   complications and FTR. Preoperative CHF, renal failure, and ascites,
   which were associated with FTR, can reflect a physiologic inability to
   tolerate complication-induced fluid shifts. Postoperative mortality was
   associated with signs of end organ damage, including sepsis, respiratory
   failure, and renal failure. Earlier recognition of these complications
   in at-risk patients should improve rates of FTR. (C) 2015 by the

Title = {{Analysis of Image Distortion on Magnetic Resonance Diffusion Weighted
   Imaging}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to improve diagnostic efficiency of
   clinical study by setting up guidelines for more precise examination
   with a comparative analysis of signal intensity and image distortion
   depending on the location of X axial of object when performing magnetic
   resonance diffusion weighted imaging (MR DWI) examination. We arranged
   the self-produced phantom with a 45 mm of interval from the core of 44
   regent bottles that have a 16 mm of external diameter and 55 mm of
   height, and were placed in 4 rows and 11 columns in an acrylic box. We
   also filled up water and margarine to portrait the fat. We used 3T Skyra
   and 18 Channel Body array coil. We also obtained the coronal image with
   the direction of RL (right to left) by using scan slice thinkness 3 mm,
   slice gap: 0mm, field of view (FOV): 450 x 450 mm(2), repetition time
   (TR): 5000 ms, echo time (TE): 73/118 ms, Matrix: 126 x 126, slice
   number: 15, scan time: 9 min 45sec, number of excitations (NEX): 3,
   phase encoding as a diffusion-weighted imaging parameter. In order to
   scan, we set b-value to 0 s/mm(2), 400 s/mm(2), and 1,400 s/mm(2), and
   obtained T2 fat saturation image. Then we did a comparative analysis on
   the differences between image distortion and signal intensity depending
   on the location of X axial based on isocenter of patient's table. We
   used ``Image J{''} as a comparative analysis programme, and used SPSS
   v18.0 as a statistic programme. There was not much difference between
   image distortion and signal intensity on fat and water from T2 fat
   saturation image. But, the average value depends on the location of X
   axial was statistically significant (p < 0.05). From DWI image, when
   b-value was 0 and 400, there was no significant difference up to 2nd
   columns right to left from the core of patient's table, however, there
   was a decline in signal intensity and image distortion from the 3rd
   columns and they started to decrease rapidly at the 4th columns. When
   b-value was 1,400, there was not much difference between the 1st row
   right to left from the core of patient's table, however, image
   distortion started to appear from the 2nd columns with no change in
   signal intensity, the signal was getting decreased from the 3rd columns,
   and both signal intensity and image distortion started to get decreased
   rapidly. At this moment, the reagent bottles from outside out of 11
   reagent bottles were not verified from the image, and only 9 reagent
   bottles were verified. However, it was not possible to verify anything
   from the 5th columns. But, the average value depends on the location of
   X axial was statistically significant. On T2 FS image, there was a
   significant decline in image distortion and signal intensity over 180mm
   from the core of patient's table. On diffusion-weighted image, there was
   a significant decline in image distortion and signal intensity over 90
   mm, and they became unverifiable over 180 mm. Therefore, we should make
   an image that has a diagnostic value from examinations that are hard to
   locate patient's position.}},

Abstract = {{The highly sensitive operation of a bottom-gate silicon nanowire (SiNW)
   field-effect transistor (FET)-based hydrogen (H-2) sensor is
   demonstrated by controlling the working regime of the sensor. It is
   observed that the deposition of palladium (Pd) nanoparticles on the SiNW
   surface for the selective absorption of H-2 can result in a significant
   enhancement of the electrostatic properties, such as the subthreshold
   swing and on-current, of the SiNW FET-based H-2 sensor. By comparing the
   experimental results with the numerical simulation, we conclude that the
   improvement of the electrostatic properties of the sensor is due to the
   coupling effect between the electrostatic potentials in the Pd
   nanoparticle and bottom gate. Based on these results, highly sensitive
   detection of H-2 gas could be achieved in the subthreshold regime where
   the gating effect induced by absorbed H-2 gas is the most effective. (C)

   the Kuomintang (KMT) and their (dis)coordination with the KMT first
   undermined and then recovered the KMT's dominance. Furthermore, this
   study pays particular attention to cross-strait relations in shaping the
   dynamics of electoral coalitions in Taiwan. This study argues that
   China's military threat and Taiwan's deepening economic integration to
   the Mainland, along with other international forces, have influenced
   Taiwanese public opinion on cross-strait policy and have thus affected
   electoral coalition formation and the electoral fortunes of the KMT.}},

Abstract = {{Extending La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1999), we
   examine the effect of local government quality on firm performance,
   since regional and firm research provides a more fine-grained analysis
   especially in countries where local administration is an integral part
   of the bureaucratic apparatus. Using a dataset of 7,873 Chinese listed
   firm-years for 1994 2006, we find a positive relationship between the
   quality of provincial government and firm performance, controlling for
   location and firm-specific governance variables. Among various
   government quality variables, we find that having a special economic
   zone depicting low taxes and bureaucratic efficiency is the best
   predictor of firm performance, followed by the degree of marketization,
   efficient property registration, and environmental protection. Most
   intriguingly, political freedom has a significant impact on firm
   performance and productivity, even in a regime where democracy is not
   practiced. This has never been documented before at a microeconomic
   level and barely so at a macro level, vindicating Hayek's (1944) theory.}},

   supernatants of splenocytes exposed to 85\% aqueous methanol (85\% aq.
   MeOH) fraction from the BM product plus concanavalin A (Con A) were
   harvested to determine the production of Th1 (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha,
   IL-2, IL-17A) and Th2 {[}IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12/IL-23(p40)]
   cytokines. Cytokines were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay (ELISA) reader. Co-administration of the 85\% aq. MeOH fraction
   with Con A resulted in a significantly higher IFN-gamma expression than
   that observed with Con A alone (P < 0.01), but significantly decreased
   TNF-a and IL-17A expression (P<0.05). Treatment with 85\% aq. MeOH
   fraction plus Con A also significantly decreased the expression of Th2
   {[}IL-4, IL-5, IL-12/IL-23(p40)] cytokines (P<0.01). These findings
   demonstrate that 85\% aq. MeOH fraction from the BM product
   downregulates the immediate hypersensitivity reaction induced by Con A.
   These results also suggest that 85\% aq. MeOH fraction from the BM
   product may have potential application in preventive or adjunct

Abstract = {{We present an analysis of the level of polarized dust and synchrotron
   emission using the WMAP9 and Planck data. The primary goal of this study
   is to inform the assessment of foreground contamination in the cosmic
   microwave background (CMB) measurements below 200 from 23 to 353 GHz. We
   compute angular power spectra as a function of sky cut based on the
   Planck 353 GHz polarization maps. Our primary findings are the
   following. (1) There is a spatial correlation between the dust emission
   as measured by Planck at 353 GHz and the synchrotron emission as
   measured by WMAP at 23 GHz with rho approximate to 0.4 or greater for l
   < 20 and f(sky) >= 0.5, dropping to rho approximate to 0.2 for 30 < l <
   200. (2) A simple foreground model with dust, synchrotron, and their
   correlation fits well to all possible cross spectra formed with the WMAP
   and Planck 353 GHz data given the current uncertainties. (3) In the 50\%
   cleanest region of the polarized dust map, the ratio of synchrotron to
   dust amplitudes at 90 GHz for 50 <= l <= 110 is 0.3(-0.2)(+0.3). Smaller
   regions of sky can be cleaner although the uncertainties in our
   knowledge of synchrotron emission are larger. A high-sensitivity

Abstract = {{Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are secondary metabolites found in
   diverse marine, freshwater, and terrestrial organisms. Evidence suggests
   that MAAs have several beneficial effects on skin homeostasis such as
   protection against UV radiation and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In
   addition, MAAs are also involved in the modulation of skin fibroblasts
   proliferation. However, the regulatory function of MAAs on wound repair
   in human skin is not yet clearly elucidated. To investigate the roles of
   MAAs on the wound healing process in human keratinocytes, three MAAs,
   Shinorine (SH), Mycosporine-glycine (M-Gly), and Porphyra (P334) were
   purified from Chlamydomonas hedlyei and Porphyra yezoensis. We found
   that SH, M-Gly, and P334 have significant effects on the wound healing
   process in human keratinocytes and these effects were mediated by
   activation of focal adhesion kinases (FAK), extracellular
   signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK).
   These results suggest that MAAs accelerate wound repair by activating
   the FAK-MAPK signaling pathways. This study also indicates that MAAs can
   act as a new wound healing agent and further suggests that MAAs might be
   a novel biomaterial for wound healing therapies.}},

   succeed only in proving a domain monotonicity result for a weighted
   eigenvalue problem in which the weights need to satisfy some artificial
   conditions. In this paper we generalize the result of Kesavan to the
   case of the p-Laplacian (1 < p < infinity) without any artificial
   restrictions, and in the process we simplify greatly the proof, even in
   the case of the Laplacian. The uniqueness of the maximizing domain in
   the nonlinear case is still an open question.}},

Title = {{Comparison of the Levels of Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines Released in the

   Study}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   Fibromyalgia is associated with central hyperexcitability, but it is
   suggested that peripheral input is important to maintain central
   hyperexcitability. The primary aim was to investigate the levels of
   pro-inflammatory cytokines released in the vastus lateralis muscle
   during repetitive dynamic contractions of the quadriceps muscle in
   patients with fibromyalgia and healthy controls. Secondarily, to
   investigate if the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were correlated
   with pain or fatigue during these repetitive dynamic contractions.
   Material and Methods
   32 women with fibromyalgia and 32 healthy women (controls) participated
   in a 4 hour microdialysis session, to sample IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and
   TNF from the most painful point of the vastus lateralis muscle before,
   during and after 20 minutes of repeated dynamic contractions. Pain
   (visual analogue scale; 0-100) and fatigue Borg's Rating of Perceived
   Exertion Scale; 6-20) were assessed before and during the entire
   microdialysis session.
   Results
   The repetitive dynamic contractions increased pain in the patients with
   fibromyalgia (P < .001) and induced fatigue in both groups (P < .001).
   Perceived fatigue was significantly higher among patients with
   fibromyalgia than controls (P < .001). The levels of IL-1 beta did not
   change during contractions in either group. The levels of TNF did not
   change during contractions in patients with fibromyalgia, but increased
   in controls (P < .001) and were significantly higher compared to
   patients with fibromyalgia (P = .033). The levels of IL-6 and IL-8
   increased in both groups alike during and after contractions (P's <
   .001). There were no correlations between pain or fatigue and cytokine
   levels after contractions.
   Conclusion
   There were no differences between patients with fibromyalgia and
   controls in release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and no correlations
   between levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pain or fatigue. Thus,
   this study indicates that IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF do not seem to
   play an important role in maintenance of muscle pain in fibromyalgia.}},

Abstract = {{Diatoms are considered as third generation biofuel. In this framework,
   three-isolated diatom from Tunisian biotopes were identified and tested
   for their ability to produce lipids, which then converted to biodiesel.
   The lipid extraction with modified Bligh and Dyer methods coupling with
   microwave cell disruption could increase the lipid yield for all the
   studied strains. On the other hand, the direct-transesterification
   allowed higher yield of crude biodiesel than
   extraction-transesterification. Chloroform-based
   direct-transesterification from microwave treated cells led to higher
   FAME yield: from 16 to 18\%, 9 to 26\% and 5 to 13\% of the dry weight,
   in Amphora subtropica CTM 20013, Amphora sp. CTM 20023 and Navicula sp.
   CTM 20025, respectively. Palmitic (C16:0) and palmitoleic (C16:1) acids
   were dominant and both accounted for 74\%, 55\% and 68\% of total FAME
   in CTM 20013, CTM 20023 and CTM 20025 strains, respectively. For Amphora
   sp. and Navicula sp. the lipid yield was ameliorated with lipid
   extraction by modified Bligh and Dyer method after microwave cell
   disruption treatment. Direct transesterification gave high biodiesel
   yield and FAME content. These three new diatoms are a suitable feedstock
   for producing neutral lipids which then converted to biodiesel.}},

   segmentation of hip CT images}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the issue of fully automatic segmentation of a hip
   CT image with the goal to preserve the joint structure for clinical
   applications in hip disease diagnosis and treatment. For this purpose,
   we propose a Multi-Atlas Segmentation Constrained Graph (MASCG) method.
   The MASCG method uses multi-atlas based mesh fusion results to
   initialize a bone sheetness based multi-label graph cut for an accurate
   hip CT segmentation which has the inherent advantage of automatic
   separation of the pelvic region from the bilateral proximal femoral
   regions. We then introduce a graph cut constrained graph search
   algorithm to further improve the segmentation accuracy around the
   bilateral hip joint regions. Taking manual segmentation as the ground
   truth, we evaluated the present approach on 30 hip CT images (60 hips)
   with a 15-fold cross validation. When the present approach was compared
   to manual segmentation, an average surface distance error of 0.30 mm,

   K, p = 1.9 Pa and in the E/N range from 40 up to 400 Td using gas filled

   theoretical model of ion deceleration in collisions with gas molecules
   was used for the data analysis. The model is valid for hard sphere
   collisions and for ion mass much higher than mass of gas molecule. Using
   this model it is possible to simulate ion motion in gas under influence
   of electric fields in wide ion velocity range. Collision cross sections
   of the ions were calculated from the experimentally measured drift
   times. Calculated cross sections for most of the ions showed significant
   dependence on the ion drift velocity. It was supposed that long-range

Abstract = {{Background Bleeding complications have been frequently reported in East
   Asian patients on warfarin with a target international normalized ratio
   (INR) of 2.0-3.0. Objective This study aimed to identify the optimal
   therapeutic range of the INR in Korean patients with non-valvular atrial
   fibrillation (NVAF). Setting Cardiovascular department of a 1320
   inpatient bed Korean hospital. Method Retrospective chart review was
   conducted on 1014 patients for a total follow-up period of 2249.2
   patient years. Major thromboembolic and bleeding complications were
   evaluated. The INR incidence of complication curve was plotted, and the
   optimal therapeutic range of INR was determined from the intersection of
   curves to ensure the lowest incidences of both thromboembolic and
   bleeding complications. For subgroup analysis, all patients were
   stratified by the following factors: age (above 75), disease (presence
   of hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and a history of
   stroke or thromboembolism), rhythm control procedure, and concurrent
   aspirin therapy. Main outcome measure Optimal therapeutic ranges of INR
   according to the risk factors. Results A total of 41 thromboembolic and
   91 bleeding events occurred during the follow-up period. The
   complication rates were the lowest at an INR of 1.9 and the optimal
   therapeutic range was estimated to be 1.7-2.2 for the overall patients.
   The optimal therapeutic ranges of INR in the stratified patients were
   determined as follows: 1.3-1.8 in the patients a parts per thousand
   yen75 years of age; 1.5-2.0 in patients with hypertension, diabetes and
   concurrent aspirin therapy; 1.8-2.3 in patients with congestive heart
   failure; 1.9-2.4 in patients with previous stroke or thromboembolism;
   1.7-2.2 in patients who had undergone rhythm control procedures. It has
   been shown that, by keeping the INR within these ranges, complication
   risks could be significantly reduced by up to 81 \%. Conclusion The
   intensity of anticoagulation therapy for Korean patients with NVAF is
   optimal when INR is between 1.7 and 2.2.}},

Abstract = {{The European eel Anguilla anguilla has a complex life cycle that
   includes freshwater, seawater and morphologically distinct stages as
   well as two extreme long distance migrations. Eels do not feed as they
   migrate across the Atlantic to the Sargasso Sea but nevertheless reach
   sexual maturity before spawning. It is not yet clear how existing energy
   stores are used to reach the appropriate developmental state for
   reproduction. Since the liver is involved in energy metabolism, protein
   biosynthesis and endocrine regulation it is expected to play a key role
   in the regulation of reproductive development. We therefore used
   microarrays to identify genes that may be involved in this process.
   Using this approach, we identified 231 genes that were expressed at
   higher and 111 genes that were expressed at lower levels in sexually
   mature compared with immature males. The upregulated set includes genes
   involved in lipid metabolism, fatty acid synthesis and transport
   mitochondrial function, steroid transport and bile acid metabolism.
   Several genes with putative enzyme functions were also expressed at
   higher levels at sexual maturity while genes involved in immune system
   processes and protein biosynthesis tended to be down-regulated at this
   stage. By using a high-throughput approach, we have identified a subset
   of genes that may be linked with the mobilization of energy stores for
   sexual maturation and migration. These results contribute to an improved
   understanding of eel reproductive biology and provide insight into the
   role of the liver in other teleosts with a long distance spawning
   migrations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrological and hydraulic processes of the flash flood that
   affected Atrani village (Amalfi Coast of Southern Italy) on 9 September
   2010 are analysed using post-flood surveys and numerical modelling.
   Observations in this case are particularly challenging because of the
   small spatial and temporal scales of the event, relative to the sampling
   characteristics of conventional rain and discharge measurement networks.
   Given these aspects, some of the relevant characteristics of the event
   were deduced by analysing field data that were collected immediately
   after the event. A width function instantaneous unit hydrograph (WFIUH)
   rainfall-runoff model is applied to derive a flow hydrograph for the
   area immediately upstream of the village. This hydrograph is inputted as
   an upstream boundary condition for the simulation of the propagation
   processes. A two-dimensional innovative hydraulic model is used to
   reproduce the flood within the village. The use of an unstructured mesh
   enabled a detailed simulation of water flow within the narrow and
   winding alleyways of the village. The results of the simulations
   indicate agreement with the field observations. The implemented approach
   is suitable for simulating flash floods in similar contexts and,
   therefore, may be used to predict potential future events.}},

Abstract = {{Objective, To survey the pediatric trauma programs to ascertain if and
   how etomidate is being used for rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in
   pediatric trauma patients. Design, A 25 question survey was created
   using REDCaps. A link to the survey was emailed to each of the pediatric
   and adult trauma programs that care for pediatric patients. Setting,
   Pediatric trauma programs and adult trauma programs caring for pediatric
   patients. Intervention, None. Measurements and Main Results, A total of
   16\% of programs responded (40/247). The majority of the centers that
   responded are urban, academic, teaching Level 1 pediatric trauma centers
   that provide care for > 200 pediatric trauma patients annually. The
   trauma program directors were the most likely to respond to the survey
   (18/40). 33/38 respondents state they use etomidate in their RSI
   protocol but it is not used in all pediatric trauma patients. 26/38
   respondents believe that etomidate is associated with adrenal
   suppression and 24/37 believe it exacerbates adrenal suppression in
   pediatric trauma patients yet 28 of 37 respondents do not believe it is
   clinically relevant. Conclusions, Based on the results of the survey,
   the use of etomidate in pediatric trauma patients is common among urban,
   academic, teaching, level 1 pediatric trauma centers. A prospective
   evaluation of etomidate use for RSI in pediatric trauma patients to
   evaluate is potential effects on adrenal suppression and hemodynamics is
   warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of value-added planning (as part of the Valuing Attractive
   Landscapes in the Urban Economy, INTERREG IVB North West Europe Project)
   is introduced in this paper to facilitate integrative planning, focusing
   on the benefits that use and non-use green spaces can provide to an
   urban area. The aim is to stress the need to plan for, and protect,
   green spaces in urban areas by determining the economic values connected
   to the green spaces and relate that values to community benefit and
   local authority revenue. The paper identifies tools that can be used to
   determine the economic value of green spaces based on the environmental,
   social, and economic benefits. The first section (value) refers to the
   social value of green spaces as determined from the public perspective
   and introduces the workbench method as a tool to assist with
   participatory planning and capturing of the social benefits of green
   spaces. The second section (added) refers to the environmental benefits
   of green spaces and, by means of the Green Credit Tool, introduces ways
   to ensure the protection of the green resources in an area. The final
   section (planning) refers to the economic benefit of green space,
   bringing use values and non-use values of green spaces together. The
   paper concludes with an integrative framework for value-added planning,
   incorporating all the tools presented in the paper, capturing the
   social, environmental, and economic benefits of green spaces and
   relating it to community benefit and local authority revenue.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{554-558}},

Abstract = {{Background. The population of patients in need of renal replacement
   therapy has changed with an increase in age and a rising number of
   comorbidities. Therefore, the prerequisites for a vascular access for
   hemodialysis have become less favorable and the risk for the patient has
   increased.
   Objective. What is the role of the nephrologist for a safe access
   placement in patients with chronic renal insufficiency?
   Material and methods. A literature search was carried out and
   descriptions of experiences of nephrologists working in an
   interdisciplinary vascular access team were included.
   Results. Nephrologists play a pivotal role in the timely patient
   education and planning of an optimal vascular access. The decision of
   the patient defines the type of dialysis to be used. The nephrologist
   together with the interdisciplinary vascular access team (general
   practitioner, angiologist, interventional radiologist and vascular
   surgeon) decides on the best access, depending on the clinical needs,
   clinical examination and duplex sonography mapping. Timely planning of
   access creation and surveillance after surgery are important tasks for
   the nephrologist.
   Conclusion. For the safety of the patient the decision for the best
   access and correct timing are of pivotal importance. To reduce the
   number of catheters it will probably be necessary to start with the
   planning of a vascular access earlier in the future.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{84}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Calabria-Peloritani Orogen is an arcuate segment of the
   peri-Mediterranean orogenic Alpine nappe system that comprises the whole
   Calabria and the north-eastern sector of Sicily. It comprises the Sila
   and Catena Costiera Massifs in northern Calabria, the Serre and
   Aspromonte Massifs in central and southern Calabria, and the Peloritani
   Mountains in Sicily.
   In Sila and Catena Costiera Massifs, three tectonic complexes are
   recognisable: a) the basal Apennine Complex, which consists of carbonate
   platform sequences of passive continental margin; b) the intermediate
   Liguride Complex, made of oceanic-derived units, affected by HP/LT
   metamorphism; and c) the upper Calabride Complex, which represents a
   nearly entire section of continental crust. The Catanzaro Line separates
   the northern sector from the Serre Massif that also represents a nearly
   entire segment of Variscan continental crust unaffected by Alpine
   metamorphism. Further to the south, the Palmi Line separates the Serre
   from the Aspromonte Massif and the Peloritani Mountains. These two
   latter nappe edifices consist of either Variscan metamorphic units,
   Variscan units with Alpine overprint and units of continental derivation
   that are exclusively affected by Alpine metamorphism. The comparison
   between the geological evolutions of the various chain sectors, as well
   as their structural setting and their direction of tectonic transport,
   indicates that the Calabria-Peloritani Orogen is a composite terrane
   derived from the amalgamation of crustal blocks of different continental
   provenance. Northern Calabria represents a fragment of the Adria
   palaeomargin, whereas southern Calabria and northeastern Sicily are
   relics of an accretionary wedge resulting from the deformation of the
   European continental margin. As a consequence, nowadays a segment of the
   Europe-Adria collisional suture crops out in central Calabria.}},

Abstract = {{A class of (right) Rickart rings, called strong, is isolated. In

   that every strong Rickart ring R admits a binary operation which turns R

   its natural order <=; such bands are known as right normal skew
   nearlattices. The poset (R, <=) is relatively orthocomplemented; in
   particular, every initial segment in it is orthomodular. The order <= is
   actually a version of the so called right-star order. The one-sided star
   orders are well-investigated for matrices and recently have been
   generalized to bounded linear Hilbert space operators and to abstract
   Rickart {*}-rings. The paper demonstrates that they can successfully be

Abstract = {{Pre-surgical assessment and surgical management of frontal epilepsy with
   normal MRI is often challenging. We present a case of a 33-year-old,
   right-handed, educated male. During childhood, his seizures presented
   with mandibular myoclonus and no particular trigger. As a young adult,
   he developed seizures with a startle component, triggered by unexpected
   noises. During his ictal episodes, he felt fear and grimaced with sudden
   head flexion and tonic axial posturing. Similar seizures also occurred
   without startle. Neuropsychological assessment showed executive
   dysfunction and verbal memory deficit. The cerebral MRI was normal.
   Electro-clinical reasoning, investigations performed, the results
   obtained and follow-up are discussed in detail. {[}Published with video

Abstract = {{We proposed and tested a method by which surface strains of biological
   tissues can be captured without the use of fiducial markers by instead,
   utilizing the inherent structure of the tissue. We used
   polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS OCT) to obtain
   volumetric data through the thickness and across a partial surface of
   the lumbar facet capsular ligament during three cases of static bending.
   Reflectivity and phase retardance were calculated from two polarization
   channels, and a power spectrum analysis was performed on each a-line to
   extract the dominant banding frequency (a measure of degree of fiber
   alignment) through the maximum value of the power spectrum (maximum
   power). Maximum powers of all a-lines for each case were used to create
   2D visualizations, which were subsequently tracked via digital image
   correlation. In-plane strains were calculated from measured 2D
   deformations and converted to 3D surface strains by including
   out-of-plane motion obtained from the PS OCT image. In-plane strains
   correlated with 3D strains (R (2) a parts per thousand yen 0.95). Using
   PS OCT for marker-free motion tracking of biological tissues is a
   promising new technique because it relies on the structural
   characteristics of the tissue to monitor displacement instead of
   external fiducial markers.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a thematic analysis of the naming and framing of
   lateral violence within the Aboriginal community in Adelaide, South
   Australia. Lateral violence is a relatively under researched area within
   the Aboriginal community, yet this term has been applied with little
   consultation. Interviews with 30 Aboriginal participants examining their
   understandings of lateral violence identified five themes relevant to
   the labelling and acceptance of the term `lateral violence'. By drawing
   on theories of oppression, social representations, stigma and racism
   many of the themes indicate the importance and relevance of an
   overarching label of lateral violence to describe the ``infighting{''}
   behaviours that have been normalised within the Aboriginal community.
   Assurance of a label makes the concept of lateral violence tangible and
   therefore able to be addressed. Despite this labelling, awareness of the
   concept of lateral violence in Adelaide appears relatively low.
   Resistance and opposition from the Aboriginal community to lateral
   violence appear to be associated with the stigma and prejudice attached
   to `violence'. Such a word can potentially render all Aboriginal people
   as intrinsically violent and therefore blameworthy, which can alleviate
   any responsibility for dealing with this chronic problem in broader
   society.}},

Abstract = {{Background/purpose: Diabetes mellitus (DM) disproportionately affects
   Hispanic patients. DM patients have enhanced platelet reactivity and
   reduced sensitivity to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor demonstrated a more rapid
   onset and greater magnitude of platelet inhibition than clopidogrel in
   Hispanic patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). This
   subgroup analysis examined the onset and level of platelet inhibition of
   ticagrelor and clopidogrel in Hispanic patients with DM.
   Methods/materials: This was a subgroup analysis of a randomized,
   open-label, crossover study in which 40 Hispanic patients with stable
   CAD received ticagrelor 180 mg loading dose (LD)/90 mg twice-daily
   maintenance dose (MD) then clopidogrel 600 mg LD/75 mg once-daily MD, or
   vice versa. The primary end point was on-treatment platelet reactivity
   at 2 hours post-LD using the VerifyNow (TM) P2Y12 test.
   Results: 21 patients had DM and 19 were non-diabetic. At 2 hours
   post-LD, mean platelet reactivity in the diabetic group was 34.5 PRU
   with ticagrelor versus 219.3 PRU with clopidogrel (P < 0.001), and in
   the non-diabetic group was 33.7 PRU with ticagrelor versus 181.0 PRU
   with clopidogrel (P < 0.001). In both diabetic and non-diabetic
   subgroups, mean platelet reactivity declined to a significantly greater
   extent with ticagrelor than clopidogrel at all time points evaluated
   (0.5, 2, and 8 hours post LD and after 7-9 days of MD). Patients were
   significantly more likely to have high on-treatment platelet reactivity
   (>= 208 PRU) during treatment with clopidogrel compared with ticagrelor,
   regardless of diabetic status.
   Conclusions: Among Hispanic patients with stable CAD, ticagrelor
   achieves a faster onset and greater magnitude of platelet inhibition
   compared with clopidogrel, irrespective of diabetic status. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Objective Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and Neospora caninum may
   cause clinical disease in alpacas. Both diseases are present in the
   Australian cattle population. The objective of this study was to perform
   a serological prevalence survey for BVDV and N. caninum exposure in a
   regional alpaca population of South Australia.
   Methods Serum samples were taken from 182 alpacas on 10 farms, which had
   a combined population of 1308 alpacas. Serological analysis for BVD
   antibodies was performed using a competitive BVDV antibody ELISA kit.
   Serological analysis for N. caninum was performed using an anti-Neospora
   ELISA with a protein G conjugate.
   Results Of the 182 alpacas sampled, 5 animals located on three
   properties were positive for BVDV antibodies, constituting a prevalence
   of 2.7\% (95\% confidence interval 1-6\%). All samples tested negative
   for N. caninum antibodies.
   Conclusion There is a low BVDV seroprevalence and N. caninum is
   currently either absent or present at a very low prevalence in this
   population of alpacas in South Australia. There is serological evidence
   for the presence of both organisms in South Australian beef and dairy
   cattle herds. Appropriate biosecurity protocols to minimise the risk of
   introduction and exposure should be a high priority to maintain this
   favourable status.}},

   presented, extending a technique previously conceived for the one-port

   small state-space dimensions of the model. It is also very efficient
   since it requires the solutions to a few linear heat diffusion problems
   in the frequency domain. The multi-port compact models exhibit structure
   similar to the one-port counterparts and can be used to accurately
   approximate not only the junction temperatures, but also the whole

Title = {{The Rise and Fall of Universal Salt Iodization in Vietnam: Lessons
   Learned for Designing Sustainable Food Fortification Programs With a
   Public Health Impact}},
Journal = {{FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN}},

Abstract = {{Background: In 2005, more than 90\% of Vietnamese households were using
   adequately iodized salt, and urinary iodine concentration among women of
   reproductive age was in the optimal range. However, household coverage
   declined thereafter to 45\% in 2011, and urinary iodine concentration
   levels indicated inadequate iodine intake.
   Objective: To review the strengths and weaknesses of the Vietnamese
   universal salt iodization program from its inception to the current day
   and to discuss why achievements made by 2005 were not sustained.
   Methods: Qualitative review of program documents and semistructured
   interviews with national stakeholders.
   Results: National legislation for mandatory salt iodization was revoked
   in 2005, and the political importance of the program was downgraded with
   consequential effects on budget, staff, and authority.
   Conclusions: The Vietnamese salt iodization program, as it was initially
   designed and implemented, was unsustainable, as salt iodization was not
   practiced as an industry norm but as a government-funded activity. An
   effective and sustainable salt iodization program needs to be
   reestablished for the long-term elimination of iodine deficiency,
   building upon lessons learned from the past and programs in neighboring
   countries. The new program will need to include mandatory legislation,
   including salt for food processing; industry responsibility for the cost
   of fortificant; government commitment for enforcement through routine
   food control systems and monitoring of iodine status through existing
   health/nutrition assessments; and intersectoral collaboration and
   management of the program. Many of the lessons would apply equally to
   universal salt iodization programs in other countries and indeed to food
   fortification programs in general.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{212-218}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) has been considered a heroic,
   high-risk procedure for patients in extremis since its introduction in
   1967, and over the last four decades, the technique has been used with
   increasing selectivity. Patients with isolated stab wounds to the chest
   stand the best chance of survival. Most institutions agree that EDT
   should be performed in patients with penetrating mechanisms of injury
   who have lost signs of life, but controversy surrounds its use in
   patients who undergo prehospital CPR or in cases involving blunt
   mechanisms of traumatic arrest. Dismal outcomes have been reported for
   patients with penetrating injuries and prehospital CPR > 15 min and
   blunt trauma victims who undergo prehospital CPR. Despite the low
   survival, the Western Trauma Association advocates EDT in cases of blunt
   traumatic arrest with CPR < 10 min. Biochemical profiles during EDTand
   outcomes beyond neurologic recovery are currently being investigated,
   and alternatives such as resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of
   the aorta (REBOA) are emerging.}},

Abstract = {{Pelagic longliners targeting swordfish and tunas in oceanic waters
   regularly capture sharks as bycatch, including currently protected
   species as the bigeye thresher, Alopias superciliosus. Fifteen bigeye
   threshers were tagged with pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) in
   2012-2014 in the tropical northeast Atlantic, with successful
   transmissions received from 12 tags for a total of 907 tracking days.
   Marked diel vertical movements were recorded on all specimens, with most
   of the daytime spent in deeper colder water (mean depth = 353 m, SD =
   73; mean temperature = 10.7 degrees C, SD = 1.8) and nighttime spent in
   warmer water closer to the surface (mean depth = 72 m, SD = 54; mean
   temperature = 21.9 degrees C, SD = 3.7). The operating depth of the
   pelagic longline gear was measured with Minilog Temperature and Depth
   Recorders (TDRs), and the overlap with habitat utilization was
   calculated. Overlap is taking place mainly during the night and is
   higher for juveniles. The results presented herein can be used as inputs
   for Ecological Risk Assessments for bigeye threshers captured in oceanic
   tuna fisheries, and serve as a basis for efficient management and
   conservation of this vulnerable shark species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of
   cardiovascular disease and MetS and it may be one of molecular
   mechanisms involved in stroke. The aims of the present study were to
   verify differences in oxidative stress markers in acute ischemic stroke
   patients with and without MetS and to verify whether MetS influences
   disability and short time outcome of the patients. 148 patients with
   acute ischemic stroke were divided in two groups: with MetS (n = 92) and
   without MetS (n = 56). The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used for
   measuring the functional disability after 3-month follow-up. The study
   assessed the metabolic profile and oxidative stress markers. Stroke
   patients with MetS had higher levels of lipid hydroperoxides (p <
   0.0001) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP, p = 0.0302) than
   those without MetS. Hydroperoxides were directly and independently
   associated with MetS (OR: 1.000, 95 \% IC = 1.000-1.000, p = 0.005).
   Linear regression demonstrated that AOPP levels (R-2 = 0.281, p <
   0.0001) and oxidative stress index (OSI, R-2 = 0.223, p < 0.0001) were
   directly associated with triglycerides levels and hydroperoxides levels
   was also directly associated with glucose levels (R-2 = 0.080, p =
   0.013. The mRS and short-come outcome did not differ after 3 months in
   both groups. In conclusion, an increase in oxidative stress markers was
   shown in acute ischemic stroke patients with MetS and this elevation
   seems to be involved mainly with changes in lipid profile, but the
   presence of MetS did not influence short-time disability and survival of
   the acute ischemic stroke patients.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To characterize the role of Big Data in evaluating quality of
   care in ophthalmology, to highlight opportunities for studying quality
   improvement using data available in the American Academy of
   Ophthalmology Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) Registry, and to show
   how Big Data informs us about rare events such as endophthalmitis after
   cataract surgery.
   DESIGN: Review of published studies, analysis of public-use Medicare
   claims files from 2010 to 2013, and analysis of IRIS Registry from 2013
   to 2014.
   METHODS: Statistical analysis of observational data.
   RESULTS: The overall rate of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery was
   0.14\% in 216 703 individuals in the Medicare database. In the IRIS
   Registry the endophthalmitis rate after cataract surgery was 0.08\%
   among 511 182 individuals. Endophthalmitis rates tended to be higher in
   eyes with combined cataract surgery and anterior vitrectomy (P = .051),
   although only 0.08\% of eyes had this combined procedure. Visual acuity
   (VA) in the IRIS Registry in eyes with and without postoperative
   endophthalmitis measured 1-7 days postoperatively were logMAR 0.58
   (standard deviation {[}SD]: 0.84) (approximately Snellen acuity of
   20/80) and logMAR 0.31 (SD: 0.34) (approximately Snellen acuity of
   20/40), respectively. In 33 547 eyes with postoperative VA after
   cataract surgery, 18.3\% had 1-month-postoperative VA worse than 20/40.
   CONCLUSIONS: Big Data drawing on Medicare claims and IRIS Registry
   records can help identify additional areas for quality improvement, such
   as in the 18.3\% of eyes in the IRIS Registry having
   1-month-postoperative VA worse than 20/40. The ability to track patient
   outcomes in Big Data sets provides opportunities for further research on
   rare complications such as postoperative endophthalmitis. and outcomes
   from uncommon procedures such as cataract surgery combined with anterior
   vitrectomy. But privacy and data-security concerns associated with Big
   Data should not be taken lightly. ((C) 2015 by Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{There are 160,000 cancer patients worldwide treated with particle
   radiotherapy (RT). With the advent of proton, and high (H) charge (Z)
   and energy (E) HZE ionizing particle RT, the cardiovascular diseases
   risk estimates are uncertain. In addition, future deep space
   exploratory-type missions will expose humans to unknown but low doses of
   particle irradiation (IR). We examined molecular responses using
   transcriptome profiling in left ventricular murine cardiomyocytes
   isolated from mice that were exposed to 90 cGy, 1 GeV proton (H-1) and
   15 cGy, 1 GeV/nucleon iron (Fe-56) over 28 days after exposure.
   Unsupervised clustering analysis of gene expression segregated samples
   according to the IR response and time after exposure, with Fe-56-IR
   showing the greatest level of gene modulation. H-1-IR showed little
   differential transcript modulation. Network analysis categorized the
   major differentially expressed genes into cell cycle, oxidative
   responses, and transcriptional regulation functional groups.
   Transcriptional networks identified key nodes regulating expression.
   Validation of the signal transduction network by protein analysis and
   gel shift assay showed that particle IR clearly regulates a long-lived
   signaling mechanism for ERK1/2, p38 MAPK signaling and identified
   NFATc4, GATA4, STAT3, and NF-kappa B as regulators of the response at
   specific time points. These data suggest that the molecular responses
   and gene expression to Fe-56-IR in cardiomyocytes are unique and
   long-lasting. Our study may have significant implications for the
   efforts of National Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop
   heart disease risk estimates for astronauts and for patients receiving
   conventional and particle RT via identification of specific HZE-IR
   molecular markers.}},

Abstract = {{Excessive alcohol intake is one of the leading causes of premature death
   in Europe and particularly in Belgium. Belgian people are consuming more
   alcohol per year than the European average. It is well established that
   excessive alcohol consumption is a significant predictor of the
   development of hypertension (HTN). Two million adults in Belgium suffer
   from HTN and this number will increase to three million by 2025. Less
   than 50\% of Belgian people treated for HTN are well-controlled. Alcohol
   reduction in patients with HTN can significantly lower systolic and
   diastolic blood pressure. After reviewing the epidemiology of HTN and
   alcohol disorders in Belgium, this paper will focus on the rationale for
   alcohol screening and brief intervention in primary care. It will also
   describe the barriers to alcohol screening, and what could be the
   benefits of alcohol screening for our healthcare system. The authors
   believe that early identification through alcohol screening and brief
   intervention in general practice can help to improve the management of
   patients with HTN, to reach the targets of the WHO Global Action Plan,
   i.e., a 25\% relative reduction in the risk of premature mortality from
   cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory
   diseases. They are also convinced that this would allow achieving major
   healthcare savings.}},

Abstract = {{Neuronal adaptation is the intrinsic capacity of the brain to change, by
   various mechanisms, its dynamical responses as a function of the
   context. Such a phenomena, widely observed in vivo and in vitro, is
   known to be crucial in homeostatic regulation of the activity and gain
   control. The effects of adaptation have already been studied at the
   single-cell level, resulting from either voltage or calcium gated
   channels both activated by the spiking activity and modulating the
   dynamical responses of the neurons. In this study, by disentangling
   those effects into a linear (sub-threshold) and a non-linear
   (supra-threshold) part, we focus on the the functional role of those two
   distinct components of adaptation onto the neuronal activity at various
   scales, starting from single-cell responses up to recurrent networks
   dynamics, and under stationary or non-stationary stimulations. The
   effects of slow currents on collective dynamics, like modulation of
   population oscillation and reliability of spike patterns, is quantified
   for various types of adaptation in sparse recurrent networks.}},

Title = {{Multiphase turbulence in bubbly flows: RANS simulations}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{222-243}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The ability of a two-fluid Eulerian-Eulerian computational multiphase
   fluid dynamic model to predict bubbly air-water flows is studied. Upward
   and downward pipe flows are considered and a database of 19 experiments
   from 6 different literature sources is used to assess the accuracy of
   the model, with the aim of evaluating our ability to predict these kinds
   of flows and to contribute to ongoing efforts to develop more advanced
   simulation tools. The particular focus in the work described is on the
   prediction of multiphase turbulence due to its relevance in the
   modelling of bubbly flows in general, including bubble coalescence and
   break-up, and boiling at a wall. Overall, a satisfactory accuracy is
   obtained in the prediction of liquid velocities and void fraction
   distributions in all conditions, including upward and downward flows,
   and wall-peaked and core-peaked void profiles, when values of the bubble
   diameter are specified from experimental data. Due to its importance for
   the correct prediction of the turbulence level in these flows, a
   bubble-induced turbulence model is introduced, starting from an existing
   formulation. Source terms due to drag are included in the turbulence
   kinetic energy and the turbulence energy dissipation rate equations of
   the k-s turbulence model, and optimisation of the turbulence source
   gives velocity fluctuation predictions in agreement with data. After
   comparisons with data, improvement in the predictions of other
   turbulence models is also demonstrated, with a Reynolds stress
   formulation based on the SSG (Speziale et al., 1991) pressure-strain
   model and the same bubble-induced turbulence model accurately predicting
   the two-phase flows and the anisotropy of the turbulence field. The same
   database is also exploited to evaluate different drag models and the
   advantages of including the effect of the bubble aspect ratio. Following
   experimental evidence, the model of Tomiyama et al. (2002) is used which
   assumes that the bubble shape is closer to spherical near a wall and
   employs a correlation to calculate the aspect ratio. An increase in the
   drag coefficient due to the higher aspect ratio increases the accuracy
   of calculated velocity profiles in the near-wall region, even if
   additional validation is still required due to the possible loss of
   accuracy in the pipe centre. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   information may contradict the ideal of the museum-serving the public
   good in the public trust. Over the last three decades, this paradox has
   been particularly revealed during repatriation debates, which have
   threatened many museums with the loss of objects while exposing
   histories of illicit and unethical collecting. In this article, I
   provide a case study to the theme of secrecy by exploring how, in the
   United States, the institutional culture of museums creates a process
   that shelters certain kinds of knowledge. While repatriation law in the
   United States was intended to increase transparency about Native
   American collections and thus shift power asymmetries between museums
   and tribes, the law has ultimately reinforced preexisting power
   structures. Repatriation reveals the tension between concealing and
   disclosing secrets.}},

Abstract = {{Background A Virtual Lesion Clinic (VLC) using teledermatoscopy was
   established to improve efficiency of the melanoma referral pathway.
   Objectives To assess diagnostic accuracy and to compare wait-times and
   costs of VLC and conventional clinics.
   Methods Patients with suspected melanoma referred from primary care into
   a publicly funded health system attended local skin imaging centres,
   rather than hospital outpatient clinics. A teledermatologist assessed
   each lesion choosing specialist assessment/excision, General
   Practitioner (GP) follow-up, to re-image in 3 months, or
   self-monitoring/no concern.
   Results 613 skin lesions in 310 patients were evaluated over 12 months.
   Median time between receipt of referral and attendance at the VLC was 9
   days compared to 26.5 days for standard outpatient assessment. Sixty-six
   percent (404/ 613) of lesions were considered benign, and 12\% (73/613)
   were suspicious for melanoma. Of 129 lesions excised, 98 were skin
   cancers including 48 histologically confirmed melanomas with one
   spitzoid tumour of unknown malignant potential (STUMP), i.e. one
   melanoma per 1.59 suspected lesions biopsied and one melanoma in every
   12.8 referred to the service. There were 49 non-melanoma skin cancers
   (NMSC). Teledermatoscopic diagnosis of melanomas was found to have a
   positive predictive value (PPV) of 63\%. Compared to the conventional
   clinic, cost reductions from running the VLC for 1 year were in excess
   of NZ\$364 000 (or NZ\$1174/patient seen).
   Conclusions The VLC offered an efficient, accurate and cost effective
   way of processing suspected melanoma referrals to the public health
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Medical Research Council Guidelines for Good Clinical
   Practice outlines a three-committee trial oversight structure - the
   day-to-day Trial Management Group, the Data Monitoring Committee and the
   Trial Steering Committee. In this model, the Trial Steering Committee is
   the executive committee that oversees the trial and considers the
   recommendations from the Data Monitoring Committee. There is yet to be
   in-depth consideration establishing the Trial Steering Committee's role
   and functionality.
   Methods: A survey to establish Trial Steering Committee's current
   practices, role and the use and opinion on the Medical Research Council
   guidelines was undertaken within UK Clinical Research Collaborative
   registered Clinical Trials Units.
   Results: Completed surveys were obtained from 38 of 47 fully and
   partially registered Units. Individual items in the survey were analysed
   and reported spanning current Trial Steering Committee practices
   including its role, requirement and experience required for membership;
   methods to identify members; and meeting frequency. Terms (a document
   describing the committee's remit, objectives and functionality) were
   obtained and analysed from 21 of 33 Units with documents in place at
   their Unit. A total of 20 responders suggested aspects of the current
   Medical Research Council Guidelines that need improvement.
   Conclusion: We present the first survey reporting on practices within UK
   Clinical Research Collaborative registered Clinical Trials Units on the
   experience and remits of Trial Steering Committees. We have identified a
   widespread adoption of Medical Research Council Guidelines for Trial
   Steering Committees in the United Kingdom, but limitations in this
   existing provision have been identified that need to be addressed.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical formulas for next-to-leading order temperature corrections to
   the thermal state variables of interacting nucleons in bulk matter are
   derived in the degenerate limit. The formalism developed is applicable
   to a wide class of non-relativistic and relativistic models of hot and
   dense matter currently used in nuclear physics and astrophysics
   (supernovae, proto-neutron stars and neutron star mergers) as well as in
   condensed matter physics. We consider the general case of arbitrary
   dimensionality of momentum space and an arbitrary degree of relativity
   (for relativistic models). For non-relativistic zero-range interactions,
   knowledge of the Landau effective mass suffices to compute
   next-to-leading order effects, but for finite-range interactions,
   momentum derivatives of the Landau effective mass function up to second
   order are required. Results from our analytical formulas are compared
   with the exact results for zero- and finite-range potential and
   relativistic mean-field theoretical models. In all cases, inclusion of
   next-to-leading order temperature effects substantially extends the
   ranges of partial degeneracy for which the analytical treatment remains
   valid. Effects of many-body correlations that deserve further
   investigation are highlighted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{We examined the effect of a mesoscale cyclonic eddy on the
   three-dimensional distribution of Vinciguerria lucetia and Diogenichthys
   laternatus in southern Gulf of California during July 2010. CTD data and
   zooplankton samples collected with a closing-opening net (505 mu m),
   were obtained on 2 transects across the eddy, and on a transect outside
   of the mesoscale structure. In the later the thermocline depth was at
   similar to 40 m where larvae V. lucetia dominated. Opposite to V.
   lucetia distribution, D. laternatus larvae was the dominant species in
   the deepest strata. In the area influenced by the cyclonic eddy (similar
   to 350 m depth and similar to 60 km diameter), the thermocline was sunk
   from similar to 25 m (eddy edge) to similar to 50 m depth (eddy center).
   The isotherms below the thermocline formed a dome from similar to 350 m
   to similar to 100 m depth in the eddy center. This upwelling coincided
   with an increase of D. laternatus larvae in the water column. Compared
   with the transect outside of the cyclonic eddy, the shoaling of the
   isotherms inside the eddy produced not only an increase of D. laternatus
   larvae, also decreased the V. lucetia abundance. These variations in
   larval distribution of both mesopelagic species are closely correlated
   with the mesoscale cyclonic eddy.}},

Abstract = {{IntroductionFemale sexual interest and arousal disorder is personally
   distressing for women. To better understand the mechanism of the
   candidate therapeutic, flibanserin, we determined its effects on an
   index of brain glucose metabolism.
   AimWe hypothesized that chronic treatment with flibanserin would alter
   metabolism in brain regions associated with serotonergic function and
   female sexual behavior.
   MethodsIn a crossover design, eight adult female common marmosets
   (Calithrix jacchus) received daily flibanserin or vehicle. After 7-12
   weeks of treatment, the glucose metabolism radiotracer
   {[}F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was administered to each female
   immediately prior to 30 minutes of interaction with her male pairmate,
   after which females were anesthetized and imaged by positron emission
   tomography. Whole-brain normalized images were analyzed with
   anatomically defined regions of interest. Whole-brain voxelwise mapping
   was used to explore treatment effects. Correlations were examined
   between alterations in metabolism and pairmate social grooming.
   Main Outcome MeasuresChanges in metabolism associated with flibanserin
   were determined for dorsal raphe, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC),
   medial preoptic area of hypothalamus (mPOA), ventromedial nucleus of
   hypothalamus, and field cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) of the hippocampus.
   ResultsIn response to chronic flibanserin, metabolism in mPOA declined,
   and this reduction correlated with increases in pairmate grooming. A
   cluster of voxels in frontal cortico-limbic regions exhibited reduced
   metabolism in response to flibanserin and overlapped with a voxel
   cluster in which reductions in metabolism correlated with increases in
   pairmate grooming. Finally, reductions in mPOA metabolism correlated
   with increases in metabolism in a cluster of voxels in somatosensory
   cortex.
   ConclusionsTaken together, these results suggest that
   flibanserin-induced reductions in female mPOA neural activity increase
   intimate affiliative behavior with male pairmates. AK Converse, Y

Abstract = {{Objectives: Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for patients
   with severe respiratory failure is increasingly common. There has been a
   significant change in the population, technology, and approach used for
   venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation over the last 10 years.
   The objective of this study is to describe the prevalence of
   postdecannulation deep vein thrombosis in the cannulated vessel in
   adults who have received venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
   for severe respiratory failure.
   Design: A single-center, retrospective, observational cohort, electronic
   note review study.
   Setting: Tertiary referral university teaching hospital.
   Patients: Patients commenced on venovenous extracorporeal membrane
   oxygenation for severe respiratory failure.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: We identified 103 patients commenced on
   extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with 81 survivors from December 2011
   to February 2014. We performed postdecannulation venous Doppler
   ultrasound in 88.9\% of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation survivors.
   The prevalence of deep vein thrombosis in the cannulated vessel
   following extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is 8.1/1,000 cannula days
   in patients who were screened.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of deep vein thrombosis following
   decannulation from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe
   respiratory failure is clinically significant, and routine venous
   Doppler ultrasound following decannulation is warranted in this
   population.}},

Title = {{Estimating effectiveness of school-based counselling: Using data from

Abstract = {{Background: There is a growing body of data to show that participation
   in school-based counselling is associated with significant reductions in
   psychological distress. However, this cannot be taken as evidence that
   school-based counselling is effective, as improvements may have happened
   without the intervention. Aims: The purpose of this study was to develop
   a method of estimating the amount of `natural' change that might be
   expected in young people who would attend school-based counselling, such
   that the effects of the intervention over and above this amount could be
   identified. Method: Young Person's CORE (YP-CORE) scores from 74
   participants allocated to waiting list control conditions in four pilot
   trials of school-based counselling in the UK were re-analysed using
   regression models, and a formula was found for estimating the outcomes
   for young people were they not to receive counselling. This was termed
   their Estimated Non-intervention Outcome (ENO), and could then be
   compared against the young person's Actual Outcome (AO), to give an
   estimated intervention effect (EIE). Results: The formula for the ENO
   was 4.17 + 0.64 9 baseline score. Using this, we calculated a mean EIE
   for 256 young people in a cohort evaluation study of school-based
   counselling, which showed that the counselling was associated with large
   and significantly greater change than would be expected without the
   intervention (Cohen's d = 0.91). Discussion: The method presented in
   this paper is a simple means for improving the accuracy of estimations
   of treatment effectiveness, helping to adjust for changes due to
   spontaneous recovery and other non-treatment effects.}},

Abstract = {{The skin's mechanical integrity is maintained by an organized and robust
   dermal extracellular matrix (ECM). Resistance to mechanical disruption
   hinges primarily on homeostasis of the dermal collagen fibril
   architecture, which is regulated, at least in part, by members of the
   small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. Here we present data
   linking protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha) to the regulated expression
   of multiple ECM components including SLRPs. Global microarray profiling
   reveals deficiencies in ECM gene expression in PKC alpha(-/-) skin
   correlating with abnormal collagen fibril morphology, disorganized
   dermal architecture, and reduced skin strength. Detailed analysis of the
   skin and wounds from wild-type and PKC alpha(-/-) mice reveals a failure
   to upregulate collagen and other ECM components in response to injury,
   resulting in delayed granulation tissue deposition in PKC alpha(-/-)
   wounds. Thus, our data reveal a previously unappreciated role for PKC
   alpha in the regulation of ECM structure and deposition during skin
   wound healing.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The endocannabinoid system contributes to the regulation of
   emotions, stress, memory, and cognition. It has been reported that
   endocannabinoids cause GABAergic inhibition and dopaminergic increase in
   the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal systems, thus playing a part in the
   neurobiology of schizophrenia. In this study, we investigate cannabinoid
   receptor 1 (CNR1) gene polymorphisms in schizophrenia patients.
   Methods: CNR1 gene polymorphisms were studied in 66 schizophrenia
   patients and 65 healthy controls. To obtain genomic DNA, proteinase K
   digestion and the salt-chloroform method were used. Clinical Global
   Impression severity scale (CGI-S) and Positive and Negative Syndrome
   Scale (PANSS) were administered to evaluate the severity of
   schizophrenia symptoms. CNR1 gene polymorphism was determined by using
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Restriction Fragment Length
   Polymorphism (RFLP), and Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP)
   methods for the Rs6454674, Rs806368, and Rs1049353 sites.
   Results: There was no difference in CNR1 gene polymorphisms between
   schizophrenia patients and control groups (Rs6454674 T/G; p=0.973,
   Rs806368 T/C; p=0.349, Rs1049353 A/G; p=1.00). However, CGI-S, PANSS
   total, PANSS positive, PANSS negative and PANSS general psychopathology
   scores were significantly lower in schizophrenia patients with RS6454674
   polymorphism than in those not showing polymorphism.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that CNR1 gene polymorphisms may be
   associated with clinical symptoms and disease severity in schizophrenia
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury emissions from artisanal mining present a significant
   development and environmental challenge globally. The Colombia Mercury
   Project (CMP), a joint initiative of the United Nations Industrial
   Development Organization (UNIDO), the Government of Antioquia, Colombia,
   and various other organizations, conducted a three year mercury
   reduction initiative in the Department of Antioquia. The CMP estimate
   that they prevented 46-70 tonnes of mercury from being used and released
   by various methods: technical assistance, elimination of whole ore
   amalgamation, mercury vapour capture, and introduction of alternative
   (and cleaner) extraction technologies all contributed to these
   successes.
   Maps of airborne mercury concentrations show the distribution and
   intensity of mercury emissions that can be used to estimate human health
   risk. Direct comparison with international air quality standards is
   possible by extrapolating annual average concentrations from short term
   atmospheric monitoring. Mercury vapour concentrations in the urban core
   of Segovia, Colombia have decreased 50\% from 2010 to 2012, despite a
   30\% increase in gold production. Part of the reduction may be displaced
   emissions, as sources have been relocated to adjacent rural areas. This
   is the first time that reductions in environmental concentrations of
   mercury associated with a mercury abatement project have been measured.
   The mercury mitigation efforts applied by UNIDO provide a hopeful model
   for future remediation campaigns. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we review the issue of defining energy for test particles
   on a background stationary spacetime. We revisit different notions of
   energy as defined by different observers. As is well-known, the
   existence of a timelike isometry allows for the notion of total
   conserved energy to be well defined. We use this well-known quantity to
   show that a gravitational potential energy can be consistently defined.
   As examples, we study the case of the exterior regions of an
   asymptotically flat black hole and of the Lambda > 0 Schwarzschild-de
   Sitter (SdS) case, where an asymptotic region is not available. We then
   consider the situation in which the test particle is absorbed by the
   black hole and analyze the energetics in detail. In particular, we show
   that the notion of horizon energy as defined by the isolated horizons
   formalism provides a satisfactory notion of energy compatible with the
   particle's total conserved energy. With these choices, there is a global
   conservation of energy. Finally, we comment on a recent proposal to
   define energy of the black hole as seen by a nearby observer at rest,
   for which this feature is lost.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ATHLETIC TRAINING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1267-1276}},

Abstract = {{Context: Athletic trainers (ATs) commonly use psychological skills
   during sport rehabilitation. However, little is known about their
   ability to accurately implement these skills.
   Objective: To assess ATs' skills in identifying psychological symptoms,
   selecting appropriate strategies, and making referral decisions for
   athletes experiencing various degrees of psychological distress.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Participants were recruited using the National Athletic
   Trainers' Association professional member database.
   Patients or Other Participants: Of the 2998 ATs who were selected
   randomly, 494 (16.5\%) partially completed the questionnaire and 326
   (10.9\%) completed the entire survey (mean age = 34.7 +/- 10.8 years,
   mean years of experience = 11.3 +/- 9.9).
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Using the Web-based questionnaire created for
   this study, we collected ATs' demographic information and assessed their
   perceptions about responsibilities as ATs, psychosocial competencies,
   training in sport psychology, and referral behaviors. Additionally,
   respondents were asked to identify symptoms, match psychological
   strategies (eg, goal setting, imagery, progressive muscle relaxation),
   and make referral decisions for athletes in 3 case vignettes.
   Results: The ATs demonstrated high accuracy in identifying symptoms and
   making referral decisions but struggled in selecting appropriate
   psychosocial strategies for athletes. Stepwise regression analyses
   revealed that ATs who had had specific coursework in sport psychology
   were able to more accurately identify symptoms (t = 3.01, P < .01), and
   those ATs with more experience reported lower accuracy scores for their
   intended course of action (t = -2.25, P < .05).
   Conclusions: Our analogue research design provided new insights into
   ATs' knowledge and use of sport psychology in practice. The results

Abstract = {{Here is described a sibling incest case involving a brother and his
   underage sister, both native from Ivory Coast. A police investigation
   was conducted, and suspects were restricted to two subjects,
   specifically the father and older brother of the underage girl. However,
   no clear indication of the perpetrator could be obtained, and therefore
   the judge demanded a paternity testing. DNA analysis was conducted on
   the underage girl, her daughter and her older brother, while the
   father's victim refused to provide his own DNA sample. The analysis of
   autosomal STRs was supported by X-STRs. As expected, the latter analysis
   proved to be decisive in the resolution of the case, confirming that the
   brother was the female newborn's father and the rapist of his underage
   sister. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We formulate a generalization of the volume conjecture for planar
   graphs. Denoting by the Kauffman bracket of the graph whose edges are
   decorated by real ``colors{''} c, the conjecture states that, under
   suitable conditions, certain evaluations of grow exponentially as and
   the growth rate is the volume of a truncated hyperbolic hyperideal
   polyhedron whose one-skeleton is (up to a local modification around all
   the vertices) and with dihedral angles given by c. We provide evidence
   for it, by deriving a system of recursions for the Kauffman brackets of
   planar graphs, generalizing the Gordon-Schulten recursion for the
   quantum 6j-symbols. Assuming that does grow exponentially these
   recursions provide differential equations for the growth rate, which are
   indeed satisfied by the volume (the Schlafli equation); moreover, any
   small perturbation of the volume function that is still a solution to
   these equations, is a perturbation by an additive constant. In the
   appendix we also provide a proof outlined elsewhere of the conjecture
   for an infinite family of planar graphs including the tetrahedra.}},

Abstract = {{A poly(melamine)/graphene oxide (PM/GO) layer modified on a glassy

   adsorption and electrochemical reduction of TNT via the AdCSV technique
   with two linear ranges, 1-90 mu g L-1 and 100-1000 mu g L-1, a detection
   limit of 0.34 mu g L-1 and a quantitation limit of 1.14 mu g L-1. The
   PM/GO/GCE provided for a high sensitivity, good repeatability and

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Spot measurements of methane emission rate (n = 18 700) by 24 Angus
   steers fed mixed rations from GrowSafe feeders were made over 3- to
   6-min periods by a GreenFeed emission monitoring (GEM) unit. The data
   were analysed to estimate daily methane production (DMP; g/day) and
   derived methane yield (MY; g/kg dry matter intake (DMI)). A
   one-compartment dose model of spot emission rate v. time since the
   preceding meal was compared with the models of Wood (1967) and Dijkstra
   et al. (1997) and the average of spot measures. Fitted values for DMP
   were calculated from the area under the curves. Two methods of relating
   methane and feed intakes were then studied: the classical calculation of
   MY as DMP/DMI (kg/day); and a novel method of estimating DMP from time
   and size of preceding meals using either the data for only the two meals
   preceding a spot measurement, or all meals for 3 days prior. Two
   approaches were also used to estimate DMP from spot measurements:
   fitting of splines on a `per-animal per-day' basis and an alternate
   approach of modelling DMP after each feed event by least squares (using
   Solver), summing (for each animal) the contributions from each feed
   event by best-fitting a one-compartment model. Time since the preceding
   meal was of limited value in estimating DMP. Even when the meal sizes
   and time intervals between a spot measurement and all feeding events in
   the previous 72 h were assessed, only 16.9\% of the variance in spot
   emission rate measured by GEM was explained by this feeding information.
   While using the preceding meal alone gave a biased (underestimate) of
   DMP, allowing for a longer feed history removed this bias. A power
   analysis taking into account the sources of variation in DMP indicated
   that to obtain an estimate of DMP with a 95\% confidence interval within
   5\% of the observed 64 days mean of spot measures would require 40
   animals measured over 45 days (two spot measurements per day) or 30
   animals measured over 55 days. These numbers suggest that spot
   measurements could be made in association with feed efficiency tests
   made over 70 days. Spot measurements of enteric emissions can be used to
   define DMP but the number of animals and samples are larger than are
   needed when day-long measures are made.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{71-85}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many studies in literature have shown that energy-aware routing (EAR)
   can significantly reduce energy consumption for backbone networks. Also,
   as an arising concern in networking research area, the
   protocol-independent traffic redundancy elimination (RE) technique helps
   to reduce (a.k.a compress) traffic load on backbone network. Motivation
   from a formulation perspective, we first present an extended model of
   the classical multi-commodity flow problem with compressible flows.
   Moreover, our model is robust with fluctuation of traffic demand and
   compression rate. In details, we allow any set of a predefined size of
   traffic flows to deviate simultaneously from their nominal volumes or
   compression rates. As an applicable example, we use this model to
   combine redundancy elimination and energy-aware routing to increase
   energy efficiency for a backbone network. Using this extra knowledge on
   the dynamics of the traffic pattern, we are able to significantly
   increase energy efficiency for the network. We formally define the
   problem and model it as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). We then
   propose an efficient heuristic algorithm that is suitable for large
   networks. Simulation results with real traffic traces on Abilene, Geant
   and Germany50 networks show that our approach allows for 16-28\% extra
   energy savings with respect to the classical EAR model. (C) 2015

   Background. Over 28,000 nurses in the UK can prescribe the same
   medicines as doctors provided that it is in their level of experience
   and competence. Over 30\%, mostly in general practice, prescribe
   medicines for patients with diabetes.
   Design. A comparative case study.
   Method. Nurses managing care of people with Type 2 diabetes were
   recruited in twelve general practices in England; six could prescribe,
   six could not. Patients, recruited by nurses, were followed up for 6
   months (2011-2012).
   Results. The patient sample comprised 131 in prescriber sites, 83 in
   non-prescriber sites. Patients of prescribers had been diagnosed and
   cared for by the nurse longer than those of non-prescribers. There were
   no differences in reported self-care activities or HbA1c test results
   between the patients of prescribers and non-prescribers. Mean HbA1c
   decreased significantly in both groups over 6 months. Patients of
   prescribers were more satisfied. Consultation duration was longer for
   prescribers (by average of 7.7 minutes). Non-prescribing nurses sought
   support from other healthcare professionals more frequently. Most
   prescribing nurses were on a higher salary band than non-prescribers.
   Conclusion. Clinical outcomes of patients managed by prescribing and
   non-prescribing diabetes nurses are similar. Prescribing nurses had
   longer relationships with their patients and longer consultations,
   possibly contributing to higher satisfaction with care. Employment costs
   of prescribing nurses are potentially higher.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The performance of a body area network (BAN) is strongly dependent on
   several parameters which make wireless communication quite challenging.
   For instance, the performance of the antenna itself could be affected by
   its geometric deformation when the structure is directly integrated into
   clothes. Operation of the antenna close to the human body necessitates
   adjusting its design for the intended applications whereas the maximum
   SAR value estimated in such conditions has to respect the standards. In
   this context, simulation tools that can take into account specific
   biological models offer a range of possibilities for investigating and
   optimizing the performance of BAN devices. Two different applications
   are presented here: the case of an RFID tag operating at 870 MHz, and a
   UWB antenna working in a frequency range between 3 and 6 GHz. The
   simulation tools developed by CST are used in this context to optimize
   the implementation of BAN devices shown in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Archaeological interpretations of the capital region of ancient empires
   often rely on documentary sources and assume the existence of a highly
   integrated and institutionalized state polity.
   A multiscalar archaeological study of the imperial heartland of the Inca
   empire (c. 1400-1530s) reveals variable manifestations in Inca power
   from the period of local expansion until the European invasions of the
   1530s. Large-scale patterning from numerous regional surveys identifies
   variations in pre-Inca and Inca settlement patterns and the distribution
   of Inca architecture and pottery. More intensive analyses from the
   Sacred Valley, a study region lying immediately to the north of the Inca
   capital, reveal additional patterns of interaction that contrast early
   Inca expansion practices with later generations of royal estate
   development. Excavations from domestic and public buildings at the large
   upland village of Pukara Pantillijlla indicate limited Inca efforts to
   incorporate local horticulturalists and herders within their existing
   villages. The variability of Inca power in the Sacred Valley and the
   kin-based nature of the institutional forces transforming valley-bottom
   farming areas draw attention to the prevalent role of Inca elite kinship
   practices for state formation and institutional development.
   These observations raise important questions about the role of kinship
   in other non-Western states and empires. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{This study will be of interest to anyone concerned with a critical
   appraisal of mental health service users' and carers' participation in
   research collaboration and with the potential of the postcolonial
   paradigm of cultural safety to contribute to the service user research
   (SUR) movement. The history and nature of the mental health field and
   its relationship to colonial processes provokes a consideration of
   whether cultural safety could focus attention on diversity, power
   imbalance, cultural dominance and structural inequality, identified as
   barriers and tensions in SUR. We consider these issues in the context of
   state-driven approaches towards SUR in planning and evaluation and the
   concurrent rise of the SUR movement in the UK and Australia, societies
   with an intimate involvement in processes of colonisation. We consider
   the principles and motivations underlying cultural safety and SUR in the
   context of the policy agenda informing SUR. We conclude that while both
   cultural safety and SUR are underpinned by social constructionism
   constituting similarities in principles and intent, cultural safety has
   additional dimensions. Hence, we call on researchers to use the
   explicitly political and self-reflective process of cultural safety to
   think about and address issues of diversity, power and social justice in
   research collaboration.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, spray drying from aqueous solutions, using the
   surface-active agent sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) as a solubilizer, was
   explored as a production method for co-amorphous simvastatin-lysine
   (SVS-LYS) at 1:1 molar mixtures, which previously have been observed to
   form a co-amorphous mixture upon ball milling. In addition, a
   spray-dried formulation of SVS without LYS was prepared.
   Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) revealed that SLS coated the
   SVS and SVS-LYS particles upon spray drying. X-ray powder diffraction
   (XRPD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that in the
   spray-dried formulations the remaining crystallinity originated from SLS
   only. The best dissolution properties and a spring and parachute effect
   were found for SVS spray-dried from a 5\% SLS solution without LYS.
   Despite the presence of at least partially crystalline SLS in the
   mixtures, all the studied formulations were able to significantly extend
   the stability of amorphous SVS compared to previous co-amorphous
   formulations of SVS. The best stability (at least 12 months in dry
   conditions) was observed when SLS was spray-dried with SVS (and LYS). In
   conclusion, spray drying of SVS and LYS from aqueous surfactant
   solutions was able to produce formulations with improved physical
   stability for amorphous SVS.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC ORTHOPAEDICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{E90-E92}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Stable slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) has been shown
   to have a lower rate of avascular necrosis than unstable SCFE. A recent
   study found increased intracapsular hip pressures in the setting of
   unstable SCFE, thus increasing the risk of osteonecrosis. The purpose of
   this study was to measure the intracapsular pressure in stable SCFE and
   compare it to the intracapsular pressure in normal hips and in unstable
   SCFE.
   Methods: Thirteen hips with stable SCFE and 15 hips with unstable SCFE
   were identified. Using a side-bored needle, intracapsular hip pressures
   were measured at the time of surgery. Within these 2 study groups, 11
   unaffected (normal) hips were also measured. Diastolic blood pressure
   and mean arterial pressure at the time of measurement were also
   recorded.
   Results: The average intracapsular hip pressure in the stable SCFE group
   was 27.0mm Hg, whereas the average pressure in the unstable SCFE group
   was 48.2mm Hg and the average pressure in the normal group was 21.8mm
   Hg. There was no significant difference between the normal and stable
   SCFE groups. There was a statistically significant difference between
   the stable SCFE and unstable SCFE groups (P < 0.001). We found similar
   trends when comparing the intracapsular hip pressure as a percentage of
   the mean arterial pressure as well as the difference between diastolic
   blood pressure and hip pressure.
   Conclusions: As expected, the intracapsular pressure in the setting of
   stable SCFE approaches that of normal hips. This may explain why the
   risk of AVN in stable SCFE is significantly lower than that of unstable
   SCFE. It also supports the idea that capsulotomy is indicated for
   unstable slips to decrease the elevated hip pressure but not in stable
   SCFE.}},

Abstract = {{The intersectoral and interdisciplinary nature of health promotion gives
   rise to ethical questions. This is because health promotion depends upon
   alliances between people who often have different perspectives on what
   matters in particular cases or different visions of the good society.
   This paper draws on the ambivalent relationship that health promoters
   can have with biomedicine to illustrate and explore the nature of these
   ethical questions. Examples from everyday life are used to underline the
   familiar nature of the kinds of coalitions and compromises that are
   needed to work alongside others with different values to oneself. It is
   suggested that analogous kinds of compromise are needed in health
   promotion and that this requires a form of diplomatic ethics' for health
   promoters that, in turn, raises questions about their ethical integrity.}},

Abstract = {{The First World War had brought Britain's largest employer, the Post
   Office, into the forefront of the war effort. Not only was it a major
   force in the nation's communications during the war, but it was also the
   single largest employer of women. When the government began planning for
   a future war effort, the centrality of the Post Office to these plans
   was a subject of heated and controversial debates. The mobilization of
   sufficient `manpower' and the protection of its staff were its chief
   concerns. This article will examine the nature of the Post Office plan
   for a future war, and explain how and why this created both tension
   between the government, and a greater recognition for the need for
   collaboration between all government departments in the national
   interest.}},

Abstract = {{The current study investigated first language (L1) effects on listener
   judgment of comprehensibility and accentedness in second language (L2)
   speech. The participants were 45 university-level adult speakers of
   English from three L1 backgrounds (Chinese, Hindi, Farsi), performing a
   picture narrative task. Ten native English listeners used continuous
   sliding scales to evaluate the speakers' audio recordings for
   comprehensibility and accentedness as well as 10 linguistic variables
   drawn from the domains of pronunciation, fluency, lexis, grammar, and
   discourse. Comprehensibility was associated with several linguistic
   variables (segmentals, prosody, fluency, lexis, grammar), but
   accentedness was primarily linked to pronunciation (segmentals, word
   stress, intonation). The relative strength of these associations also
   varied as a function of the speakers' L1, especially for
   comprehensibility, with Chinese speakers influenced chiefly by
   pronunciation variables (segmental errors), Hindi speakers by
   lexicogrammar variables, and Farsi speakers showing no strong
   association with any linguistic variable. Results overall suggest that
   speakers' L1 plays an important role in listener judgments of L2
   comprehensibility and that instructors aiming to promote L2 speakers'
   communicative success may need to expand their teaching targets beyond
   segmentals to include prosody-, fluency-, and lexicogrammar-based
   targets.}},

Abstract = {{Modern Tokamaks have evolved from the initial axisymmetric circular
   plasma shape to an elongated axisymmetric plasma shape that improves the
   energy confinement, which is one of the key factors to improve fusion
   reactor performance. However, the elongated plasma cross section
   introduces a vertical instability that requires a real-time feedback
   control loop to stabilize the plasma vertical position and velocity. At
   the Tokamak a Configuration Variable (TCV) in-vessel poloidal field
   coils driven by fast switching power supplies are used to stabilize
   highly elongated plasmas. TCV plasma experiments have used a PID
   algorithm based controller to correct the plasma vertical position. In
   late 2013 experiments a new optimal real-time controller was tested
   improving the stability of the plasma. This contribution describes the
   new optimal real-time controller developed. The choice of the model that
   describes the plasma response to the actuators is discussed. The high
   order model that is initially implemented needs the application of a
   mathematical order reduction and the validation of the new reduced
   model. The lower order model is used to derive the time optimal control
   law. A new method for the construction of the switching curves of a
   bang-bang controller is presented that is based on the state-space
   trajectories that optimize the time to target of the system. The final
   control algorithm and its implementation are described and preliminary
   experimental results are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of wealth generated in the tourism industry among the
   labor force should be considered one out of the facets of the social
   tourism sustainability. Literature highlights that tourism firms'
   practices have an impact on labor well-being. However, it also warns
   that national institutions may condition the adoption of these practices
   by firms, and so institutions might become a challenge for well-being.
   This study analyzes the effect of institutions on well-being, and
   particularly it differentiates between employees and entrepreneurs as
   human resources in the tourism industry. The empirical analysis carried
   out on a sample of 1,352 employees and 302 entrepreneurs located in 27
   European countries, confirms the direct effect of national institutions
   on well-being at work. Because institutions would have affect human
   resources' well-being, the tourism authorities should pay attention to
   the governance of this industry.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Medical competence requires the acquisition of theoretical
   knowledge and technical skills. Severe trauma management teaching is
   poorly developed during internship. Nevertheless, the basics of major
   trauma management should be acquired by every future physician. For this
   reason, the major trauma course (MTC), an educational course in major
   traumatology, has been developed for medical students. Our objective was
   to evaluate, via a high fidelity medical simulator, the impact of the
   MTC on medical student skills concerning major trauma management.
   Methods: The MTC contains 3 teaching modalities: posters with associated
   audio-guides, a procedural workshop on airway management and a teaching
   session using a medical simulator. Skills evaluation was performed 1
   month before (step 1) and 1 month after (step 3) the MTC (step 2).
   Nineteen students were individually evaluated on 2 different major
   trauma scenarios. The primary endpoint was the difference between steps
   1 and 3, in a combined score evaluating: admission, equipment,
   monitoring and safety (skill set 1) and systematic clinical examinations
   (skill set 2).
   Results: After the course, the combined primary outcome score improved
   by 47\% (P < 0.01). Scenario choice or the order of use had no
   significant influence on the skill set evaluations.
   Conclusion: This study shows improvement in student skills for major
   trauma management, which we attribute mainly to the major trauma course
   developed in our institution. (C) 2015 Societe francaise d'anesthesie et

Abstract = {{Whole person care is deemed important within UK medical practice and is
   therefore fundamental in education. However, spirituality is an aspect
   of this often neglected. Confusion and discomfort exists regarding how
   care relating to issues of spirituality and health (S\&H) should be
   delivered. Different interpretations have even led to disciplinary
   action with professionals seeking to address these needs

   -offering-to-prayfor-patients-recovery.html
   .Nurse-suspended-for-offering-to-prayfor-patients-recovery.html.
   Previous research shows 45 \% of patients want spiritual needs to be
   addressed within their care (Jackson and Summerton 2008). Two-thirds of
   healthcare professionals want to do this. However, lack of knowledge is
   a significant barrier (Moynihan 2008). Little is known regarding how
   Medical schools address S\&H, only one limited study exists in the
   literature (Koenig et al. in Int J Psychiat Med 40: 391-8, 2010).
   Thirty-two UK educational institutions were surveyed. The chosen survey
   was compiled by Koenig and Meador (Spirituality and Health in Education
   and Researc. Duke University, Durham, 2008). Fifty-nine academics were
   contacted across UK medical schools, and the response rate was 57.6 \%.
   Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0. 5.6 \% institutions
   provide required and dedicated S\&H teaching, 63.4 \% provided it as an
   integrated component. Nearly 40 \% felt staff were not adequately
   trained to teach S\&H but welcomed opportunities for training. S\&H is
   given value in undergraduate education but with little evidence of
   formal teaching. Institutions feel that this area is addressed within
   other topic delivery, although previous studies have shown integrating
   S\&H with PBL leads to poor clinical performance (Musick et al. in Acad
   Psychiatry 27(2):67-73, 2003). Seminars or lectures are students'
   preferred methods of learning (Guck and Kavan in Med Teach
   28(8):702-707, 2006). Further consideration should be given towards S\&H
   delivery and training for practice.}},

   as a surrogate host, reveals a novel C. burnetii gene (IcaA) involved in
   the inhibition of caspase activation. Expression of IcaA in L.
   pneumophila inhibited the caspase-11 activation in macrophages.
   Moreover, icaA(-) mutants of C. burnetii failed to suppress the
   caspase-11-mediated inflammasome activation induced by L. pneumophila.
   Our data reveal IcaA as a novel C. burnetii effector protein that is
   secreted by the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system and interferes with the
   caspase-11-induced, non-canonical activation of the inflammasome.}},

   the impact of music and seeks to explain e-behavioral intentions through

   virtual art gallery. The results reveal that music fosters e-behavioral
   intentions. They also emphasize that immersion and aesthetic experience
   (emotions and contemplation) mediate this effect. The findings,
   confirming the impact of music on immersion, could thus help managers

Abstract = {{Diversified and focused business models may affect foreign bank
   efficiency differently. We investigate whether there is an optimal
   business model along three business dimensions assets, funding and
   income and which business model is optimal for foreign banks in a
   financial center. We apply recently developed non-parametric methods
   with bootstrap to estimate group efficiency, to test for differences
   across groups and finally to analyze the link between bank efficiency
   and diversification measures. Using Luxembourg bank data that include
   the financial crisis, we find that there is no unique business model.
   The most efficient business model appears to be a focused asset, funding
   and income strategy. Banks' organizational forms play a role; branches
   may be preferable to subsidiaries prior to the financial crisis, whereas
   bank subsidiaries perform better than branches during the financial
   crisis. However, branches diversified in assets, funding and income
   exploit efficiency advantages during the financial crisis. (C) 2015

   compared to the control). The presence of glycerol in the formulation,
   on the contrary, favoured water uptake during cooking and resulted in
   softer products. At a molecular level, gluten did not significantly

Abstract = {{The paper presents a hybrid ensemble of diverse classifiers for logo and
   trademark symbols recognition. The proposed ensemble is composed of four
   types of different member classifiers. The first one compares color
   distribution of the logo patterns and is responsible for sifting out
   images of different color distribution. The second of the classifiers is
   based on the structural tensor recognition of local phase histograms. A
   proposed modification in this module consists of tensor computation in
   the space of the morphological scale-space. Thanks to this, more
   discriminative histograms describing global shapes are obtained. Next in
   the chain, is a novel member classifier that joins the Hausdorff
   distance with the correspondence measure of the log-polar patches
   computed around the corner points. This sparse classifier allows
   reliable comparison of even highly deformed patterns. The last member
   classifier relies on the statistical affine moment invariants which
   describe global shapes. However, a real advantage is obtained by joining
   the aforementioned base classifiers into a hybrid ensemble of
   classifiers, as proposed in this paper. Thanks to this a more accurate
   response and generalizing properties are obtained at reasonable
   computational requirements. Experimental results show good recognition
   accuracy even for the highly deformed logo patterns, as well as fair
   generalization properties which support human search and logo assessment
   tasks.}},

Journal = {{ECONOMIC MODELLING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{454-459}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the spirit of Merton (1973), we assert that temporary aggregate
   market illiquidity is compensated for in the form of higher conditional
   market returns. In order to test this hypothesis, we use two available
   liquidity proxies, namely versions of the Amihud illiquidity measure and
   a measure based on exchange traded fund prices. Our investigation is
   based on vector autoregressive models for the German stock market
   between July 2006 and June 2010. The fund-based illiquidity proxy
   dominates in capturing consistent results for the determination of
   time-varying market returns. Temporary illiquidity is indeed compensated
   for by higher market returns. We confirm a bidirectional relation
   between illiquidity and market returns, i.e. current returns depend on
   lagged illiquidity and current illiquidity can be determined by a
   combination of past returns as well as past illiquidity. The relation
   shows that illiquidity is persistent and driven by market declines. (C)

   they cause to the system's PUs, and we examine how SUs can react to
   maximize their achievable transmission rate in this setting. We show
   that the resulting noncooperative game admits a unique Nash equilibrium
   under very mild assumptions on the pricing mechanism employed by the
   network operator and under both static and ergodic (fast-fading) channel
   conditions. In addition, we derive a dynamic power allocation policy
   that converges to equilibrium within a few iterations (even for large
   numbers of users) and that relies only on local-and possibly
   imperfect-signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio measurements;
   importantly, the proposed algorithm retains its convergence properties
   even in the ergodic channel regime, despite its inherent stochasticity.
   Our theoretical analysis is complemented by extensive numerical
   simulations that illustrate the performance, robustness, and scalability
   properties of the proposed pricing scheme under realistic network
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We carried out the first survey of Hymenolepis spp. infection in pet
   rodents in Italy. Fresh fecal samples were collected from 172 pet
   rodents as follows: guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus; n=60), squirrels
   (Callosciurus finlaysonii, Callosciurus prevosti, Tamias striatus,
   Tamias sibiricus, Sciurus calorinensis; n =52), hamsters (Phodopus
   campbelli, Mesocricetus auratus; n=30), chinchillas (Chinchilla
   lanigera; n=13), rats (Rattus norvegicus; n=10), and mice (Mus
   minutoides; n=7). These animals were housed either in pet shops or in
   private houses. All fecal samples were processed using the FLOTAC pellet
   technique to assess the number of eggs per gram (EPG) of feces. Eggs of
   Hymenolepis nana were found in 24 out of 172 (13.9 \%; 95 \% confidence
   interval = 9.3-20.2 \%) pet rodents. Of those rodents, 41.6 \% (10/24)
   were rats (mean EPG = 55.7; range = 2-200), 29.2 \% (7/24) mice (mean
   EPG = 64.5; range = 32-120), 25.0 \% (6/24) were chinchillas (mean EPG =
   25.5; range = 10-50), and 4.2 \% (1/24) hamsters (P. campbelli) (EPG =
   86.0). In addition, Hymenolepis diminuta eggs were found in 2 out of 172
   (1.2 \%; 95 \% confidence interval = 0.2-4.6 \%) rodents examined, both
   of which (100 \%; 2/2) were pet squirrels (C. prevosti) (mean EPG = 10;
   range = 4-16). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a
   natural infection of H. diminuta in pet squirrels.}},

Title = {{2-Amino-thiophene derivatives present antileishmanial activity mediated

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the effects of 2-amino-thiophene derivatives on the
   promastigote and amastigote forms of Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis
   and their possible mechanisms of action. Initially, we evaluated the
   antileishmanial activity of ten 2-amino-thiophene derivatives on
   promastigote and axenic amastigote forms of Leishmania amazonensis and
   their cytotoxicity against murine macrophages and human red blood cells.
   Three promising compounds were selected for studies of the cell death
   process using flow cytometry analysis and a DNA fragmentation assay. The
   effects of the compounds were assessed on intramacrophagic amastigotes,
   and the modulation of cytokine and NO production was investigated. All
   thiophene derivatives showed antileishmanial activity against
   promastigotes and axenic amastigotes with less toxicity for murine
   macrophages and human red blood cells. The best values were obtained for
   compounds containing a lateral indole ring. Docking studies suggested
   that these compounds played an important role in inhibiting
   trypanothione reductase (TryR) activity. The selected compounds SB-200,
   SB-44, and SB-83 induced apoptosis in promastigotes involving
   phosphatidylserine externalization and DNA fragmentation in a pattern
   similar to that observed for the positive control. Additionally, SB-200,
   SB-44, and SB-83 significantly reduced the infection index of
   macrophages by the parasites; for compounds SB-200 and SB-83 this
   reduction was associated with increased TNF-alpha, IL-12, and NO levels.
   This study demonstrated the effective and selective action of
   2-amino-thiophene derivatives against L. amazonensis, resulting in
   apoptosis-like cell death and immunomodulation in vitro. The results
   suggest that they are promising compounds for the development of new
   leishmanicidal drugs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Trichospilus diatraeae Cherian \& Margabandhu (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae)
   is a gregarious parasitoid of a wide variety of lepidopterans including
   melonworm, Diaphania hyalinata L. (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), pupae in the
   field. The latter is a key pest of Cucurbitaceae; it primarily damages
   their leaves and secondarily their fruit, and it reduces the
   productivity of the plants. The aim of this study was to determine the
   effect of the age of D. hyalinata pupae on the development of T.
   diatraeae. Diaphania hyalinata pupae aged 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 h
   were individualized and exposed to eight 48-h-old T. diatraeae females
   for 24 h. The emergence and parasitism rates, sex ratios, and
   longevities of T. diatraeae males and females were found to be similar
   with D. hyalinata pupae of different ages. The number of progeny, width
   of the head capsule, and duration of the life cycle (egg to adult) of T.
   diatraeae decreased with the increasing age of D. hyalinata pupae.
   Importantly, the number of parasitoid progeny per host pupa and size of
   the parasitoid adults were larger when 24-h-old host pupae were
   parasitized than when 48- to 144-h-old pupae were parasitized.
   Trichospilus diatraeae was very effective in parasitizing D. hyalinata
   pupae of ages ranging from 24 to 144 h.}},

Abstract = {{Energy traders and decision-makers need accurate wind power forecasts.
   For this purpose, numerical weather predictions (NWPs) are often
   statistically postprocessed to correct systematic errors. This requires
   a dataset of past forecasts and observations that is often limited by
   frequent NWP model enhancements that change the statistical model
   properties. Reforecasts that recompute past forecasts with a recent
   model provide considerably longer datasets but usually have weaker
   setups than operational models. This study tests the reforecasts from
   the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the
   European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) for wind
   power predictions. The NOAA reforecast clearly performs worse than the
   ECMWF reforecast, the operational ECMWF deterministic and ensemble
   forecasts, and a limited-area model of the Austrian weather service
   {[}Zentralanstalt fur Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG)]. On the
   contrary, the ECMWF reforecast has, of all tested models, the smallest
   squared errors and one of the highest financial values in an energy
   market.}},

Title = {{Orchestrating care: nursing practice with hospitalised older adults}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OLDER PEOPLE NURSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Background. The increased incidence of health challenges with aging
   means that nurses are increasingly caring for older adults, often in
   hospital settings. Research about the complexity of nursing practice
   with this population remains limited.
   Objective. To seek an explanation of nursing practice with hospitalised
   older adults.
   Methods. Design. A grounded theory study guided by symbolic
   interactionism was used to explore nursing practice with hospitalised
   older adults from a nursing perspective. Glaserian grounded theory
   methods were used to develop a mid-range theory after analysis of 375
   hours of participant observation, 35 interviews with 24 participants and
   review of selected documents.
   Results. The theory of orchestrating care was developed to explain how
   nurses are continuously trying to manage their work environments by
   understanding the status of the patients, their unit, mobilising the
   assistance of others and stretching available resources to resolve their
   problem of providing their older patients with what they perceived as
   `good care' while sustaining themselves as `good' nurses. They described
   their practice environments as hard and under-resourced. Orchestrating
   care is comprised of two subprocesses: building synergy and minimising
   strain. These two processes both facilitated and constrained each other
   and nurses' abilities to orchestrate care.
   Conclusions. Although system issues presented serious constraints to
   nursing practice, the ways in which nurses were making meaning of their
   work environment both aided them in managing their challenges and
   constrained their agency. Implications for practice. Nurses need to be
   encouraged to share their important perspective about older adult care.
   Administrators have a role to play in giving nurses voice in workplace
   committees and in forums. Further research is needed to better
   understand how multidisciplinary teams influence care of hospitalized
   older adults.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-trace analysis of actinides, such as Pu isotopes and Np-237, in
   bioassay samples is often needed for radiation protection programs at
   nuclear facilities. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), particularly
   the compact ETH Zurich system ``Tandy{''}, has evolved over the years as
   one of the most sensitive, selective, and robust techniques for actinide
   analysis. Employment of the AMS technique can reduce the demands on
   sample preparation chemistry and increase sample analysis throughput,
   due to very low instrumental detection limit, high rejection of
   interferences, and low susceptibility to adverse sample matrices.
   Initial research and development tests were performed to explore and
   demonstrate the analytical capability of AMS for Pu and Np urine
   bioassay. In this study, urine samples spiked with femtogram levels of
   Np and Pu isotopes were prepared and measured using compact ETH AMS
   system and the results showed excellent analytical capability for
   measuring Np and Pu isotopes at femtogram/litre levels in urine.}},

Abstract = {{Biotin is a B vitamin involved in multiple metabolic pathways. In
   humans, biotin deficiency is relatively rare but can cause dermatitis,
   alopecia, and perosis. Low biotin levels occur in individuals with
   type-2 diabetes, and supplementation with biotin plus chromium may
   improve blood sugar control. The acute effect on pancreatic gene
   expression of biotin repletion following chronic deficiency is unclear,
   therefore we induced biotin deficiency in adult male rats by feeding
   them a 20\% raw egg white diet for 6 weeks. Animals were then randomized
   into 2 groups: one group received a single biotin supplement and
   returned to normal chow lacking egg white, while the second group
   remained on the depletion diet. After 1 week, pancreata were removed
   from biotin-deficient (BD) and biotin-repleted (BR) animals and RNA was
   isolated for microarray analysis. Biotin depletion altered gene
   expression in a manner indicative of inflammation, fibrosis, and
   defective pancreatic function. Conversely, biotin repletion activated
   numerous repair and anti-inflammatory pathways, reduced fibrotic gene
   expression, and induced multiple genes involved in pancreatic endocrine
   and exocrine function. A subset of the results was confirmed by
   quantitative real-time PCR analysis, as well as by treatment of
   pancreatic AR42J cells with biotin. The results indicate that biotin
   repletion, even after lengthy deficiency, results in the rapid induction
   of repair processes in the pancreas.}},

Abstract = {{Among various types of motors, permanent magnet (PM) motors, due to
   their high energy density, are mainly used for electric-based propulsion
   systems. In this paper, an improved analytical model for PM motor has
   been presented. The model considers important factors, such as armature
   reaction, slotting effect, and influence of non-linear material property
   on motor's behavior. Moreover, the main contributions of this paper are
   the representation of stator windings with exact winding width using
   Fourier series and the consideration of effects of non-linear
   ferromagnetic material property. Using this model, it is possible to
   determine air-gap magnetic field, flux linkage, back electromotive
   force, cogging torque, and electromagnetic torque with high accuracy.
   Results from the proposed model are compared with other analytical model
   and also with those from a finite-element analysis (FEA). The results

Title = {{From Recovery Programs to Recovery-Oriented Practice? A Qualitative
   Study of Mental Health Professionals' Experiences When Facilitating a
   Recovery-Oriented Rehabilitation Program}},
Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF PSYCHIATRIC NURSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The recovery model has influenced mental health services
   and fostered new standards for best practice. However, knowledge about
   how mental health care professionals (HCPs) experience recovery-oriented
   programs is sparse.
   Aim/Question: This paper explores HCPs' experiences when facilitating a
   recovery-oriented rehabilitation program. The research question is how
   do HCPs experience a change in their attitude and practice when applying
   recovery-oriented programs?
   Methods: This paper draws on semi-structured in-depth qualitative
   interviews conducted with 16 HCPs experienced in facilitating a
   recovery-oriented rehabilitation program in either the USA or Denmark.
   Results: Three themes emerged from the HCPs' reflections on changes in
   attitudes and practices: ``Hopeful Attitude{''} captures a change in the
   HCPs' attitude toward a more positive view on the future for clients'
   living with mental illness; ``A New Focus in the Dialogue With
   Clients{''} thematizes how the HCPs focus more on the individual's own
   goal for recovery rather than disease-induced goals in the dialog with
   clients; ``A Person-Centered Role{''} comprises a shift in the
   professional role whereby the HCPs value the client's own ideas in
   addition to the professional's standards.
   Conclusion: This study supports the theory of the recovery model by its
   empirical findings and indications that when facilitating a
   recovery-oriented program, HCPs experience recovery-oriented changes in
   their attitude toward life with mental illness, and it alters their
   professional practice toward a stronger focus on client's own goals
   during treatment. More studies are needed to further clarify how changes
   in HCPs' attitudes translate into changes in mental health practices.

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{Early cancers are avascular and hence, profoundly acidic. Pre-malignant
   cells must adapt to acidosis to thrive in this hostile microenvironment.
   Here, we investigate MCF-7 cells that are adapted to grow in acidic
   conditions using SILAC proteomics and we reveal a significant
   upregulation of lysosomal proteins. Prominent among these is LAMP2 that
   functions to protect lysosomal membranes from acid proteolysis. LAMP2
   upregulation by acidosis is confirmed both in vitro and in vivo.
   Furthermore, we show that the depletion of LAMP2 is sufficient to
   increase acidosis-mediated toxicity. In breast cancer patient samples,
   there is a high correlation of LAMP2 mRNA and protein expression with
   progression. We also observe that LAMP2 is located at the plasma
   membrane in clinical samples and this redistribution is acid-induced in
   vitro. Our findings suggest a potential adaptive mechanism, wherein
   cells chronically exposed to an acidic environment translocate lysosomal
   proteins to their surface, thus protecting the plasmalemma from
   acid-induced hydrolysis.}},

Abstract = {{Using application-specific instructions for heterogeneous multiprocessor
   system-on-chip (Ht-MPSoC) allows to find a good performance/energy
   trade-off. For MPSoC architecture executing different multimedia
   applications, we expect a large number of potential custom instructions.
   In order to explore the potential of all these instructions, we propose
   to identify the similar critical computations to be executed on hardware
   accelerators (HWA) shared between processors. Depending on the running
   applications in one side and their needs in performance and area usage
   on the other side, private and shared hardware accelerators are attached
   to the different cores. This leads to a large architectural space
   exploration. In this letter we propose an FPGA-based framework capable
   of identifying the configuration of HWA targeted to an MPSoC
   architecture. Our framework incorporates a hardware accelerators sharing
   methodology to optimize area/performance tradeoff. The comparison of
   framework-estimated results and real measurements proves the efficiency
   of our framework.}},

Abstract = {{Effectively engaging with the world depends on accurate representations
   of the regularities that make up that world-what we call mental models.
   The success of any mental model depends on the ability to adapt to
   changes-to `update' the model. In prior work, we have shown that damage
   to the right hemisphere of the brain impairs the ability to update
   mental models across a range of tasks. Given the disparate nature of the
   tasks we have employed in this prior work (i.e. statistical learning,
   language acquisition, position priming, perceptual ambiguity, strategic
   game play), we propose that a cognitive module important for updating
   mental representations should be generic, in the sense that it is
   invoked across multiple cognitive and perceptual domains. To date, the
   majority of our tasks have been visual in nature. Given the ubiquity and
   import of temporal information in sensory experience, we examined the
   ability to build and update mental models of time. We had healthy
   individuals complete a temporal prediction task in which intervals were
   initially drawn from one temporal range before an unannounced switch to
   a different range of intervals. Separate groups had the second range of
   intervals switch to one that contained either longer or shorter
   intervals than the first range. Both groups showed significant positive
   correlations between perceptual and prediction accuracy. While each
   group updated mental models of temporal intervals, those exposed to
   shorter intervals did so more efficiently. Our results support the
   notion of generic capacity to update regularities in the environment-in
   this instance based on temporal information. The task developed here is
   well suited to investigations in neurological patients and in
   neuroimaging settings.}},

Abstract = {{We examine trends in investment in personnel in Belarussian enterprises

   Belarussian industry has attracted considerable FDI, due in part to high
   investment in human capital. Our findings, based on micro-level data
   from Belarussian enterprises in 2009-2014, demonstrate that investments
   in personnel have decreased since the global financial crisis and are
   suboptimal, reducing industry's capacity to attract and retain FDI.
   Management has limited ability and inclination to address these
   problems, due to government pressure. We conclude that the model may be
   becoming less sustainable as a result. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is known to be more resistant
   to the effects of various external factors than other hippocampal areas.
   This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of moderate
   treadmill exercise on early-phase long-term potentiation (E-LTP) and its
   molecular signaling pathways in the DG of amyloid beta rat model of
   sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Animals were preconditioned to run on
   treadmill for 4 weeks and concurrently received ICV infusion of A
   beta(1-42) peptides (250 pmol/day) during the third and fourth weeks of
   exercise training. We utilized in vivo electrophysiological recordings
   to assess the effect of exercise and/or AD pathology on basal synaptic
   transmission and E-LTP magnitude of the perforant pathway synapses in
   urethane-anesthetized rats. Immunoblotting analysis was used to quantify
   changes in the levels of learning and memory-related key signaling
   molecules. The AD-impaired basal synaptic transmission and suppression
   of E-LTP in the DG were prevented by prior moderate treadmill exercise.
   In addition, exercise normalized the basal levels of memory and
   E-LTP-related signaling molecules including Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
   protein kinase II (CaMKII), calcineurin (PP2B), and brain-derived
   neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Exercise also prevented the reduction of
   phosphorylated CaMKII and aberrant increase of PP2B seen after E-LTP
   induction in amyloid-infused rats. Our data suggests that by restoring
   the balance of kinase-phosphatase, 4 weeks of moderate treadmill
   exercise prevents DG synaptic deficits and deleterious alterations in
   signaling pathways associated with AD.}},

Abstract = {{Many arid and semiarid ecosystems have soils covered with well-developed
   biological soil crust communities (biocrusts) made up of mosses,
   lichens, cyanobacteria, and heterotrophs living at the soil surface.
   These communities are a fundamental component of dryland ecosystems, and
   are critical to dryland carbon (C) cycling. To examine the effects of
   warming temperatures on soil C balance in a dryland ecosystem, we used
   infrared heaters to warm biocrust-dominated soils to 2 A degrees C above
   control conditions at a field site on the Colorado Plateau, USA. We
   monitored net soil exchange (NSE) of CO2 every hour for 21 months using
   automated flux chambers (5 control and 5 warmed chambers), which
   included the CO2 fluxes of the biocrusts and the soil beneath them. We
   observed measurable photosynthesis in biocrust soils on 12 \% of
   measurement days, which correlated well with precipitation events and
   soil wet-up. These days included several snow events, providing what we
   believe to be the first evidence of substantial photosynthesis
   underneath snow by biocrust organisms in drylands. Overall, biocrust
   soils in both control and warmed plots were net CO2 sources to the
   atmosphere, with control plots losing 62 +/- A 8 g C m(-2) (mean +/- A
   SE) over the first year of measurement and warmed plots losing 74 +/- A
   9 g C m(-2). Between control and warmed plots, the difference in soil C
   loss was uncertain over the course of the entire year due to large and
   variable rates in spring, but on days during which soils were wet and
   crusts were actively photosynthesizing, biocrusts that were warmed by 2
   A degrees C had a substantially more negative C balance (i.e., biocrust
   soils took up less C and/or lost more C in warmed plots). Taken
   together, our data suggest a substantial risk of increased C loss from
   biocrust soils with higher future temperatures, and highlight a robust
   capacity to predict CO2 exchange in biocrust soils using easily measured
   environmental parameters.}},

   (NPs) were prepared by different drug to polymer ratios, human serum
   albumin (HSA) content, dithiothreitol (as producer of free thiol groups)
   content, and acetone (as non-solvent in nanoprecipitation). NPs with a
   size ranging from 126 to 174 nm were achieved. The highest entrapment
   efficiency (89.4 +/- 4.2 \%) was achieved when the ratio of drug to
   polymer was 1: 4. The zeta potential of NPs was fairly negative (-8 to
   -12). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning
   calorimetry proved the conjugation of HSA to PLGA NPs. In vitro release
   profile of NPs showed 2 phases: an initial burst for 4 h (34-49 \%)
   followed by a slow release pattern up to the end. The antibacterial
   effects of NPs against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis
   and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied by microdilution method. The
   GLA-loaded NPs showed more antibacterial effect than pure GLA (2-4
   times). The anticancer MTT test revealed that GLA-loaded NPs were
   approximately 9 times more effective than pure GLA in Hep G2 cells.}},

   Three different types of water based nanofluids, containing copper,

   effects of the pertinent parameters on the fluid velocity, the
   temperature, the entropy generation number, the Bejan number, the shear
   stress, and the heat transfer rate at the sheet surface are graphically
   and quantitatively discussed in detail. A comparison of the entropy
   generation due to the heat transfer and the fluid friction is made with
   the help of the Bejan number. It is observed that the presence of the
   metallic nanoparticles creates more entropy in the nanofluid flow than
   in the regular fluid flow.}},

Abstract = {{CPO-27-Ni/alginate spheres have been prepared and evaluated for
   post-combustion CO2 capture using both dry and moist synthetic flue-gas
   in a multicycle pressure-vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA) cycle. Single
   component equilibrium isotherms of the adsorbent spheres give estimated
   CO2/N-2 and H2O/CO2 selectivities of 24 and 7 at 323 K for the actual
   gas composition (around 9 kPa H2O, 28 kPa CO2, rest N-2, P-tot=200 kPa).
   The PVSA cycle used consists of four steps; an adsorption step, a
   counter-current blowdown step, a counter-current purge step and,
   finally, a counter-current pressurization step. The results from single
   column testing show that the presence of moist in the flue gas reduces
   the CO2 working capacity somewhat (around 15\%), however, even when
   beginning the cyclic PVSA run with an adsorbent completely saturated
   with water, an apparent steady state performance is reached in which the
   CO2 working capacity still is significant and stable over more than 100
   cycles. The results are interpreted as a consequence of the
   counter-current blowdown and purge steps carried out in dry nitrogen.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL DEVICES-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Flexible needles with enhanced steerability are desired in minimally
   invasive surgeries to reach target locations precisely and to bypass
   critical organs lying in the planned path. We have proposed a
   flexure-based active needle that enhances steerability by using a
   flexure element near the needle tip. Needle curvature is controlled by
   attached shape memory alloy (SMA) wires that apply actuator forces to
   bend the needle. Using actuator forces rather than axial rotation to
   control needle curvature minimizes placement errors due to torsional
   rigidity that is compromised by the flexure element. A prototype of the
   proposed needle was developed and was demonstrated in air, in
   tissue-mimicking gel, and in pig liver. Needle insertion studies with
   the prototype showed that increasing the wire diameter from 0.15 to 0.24
   mm insignificantly affected the maximum needle tip deflection
   (19.4+/-0.3 mm for 150 mm insertion), but significantly increased the
   actuation current (from 0.60 to 1.04 A).}},

Title = {{Cost and Utility Analysis of a Store-and-Forward Teledermatology
   Referral System A Randomized Clinical Trial}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE The costs and utility of teledermatology are important
   features of implementation. Such an analysis requires a description of
   the perspective of the entity that will bear the cost.
   OBJECTIVE To assess the costs and utility of a store-and-forward
   teledermatology referral process compared with a conventional referral
   process from the perspectives of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
   and society.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Three hundred ninety-one randomized
   participants were referred from remote sites of primary care to the
   dermatology services of 2 VA medical facilities for ambulatory skin
   conditions from December 2008 through June 2010, and follow-up was
   completed in March 2011. The time trade-off utility measures and costs
   were collected during a 9-month period among participants in a 2-site
   parallel group randomized clinical trial. The perspectives of the VA and
   society were evaluated. The multiple imputation procedure or weighted
   means were used for missing data elements. Data were analyzed from
   January to July 2014.
   INTERVENTIONS Referrals were managed using store-and-forward
   teledermatology or a conventional text-based referral process.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Total costs from the perspectives of the VA
   and society incurred during the 9-month follow-up were used to derive
   per-participant costs. Utility, using the time trade-off method, was the
   measure of effectiveness.
   RESULTS From the VA perspective, the total cost for conventional
   referrals was \$66 145 (minimum, \$58 697; maximum, \$71 635), or \$338
   (SD, \$291) per participant (196 participants); the total cost for
   teledermatology referrals was \$59 917 (mimimum, \$51 794; maximum, \$70
   398), or \$308 (SD, \$298) per participant (195 participants). The \$30
   difference in per-participant cost was not statistically significant
   (95\% CI, -\$79 to \$20). From the societal perspective, the total cost
   for conventional referrals was \$106 194 (minimum, \$98 746; maximum,
   \$111 684), or \$542 (SD, \$403) per participant (196 participants); the
   total cost for teledermatology referrals was \$89 523 (minimum, \$81
   400; maximum, \$100 400) or \$460 (SD, \$428) per participant. This \$82
   difference in per-participant cost was statistically significant (95\%
   CI, -\$12 to -\$152). From baseline to the 9-month follow-up, the time
   trade-off utility value improved by 0.02 in the conventional referral
   group and 0.03 in the teledermatology group. This difference was not
   statistically significant (P = .50).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Compared with conventional referrals,
   store-and-forward teledermatology referrals were performed at a
   comparable cost (VA perspective) or at a lower cost (societal
   perspective) with no evidence of a difference in utility as measured by
   the time trade-off method.}},

Abstract = {{The inverse problem of parameter estimation from noisy observations is a
   major challenge in statistical inference for dynamical systems.
   Parameter estimation is usually carried out by optimizing some criterion
   function over the parameter space. Unless the optimization process
   starts with a good initial guess, the estimation may take an
   unreasonable amount of time, and may converge to local solutions, if at
   all. In this article, we introduce a novel technique for generating good
   initial guesses that can be used by any estimation method. We focus on
   the fairly general and often applied class of systems linear in the
   parameters. The new methodology bypasses numerical integration and can
   handle partially observed systems. We illustrate the performance of the
   method using simulations and apply it to real data.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the NP-hard problem of minimizing power consumption in
   wireless communications systems is approached. In the literature,
   several metaheuristic approaches have been proposed to solve it.
   Currently a homogeneous cellular processing algorithm and a GRASP
   algorithm hybridized with path-relinking are considered the state of the
   art algorithms. The main contribution of this paper is the analysis of
   five main characteristics for a heterogeneous cellular processing
   algorithm, based on scatter search and GRASP. A series of computational
   experiments with standard instances were carried out to assess the
   impact of each one of these characteristics. Among the main analyses we
   found particularly interesting a time reduction by 74.24 \%, produced by
   the stagnation detection characteristic. Also the communication
   characteristic improves the quality of the solutions by 24.73 \%. The
   computational results show that our heterogeneous cellular processing
   algorithm is a good alternative for solving the problem. The proposed
   algorithm finds 34 new best known solutions, which is 27 \% of the
   instances with unknown optimal values. A Friedman hypothesis test was
   carried out to validate that two state-of-the-art algorithms and the
   proposed algorithm are statistically equivalent.}},

Abstract = {{Large wood has historically been removed from streams, resulting in the
   depletion of in-stream wood in waterways worldwide. As wood increases
   morphological and hydraulic complexity, the addition of large wood is
   commonly employed as a means to rehabilitate in-stream habitat. At
   present, however, the scientific understanding of wood mobilization and
   transport is incomplete. This paper presents results from a series of
   four flume experiments in which wood was added to a reach to investigate
   the piece and reach characteristics that determine wood stability and
   transport, as well as the time scale required for newly recruited wood
   to self-organize into stable jams. Our results show that wood
   transitions from a randomly distributed newly recruited state to a
   self-organized, or jam-stabilized state, over the course of a single
   bankfull flow event. Statistical analyses of piece mobility during this
   transitional period indicate that piece irregularities, especially
   rootwads, dictate the stability of individual wood pieces; rootwad
   presence or absence accounts for up to 80\% of the variance explained by
   linear regression models for transport distance. Furthermore, small
   pieces containing rootwads are especially stable. Large ramped pieces
   provide nuclei for the formation of persistent wood jams, and the
   frequency of these pieces in the reach impacts the travel distance of
   mobile wood. This research shows that the simulation of realistic wood
   dynamics is possible using a simplified physical model, and also has
   management implications, as it suggests that randomly added wood may
   organize into persistent, stable jams, and characterizes the time scale
   for this transition.}},

Volume = {{85}},

Abstract = {{Background: Following urological procedures, it is common for patients
   to receive written handouts containing pertinent post-operative
   information and advice. This study aims to assess the consistency of
   procedure-specific post-operative advice provided to patients in
   Australia.
   Methods: Post-operative handouts for common urological procedures were
   obtained from a selection of Australian hospitals and practising
   urologists' websites. Handouts were examined for consistency with regard
   to post-operative advice and the Flesch-Kincaid grade level was
   calculated to determine readability.
   Results: In total, 209 handouts were reviewed comprising seven
   urological procedures. The majority of handouts provided information
   regarding expected symptoms (88\%) and when to seek medical attention
   (70.8\%). Overall, 85.2\% of handouts provided advice about which
   activities should and should not be performed. Instructions for return
   to work (32.1\%), driving (45.5\%), sex (32.1\%) and physical activity
   (56\%) were less universal. Infection, bleeding, pain and swelling were
   the principal reasons to seek medical attention. Duration of expected
   symptoms and timing for resuming normal activities were the most common
   sources of discordance between handouts. The mean Flesch-Kincaid grade
   level was 9.7 with a range of 6.7 to 13.6. Only 9.6\% of patient
   information handouts had a grade level of 8 or less and no handouts were
   at or below the suggested grade 6 readability level.
   Conclusions: There is a significant degree of variability in written
   post-operative advice provided to patients in Australia. Individual
   surgeons and hospitals should provide specific and tailored advice
   directly to their own patients, written at a grade level suitable for
   the majority to understand.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To assess the online and social media presence of all practising
   Australian and New Zealand urologists.
   Subjects and Methods
   In July 2014, all active members of the Urological Society of Australia
   and New Zealand (USANZ) were identified. A comprehensive search of
   Google and each social media platform (Facebook, Twitter, Linked In and
   You Tube) was undertaken for each urologist to identify any private
   websites or social media profiles.
   Results
   Of the 435 urologists currently practising in Australia and New Zealand,
   305 (70.1\%) have an easily identifiable social media account. Linkedln
   (51.3\%) is the most commonly used form of social media followed by
   Twitter (33.3\%) and private Facebook (30.1\%) accounts. About half
   (49.8\%) have a private business website. The average numb: of social
   media accounts per urologist is 1.42 and 16 urologists (3.7\%) have an
   account with all searched social media platforms. Over half of those
   with a Twitter account (55.9\%) follow a dedicated urology journal club
   and have a median (range) number of `followers' of 12 (1-2 862). Social
   media users had a median (range) of 2 (0-8 717) `tweets' on Twitter, 2
   (1-45) Linkedln posts and 1 (1-14) YouTube video.
   Conclusion
   This study represents a unique dataset not relying on selection or
   recall bias but using data freely available to patients and colleagues
   to gauge social media presence of urologists. Most Australian and New
   Zealand urologists have a readily identifiable online and social media
   presence, with wideq)read and consistent use across both countries,}},

Journal = {{MARINE POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{169-177}},

Abstract = {{An important task of natural resource management is deciding amongst
   alternative policy options, including how interventions will affect the
   dynamics of resource exploitation. Yet predicting the behaviour of
   natural resource users in complex, changeable systems presents a
   significant challenge for managers. Scenario planning, which involves
   thinking creatively about how a socio-ecological system might develop
   under a set of possible futures, was used to explore uncertainties in
   the future of the Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery. This exercise
   stimulated thinking on how key social, economic and environmental
   conditions that influence fleet behaviour may change in the future, and
   how these changes might affect the dynamics of fishing effort. Three
   storylines were explored: an increase in marine protection, growing
   consumer preference for sustainable seafood, and depletion of tuna
   stocks. Comparing across several possible future scenarios, a number of
   critical aspects of fleet behaviour were identified that should be
   important considerations for fishery managers, but which are currently
   poorly understood. These included a switch in fishing practices,
   reallocation of effort in space, investment in new vessels and exit from
   the fishery. Recommendations for future management interventions in the
   Indian Ocean were offered, along with suggestions for research needed to
   reduce management uncertainty. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Journal = {{FOOD AND ENVIRONMENTAL VIROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Enteric viruses are a major problem in the food industry, especially as
   human noroviruses are the leading cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis.
   Chitosan is known to be effective against some enteric viral surrogates,
   but more detailed studies are needed to determine the precise
   application variables. The main objective of this work was to determine
   the effect of increasing chitosan concentration (0.7-1.5 \% w/v) on the
   cultivable enteric viral surrogates, feline calicivirus (FCV-F9), murine
   norovirus (MNV-1), and bacteriophages (MS2 and phiX174) at 37 A degrees
   C. Two chitosans (53 and 222 kDa) were dissolved in water (53 kDa) or 1
   \% acetic acid (222 KDa) at 0.7-1.5 \%, and were then mixed with each
   virus to obtain a titer of similar to 5 log plaque-forming units
   (PFU)/mL. These mixtures were incubated for 3 h at 37 A degrees C.
   Controls included untreated viruses in phosphate-buffered saline and
   viruses were enumerated by plaque assays. The 53 kDa chitosan at the
   concentrations tested reduced FCV-F9, MNV-1, MS2, and phi X174 by
   2.6-2.9, 0.1-0.4, 2.6-2.8, and 0.7-0.9 log PFU/mL, respectively, while
   reduction by 222 kDa chitosan was 2.2-2.4, 0.8-1.0, 2.6-5.2, and 0.5-0.8
   log PFU/mL, respectively. The 222 kDa chitosan at 1 and 0.7 \% w/v in
   acetic acid (pH 4.5) caused the greatest reductions of MS2 by 5.2 logs
   and 2.6 logs, respectively. Overall, chitosan treatments showed the
   greatest reduction of MS2, followed by FCV-F9, phi X174, and MNV-1.
   These two chitosans may contribute to the reduction of enteric viruses
   at the concentrations tested but would require use of other hurdles to
   eliminate food borne viruses.}},

Abstract = {{Associations between socio-demographic and psychological factors and
   food choice patterns were explored in unemployed young people who
   constitute a vulnerable group at risk of poor dietary health. Volunteers
   (N = 168), male (n = 97) and female (n = 71), aged 15-25 years were
   recruited through United Kingdom (UK) community-based organisations
   serving young people not in education training or employment (NEET).
   Survey questionnaire enquired on food poverty, physical activity and
   measured responses to the Food Involvement Scale (FIS), Food
   Self-Efficacy Scale (FSS) and a 19-item Food Frequency Questionnaire
   (FFQ). A path analysis was undertaken to explore associations between
   age, gender, food poverty, age at leaving school, food self-efficacy
   (FS-E), food involvement (Fl) (kitchen; uninvolved; enjoyment), physical
   activity and the four food choice patterns (junk food; healthy; fast
   food; high fat). FS-E was strong in the model and increased with age.
   FS-E was positively associated with more frequent choice of healthy food
   and less frequent junk or high fat food (having controlled for age,
   gender and age at leaving school). Fl (kitchen and enjoyment) increased
   with age. Higher FI (kitchen) was associated with less frequent junk
   food and fast food choice. Being uninvolved with food was associated
   with more frequent fast food choice. Those who left school after the age
   of 16 years reported more frequent physical activity. Of the indirect
   effects, younger individuals had lower FI (kitchen) which led to
   frequent junk and fast food choice. Females who were older had higher Fl
   (enjoyment) which led to less frequent fast food choice. Those who had
   left school before the age of 16 had low food involvement (uninvolved)
   which led to frequent junk food choice. Multiple indices implied that
   data were a good fit to the model which indicated a need to enhance food
   self-efficacy and encourage food involvement in order to improve dietary
   health among these disadvantaged young people. Crown Copyright (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In the area of production planning and control, the aggregate production
   planning (APP) problem represents a great challenge for decision makers
   in production-inventory systems. Tradeoff between inventory-capacity is
   known as the APP problem. To address it, static and dynamic models have
   been proposed, which in general have several shortcomings. It is the
   premise of this paper that the main drawback of these proposals is, that
   they do not take into account the dynamic nature of the APP. For this
   reason, we propose the use of an Optimal Control (OC) formulation via
   the approach of energy-based and Hamiltonian-present value. The main
   contribution of this paper is the mathematical model which integrates a
   second order dynamical system coupled with a first order system,
   incorporating production rate, inventory level, and capacity as well
   with the associated cost by work force in the same formulation. Also, a
   novel result in relation with the Hamiltonian-present value in the OC
   formulation is that it reduces the inventory level compared with the
   pure energy based approach for APP. A set of simulations are provided
   which verifies the theoretical contribution of this work.}},

   transients with and without chemical solvent vapours (methanol,

   law with times of about 0.5 ns, 2 ns and 7 ns. The measurements revealed
   a weak effect on clorophorm, acetone and water, while the initial decay
   time of InP surface quantum dots increases (up to 15\%) upon methanol
   vapour exposure, indicating that the organic molecules efficiently

Abstract = {{ObjectivesThe primary aim of the present study was to obtain insight
   into parents' perception of the IDEFICS intervention at the school or
   preschool/kindergarten and community levels and whether they received
   specific materials related to the intervention. The secondary aim was to
   analyse whether parents who reported higher levels of exposure to the
   IDEFICS intervention had children with more favourable changes in body
   mass index (BMI) z-scores between baseline and after 2years of
   intervention.
   MethodsProcess evaluation of the IDEFICS intervention investigated the
   implementation of the 2-year intervention in the intervention
   communities. Intervention group parents (n=4,180) in seven countries
   (Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden) answered
   questions about their exposure to the IDEFICS study. To analyse the
   relationship between exposure and BMI z-score, a composite score was
   calculated for exposure at the setting and at the community levels.
   ResultsThe frequency of parental exposure to the IDEFICS messages not
   only through the community but also through the (pre)school/kindergarten
   was lower than what was intended and planned. The dose received by the
   parents was considerably higher through the (pre)school/kindergarten
   settings than that through the community in all countries. Efforts by
   the settings or communities related to fruit and vegetable consumption
   (range 69\% to 97\%), physical activity promotion (range 67\% to 91\%)
   and drinking water (range 49\% to 93\%) were more visible and also
   realized more parental involvement than those related to TV viewing,
   sleep duration and spending time with the family (below 50\%). Results
   showed no relation of parental exposure at the setting or the community
   level on more favourable changes in children's BMI z-scores for the
   total sample. Country-specific analyses for parental exposure at the
   setting level showed an expected positive effect in German girls and an
   unexpected negative effect in Italian boys.
   ConclusionParental exposure and involvement in the IDEFICS intervention
   in all countries was much less than aimed for, which might be due to the
   diverse focus (six key messages) and high intensity and duration of the
   intervention. It may also be that the human resources invested in the
   implementation and maintenance of intervention activities by the study
   centres, the caretakers and the community stakeholders were not
   sufficient. Higher levels of parental exposure were not related to more
   favourable changes in BMI z-scores. (c) 2015 World Obesity}},

Abstract = {{The European Union's REACH regulation has introduced Socio-Economic
   Analyses as a new decision support tool in the domain of chemical
   policy-making. This paper presents a pragmatic method to review the
   replacement of chemicals in processes or products in terms of the
   environmental impact. The aim of this work is to develop a broadly
   accepted method for environmental impact assessment as part of
   Socio-Economic Analyses. The method consists of a stepwise and tiered
   approach for Environmental Impact Assessment whereby the expected impact
   of the replacement of chemicals is assessed via Risk Characterization
   Ratios and toxic pressure quantification (expressed as a Potentially
   Affection Fraction of species), and if relevant via a Persistency,
   Bioaccumulation potential and Toxicity score. The working of the method
   is demonstrated by the replacement of chemical substances in detergents,
   gutters and Expanded Polystyrene. Of the three replacements, for
   gutters, the reduction of the toxic pressure on the aquatic compartment
   was highest. Based on 50\% effect concentrations the Potentially
   Affection Fraction of species due to the use of zinc gutters was
   relatively high (15\%), while it was 0.6\% after replacement by PVC
   gutters. This indicates that PVC gutters have a lower direct impact on
   aquatic biodiversity than zinc gutters. This paper demonstrates that
   even with limited data the proposed method can be used to move from risk
   indicators to impact indicators. The tiered approach allows finding the
   most appropriate level of analysis in a cost and resource efficient way.
   The method allows comparison of results of different scenarios and as
   such allows selecting the most preferable alternative from an
   environmental perspective. This is useful in the context of
   socio-economic analysis and as such, this method is available as a
   decision-support tool under REACH and other chemical policy frames such
   as the United Nations Environment Program. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   variation of calls of four Pseudopaludicola species that share a trilled
   advertisement call pattern, as well as revisit their diagnoses, and
   update their distribution. Acoustic variation was helpful for species
   delimitation: two temporal traits distinguished P. facureae from P.
   hyleaustralis, and both species from P. canga and P. parnaiba, whereas
   the latter two species could not be distinguished from each other.
   Therefore, additional evidence is required to establish the taxonomic
   status of P. parnaiba in relation to P. canga, since neither morphology,
   body size, color patterns, or bioacoustics supported the separation
   between these species. This frog genus has a conservative morphology and
   a great variety of calling patterns. Therefore, the association between
   specimens and calling patterns is crucial for more reliable species
   identifications and understanding its distributional patterns and
   implications for conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Symptomatic horizontal meniscal tears are rare but
   worrisome lesions in young adults. These are overuse injuries not
   amenable to the classic arthroscopic sutures. An open meniscal repair
   allows the meniscal lesion to be suture vertically, perpendicular to its
   in the vascularized zone. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
   short and long-term clinical and radiological outcomes of the
   aforementioned surgical technique.
   Material and method: The first cohort consisted of 24 patients operated
   between 2009 and 2011 (6 women, 18 men; mean age 26 years) having 11
   lateral and 13 medial meniscal tears. The second cohort was of 10
   patients operated between 2001 and 2002 (3 women, 7 men; mean age 24
   years) having 8 lateral and 2 medial meniscal tears. Patients were
   reviewed at the last follow-up using the IKDC, Lysholm and KOOS scores.
   Patients in the first cohort had an MRI, while those in the second
   cohort had X-rays.
   Results: Eighteen patients in the first cohort were reviewed with a mean
   follow-up of 2 years (12-45 months) and 9 patients from the second
   cohort were reviewed after 10 years (97-142 months). In the first
   cohort, one patient required secondary menisectomy. The mean Lysholm
   score was 90 and the subjective IKDC was 85. Every MRI examination found
   reduced extent and intensity of the hyperintense signal. In the second
   cohort, no patients required secondary meniscectomy. Two patients had
   joint space narrowing (less than 50\%) on radiographs. The mean Lysholm
   score was 99 and the subjective IKDC was 91.
   Conclusion: Open repair of horizontal meniscal tears in young adults
   leads to good subjective and objective results in the short term, which
   are maintained in the long-term. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {{Global climate changes and biological invasions are environmental
   disturbances that may interact synergistically, causing loss of
   biodiversity. As the early stages of development are the most sensitive
   and easily affected by these constraints, this study investigated the
   effects of increased carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature, as forecasted
   for 2100, on seed germination and early development of three species of
   invasive African grasses that have gradually replaced landscapes of the
   Brazilian Cerrado biome. It was observed that these parameters affected
   percentage and rate of germination in Urochloa brizantha, rate of
   germination and mean germination time in Urochloa decumbens and
   accelerated autotrophy acquisition in U. brizantha, U. decumbens and
   Megathyrsus maximus. Regarding root elongation, all species showed
   changes in total length, absolute and relative growth rate, but at
   different stages of development or time intervals, with increased
   temperature being more significant than increased CO2, probably due to
   seed reserves still being the main carbon sources at this stage. Taken
   together, the results indicate that the effects of CO2 and increased
   temperature are species specific and highlight the greatest potential of
   U.brizantha to germinate, and of U.decumbens for seedling establishment
   under these environmental changes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a synthesis of findings from a three-year research
   program focused on travel plans for new residential developments. Travel
   plans can be required through the landuse planning and approvals process
   as a way to encourage new residents to reduce their demand for car
   travel, and to use more sustainable forms of transport. However,
   research into travel plans at new residential developments has been
   limited to date, particularly in terms of understanding their
   effectiveness. The aim of the research program was to assess the
   effectiveness of travel plans for new residential developments, and to
   also identify opportunities to enhance their effectiveness.
   A mixed methods approach was adopted that included a survey of councils,
   an assessment of travel plan quality, interviews with relevant industry
   actors, and case studies of residential developments with travel plans.
   The key findings are as follows:
   Considerable scope exists for improving travel plan quality prior to
   granting approval.
   General support for travel plans at new residential developments is
   evident among industry actors, yet there is limited confidence in the
   ability to successfully implement them.
   On average, new residential developments with travel plans were observed
   to have 14\% less car use than matching control sites without travel
   plans.}},

Title = {{The Tendon Structure Returns to Asymptomatic Values in Nonoperatively

Abstract = {{Background: Tendinopathy is characterized by alterations in the tendon
   structure, but there are conflicting results on the potential of tendon
   structure normalization and no large studies on the quantified,
   ultrasonographic tendon structure and its association with symptoms.
   Purpose: To determine whether the tendon structure returns to values of
   asymptomatic individuals after treatment with 2 substances injected
   within the tendon, to assess the association between the tendon
   structure and symptoms, and to assess the prognostic value of the
   baseline tendon structure on treatment response.
   Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.
   Methods: This study was part of a randomized trial on chronic midportion
   Achilles tendinopathy using eccentric exercises with either a
   platelet-rich plasma or saline injection. Symptoms were recorded using
   the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A)
   questionnaire. The tendon structure was quantified with ultrasound
   tissue characterization (UTC); echo types I + II (as a percentage of
   total tendon types I-IV) are structure related. Follow-up was at 6, 12,
   24, and 52 weeks. A control group of asymptomatic subjects (similar age)
   was selected to compare the tendon structure. Patient symptomswere
   correlated with the tendon structure using a linear model.
   Results: Fifty-four patients were included in the symptomatic group. The
   mean (SD) echo types I + II in the symptomatic group increased
   significantly from 74.6\% +/- 10.8\% at baseline to 85.6\% +/- 6.0\% at
   24-week follow-up. The result for echo types I + II at 24 weeks was not
   significantly different (P = .198) from that of the asymptomatic control
   group (87.5\% +/- 6.0\%). In 54 repeated measurements at 5 time points,
   the adjusted percentage of echo types I + II was not associated with the
   VISA-A score (main effect: = .12; 95\% CI, -0.12 to 0.35; P = .338). The
   adjusted baseline echo types I + II were not associated with a change in
   the VISA-A score from baseline to 52 weeks ( = -.15; 95\% CI, -0.67 to
   0.36; P = .555).
   Conclusion: In symptomatic, tendinopathic Achilles tendons, the
   ultrasonographic tendon structure improved during nonoperative treatment
   and normalized after 24 weeks to values of matched asymptomatic
   controls. There was no association between the tendon structure and
   symptoms. The percentage of echo types I + II before treatment was not
   associated with change in symptoms over time. This study demonstrates
   that restoration of the tendon structure is not required for an
   improvement of symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on natural infection by Leishmania spp of sandflies collected in
   endemic and nonendemic areas can provide important information on the
   distribution and intensity of the transmission of these parasites. This
   study sought to investigate the natural infection by Leishmania in wild
   female sandflies. The specimens were caught in the city of Corumba,
   state of Mato Grosso do Sul (Brazil) between October 2012-March 2014,
   and dissected to investigate flagellates and/or submitted to molecular
   analysis to detect Leishmania DNA. A total of 1,164 females (77.56\% of
   which were Lutzomyia cruzi) representing 11 species were investigated
   using molecular analysis; 126 specimens of Lu. cruzi were dissected and
   also submitted to molecular analysis. The infection rate based on the
   presence of Leishmania DNA considering all the sandfly species analysed
   was 0.69\%; only Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis was identified in
   Lu. cruzi by the molecular analysis. The dissections were negative for
   flagellates. This is the first record of the presence of L. (L.)
   amazonensis DNA in Lu. cruzi, and the first record of this parasite in
   this area. These findings point to the need for further investigation
   into the possible role of this sandfly as vector of this parasite.}},

   linear-parabolic lane model, and an automatic on-the-fly camera
   calibration procedure is applied. Then, an adaptive smoothing scheme is
   applied to reduce noise while keeping close edges separated, and pairs
   of local maxima-minima of the gradient are used as cues to identify lane
   markings. Finally, a Bayesian classifier based on mixtures of Gaussians
   is applied to classify the lane markings present at each frame of a
   video sequence as dashed, solid, dashed solid, solid dashed, or double
   solid. Experimental results indicate an overall accuracy of over 96\%
   using a variety of video sequences acquired with different devices and

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is the second commonest type of cancer in the world, and
   the commonest among women, corresponding to 22\% of the new cases every
   year. This work presents a new computational methodology, which helps
   the specialists in the detection of breast masses based on the breast
   density. The proposed methodology is divided into stages with the
   objective of overcoming several difficulties associated with the
   detection of masses. In many of these stages, we brought contributions
   to the areas. The first stage is intended to detect the type of density
   of the breast, which can be either dense or non-dense. We proposed an
   adaptive algorithm capable of analyzing and image and telling if it is
   dense or non-dense. The first stage consists in the segmentation of the
   regions that look like masses. We propose a novel use of the
   micro-genetic algorithm to create a texture proximity mask and select
   the regions suspect of containing lesions. The next stage is the
   reduction of false positives, which were generated in the previous
   stage. To this end, we proposed two new approaches. The first reduction
   of false positives used DBSCAN and a proximity ranking of the textures
   extracted from the ROIs. In the second reduction of false positives, the
   resulting regions have their textures analyzed by the combination of
   Phylogenetic Trees, Local Binary Patterns and Support Vector Machines
   (SVM). A micro-genetic algorithm was used to choose the suspect regions
   that generate the best training models and maximize the classification
   of masses and non-masses used in the SVM. The best result produced a
   sensitivity of 92.99\%, a rate of 0.15 false positives per image and an
   area under the FROC curve of 0.96 in the analysis of the non-dense
   breasts; and a sensitivity of 83.70\%, a rate of 0.19 false positives
   per image and an area under the FROC curve of 0.85, in the analysis of
   the dense breasts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The production of carnivorous fish such as Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar)
   is dependent on the availability of high quality proteins for feed
   formulations. For a number of nutritional, strategic and economic
   reasons, the use of plant proteins has steadily increased over the
   years, however a major limitation is associated with the presence of
   anti-nutritional factors and the nutritional profile of the protein
   concentrate. Investigating novel raw materials involves understanding
   the physiological consequences associated with the dietary inclusion of
   protein concentrates. The primary aim of the present study was to assess
   the metabolic response of salmon to increasing inclusion of
   air-classified faba bean protein concentrate (BPC) in feeds as a
   replacement for soy protein concentrate (SPC). Specifically, we tested
   treatments with identical contents of fishmeal (222.4 g kg(-1)) and
   progressively higher inclusion of BPC (0 g kg(-1), 111.8 g kg(-1), 223.6
   g kg(-1), 335.4 g kg(-1), 447.2 g kg(-1)) substituting SPC. This study
   demonstrated a dose-dependent metabolic response to a plant ingredient
   and was the first to compare the nutrigenomic transcriptional responses
   after substitution of terrestrial feed ingredients such as BPC and SPC
   without withdrawal of marine ingredients. It was found that after eight
   weeks a major physiological response in liver was only evident above
   335.4 g kg(-1) BPC and included decreased expression of metabolic
   pathways, and increased expression of genes regulating transcription and
   translation processes and the innate immune response. Furthermore, we
   showed that the nutritional stress caused by BPC resembled, at least at
   hepatic transcriptional level, that caused by soybean meal (included as
   a positive control in our experimental design). The outcomes of the
   present study suggested that Atlantic salmon parr might efficiently
   utilize moderate substitution of dietary SPC with BPC, with the optimum
   inclusion level being around 120 g kg(-1) in the type of feeds tested
   here. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This is the second in a series of four empirical studies designed to
   develop International Classification of Functioning, Disability and
   Health (ICF and Children and Youth version, ICF-CY) core sets for
   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The objective of this
   stage was to gather the opinions from international experts on which
   ability and disability concepts were considered relevant to functioning
   in ADHD. An email-based survey was carried out amongst international
   experts in ADHD. Relevant functional ability and disability concepts
   were extracted from their responses and linked to the ICF/-CY categories
   by two independent researchers using a standardised linking procedure.
   174 experts from 11 different disciplines and 45 different countries
   completed the survey. Meaningful concepts identified in their responses
   were linked to 185 ICF/-CY categories. Of these, 83 categories were
   identified by at least 5 \% of the experts and considered the most
   relevant to ADHD: 30 of these were related to Body functions (most
   identified: attention functions, 85 \%), 30 to Activities and
   Participation (most identified: school education, 52 \%), 20 to
   Environmental factors (most identified: support from immediate family,
   61 \%), and 3 to Body structures (most identified: structure of brain,
   83 \%). Experts also provided their views on particular abilities
   related to ADHD, naming characteristics such as high-energy levels,
   flexibility and resiliency. Gender differences in the expression of ADHD
   identified by experts pertained mainly to females showing more
   internalising (e.g. anxiety, low self-esteem) and less externalising
   behaviours (e.g. hyperactivity), leading to a risk of late- and
   under-diagnosis in females. Results indicate that the impact of ADHD
   extends beyond the core symptom domains, into all areas of life and
   across the lifespan. The current study in combination with three
   additional preparatory studies (comprehensive scoping review, focus
   groups, clinical study) will provide the scientific basis to define the
   ADHD ICF/-CY core sets for multi-purpose use in basic and applied
   research and every day clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aimed to investigate the antinociceptive and
   anti-inflammatory effects of the cyclic dipeptide cyclo-Gly-Pro (CGP) in
   mice. Antinociceptive activity was assessed by employing different pain
   models, such as formalin test, acetic acid-induced writhing, hot plate
   test, and carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia, in mice. The number of
   c-Fos-immunoreactive cells in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) was
   evaluated in CGP-treated mice. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated
   using paw oedema induced by carrageenan, compound 48/80, serotonin, and
   prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and analyzed by plethysmometry. Quantitation of
   myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the paw was carried out to analyze the presence
   of neutrophils in the tissue. Intraperitoneal injection of CGP produced
   a significant inhibition in both neurogenic and inflammatory phases of
   formalin-induced pain. The antinociceptive effect of CGP, evaluated in
   the acetic acid-induced writhing test, was detected for up to 6 h after
   treatment. Further, in the hot plate test, antinociceptive behaviour was
   evoked by CGP, and this response was inhibited by naloxone. Animals
   treated with CGP did not present changes in motor performance. In
   CGP-treated mice there was an increase in the number of c-Fos-positive
   neurons in the periaqueductal gray. In another set of experiments, CGP
   attenuated the hyperalgesic response induced by carrageenan.
   Furthermore, CGP also reduced the carrageenan-increased MPO activity in
   paws. In addition, CGP also reduced the paw oedema evoked by compound
   48/80, serotonin, and PGE2. Taken together, these results may support a
   possible therapeutic application of the cyclic dipeptide cyclo-Gly-Pro
   toward alleviating nociception and damage caused by inflammation
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The theme of entrepreneurship has guided policies and actions in
   governmental spheres, professional associations and in Academia,
   constituting and consolidating discourses about, with and to
   entrepreneurs, which reverberate, in the segmented media, a certain
   ``tone{''} that is characteristic of the discursive image of such
   enunciators. Contrasting two perspectives, the discursive and the
   ergological, we ask: what is the ethos of the young entrepreneur
   constructed by the Brazilian magazine PME Exame? What do its enunciators
   say? What don't they say? And, on the other hand, what does a young
   entrepreneur say when he is asked about his work activity? The
   enunciations constituted by PME are marked by didacticism and
   prescription, while those of the entrepreneur bring reflections that
   hint at the ``debate of norms{''} and ``debate of values{''} that
   pervade his daily routine. Both construct enunciative identities that
   are in a competition relation in the broad sense, that is, their
   reciprocal delimitation does not undergo an open confrontation.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: The accurate discovery and annotation of regulatory elements
   remains a challenging problem. The growing number of sequenced genomes
   creates new opportunities for comparative approaches to motif discovery.
   Putative binding sites are then considered to be functional if they are
   conserved in orthologous promoter sequences of multiple related species.
   Existing methods for comparative motif discovery usually rely on
   pregenerated multiple sequence alignments, which are difficult to obtain
   for more diverged species such as plants. As a consequence, misaligned
   regulatory elements often remain undetected.
   Results: We present a novel algorithm that supports both alignment-free
   and alignment-based motif discovery in the promoter sequences of related
   species. Putative motifs are exhaustively enumerated as words over the
   IUPAC alphabet and screened for conservation using the branch length
   score. Additionally, a confidence score is established in a genome-wide
   fashion. In order to take advantage of a cloud computing infrastructure,
   the MapReduce programming model is adopted. The method is applied to
   four monocotyledon plant species and it is shown that high-scoring
   motifs are significantly enriched for open chromatin regions in Oryza
   sativa and for transcription factor binding sites inferred through
   protein-binding microarrays in O. sativa and Zea mays. Furthermore, the
   method is shown to recover experimentally profiled ga2ox1-like KN1
   binding sites in Z. mays.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this trial was to assess the feasibility,
   toxicity profile, and antitumor activity of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO)
   combined with a chemotherapy remission-induction regimen in adults with
   untreated high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS) or secondary acute
   myeloid leukemia (sAML). In this phase II trial, 30 patients with median
   age of 58 years received 1 day of GO as a 1-h infusion at the dose level
   of 5 mg/m(2) on day 7 of the remission-induction course further
   consisting of a continuous infusion of cytarabine 100 mg/m(2)/day for 10
   days and idarubicin 12 mg/m(2)/day on days 1, 3, and 5. A consolidation
   course, consisting of intermediate-dose cytarabine (A) and idarubicin
   (I) followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was
   planned for patients in complete remission (CR). The primary endpoints
   were response rate (CR/CRi) and severe toxicity rate. The secondary
   endpoint(s) were survival and progression-free survival (PFS) from start
   of treatment. Thirteen patients (43 \%) achieved CR (eight patients) or
   CR with incomplete hematopoietic recovery (CRi) (five patients). In
   patients who achieved CR or CRi, the median time to recovery of
   neutrophils to 0.5 x 10(9)/l and of platelets to > 50 x 10(9)/l was 29
   and 30 days, respectively. Grade 3 to 4 severe toxicities occurred in
   nine patients. The most prominent was liver toxicity, as shown by
   elevated bilirubin levels in 16 patients and one case of nonfatal
   veno-occlusive disease (VOD). All 13 patients with CR/CRi received
   consolidation therapy, which was followed by allogeneic HSCT in five
   patients and autologous HSCT in three patients. According to the
   statistical design of the study, the idarubicin and cytarabine in
   combination with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (IAGO) regimen did not show
   sufficient activity to warrant further exploration of this regimen in
   adult patients with HR-MDS or sAML.}},

Abstract = {{The ground-state properties of N spinless free fermions in a
   d-dimensional confining potential are studied. We find that any n-point
   correlation function has a simple determinantal structure that allows us
   to compute several properties exactly for large N. We show that the
   average density has a finite support with an edge, and near this edge
   the density exhibits a universal (valid for a wide class of potentials)
   scaling behavior for large N. The associated edge scaling function is
   computed exactly and generalizes to any d the edge electron gas result
   of Kohn and Mattsson in d = 3 (Kohn W. and Mattsson A. E., Phys. Rev.
   Lett., 81 (1998) 3487). In addition, we calculate the kernel (that
   characterizes any n-point correlation function) for large N and show
   that, when appropriately scaled, it depends only on dimension d, but has
   otherwise universal scaling forms, at the edges. The edge kernel, for
   higher d, generalizes the Airy kernel in one dimension, well known from
   the random matrix theory. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2015}},

Abstract = {{The reaction of CO2 methane reforming was tested over hydrotalcite-based
   catalysts containing nickel. The nickel species were introduced into the
   catalysts at the coprecipitation stage (HTNi) or postsynthesis (HTexNi).
   Characterization of the catalysts by elemental analysis, X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), H-2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR),
   diffuse-reflectance (DR) ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), low-temperature
   N-2 sorption, and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) experiments
   confirmed successful introduction of nickel species into the
   hydrotalcite structure and onto external surfaces of crystallites. Both
   synthesized catalysts were active in the reaction of dry methane
   reforming at 550 A degrees C. Higher values of CH4 and CO2 conversions
   were obtained for the coprecipitated sample (HTNi). However, higher
   catalytic activity per gram of active material was shown by the HTexNi
   sample, indicating that the method of preparation of hydrotalcite-based
   catalysts strongly influenced their catalytic performance.}},

Abstract = {{This article offers a reflection of three young researchers - an
   urbanist, an historian and a political scientist - on the impact of the
   Egyptian revolution in carrying out their fieldwork research. Looking
   retrospectively at their research activities during a crucial year,
   2011, they question not only the disruptive events taking place among
   the people they were studying, but also their own relationship with
   these people and their environment. Even though belonging to three very
   different fields of the social sciences, in terms of the material used
   and the scale of analysis, the revolutionary events led the three
   researchers to very similar methodological approaches, converging
   towards a more ``micro{''} perspective on their respective topics.
   Finally, this ``bottom-up{''} approach - which tends to cross over the
   temporal, spatial and political dimensions of the studied phenomena -
   proved to be very relevant in analyzing the dynamics of power among
   different sectors of society.}},

Abstract = {{Almost 60\% of operative dentistry is devoted to replacing restorations.
   When practitioners have to replace an amalgam restoration, they tend to

   review, the aim of this article is to determine the best tissue approach

   analyzing and understanding tissue alterations due to the amalgam

   managing the situation. Both tissue orientated and specific mechanical
   approaches are developed and should be implemented to carry out the
   optimal clinical procedure and achieve the most conservative and durable

Abstract = {{The primary goal of this study is to contribute on the literature on
   poverty by looking at household economic hardship in relation to the
   housing cost burden. Being one of the most significant outlays in a
   household balance, housing costs may indeed cause households to reduce
   non-housing expenditure such as health care, education, food, and
   clothing, thus creating serious household economic hardship. Using
   microdata from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living
   Conditions dataset (EU-SILC) regarding five European countries (Italy,
   Germany, UK, Spain, and France) we have examined the predictive power of
   housing costs in explaining family economic hardship. Furthermore, we
   have jointly estimated the effect of the housing cost burden upon
   economic hardship for renters versus homeowners paying mortgages.
   Results showed that housing costs represent a non negligible burden in
   all the five European countries. Moreover, home ownership was found to
   significantly reduce household hardship status.}},

   hallucinations and delusions had undergone a significantly larger number
   of traumatic experiences in childhood, but not as adults. Subjects with
   hallucinations and delusions had higher scores in dissociation than
   those who did not have these psychotic symptoms. It was also found that
   subjects with hallucinations had had experienced more physical abuse and
   threats in childhood, while there were no differences in the type of
   trauma for presence or not of delusions. Finally, of the factors studied
   in this research, only depersonalization predicted the presence of

Journal = {{MATERIA ARQUITECTURA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{30+}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article explores the meaning of `urban conflict' from the
   perspective of a self-help settlement. It is understood that conflicts,
   like settlements, are multi-dimensional and multi-scale. Rather than
   perpetuating a notion of settlements as `conflict' that certain places
   in the world suffer from (the global South), we chose to understand them
   as an expression of diversity, contributing to imagining and building an
   alternative part of the city (Robinson, 2006). Three dimensions will be
   emphasised: govemance (Swyngedouw, 2011), sense of place (Harvey 2001),
   and planning (Roy, 2005; Friedmann, 2005). Some of the conclusions
   suggest reconsidering the planning that denies the existence of
   conflicts and tries to `solve' the problem of settlements by any means.
   Settlements also impact on the way in which agreement to govern the city
   is shared, prioritized and obtained. Finally, places affect the nature
   of the conflict and its solution. As a case study, we will consider the
   Toma de Perialolen (Occupation of Pefialolen), located in the western
   sector of Santiago de Chile. The results shown come from a recent
   research based on 35 interviews, a survey and secondary sources.}},

Abstract = {{Spartina is a distinctive grass genus because of its processes of
   dispersal, survival and evolution. It grows in ecosystems of tidal
   marshes, mudfiats and saline basins. The genus is distributed mainly
   along the entire Atlantic coast, on the Pacific coast only in Baja
   California, Sinaloa and Oaxaca, and in inland areas of Coahuila and San
   Luis Potosi. All species are polyploid with a great capacity for
   hybridization. Frequently species of Spartina have been used in
   restoration of areas with soil loss; however in many cases they have
   become invasive weeds. To date, there has not been carried out an
   exclusive and comprehensive study of this genus in Mexico. The aim of
   this project was to determine the number of species of Spartina and
   their distribution in the country. Based on bibliographic and herbarium
   voucher information, field explorations were carried out in all Mexican
   localities where Spartina had been reported. Four out of the six species
   reported for Mexico were found: S. alterniflora, S. foliosa, S. patens,
   and S. spartinae, the latter being the most widely distributed. Reports
   of S. gracilis in Jalisco and S. cynosuroides in Chihuahua were noted;
   however, these species were not located in field explorations nor in
   herbarium collections. There is no evidence of any introduced species.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical education is foundational to health professional training.
   However, it is also a time of increased stress for students. A student's
   perception of stressors and their capacity to effectively manage them is
   a legitimate concern for educators, because anxiety and decreased coping
   strategies can interfere with effective learning, clinical performance
   and capacity to care for patients. Resilience is emerging as a valuable
   construct to underpin positive coping strategies for learning and
   professional practice. We report the development and evaluation of a
   psycho-education resilience program designed to build practical
   skills-based resilience capacities in health science (physiotherapy)
   students. Six final year undergraduate physiotherapy students attended
   four action research sessions led by a clinical health psychologist.
   Resilience strategies drawn from cognitive behavioural therapy, and
   positive and performance psychology were introduced. Students identified
   personal learning stressors and their beliefs and responses. They chose
   specific resilience-based strategies to address them, and then reported
   their impact on learning performance and experiences. Thematic analysis
   of the audio-recorded and transcribed action research sessions, and
   students' de identified notes was conducted. Students' initial
   descriptions of stressors as `problems' outside their control resulting
   in poor thinking and communication, low confidence and frustration,
   changed to a focus on how they managed and recognized learning
   challenges as normal or at least expected elements of the clinical
   learning environment. The research suggests that replacing stressful
   challenges with positive coping strategies offers a potentially powerful
   tool to build self-efficacy and cognitive control as well as greater
   self-awareness as a learner and future health practitioner.}},

Abstract = {{Speaker diarization has become a key process within other speech
   processing systems which take advantage of single-speaker speech
   signals. Furthermore, finding recurrent speakers among a set of audio
   recordings, known as cross-show diarization, is gaining attention in the
   last years. Current state-of-the-art-systems provide good performance,
   but usually at the cost of long processing times. This limitation may
   make current systems not suitable for real-life applications. In this
   line, the speaker diarization approach based on binary key modeling
   provides a very fast yet accurate alternative. In this paper, we present
   the last improvements applied in binary key speaker diarization with the
   aim of further speeding up the process and improving performance. In
   addition, we propose a novel method for cross-show speaker diarization
   based on binary keys. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the
   proposed improvements for single-show speaker diarization, both in terms
   of speed and performance, obtaining a real-time factor of 0.0354xRT and
   a 16.8\% relative improvement in performance. Furthermore, our proposed
   cross-show approach provides very competitive performance, just slightly
   worse than its single-show diarization counterpart, and exhibits a real
   time factor of 0.04xRT.}},

Abstract = {{Created more than 60 years ago, broadcast television now reaches most of
   brazilian households. Over the decades, however, media broadcasting has
   been consolidated with the predominance of commercial channels and the
   concentration of media ownership in the hands of a few companies. The
   laws concerning the matter are too old and organised civil society
   demands new regulation. A whole chapter of the 1988 Brazilian
   Constitution was dedicated to Communication and has established that
   media broadcasting must have cultural and educative goals, as well as
   prioritize regional and independent content production and base itself
   in the complementarity of public, private and state systems. Based on a
   bibliographical research, this paper aims to analyze brazilian broadcast
   television regarding its inauguration and expansion processes, the set
   of norms and standards that governs it, the lack of public policies for
   mass communication and the contemporary discussion regarding its opening
   for new social actors. Our conclusions show that beyond the need for
   updating the legislation there is a lack of public intervention in order
   to ensure greater social participation, as well as the supervision of
   the broadcasters' operations.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{A range of studies has found that corruption has a significant impact
   upon FDI decisions, however to date there has been scant investigation
   into longer term investments made by firms and their relative proclivity
   to reinvest. Further, there is particularly little work on reinvestment
   choices made on the transitional periphery of post-state socialist
   countries and how these might differ from the more stable transitional
   economies of central and Eastern Europe. Utilising 2005 World Bank
   Enterprise Survey data, this study explores the relationship between
   corruption and MNEs' strategic decision to reinvest profits. From an
   institutionalist starting point, we find variation in the impact of
   different dimensions of corruption upon reinvestment; pervasive
   corruption impacts negatively upon reinvestment, but its effects are
   more pronounced in the transitional periphery. Perceived robust legal
   institutions have a positive correlation with reinvestment, but again,
   the positive effects are less pronounced on the transitional peripheral
   state socialist states. We ascribe this disparity to greater
   institutional fluidity, and explore why this context has particularly
   adverse effects. Finally, we find that firm level attributes of larger
   size and greater age play an important role in positive reinvestment
   decisions, appearing to mitigate the worst consequences of this
   fluidity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mortality audits are being used with increasing frequency to improve
   health outcomes by pinpointing precisely where deficiencies in clinical
   care exist. We conducted a prospective audit of stillbirths and early
   neonatal deaths at Tikur Anbessa Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as
   part of a broader initiative to reduce perinatal mortality in the labor
   room and neonatal intensive care unit. Out of 1,225 deliveries that took
   place during the six-month study period, there were 30 stillbirths and
   31 early neonatal deaths (PMR 50/1,000). A multi-disciplinary Audit Team
   was established and convened monthly to review standardized data
   collection forms that were completed for each death. It was determined
   that avoidable factors were present in 70\% of perinatal deaths. Health
   worker-related factors were the most common avoidable factors identified
   (accounting for 84\% of avoidable factors identified), followed by
   patient-related factors (11\%) and administrative-related factors (5\%).
   Based on the study findings, quality improvement programs that target
   gaps in care are being implemented on the hospital's labor room and in
   the neonatal intensive care unit..}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that type-1 fuzzy sets (T1 FSs) have limited
   capabilities to handle some data uncertainties directly, and type-2
   fuzzy sets (T2 FSs) can cover the shortcoming of T1 FSs to a certain
   extent. Fuzzy discrete event systems (FDESs) were proposed based on T1
   FSs theory. Hence, FDES may not be a satisfactory model to characterize
   some high-uncertainty systems. In this paper, we propose a new model,
   called as bifuzzy discrete event systems (BFDESs), by combining
   classical DESs theory and T2 FSs theory. Then, we consider the
   supervisory control problem of BFDESs. The bifuzzy controllability
   theorem and nonblocking bifuzzy controllability theorem are
   demonstrated. In addition, an algorithm for checking the bifuzzy
   controllability condition is presented. In addition, two controllable
   approximations to an uncontrollable language are investigated in detail.
   An illustrative example is provided to show the applicability and the
   advantages of the BFDES model.}},

Abstract = {{New U-Pb zircon ages and geochemical data including whole rock major and
   trace element concentrations, PGE and radiogenic isotopes are used to
   investigate the magma evolution processes and the sulfide saturation
   history of the Ural-Alaskan type Tuerkubantao mafic-ultramafic intrusion
   in southern Altai orogen. The Tuerkubantao intrusion consists of dunite,
   wehrlite, olivine pyroxenite, gabbro and diorite. Igneous zircons from a
   gabbro in the intrusion yielded a LA-ICP-MS U-Pb age of 370.3 +/- 4.8
   Ma, indicating that the intrusion was emplaced in the Late Devonian. The
   intrusive rocks are characterized by enrichment of large ion lithophile
   elements and depleted high field strength elements relative to N-MORB,
   which is similar to the Devonian Ural-Alaskan type intrusions in
   southern Altai orogen and different from Devonian volcanic rocks from
   ophiolites in West Junggar. The Tuerkubantao intrusive rocks have
   restricted (Sr-87/Sr-86)(t) ratios (0.70396-0.70453) and a large range
   of epsilon Nd-(t) (-2.84 to +3.80). The trace elements and isotope
   compositions are comparable with those of the volcanic rocks along the
   Pacific margins of the Americas. The calculated parental magma of the
   Tuerkubantao rocks has a high-Mg basaltic composition with similar to
   9.12 wt\% MgO and similar to 7.02 wt\% FeOT. It is proposed that the
   primary magma was generated from partial melting of rnetasomatized
   lithospheric mantle triggered by upwelling of asthenosphere at an active
   continental margin. The Cu/Pd ratios in gabbros (9.26 x 10(5)-32.8 x
   10(5)) are obviously higher than those of the wehrlites (1.18 x
   10(4)-1.95 x 10(4)), indicating that gabbros in the intrusion have
   experienced sulfide segregation, whereas sulfide saturation did not
   occur in the wehrlites. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed data are very effective
   meteorological parameters over the sensitive temperature. Daily mean
   temperature (A degrees C), relative humidity (\%), wind speed (m/s), and
   vapor pressure (hPa) data are used in this study. Using the thermal
   indices is calculated to long-term data from 49 stations distributed
   over the western part of Turkey. The Mann-Kendall test is applied to
   identify statistically significant trends at each series of thermal
   indices. The results of this study have shown that there are marked
   spatiotemporal variations in the thermal indices in the western part of
   Turkey. Increasing trends are stronger in summer compare with other
   season. Analysis are displayed that the increasing trends have shown
   warm-hot and discomfort days, especially during the summer season. High
   values of these indices are mainly connected to Azor high-pressure
   system and Monsoonal circulation and weakly etesian winds in summer.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The two main advantages of space-based observation of extreme energy
   (greater than or similar to 5 x10(19) eV) cosmic rays (EECRs) over
   ground based observatories are the increased field of view and the
   full-sky coverage with nearly uniform systematics across the entire sky.
   The former guarantees increased statistics, whereas the latter enables a
   clean partitioning of the sky into spherical harmonics. The discovery of
   anisotropies would help to identify the long sought origin of EECRs. We
   begin an investigation of the reach of a full-sky space-based experiment
   such as EUSO to detect anisotropies in the extreme-energy cosmic-ray sky
   compared to ground based partial-sky experiments such as the Pierre
   Auger Observatory and Telescope Array. The technique is explained here,
   and simulations for a Universe with just two nonzero multipoles,
   monopole plus either dipole or quadrupole, are presented. These
   simulations quantify the advantages of space-based, all-sky coverage.

   sub-categories by test methods of OECD Test Guideline No. 431}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Alternative test methods often use prediction models (PMs) for
   converting endpoint measurements into predictions. Two PMs are used for
   the skin corrosion tests (SCTs) of the OECD Test Guideline No. 431 (TG
   431). One is specific to EpiSkin (TM) test method, whereas EpiDerm (TM),
   SkinEthic (TM) RHE and epiCS (R) share a common PM. These methods are
   based on reconstructed human epidermis models wherein cell viability
   values are measured. Their PMs allow translating those values into
   sub-categories of corrosive chemicals, Category 1A (Catl A) and a
   combination of Categories 1B/1C (Cat1BC), and identifying non-corrosive
   (NC) chemicals. EpiSkin (TM)'s PM already results in sufficiently
   accurate predictions. The common PM of the three others accurately
   identifies all corrosive chemicals but, for sub-categorization, an
   important fraction of Catl BC chemicals (40-50\%) is over-predicted as
   Cat1A. This paper presents a post-hoc analysis of validation data on a
   set of n = 80 chemicals. It investigates: why this common PM causes
   these over-predictions and how two novel PMs that we developed (PMvar1
   and PMvar2) improve the predictive capacity of these methods. PMvar1 is
   based on a two-step approach; PMvar2 is based on a single composite
   indicator of cell viability. Both showed a greater capacity to predict
   Catl BC, while CatlA correct predictions remaining at least at the same
   level of EpiSkin (TM). We suggest revising TG 431, to include the novel
   PMs in view of improving the predictive capacity of its SCTs. (C) 2015

Title = {{High Prevalence of Opaline Silica in Urinary Stones From Burkina Faso}},
Journal = {{UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{86}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To underline peculiar composition of kidney stones and to
   propose an epidemiologic study of urinary stones in West African
   countries, where epidemiologic studies are scarce. Only few data are
   available regarding stone composition in sub-Saharan countries.
   Recently, a set of 100 stones consecutively removed by surgery in the
   Department of Urology of the University Hospital of Ouagadougou in
   Burkina Faso were collected for physical analysis, which provided the
   opportunity to obtain an epidemiologic profile of stone composition in
   this country.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 100 stones from 64 men, 22 women, 10
   boys, and four girls were analyzed by morphologic examination, infrared
   spectroscopy, and electron microscopy in our laboratory. The results
   were considered by sex and separately for adults and children.
   RESULTS Sixty-five percent of the 100 stones contained calcium oxalate
   as the main component. Interestingly, the second main component was
   opaline silica (18\%). Furthermore, opaline silica was identified in any
   proportion in 48\% of the stones. The prevalence was sex and age
   dependent. Opaline silica was detected as the main component in 42\% of
   the nuclei, which underlines its role as one of the main components
   involved in the initiation of calculi in this country.
   CONCLUSION For the first time, a dramatically high occurrence of a
   ``scarce{''} urinary stone component, namely opaline silica, was
   reported in a series of consecutive calculi from a single country. We
   propose that a regular consumption of clay could be the origin of this
   phenomenon in these populations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Aim of the study: Gymnema sylvestre is a well-known herb noted for its
   anti-sweet and antidiabetic properties in both traditional and Ayurvedic
   medicine. The use of modern phyto-pharmaceutical methods may be used to
   improve both the palatability and efficacy of herbal medicines
   previously prepared using old traditional methods. The aim of the
   present study was to develop an improved formulation of G. sylvestre
   extract that utilized its anti-sweet properties for diet control in
   obesity with the added advantage of being patient compliant.
   Materials and methods: The anti-sweet dosage forms of G. sylvestre
   extract were prepared as oral dispersing tablets for immediate action.
   The bitter and unpleasant taste of the plant was masked to improve its
   palatability. The formulation developed was clinically evaluated for
   bitter taste masking and anti-sweet efficacy in healthy human
   volunteers.
   Results: The formulation developed was found to be highly palatable and
   able to produce an anti-sweet effect for a duration of 30 min. Any sweet
   foods consumed within this duration of time failed to taste sweet.
   Conclusions: The formulation developed may serve as a simple, novel and
   workable remedy for people to control their sweet cravings, which in
   turn could help in controlling caloric intake derived from sweet
   substances and thus help in the control of diabetes and obesity. (C)

Abstract = {{A miniature microwave electron cyclotron resonance plasma source
   {[}(discharge diameter)/(microwave cutoff diameter) < 0.3] has been
   developed at Kyushu University to be used as an ion thruster in micro-
   propulsion applications in the exosphere. The discharge source uses both
   radial and axial magnetostatic field confinement to facilitate electron
   cyclotron resonance and increase the electron dwell time in the volume,
   thereby enhancing plasma production efficiency. Performance of the ion
   thruster is studied at 3 microwave frequencies (1.2 GHz, 1.6 GHz, and
   2.45 GHz), for low input powers (< 15 W) and small xenon mass flow rates
   (< 40 mu g/s), by experimentally measuring the extracted ion beam
   current through a potential difference of congruent to 1200 V. The
   discharge geometry is found to operate most efficiently at an input
   microwave frequency of 1.6 GHz. At this frequency, for an input power of
   8 W, and propellant (xenon) mass flow rate of 21 mu g/s, 13.7 mA of ion
   beam current is obtained, equivalent to an calculated thrust of 0.74 mN.

Abstract = {{The Italian insurance market represents a peculiar and puzzling case
   within the European Single Market. Since the radical deregulation
   process in 1992, standard indicators have shown a low degree of market
   concentration. However, at the same time, Italian insurance costs still
   remain among the highest in Europe due to the existence of widespread
   collusive practices, which have been largely documented by both the
   Italian Antitrust Authority and empirical evidence. The main channel of
   anti-competitive behavior seems to be related to the exchange of
   information. To improve the understanding of its structure, our paper
   studies interlocking linkages among firms operating in the Italian
   insurance market. Interlock linkages are apparent when single directors
   sit on more than one company's board. Thus, interlock linkages can be
   viewed as a systemic channel of information exchange and a potential
   source of collusive practices. We distinguish interlock linkages
   occurring within and between groups operating under a common ownership
   because companies operating in the insurance sector may be organized in
   multi-brand holdings. Therefore, we disentangle interlocking
   directorates as holding business strategies from systemic structures
   that might represent potential threats for the market competition.}},

   parasitism (up to 11 parasites) were observed. The mortality of mosquito
   larvae and adults was produced in all cases where at least one mermithid
   emerged. The mortality of S. spiculatus showed an increasing trend in
   mosquito larvae with larger numbers of nematodes and was higher in
   larvae parasitized by eight or more nematodes. Maximum survival of
   parasitized adult females of Ae. albifasciatus was 38 days, while
   non-parasitized adult males and females survived 39 and 41 days,

Abstract = {{Gridded estimates of precipitation using both satellite and
   observational station data are regularly used as reference products in
   the evaluation of basic climate fields and derived indices as simulated
   by regional climate models (RCMs) over the current period. One of the
   issues encountered in RCM evaluation is the fact that RCMs and reference
   fields are usually on different grids and often at different horizontal
   resolutions. A proper RCM evaluation requires remapping on a common
   grid. For the climate indices or other derived fields, the remapping can
   be done in two ways: either as a first-step operation on the original
   field with the derived index computed on the final/common grid in a
   second step, or to compute first the climate index on the original grid
   before remapping or regridding it as a last-step operation on the
   final/common grid. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how the
   two approaches affect the final field, thus contributing to one of the
   Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) in Africa
   (CORDEX-Africa) goals of providing a benchmark framework for RCM
   evaluation over the West Africa monsoon area, using several daily
   precipitation indices. The results indicate the advantage of using the
   last-step remapping procedure, regardless of the mathematical method
   chosen for the remapping, in order to minimize errors in the indices
   under evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To determine the association (1) between shorter operative
   duration and surgical site infection (SSI) and (2) between surgeon
   median operative duration and SSI risk among first-time hip and knee
   arthroplasties.
   DESIGN Retrospective cohort study
   SETTING A total of 43 community hospitals located in the southeastern
   United States.
   PATIENTS Adults who developed SSIs according to National Healthcare
   Safety Network criteria within 365 days of first-time knee or hip
   arthroplasties performed between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012.
   METHODS Log-binomial regression models estimated the association (1)
   between operative duration and SSI outcome and (2) between surgeon
   median operative duration and SSI outcome. Hip and knee arthroplasties
   were evaluated in separate models. Each model was adjusted for American
   Society of Anesthesiology score and patient age.
   RESULTS A total of 25,531 hip arthroplasties and 42,187 knee
   arthroplasties were included in the study. The risk of SSI in knee
   arthroplasties with an operative duration shorter than the 25(th)
   percentile was 0.40 times the risk of SSI in knee arthroplasties with an
   operative duration between the 25(th) and 75(th) percentile (risk ratio
   {[}RR], 0.40; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 0.38-0.56; P<.01). Short
   operative duration did not demonstrate significant association with SSI
   for hip arthroplasties (RR, 1.04; 95\% CI, 0.79-1.37; P=.36). Knee
   arthroplasty surgeons with shorter median operative durations had a
   lower risk of SSI than surgeons with typical median operative durations
   (RR, 0.52; 95\% CI, 0.43-0.64; P<.01).
   CONCLUSIONS Short operative durations were not associated with a higher
   SSI risk for knee or hip arthroplasty procedures in our analysis.

Abstract = {{Different approaches to information system (IS) development are based on
   different data models. The selection of a data model for conceptual
   design, among other things, depends on the problem domain, the
   knowledge, and the personal preferences of an IS designer. In some
   situations, a simultaneous usage of different approaches to the
   conceptual database design and IS development may lead to the most
   appropriate solutions. In our previous research we have developed a tool
   that provides an evolutive and incremental approach to IS development,
   which is based on the form type data model. The approaches based on the
   Extended Entity-Relationship (EER) and class data models are broadly
   accepted throughout the community of IS designers. In order to support
   the simultaneous usage of approaches based on the form type, EER and
   class data models, we have developed the Multi-Paradigm Information
   System Modeling Tool (MIST). In this paper, we present a part of our
   MIST tool that supports EER approach to a database design. MIST
   components currently provide a formal specification of an EER database
   schema specification and its transformation into the relational data
   model, or the class model. Also, MIST allows generation of Structured
   Query Language code for a database creation and procedural code for
   implementing database constraints. In addition, Java code that stores
   and processes data from the database, may be generated from the class
   model. In this paper, we present the evaluation study of the MIST EER
   domain-specific language. Users' perceptions of language quality
   characteristics are used for the evaluation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Effects of Insulin and High Glucose on Human Meibomian Gland Epithelial

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for meibomian gland
   dysfunction (MGD). We hypothesize that this diabetic impact is due, at
   least in part, to the effects of insulin resistance/deficiency and
   hyperglycemia on human meibomian gland epithelial cells (HMGECs). To
   begin to test this hypothesis, we examined whether insulin and high
   glucose influence immortalized (I) HMGECs.
   METHODS. Immortalized HMGECs were cultured in serum-containing or -free
   media and treated with insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1),
   IGF-1 receptor (R) blocking antibody, and glucose or mannitol for
   varying time periods. Specific proteins were detected by Western blots,
   cell proliferation was evaluated by manual cell counting and lipids were
   assessed with LipidTOX and high performance thin layer chromatography.
   RESULTS. We found that insulin induces a dose-dependent increase in
   phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/Akt (AKT) signaling in IHMGECs. This
   effect involves the IGF-1R, but not the insulin receptor (IR), and is
   associated with a stimulation of cell proliferation and neutral lipid
   accumulation. In contrast, high glucose exposure alters cell morphology,
   causes a progressive cell loss, and significantly reduces the levels of
   IGF-1R, phospho (p)-AKT, Foxhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), and
   sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP-1) in IHMGECs.
   CONCLUSIONS. Our data show that insulin stimulates, and that high
   glucose is toxic for, IHMGECs. These results support our hypothesis that
   insulin resistance/deficiency and hyperglycemia are deleterious for
   HMGECs and may help explain why type II diabetes is a risk factor for
   MGD.}},

Abstract = {{Enocoro-80 is a lightweight stream cipher proposed in 2007. Several
   attacks on it have been published, although none have violated the
   claimed 80-bit security of Enocoro-80. The cipher had been adopted as an

   Enocoro-80, and shows that it is vulnerable to a related-key chosen IV
   attack when the key belongs to a large subset of 2(72) of all 2(80)
   keys. This attack has a time complexity of 2(48), requiring 2(17) chosen
   IVs. This is the first paper pointing out a potential weakness in the

Journal = {{PARALLEL PROCESSING LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In a graph or a network G = (V, E), a set S subset of V is a dominating
   set if each node in V - S is adjacent to at least one node in S. A
   dominating set S is called minimal when there does not exist a node i is
   an element of S such that the set S - \{i\} is a dominating set. In this
   paper, we propose a new self-stabilizing algorithm for minimal
   dominating set. It has safe convergence property under synchronous
   daemon in the sense that starting from an arbitrary state, it quickly
   converges to a dominating set (a safe state) in two rounds, and then
   stabilizes in a minimal dominating set (the legitimate state) in O(n)
   rounds without breaking safety during the convergence interval, where n
   is the number of nodes. Space requirement at each node is O(log n) bits.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Follicle-stimulating hormone plays a crucial role in
   spermatogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of
   treatment with FSH in Chinese infertility population.
   Design Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
   clinical study.
   Patients A total of 354 men affected by idiopathic oligozoospermia from
   three medical centres.
   Measurements This study contained three parts: (i) treatment with
   different doses of rhFSH (50 IU, 100 IU, 200 IU and 300 IU); (ii) the
   efficacy of rhFSH at different periods (2, 3, 4, 5 months); (iii) FSH
   treatment in patients with different levels of inhibin B (normal-level
   group, low-level group and high-level group). Semen parameters were
   evaluated in all subjects. The patients who had not reached spontaneous
   pregnancy underwent assisted reproductive techniques.
   Results Sperm number was significantly increased after treatment with
   FSH at doses of at least 200 IU, and the improvement was observed
   beginning at the third month. The significant improvement in both
   morphology and forward motility was observed beginning at the fifth
   month. Moreover, 300 IU rhFSH administration for 5 months could
   significantly improve the spontaneous pregnancy rate (12/40) and ART
   pregnancy rate (14/28), while the rates for placebo group were two of
   twenty-nine and five of twenty-seven, respectively. The seminal
   parameters (total sperm count, sperm concentration, forward motility and
   morphology) were significantly improved in the normal-and low-level
   inhibin B groups, but no significant variation was observed in the
   high-level group at the end of the study.
   Conclusions The efficacy of FSH treatment was associated with the dose
   of FSH and duration of treatment, and FSH therapy was more effective in
   patients with normal level and low level of inhibin B.}},

Abstract = {{Many previous studies have linked religiosity to social trust. Yet much
   of this relation remains insufficiently understood, which is partly due
   to the fact that religiosity is a multidimensional phenomenon. In this
   article, we identify several of those dimensions, including the
   integration in religious communities, the importance of God in people's
   lives, and the religious context. These dimensions give rise to
   different mechanisms that produce both trust-enhancing and
   trust-reducing effects. Data from the European Values Survey (2008) were
   used to test the resulting hypotheses, using multilevel logistic
   regression models. We conclude that the micro effects are ambivalent:
   integration in religious communities furthers trust, whereas religious
   socialization and the importance of God lower trust. On the macro level,
   we find a strong effect of Protestantism, which is in line with previous
   studies, but that remains puzzling since the individual-level difference
   between Protestants and the other religious traditions was found to be
   very small. In addition, in contrast to other studies, we found that
   religious diversity increases social trust.}},

Abstract = {{When a scintigraphically autonomous nodule does not produce thyroid
   hormones enough to suppress serum thyrotrophin, it is generally defined
   as nontoxic autonomous nodule. In this study, we aimed to compare
   clinical and ultrasonographical (US) features and cytological and
   histopathological results of toxic and nontoxic autonomous nodules.
   Patients who underwent thyroidectomy and were evaluated with
   technetium-99m-pertechnetate scintigraphy preoperatively in our
   institution between May 2008 and December 2014 were identified from
   medical records. Among these, treatment na < ve patients with
   scintigraphically autonomous thyroid nodules were chosen and classified
   into toxic (hyperthyroid) and nontoxic (euthyroid) groups. The
   demographic data, preoperative US features of the nodules, fine needle
   aspiration biopsy and histopathological results were analyzed.
   There were 170 (89.0 \%) patients with toxic and 21 (11.0 \%) patients
   with nontoxic autonomous nodules. A total of 258 scintigraphically
   autonomous nodules were analyzed among which 227 were clinically
   functional (toxic) and 31 were clinically euthyroid (nontoxic).
   Echogenity, texture, marginal irregularity, presence of halo and
   macrocalcification were similar in toxic and nontoxic autonomous
   nodules. Toxic autonomous nodules were significantly bigger and had a
   significantly higher rate of microcalcification compared to nontoxic
   ones (p = 0.001 and p = 0.025, respectively). There was no significant
   difference in terms of cytological diagnosis between toxic and nontoxic
   autonomous nodules (p = 0.052). Atypia of undetermined
   significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance cytology was
   significantly higher in nontoxic group (p = 0.01). 20 (8.8 \%) of 227
   toxic and 2 (6.5 \%) of 31 nontoxic autonomous nodules were malignant (p
   = 0.59). Considering all nodules regardless of the thyroid function, 8.5
   \% of autonomous nodules was malignant.
   US features and malignancy potential of nontoxic autonomous nodules
   resemble toxic autonomous nodules. Lower diameter suggests that they can
   represent a preliminary stage of toxic ones and have potential of
   toxicity when get bigger in size. There is still a considerable risk of
   malignancy risk in autonomous nodules whether toxic or not.}},

Title = {{Establishing a surgical outreach program in the developing world:
   pediatric strabismus surgery in Guatemala City, Guatemala}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AAPOS}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE To report our experince in establishing a sustainable pediatric
   surgical outreach mission to an underserved population in Guatemala for
   treatment of strabismic disorders.
   METHODS A pediatric ophthalmic surgical outreach mission was
   established. Children were evaluated for surgical intervention by 3
   pediatric ophthalmologists and 2 orthoptists. Surgical care was provided
   at the Moore Pediatric Surgery Center, Guatemala City, over 4 days.
   Postoperative care was facilitated by Guatemalan physicians during the
   second year.
   RESULTS In year 1, patients 1-17 years of age were referred by local
   healthcare providers. In year 2, more than 60\% of patients were
   prescreened by a local pediatric ophthalmologist. We screened 47\% more
   patients in year 2 (132 vs 90). Diagnoses included congenital and
   acquired esotropia, consecutive and acquired exotropia, congenital
   nystagmus, Duane syndrome, Brown syndrome, cranial nerve palsy,
   dissociated vertical deviation, and oblique muscle dysfunction. Overall,
   42\% of the patients who were screened underwent surgery. We performed
   21 more surgeries in our second year (58 vs 37), a 57\% increase. There
   were no significant intra- or postoperative complications.
   CONCLUSIONS Surgical outreach programs for children with strabismic
   disorders in the developing world can be established through
   international cooperation, a multidisciplinary team of healthcare
   providers, and medical equipment allocations. Coordinating care with
   local pediatric ophthalmologists and medical directors facilitates best
   practice management for sustainability.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Numerous predictive models have been developed to determine the
   likelihood that non-native plants will escape from cultivation and
   potentially become invasive. Given the substantial biological and
   economic costs that can result from the introduction of a new invasive
   plant and the unending pressures of world trade and transport, the
   creation and implementation of effective predictive models are becoming
   increasingly important. One key question in the development of such
   models focuses on the geographic scope at which models can best be
   developed and applied. We have developed models to predict woody-plant
   naturalization in five local areas within the Upper Midwest (United
   States). Herein, we consider whether naturalization can be reasonably
   predicted from a single model for the entire region or whether local
   models are required for each specific area. We develop a random forest
   model to predict the probability of naturalization in the region and
   compare out-of-sample prediction errors between the regional and local
   models. The regional model makes better predictions of the probability
   of naturalization for those species observed to naturalize but worse
   predictions for those not currently observed to naturalize. This model
   development process has given us an opportunity (not previously
   addressed in the literature) to examine the strengths and weaknesses of
   local and regional approaches, with the ultimate intent of optimizing
   geographic scope.}},

Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study argues that heterogeneous farms operating under a delivery
   target may yield significant economic benefits if they coordinate their
   production portfolio. To analyze the gains from cooperation, we simulate
   various cooperative game solutions over seven cotton producing farms in
   a bio-economic model of a water users association. The study results
   show that cooperation can fulfill multiple objectives: ensure the cotton
   production targets, increase farm profits and grain production, and
   reduce the pressure on water resources. We investigate a situation where
   farms differ in soil quality and distance to irrigation canals. The
   proposed modification in the national cotton procurement policy that
   utilizes the comparative advantages of cooperating cotton-producing
   farms can make the cooperative agreements economically attractive even
   among heterogeneous farms. It should be noted that the benefits offered
   from farm cooperation may be smaller or even vanish if transaction costs
   grow excessively in response to the heterogeneity of participating farms
   and the size of the cooperative. In addition, the economic benefits will
   not necessarily be distributed equally among participating farms and
   thus require the development of fair division rules. In this respect,
   net gain allocation schemes based on production costs, size and cotton
   output of farm cooperation are presented and discussed against the
   distinct social features of rural Uzbekistan. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A new approach is proposed for assessment of the quality of restrained
   Rietveld refinement. As the first step, we require the consistency of
   the restraints and diffraction data: namely, the absence of outliers in
   the distribution of the bond length deviations from the target values.
   This condition is tested using a simple and robust outlier detection
   criterion and can be reached for any correct structure. Then, the range
   of restraint variation where the model remains consistent (uncertainty
   window) is calculated. This metric is indicative of the combined model
   and data quality. The average half uncertainty window (HUW) can serve as
   an estimate of the effective bond precision; HUW < 0.04 angstrom is
   reachable for highly crystalline powders, and HUW exceeds 0.3 angstrom
   for unacceptable models. A round-robin involving the most popular
   laboratory diffractometer geometries and an analysis of literature
   examples show that HUW, unlike `classic' R values, is instrument
   independent and versatile.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates acoustic emission generated during tension
   fatigue tests carried out on a carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP)
   composite specimen. Since massive fatigue data processing, especially
   noise reduction, remains an important challenge in AE data analysis, a
   Mahalanobis distance-based noise modeling has been proposed in the
   present work to tackle this problem. A sequential feature selection
   based on Davies-Bouldin index has been implemented for fast
   dimensionality reduction. An unsupervised classifier offline-learned
   from quasi-static data is then used to classify the data to different AE
   sources with the possibility to dynamically accommodate with unseen
   ones. With an efficient proposed noise removal and automatic separation
   of AE events, this pattern discovery procedure provides an insight into
   fatigue damage development in composites in the presence of millions of
   AE events. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Existing data supports a relationship between pelvic floor
   dysfunction and lower urinary tract symptoms. We developed a survival
   model of pelvic floor dysfunction in the rabbit and evaluated
   cystometric (CMG), electromyographic (EMG) and ambulatory voiding
   behavior.
   Materials and Methods: Twelve female adult virgin rabbits were housed in
   metabolic cages to record voiding and defecation. Anesthetized CMG/EMG
   was performed before and after treatment animals (n=9) received
   bilateral tetanizing needle stimulation to the pubococcygeous (PC)
   muscle and controls (n=3) sham needle placement. After 7 days all
   animals were subjected to tetanizing transvaginal stimulation and
   CMG/EMG. After 5 days a final CMG/EMG was performed.
   Results: Of rabbits that underwent needle stimulation 7 of 9 (78\%)
   demonstrated dysfunctional CMG micturition contractions versus 6 of 12
   (50\%) after transvaginal stimulation. Needle stimulation of the PC
   musculature resulted in significant changes in: basal CMG pressure,
   precontraction pressure change, contraction pressure, interval between
   contractions and postvoid residual; with time to 3rd contraction
   increased from 38 to 53 minutes (p=0.008 vs. prestimulation). Vaginal
   noxious stimulation resulted in significant changes in: basal CMG
   pressure and interval between contractions; with time to 3rd contraction
   increased from 37 to 46 minutes (p=0.008 vs. prestimulation). Changes in
   cage parameters were primarily seen after direct needle stimulation.
   Conclusions: In a majority of animals, tetanizing electrical stimulation
   of the rabbit pelvic floor resulted in voiding changes suggestive of
   pelvic floor dysfunction as characterized by a larger bladder capacity,
   longer interval between contractions and prolonged contraction duration.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate between-site agreement of apparent diffusion
   coefficient (ADC) measurements in preclinical magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) systems.
   Materials and Methods: A miniaturized thermally stable ice-water phantom
   was devised. ADC (mean and interquartile range) was measured over
   several days, on 4.7T, 7T, and 9.4T Bruker, Agilent, and Magnex
   small-animal MRI systems using a common protocol across seven sites.
   Day-to-day repeatability was expressed as percent variation of mean ADC
   between acquisitions. Cross-site reproducibility was expressed as 1.96 x
   standard deviation of percent deviation of ADC values.
   Results: ADC measurements were equivalent across all seven sites with a
   cross-site ADC reproducibility of 6.3\%. Mean day-to-day repeatability
   of ADC measurements was 2.3\%, and no site was identified as presenting
   different measurements than others (analysis of variance {[}ANOVA] P =
   0.02, post-hoc test n.s.). Between-slice ADC variability was negligible
   and similar between sites (P = 0.15). Mean within-region-of-interest ADC
   variability was 5.5\%, with one site presenting a significantly greater
   variation than the others (P = 0.0013).
   Conclusion: Absolute ADC values in preclinical studies are comparable
   between sites and equipment, provided standardized protocols are
   employed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a dynamic structural lifecycle model to study how
   heterogeneous health and medical spending shocks affect the savings
   behavior of the elderly. Individuals are allowed to respond to health
   shocks in two ways: They can directly pay for their health care expenses
   (self-insure) or they can rely on health insurance contracts. There are
   two possible insurance options, one through formal contracts and another
   through informal care provided by family. Formal contracts may be
   affected by asymmetric information problems whereas informal insurance
   depends on social ties (cohesion) and on bequeathable wealth. I estimate
   the model on SHARE data using simulated method of moments for four
   levels of wealth in a sample of single retired Europeans. Counterfactual
   experiments show that health, medical spending, and health insurance are
   indeed the main drivers of the slow wealth decumulation in old age. I
   also find that social cohesion rises with age, declines with wealth, and
   is higher in Mediterranean countries than in Central European and
   Scandinavian countries. Finally, high social cohesion appears typically
   associated with increased life expectancy.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Dozens of studies have found learning strategies based on the ``testing
   effect{''} promote greater recall than those that rely solely on
   reading; however, the advantages of testing are often only observed
   after a delay (e.g., 2-7 days later). In contrast, our research, which
   has focused on kinesiology students learning kinesiology information
   that is generally familiar to them, has consistently demonstrated that
   testing-based strategies produce greater recall both immediately and
   after a delay. In an attempt to understand the discrepancies in the
   literature, the purpose of the present study was to determine if the
   time-related advantages of a testing-based learning strategy vary with
   one's familiarity with the to-be-learned information. Participants used
   both read-only and testing-based strategies to repeatedly study three
   different sets of information: 1) previously studied human muscle
   information (familiar information), 2) a mix of previously studied and
   previously unstudied human muscle information (mixed information), and
   3) previously unstudied muscle information that is unique to sharks
   (unfamiliar information). Learning was evaluated via free recall
   assessments administered immediately after studying and again after a
   1-wk delay and a 3-wk delay. Across those three assessments, the
   read-only strategy resulted in mean scores of 29.26 +/- 1.43, 15.17 +/-
   1.29, and 5.33 +/- 0.77 for the familiar, mixed, and unfamiliar
   information, respectively, whereas the testing-based strategy produced
   scores of 34.57 +/- 1.58, 16.90 +/- 1.31, and 8.33 +/- 0.95,
   respectively. The results indicate that the testing-based strategy
   produced greater recall immediately and up through the 3-wk delay
   regardless of the participants' level of familiarity with the muscle
   information.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Limited evidence suggests that male exposure to ubiquitous
   environmental phthalates may result in poor reproductive outcomes among
   female partners.
   Methods: This analysis included male female couples undergoing in vitro
   fertilization (IVF) and/or intrauterine insemination (IUI). We evaluated
   associations between the geometric mean of paternal specific
   gravity-adjusted urinary phthalate concentrations prior to the female
   partners' cycle and fertilization, embryo quality, implantation, and
   live birth using generalized linear mixed models.
   Results: Two-hundred eighteen couples underwent 211 IVF and 195 lUI
   cycles. Trends were observed between paternal urinary
   mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP; P=0.01) and mono(carboxyoctyl)
   phthalate (MCOP; P = 0.01) and decreased odds of implantation. MCPP and
   MCOP were also associated with decreased odds of live birth following
   IVF (P = 0.01 and P = 0.04, respectively), and monobutyl phthalate above
   the first quartile was significantly associated with decreased odds of
   live birth following IUI (P= 0.04). However, most urinary phthalate
   metabolites were not associated with these reproductive outcomes.
   Conclusion: Selected phthalates were associated with decreased odds of
   implantation and live birth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Genome size varies c.2400-fold in angiosperms (flowering plants),
   although the range of genome size is skewed towards small genomes, with
   a mean genome size of 1C = 5.7 Gb. One of the most crucial factors
   governing genome size in angiosperms is the relative amount and activity
   of repetitive elements. Recently, there have been new insights into how
   these repeats, previously discarded as `junk' DNA, can have a
   significant impact on gene space (i.e. the part of the genome comprising
   all the genes and gene-related DNA). Here we review these new findings
   and explore in what ways genome size itself plays a role in influencing
   how repeats impact genome dynamics and gene space, including gene
   expression.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Hallux valgus is a complex foot deformity resulting from medial
   deviation of first metatarsal and lateral deviation of toe. Radiographic
   and functional outcomes of chevron type distal metatarsal osteotomy
   applied to symptomatic hallux valgus patients with moderate deformity
   were assessed in the present study. Chevron osteotomy was applied to 27
   feet (13 left, 14 right) of 22 patients (12 women and 10 men; mean age:
   45 +/- 16.7 years). Mean follow-up was 15.4 +/- 4.71 months (range,
   10-24). Material and Method: The average preoperative AOFAS score of
   39.1 +/- 8.55 (range, 32-57) improved (p < 0.0001) to 87.8 +/- 4.7
   (range, 82-97). The average preoperative hallux valgus angle (HVA) of
   37.4 +/- 5.8 (range, 29-50) improved (p < 0.0001) to 14.8 +/- 3.1
   (range, 10-20), and the average preoperative intermetatarsal 1-2 angle
   (IMA) of 13.1 +/- 1.5 (range, 11-17) improved (p < 0.0001) to 7.1 +/-
   1.4 (range, 5-9). The average sesamoid position improved from 2.9 +/-
   0.2 (range, 2-3) preoperatively to 1.2 +/- 0.4 (range, 1-2) (p <
   0.0001). Toe hypoesthesia was developed in one patient as a
   complication. At the end of follow-up, patient satisfaction was found to
   be excellent in 16 feet (59.2\%) and good in 11 feet (40.8\%). Results:
   The results of the study that chevron osteotomy yields good radiological
   result, high degree of postoperative patient satisfaction with minimal
   complications. Chevron ostoetomy is most effective method in the
   treatment of moderate hallux valgus.}},

Title = {{Pre-operative image-based segmentation of the cranial nerves and blood
   vessels in microvascular decompression: Can we prevent unnecessary
   explorations?}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{159-165}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: This study was conducted to validate the accuracy of
   image-based pre-operative segmentation using the gold standard
   endoscopic and microscopic findings for localization and pre-operative
   diagnosis of the offensive vessel.
   Patients and methods: Fourteen TN and 6 HS cases were randomly selected.
   All patients had 3T MRI, which included thin-sectioned 3D space T2, 3D
   Time of Flight and MPRAGE Sequences. Imaging sequences were loaded in
   BrainLab iPlanNet and fused. Individual segmentation of the affected
   cranial nerves and the compressing vascular structure was performed by a
   neurosurgeon, and the results were compared with the microscopic and
   endoscopic findings by two blinded neurosurgeons. For each case, at
   least three neurovascular landmarks were targeted. Each segmented
   neurovascular element was validated by manual placement of the
   navigation probe over each target, and errors of localization were
   measured in mm.
   Results: All patients underwent retro-sigmoid craniotomy and MVD using
   both microscope and endoscope. Based on image segmentation, the
   compressing vessel was identified in all cases except one, which was
   also negative intraoperatively. Perfect correspondence was found between
   image-based segmentation and endoscopic and microscopic images and
   videos (Dice coefficient of 1). Measurement accuracy was 0.45 +/- 0.21
   mm (mean SD).
   Conclusion: Image-based segmentation is a promising method for
   pre-operative identification and localization of offending blood vessels
   causing HFS and TN. Using this method may prevent some unnecessary
   explorations on especially atypical cases with no vascular contacts.
   However, negative pre-operative image segmentation may not preclude one
   from exploration in classic cases of TN or HFS. A multicenter study with
   larger number of cases is recommended. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Adoptive therapy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells (CART
   cells) has exhibited great promise in clinical trials, with efficient
   response correlated with CART-cell expansion and persistence. Despite
   extensive clinical use, the mechanisms regulating CART-cell expansion
   and persistence have not been completely elucidated. We have examined
   the antileukemia potency of CART cells targeting CD19 antigen using
   second-generation CAR containing a CD28 co-stimulatory domain cloned
   into piggyBac-transposon vector and patient-derived chemoresistant
   pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples. In the presence of large
   numbers of target cells characteristic of patients with high leukemia
   burden, excessive proliferation of CART cells leads to differentiation
   into short-lived effector cells. Transient leukemia growth delay was
   induced by CART-cell infusion in mice xenografted with rapidly growing
   CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and was followed by rapid
   CART-cell extinction. Conditioning with the hypomethylating agent
   5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine-activating caspase 3 and promotion of apoptosis
   in leukemia cells maximized the effect of CART cells and improved
   CART-cell persistence. These data suggest that the clinical use of
   5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine before CART cells could be considered. Coculture
   of leukemia cells with bone marrow stroma cells reduced target cell
   loss, suggesting that leukemia cell mobilization into circulation may
   help to remove the protective effect of bone marrow stroma and increase
   the efficacy of CART-cell therapy. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{Based on the China Health and Nutrition Survey longitudinal data from
   1989 to 2009 and using BMI z-score as the measure of adiposity, we
   estimate the intergenerational transmission of BMI in China. The OLS
   estimates suggest that a one standard deviation increase in father's or
   mother's BMI is associated with an increase of around 20\% in child's
   Body Mass Index (BMI) z-score. These estimates decrease to around 14\%
   when we control for family fixed effects. We examine the heterogeneity
   of this BMI intergenerational transmission process across family income,
   parental occupation and poverty status and also find this
   intergenerational correlation tends to be higher among children of
   higher BMI levels, though this tendency becomes weaker as children

Abstract = {{This study aimed at evaluating the use of polypropylene fabrics in
   weaned pig facilities (5-10 weeks of age) during the winter period to
   improve thermal environment and energy saving for heating. Two
   experiments were conducted to validate the effects of fabrics (F)
   compared to control (C) in three 2-week periods using natural
   ventilation (assay 1, 2013) and forced ventilation (assay 2, 2014). Air
   temperature was greater in F than in C compartments in both years,
   particularly during the first 2-week periods (2 A degrees C of mean
   difference). Natural ventilation was not enough to maintain relative
   humidity levels below 70 \% at the end of the postweaning period (9-10
   weeks of age) in both groups (F and C), whereas forced ventilation
   allowed controlling daily mean relative humidity levels < 60 \%. About
   12-26 \% of the radiant heat was transmitted through the fabrics cover,
   depending on the wavelength. There were no differences on growth
   performance of piglets in the two compartments in both years. The use of
   polypropylene fabrics was associated with a significant electric energy
   saving for heating during the first (data available only in 2014) and
   second 2-week period in both years. In conclusion, polypropylene fabrics
   may be an interesting tool to provide optimal environmental conditions
   for weaned piglets in winter, especially during the two first weeks
   after weaning. Their transmittance properties allow trapping infrared
   emission produced by the piglets and heating, avoiding heat losses
   through the roof, and therefore saving heating energy.}},

Abstract = {{While analyzing Plato's theory of ideas Deleuze claims that it 1) is
   based on the process of comparing and selection of pretenders and 2) can
   be ``reversed{''} through presenting this process as an infinite process
   of becoming never coming to any identity or stability. To build a
   mathematical model of this philosophy we can take Deleuze's words
   literally and consider objects together with their comparison to each
   other on the basis of better or worse conformity to the ideal prototype.
   This gives us a partial order relation and in this way, we arrive to
   Heyting algebras or partially ordered sets with special properties. In
   mathematics these algebras in particular serve as locales in the
   so-called pointless topology. In this topology, the point is a derivable
   notion and is defined as ultrafilter. In the context of Deleuze's
   ontology, the latter plays the role of the transcendent idea - the end
   of becoming. Thus pointless topology equips us with a theory in which
   the system of locale's differences ``simulates{''} identities of points.
   This suggests this topology as a mathematical model of Deleuze's
   ontology of becoming. This is even more so if we take into account that
   there are locales without points, which provide us with a model of
   Deleuzian becoming without end.}},

   of inter-layer C-C covalent bonds and this leads to strong resistance to
   hydrogenation. In addition, the electronic properties of stable,

   coverage were investigated. This study paves the way to the selective
   functionalization of BLG for various applications.}},

Journal = {{ONCOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Inhibition of nuclear factor-B (NF-B) results in antitumor activity in
   leukemia cells, and may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the
   treatment of leukemia. However, a significant limitation of NF-B
   inhibition in the treatment of leukemia is the low efficiency of this
   technique. NF-B inhibitor treatment induces apoptosis in leukemia cells;
   however, it additionally causes inflammatory molecules to induce
   increased sensitivity of healthy hematopoietic cells to cell death
   signals, therefore limiting its clinical applications. Tumor necrosis
   factor- (TNF-) is a key regulator of inflammation, and induces a variety
   of actions in leukemic and healthy hematopoietic cells. TNF- induces
   NF-B-dependent and -independent survival signals, promoting the
   proliferation of leukemia cells. However, in healthy hematopoietic
   cells, TNF- induces death signaling, an effect which is enhanced by the
   inhibition of NF-B. Based on these observations, the present study
   hypothesized that inhibition of TNF- signaling may be able to protect
   healthy hematopoietic cells and other tissue cells, while increasing the
   anti-leukemia effects of NF-B inhibition on leukemia cells. The role and
   underlying molecular mechanisms of TNF- inhibition in the regulation of
   NF-B inhibition-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells was therefore
   investigated in the present study. The results indicated that inhibition
   of TNF- enhanced NF-B inhibition-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells. It
   was also revealed that protein kinase B was significant in the
   regulation of TNF- and NF-B inhibition-induced apoptosis. During this
   process, intrinsic apoptotic pathways were activated. A combination of
   NF-B and TNF- inhibition may be a potential specific and effective novel
   therapeutic strategy for the treatment of leukemia.}},

Abstract = {{Tumor angiogenesis is critical for cancer progression. In multiple
   murine models, endothelium-specific epsin deficiency abrogates tumor
   progression by shifting the balance of VEGFR2 signaling toward
   uncontrolled tumor angiogenesis, resulting in dysfunctional tumor
   vasculature. Here, we designed a tumor endothelium-targeting chimeric
   peptide (UPI) for the purpose of inhibiting endogenous tumor endothelial
   epsins by competitively binding activated VEGFR2. We determined that the
   UPI peptide specifically targets tumor endothelial VEGFR2 through an
   unconventional binding mechanism that is driven by unique residues
   present only in the epsin ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) and the
   VEGFR2 kinase domain. In murine models of neoangiogenesis, UPI peptide
   increased VEGF-driven angiogenesis and neovascularization but spared
   quiescent vascular beds. Further, in tumor-bearing mice, UPI peptide
   markedly impaired functional tumor angiogenesis, tumor growth, and
   metastasis, resulting in a notable increase in survival.
   Coadministration of UPI peptide with cytotoxic chemotherapeutics further
   sustained tumor inhibition. Equipped with localized tumor
   endothelium-specific targeting, our UPI peptide provides potential for
   an effective and alternative cancer therapy.}},

Abstract = {{While online offending has been found to be a specialized phenomenon,
   most literature on criminality indicates that offending behavior over
   the life course is of a general nature, which is consistent with
   Gottfredson and Hirschi's general theory of crime. Utilizing data
   collected from a large sample of 502 undergraduate college students,
   this study examined the extent to which college students commit off-line
   offending as compared with online offending. Results from a series of
   bivariate and multivariate analyses indicated support for
   conceptualizing online offending as part of a more general offending
   repertoire rather than as a specialty. Detailed findings, study
   limitations, and implications for both criminal career research and the
   specialization debate are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: New screening methods that can add predictive diagnostic
   value for aggressive (high-grade, Gleason score >= 7) prostate cancer
   (PCa) are needed to reduce unnecessary biopsies for patients with
   non-aggressive PCa. This is particularly important for men presenting
   for an initial biopsy with an equivocal PSA in the 2-10 ng ml(-1) range.
   PCA3 and ERG are biomarkers that can add predictive value for PCa in
   urine; however, with a limited utility as a digital rectal exam (DRE) is
   required.
   METHODS: First-catch urine samples were collected at six sites from men
   scheduled to undergo a prostate biopsy. Exosomal RNA was extracted, RNA
   copy numbers of ERG and PCA3 were measured by reverse
   transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and the EXO106 score (the sum
   of normalized PCA3 and ERG RNA levels) was computed. Performance was
   compared with standard of care (SOC; PSA, age, race or family history)
   parameters. Contingency table, logistic regression, receiver operating
   characteristics curve and box-plot analyses were performed.
   RESULTS: In this cohort (N = 195), a dichotomous EXO106 score
   demonstrated good clinical performance in predicting biopsy result for
   both any cancer and high-grade disease. For high-grade disease, the
   negative and positive predictive values were 97.5\% and 34.5\%,
   respectively. The discrimination between high-grade and Gleason score. 6
   (including benign) biopsy results by a combination of EXO106 and SOC
   (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.803) was significantly improved compared
   with SOC without EXO106 (AUC = 0.6723, P = 0.0009). The median EXO106
   score correlated (P < 0.001; Spearman's rank order) with histologic
   grade.
   CONCLUSIONS: A novel molecular signature (EXO106 score) derived from
   non-DRE urine demonstrated independent, negative predictive value for
   the diagnosis of high-grade PCa from initial biopsy for men with `gray
   zone' serum PSA levels. Its use in the biopsy decision process could
   result in fewer prostate biopsies for clinically insignificant disease.}},

Abstract = {{Extracellular proteins play crucial roles in the interaction between
   mycorrhizal fungi and their environment. Computational prediction and
   experimental detection allowed identification of 869 proteins
   constituting the exoproteome of Hebeloma cylindrosporum. Small secreted
   proteins (SSPs) and carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) were the two
   major classes of extracellular proteins.
   Twenty-eight per cent of the SSPs were secreted by free-living mycelia
   and five of the 10 most abundant extracellular proteins were SSPs. By
   contrast, 63-75\% of enzymes involved in nutrient acquisition were
   secreted.
   A total of 150 extracellular protein-coding genes were differentially
   expressed between mycorrhizas and free-living mycelia. SSPs were the
   most affected. External environmental conditions also affected
   expression of 199 exoproteome genes in mycorrhizas. SSPs displayed
   different patterns of regulation in response to presence of a host plant
   or other environmental signals. Several of the genes most overexpressed
   in the presence of organic matter encoded oxidoreductases.
   Hebeloma cylindrosporum has not fully lost its ancestral saprotrophic
   capacities but rather adapted them not to harm its hosts and to use soil
   organic nitrogen. The complex and divergent patterns of regulation of
   SSPs in response to a symbiotic partner and/or organic matter suggest
   various roles in the biology of mycorrhizal fungi.}},

Abstract = {{While today's revenue management systems are increasingly sophisticated,
   there is no one-size-fits-all solution. An airline must regularly
   re-evaluate its business model against the many options available and
   invest time, effort and money to move from one mode of revenue
   management to the other. Each airline has its own specific business
   model and network structure, so estimating `return on investment' from
   changes in revenue management methods based on academic literature or
   case studies from other airlines may not be fully applicable. This
   article describes how the authors successfully employed simulation
   analysis tools to estimate the impacts of various revenue management
   methods when applied to an airline's specific network and fare
   structure. For the six airlines considered in this study, the estimated
   revenue benefits of moving from leg-based to full-O\&D controls ranged
   between 1 and 6 per cent improvement, and the simulation results helped
   us gain better insights into the factors affecting those benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Freed from the competition of large raptors, Paleocene carnivores could
   expand their newly acquired habitats in search of prey. Such changing
   conditions might have led to their successful distribution and rapid
   radiation. Today, molecular evolutionary biologists are faced, however,
   with the consequences of such accelerated adaptive radiations, because
   they led to sequential speciation more rapidly than phylogenetic markers
   could be fixed. The repercussions being that current genealogies based
   on such markers are incongruent with species trees.
   Our aim was to explore such conflicting phylogenetic zones of evolution
   during the early arctoid radiation, especially to distinguish diagnostic
   from misleading phylogenetic signals, and to examine other
   carnivore-related speciation events. We applied a combination of
   high-throughput computational strategies to screen carnivore and related
   genomes in silico for randomly inserted retroposed elements that we then
   used to identify inconsistent phylogenetic patterns in the Arctoidea
   group, which is well known for phylogenetic discordances.
   Our combined retrophylogenomic and in vitro wet lab approach detected
   hundreds of carnivore-specific insertions, many of them confirming
   well-established splits or identifying and solving conflicting species
   distributions. Our systematic genome-wide screens for Long INterspersed
   Elements detected homoplasy-free markers with insertion-specific
   truncation points that we used to distinguish phylogenetically
   informative markers from conflicting signals. The results were
   independently confirmed by phylogenetic diagnostic Short INterspersed
   Elements. As statistical analysis ruled out ancestral hybridization,
   these doubly verified but still conflicting patterns were statistically
   determined to be genomic remnants from a time of ancestral incomplete
   lineage sorting that especially accompanied large parts of Arctoidea
   evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Four years after the beginning of the ``Arab uprisings{''}, a certain
   pessimism is gaining ground: researchers, analysts, political actors
   previously involved in the social contestations of the spring 2011, have
   reasons to doubt the possibility of ``Arab revolutions{''}. Between
   ``counter-revolutions{''} and civil wars, from Syria to Egypt, an
   historical moment, opened in 2011, could be definitely closed. The
   ``Arab revolutions{''} seem apparently defeated. Yet, it is perhaps the
   very concept of revolution, which has remained unthought since the end
   of the 1980's. The concept of ``revolution{''} has been associated to
   the different messianic ideologies, sometimes very violent, of the
   twentieth century; then it has been subsumed under the sole paradigm of
   ``democratic transitions{''}. The failures of the ``Arab revolutions{''}
   do not undermine the relevance of the concept of ``revolution{''}. Civil
   wars, complex dialectic between ``revolutions{''} and
   ``counter-revolutions{''}, permanent debates on the necessity of
   ``reforms{''} or ``revolutions{''}: the ``Arab revolutions{''},
   understood through their crisis, echo some past revolutionary
   ``patterns{''}.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously shown that poliovirus (PV) infection induces stress
   granule (SG) formation early in infection and then inhibits the
   formation of SG and disperses processing bodies (PBs) by the mid-phase
   of infection. Loss of SG was linked to cleavage of G3BP1 by viral 3C
   proteinase (3C(pro)), however dispersal of PBs was not strongly linked
   to cleavage of specific factors by viral proteinases, suggesting other
   viral proteins may play roles in inhibition of SG or PB formation. Here
   we have screened all viral proteins for roles in inducing or inhibiting
   the formation of RNA granules by creating fusions with mCherry and
   expressing them individually in cells. Expression of viral proteins
   separately revealed that the capsid region P1, 2A(pro), 3A, 3C(pro), the
   protease precursor 3CD and 3D polymerase all affect RNA granules to
   varying extents, whereas 2BC does not. 2A(pro), which cleaves eIF4GI,
   induced SGs as expected, and entered novel foci containing the SG
   nucleating protein G3BP1. Of the two forms of G3BP, only G3BP1 is
   cleaved by a virus proteinase, 3C(pro), whereas G3BP2 is not cleaved by
   3C(pro) or 2A(pro). Surprisingly, 3CD, which contains proteinase
   activity, differentially repressed PBs but not SGs. Further, both
   2A(pro) and 3C(pro) expression dispersed PBs, however molecular targets
   were different since PB dispersal due to 2A(pro) and heat shock protein
   (Hsp)90 inhibition but not 3C(pro), could be rescued by application of
   oxidative stress to cells. The data indicate that PV repression of SGs
   and PBs is multifactorial, though protease function is dominant.}},

Title = {{The postapocalyptic imagination}},
Journal = {{THESIS ELEVEN}},

Volume = {{131}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{99-113}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Apocalypse as a literary genre, as well as a political and religious
   agenda, has been criticized by writers such as Lee Quinby and Katherine
   Keller for its formula, which tends toward punishment for transgression
   and salvation of an elect. These same writers critique postapocalypse
   for its propensity for nihilism and portrayal of a human species beyond
   redemption'. But perhaps it is precisely this refusal to redeem that
   endows postapocalypse with dangerous possibilities. The postapocalypse
   does not have to be considered (and subsequently neutralized) via the
   same moral underpinnings that structure apocalypse. This paper frames
   postapocalypse not as a literature of pessimism or warning but as a
   radical context to explore dangerous possibilities without rehearsing
   apocalypse's characteristic damnation, salvation and enforcement of a
   horizon of revelation that simultaneously works to obliterate aberrant
   possibilities. In order to explore these claims, the process of thinking
   beyond revelation in apocalypse is defined here as the postapocalyptic
   imagination'. Its expressions are found in postapocalyptic texts, but
   also in other kinds of texts that respond to, and in some cases resist,
   the teleological drive of late capitalist narratives of endless
   progress. The postapocalyptic world is host to mutations, amalgamations
   and strange appropriations of forms and ideas left in the wreckage
   beyond the end. It is the task of the postapocalyptic imagination to
   explore what possibilities these abominations' might offer. This paper
   considers the motifs, characters and settings of postapocalyptic texts,
   alongside some of the anxieties and critiques they express.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Work on structural stigma shows how public policy affects health
   outcomes for members of devalued groups, including sexual minorities. In
   the current research, structural stigma is proposed as a moderating
   variable that strengthens deleterious associations between perceived
   discrimination and social relationship functioning. Hypotheses were
   tested in two cross-sectional studies, including both online (N = 214;
   Study 1) and community (N = 94; Study 2) samples of sexual minority men
   and women residing throughout the United States. Structural stigma was
   coded from policy related to sexual minority rights within each state.
   Confirming hypotheses, support for the moderating role of structural
   stigma was found via multilevel models across studies. Specifically,
   associations between perceived discrimination and friendship strain,
   loneliness (Study 1) and familial strain (Study 2) were increased for
   those who resided in states with greater levels of structural stigma and
   attenuated for those who resided in states with lesser levels. In Study
   1, these results were robust to state-level covariates (conservatism and
   religiosity), but conservatism emerged as a significant moderator in
   lieu of structural stigma in Study 2. Results are discussed in the
   context of the shifting landscape of public policy related to sexual
   minority rights within the United States.}},

   generalizations of the concept of an infinitely differentiable manifold.
   It is known that in many (very important) mathematical models, the
   manifold structure breaks down. Therefore it is important to introduce a
   more general concept. In this paper, in particular, the behaviour of k
   (th) order tangent spaces, their dimensions, and other geometric
   properties, are described in the context of the process of gluing
   differential spaces. At the end some examples are given. The paper is
   self-consistent, i.e., a short review of the differential spaces theory

Abstract = {{Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) was applied to grow

   NVVs were several microns long, about 100 nm thick and possessed a

   oriented in < 110 > direction whereas the jacket was formed by amorphous
   silicon. Unlike other approaches, this method avoids contamination
   caused by metal heteroatom seeds and/or applying special procedures for
   substrate pretreatment to initialize/support NW growth. The
   photocatalytical activity revealed that SiNW layers could be accredited

Abstract = {{Recent studies have revealed that the receptor activator of nuclear
   factor-kappa B ligand/RANK/osteoprotegerin (RANKL/RANK/OPG) system has
   an important role in vascular calcification, which is contributory to
   various cardiovascular diseases and intimately linked to the regulation
   of blood pressure. Therefore, we performed a case-control study to
   investigate the associations of 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs) in the TNFSF11, TNFRSF11A and TNFRSF11B genes in the
   RANKL/RANK/OPG system with hypertension and blood pressure in
   post-menopausal Chinese women. In this study, 503 hypertensive patients
   and 509 normal controls were recruited. Genotyping was performed using
   the high-throughput Sequenom genotyping platform. The results showed
   that two SNPs (rs6567270 and rs4603673) in the TNFRSF11A were associated
   with hypertension (P = 0.010 and P = 0.013, respectively) and systolic
   blood pressure (P = 0.024 and P = 0.023, respectively). One SNP
   (rs9646629) in the TNFRSF11A showed significant association with
   diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.031). The results of this study suggest
   that TNFRSF11A but not TNFSF11 and TNFRSF11B genetic variation is
   associated with hypertension and blood pressure in Chinese women. The
   findings provide additional support for the genetic role of
   RANKL/RANK/OPG system in hypertension and blood pressure regulation.}},

Abstract = {{The existing high-quality environment matting methods usually require
   the capturing of a few thousand sample images and spend a few hours in
   data acquisition. In this paper, a novel environment matting algorithm
   is proposed to capture and extract the environment matte data
   effectively and efficiently. First, the recently developed compressive
   sensing theory is incorporated to reformulate the environment matting
   problem and simplify the data acquisition process. Next, taking into
   account the special properties of light refraction and reflection
   effects of transparent objects, two advanced priors, group clustering
   and Gaussian priors, as well as other basic constraints are introduced
   during the matte data recovery process to combat with the limited image
   samples, suppress the effects of the measurement noise resulted from
   data acquisition, and faithfully recover the sparse environment matte
   data. Compared with most of the existing environment matting methods,
   our algorithm significantly simplifies and accelerates the environment
   matting extraction process while still achieving high-accurate
   composition results.}},

Abstract = {{Global tobacco-related mortality dwarfs that of all other drugs.
   Nicotine is believed to be the primary agent responsible for tobacco use
   and addiction. However, nicotine is a relatively weak and inconsistent
   reinforcer in nonhumans and nicotine reinforcement has not been
   demonstrated in never-smokers.
   This study investigated the discriminative, subjective, and reinforcing
   effects of nicotine in never-smokers.
   Eighteen never-smokers (< 50 lifetime nicotine exposures) participated
   in a double-blind study. During a drug discrimination phase, volunteers
   ingested oral nicotine and placebo capsules (quasi-random order) at
   least 2 h apart and rated subjective effects repeatedly for 2 h after
   ingestion in daily sessions. Blocks of 10 sessions were continued until
   significant discrimination was achieved (p a parts per thousand currency
   signaEuro parts per thousand 0.05, binomial test; a parts per thousand
   yen8 of 10). Following discrimination, nicotine choice was tested by
   having volunteers choose which capsule set to ingest on each daily
   session. Successive blocks of 10 sessions were conducted until choice
   for nicotine or placebo met significance within each volunteer (a parts
   per thousand yen8 of 10 sessions).
   All 18 volunteers significantly discriminated nicotine from placebo; the
   lowest dose discriminated ranged from 1.0 to 4.0 mg/70 kg. Nine
   volunteers significantly chose nicotine (choosers) and nine
   significantly chose placebo (nicotine avoiders). The choosers reported
   predominately positive nicotine subjective effects (e.g.,
   alert/attentive, good effects, liking), while avoiders tended to report
   negative effects (e.g., dizzy, upset stomach, disliking). Both choosers
   and avoiders attributed their choice to the qualitative nature of drug
   effects.
   These results provide the first evidence that nicotine can function as a
   reinforcer in some never-smokers.}},

Title = {{A geometrical characterization of regions of uniqueness and applications
   to discrete tomography}},
Journal = {{INVERSE PROBLEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the reconstruction problem of discrete tomography, projections are
   considered from a finite set. of lattice directions. Employing a limited
   number of projections implies that the injectivity of the Radon
   transform is lost, and, in general, images consistent with a given set
   of projections form a huge class. In order to lower the number of
   allowed solutions, one usually tries to include in the problem some a
   priori information. This suggests that modelling the tomographic
   reconstruction problem as a linear system of equations is preferable. In
   this paper we propose to restrict the usual notion of uniqueness,
   related to the solutions of the linear system, and to provide, for each
   set., a geometrical characterization of the shape of a lattice subset,
   say region of uniqueness (ROU), forming a partial, fast reconstructible,
   solution. Any selected set. intrinsically determines its ROU inside an
   arbitrary lattice grid. For instance, trivially, if vertical bar S
   vertical bar = 1, the ROU is represented by two rectangles having sizes
   equal to the absolute values of the entries of the unique direction in.,
   and placed at two opposite corners of the chosen grid. Surprisingly, if
   vertical bar S vertical bar = 2, the problem becomes much more
   complicated. Our purpose is to provide a geometrical characterization of
   the ROU. This is based on a double Euclidean division algorithm (DEDA),
   which runs in polynomial time. It turns out that the ROU is delimited by
   a zigzag profile obtained by means of numerical relations among the
   entries of the employed directions. According to different inputs in
   DEDA, the shape of the ROU can change consistently, as it can be easily
   observed from the provided examples. Moreover, after selecting a region
   of interest (ROI) from a given phantom, we exploit DEDA to reconstruct
   the part of the ROI which falls in the ROU and, with a few further a
   priori knowledge, even parts of the ROI which are outside the ROU.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess the effect of breathing motion on
   the delivered dose in esophageal cancer 3-dimensional (3D)-conformal
   radiotherapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and
   volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). We assessed 16 patients with
   esophageal cancer. All patients underwent 40-computed tomography (4D-CT)
   for treatment planning. For each of the analyzed patients, 1 3D-CRT, 1
   IMRT, and 1 VMAT (RapidArc RA) plan were calculated. Each of the 3
   initial plans was recalculated on the 4D-CT (for the maximum free
   inspiration and maximum free expiration) to assess the effect of
   breathing motion. We assessed the minimum dose (D-min) and mean dose
   (D-mean) to the esophagus within the planning target volume, the volume
   changes of the lungs, the D-mean and the total lung volume receiving at
   least 40 Gy (V-40), and the V-30, V-20, V-10, and V-5. For the heart we
   assessed the Dmean and the V-25. Over all techniques and all patients
   the change in Dmean as compared with the planned Dmean (planning CT
   {[}PCT]) to the esophagus was 0.48\% in maximum free inspiration
   (CT\_insp) and 0.55\% in maximum free expiration (CT\_exp). The Dmin
   CT\_insp change was 0.86\% and CT\_exp change was 0.89\%. The Dmean
   change of the lungs (heart) was in CT\_insp 1.95\% (2.89\%) and 3.88\%
   (238\%) in CT\_exp. In all, 4 patients had a clinically relevant change
   of the dose ( >= 5\% Dmean to the heart and the lungs) between
   inspiration and expiration. These patients had a very cranially or
   caudally situated tumor. There are no relevant differences in the
   delivered dose to the regions of interest among the 3 techniques.
   Breathing motion management could be considered to achieve a better
   sparing of the lungs or heart in patients with cranially or caudally
   situated tumors. (C) 2015 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists.}},

Journal = {{PALLIATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{908-917}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Significant gaps in the evidence base on costs in rural
   communities in Canada and elsewhere are reported in the literature,
   particularly regarding costs to families. However, it remains unclear
   whether the costs related to all resources used by palliative care
   patients in rural areas differ to those resources used in urban areas.
   Aim: The study aimed to compare both the costs that occurred over
   6months of participation in a palliative care program and the sharing of
   these costs in rural areas compared with those in urban areas.
   Design: Data were drawn from two prior studies performed in Canada,
   employing a longitudinal, prospective design with repeated measures.
   Setting/participants: The urban sample consisted of 125 patients and 127
   informal caregivers. The rural sample consisted of 80 patients and 84
   informal caregivers. Most patients in both samples had advanced cancer.
   Results: The mean total cost per patient was CAD26,652 in urban areas,
   while it was CAD31,018 in rural areas. The family assumed 20.8\% and
   21.9\% of costs in the rural and urban areas, respectively. The rural
   families faced more costs related to prescription medication,
   out-of-pocket costs, and transportation while the urban families faced
   more costs related to formal home care.
   Conclusion: Despite the fact that rural and urban families assumed a
   similar portion of costs, the distribution of these costs was somewhat
   different. Future studies would be needed to gain a better understanding
   of the dynamics of costs incurred by families taking care of a loved one
   at the end of life and the determinants of these costs in urban versus
   rural areas.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: In patients with early arthritis naive to disease-modifying
   antirheumatic drugs, we evaluated the prevalence of initial and
   persistent lymphopenia, underlying diagnoses, and risk of infection or
   malignancy.
   Methods: Eight hundred and thirteen patients with early arthritis
   included in the ESPOIR cohort had a clinical examination, laboratory
   tests (viral serology, immunological tests, and cytokine profile), and
   radiographs. We determined the prevalence of lymphopenia at baseline and
   after 3 years, associated factors, diagnoses, and risk of infection or
   malignancy.
   Results: At baseline, 501813 (6.2\%) patients had lymphopenia.
   Lymphopenia was associated with positive rheumatoid factor (13=0.02),
   cytopenia (13 < 0.05), hepatitis C (13=0.05), higher C-reactive protein
   and DAS28 (13 < 0.05 for both). Cytokine profile and radiological
   progression were not significantly different between patients with and
   without lymphopenia. Suspected diagnoses at inclusion were rheumatoid
   arthritis (RA, n=27), unclassified arthritis (n=15), systemic lupus
   erythematosus (SLE, n=3), spondyloarthritis (n=2), Sjogren's syndrome
   (n=1), hematologic disease (n=1), and fibromyalgia (n=1). Fifteen
   patients out of 42 (35.7\%) with initial lymphopenia had persistent
   lymphopenia after 3 years, including 5 with documented causes (lupus,
   hepatitis C, undernutrition, azathioprine, and tamoxifen); none had
   PVB19, HIV, or HBV infection and none experienced infections, solid or
   hematologic malignancies during follow-up. Final diagnoses in these 15
   patients were RA (n=6), unclassified arthritis (n=6), SLE (n=1),
   spondyloarthritis (n=1), and fibromyalgia (n=1).
   Conclusions: Lymphopenia is rare in early arthritis. The most common
   rheumatic cause is RA, in which marked inflammation and other cytopenias
   are common. Lymphopenia in early arthritis is often shortlived, even
   when methotrexate is prescribed. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate whether superchilling in
   combination with skin packaging can be applied to improve the shelf life
   of filleted sea bream (Sparus aurata). First, the optimum superchilling
   temperature for filleted sea bream was determined through the drip loss
   analysis. Different storage techniques were then compared. Filleted fish
   was skin packed and stored under either superchilled conditions (-1C) or
   refrigerated conditions (+2C). These two technologies were also compared
   with the traditional preservation system of fish fillets stored on ice
   flakes. Superchilling storage resulted in improved sensory evaluation
   scores (fresh and cooked evaluation), decreased the values of
   trimethylamine, total volatile basic nitrogen and thiobarbituric acid
   reactive substances and delayed the growth of spoilage bacteria
   (Enterobacteriaceae, psychrophilic bacteria, mesophilic bacteria and
   sulfur-producing bacteria). Our findings suggest that superchilling in
   combination with skin packaging could be a good preservation technique
   for extending the shelf life of filleted sea bream.}},

Abstract = {{Background Fibromyalgia is characterized by a diffuse and predominantly
   axial and chronic pain, for which there is no explicit rationale for
   treatment options.
   Objective This qualitative study aims to understand the medication
   experience of patients with fibromyalgia and their relationship with the
   doctors derived from treatment negotiation.
   Design A qualitative approach was used, based on interviews with
   patients.
   Setting and participants Semi-structured interviews were held in a
   public hospital, with 35 patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia.
   Qualitative content analysis was performed.
   Results The first axis is centred on the unsuccessful quest for an
   effective treatment for pain and the feeling of dismissal of patients,
   who are in search of validation and recognition. The second part of the
   accounts explains the medication adjustments and the search for
   collaboration. Developing a model of partnership with the doctor enables
   the patients to shape their own illness, through the medication.
   Discussion It is by mediating their relationship with medication that
   patients gain access to this state of co-expertise and that they put
   sense into the collaboration they develop with their doctors. Through
   this collaboration, useful drugs are identified and adjusted to treat
   the pain.}},

Abstract = {{School teachers appear to have a greater prevalence of voice problems
   than the general population, yet classrooms are not designed with the
   safe use of teachers' voices in mind. In an effort to better understand
   the influence of classroom acoustic design on teachers' voice parameters
   measurements of teachers' voices in different classroom types have been
   made. An Ambulatory Phonation Monitor (APM) has been used to measure
   voice parameters (including the average voice sound pressure level,
   fundamental frequency and phonation time) directly from the skin
   vibrations in the neck, thus eliminating the effects of other noise
   sources in the environment. The rooms involved were acoustically
   benchmarked individually to enable relationships between the voice data
   and acoustic parameters, such as unoccupied ambient noise levels and
   reverberation times, to be investigated. The study data shows a positive
   correlation between unoccupied ambient noise levels and the average
   voice levels of the teachers, as well as between voice level and
   phonation time. There was no significant correlation in the study data
   between classroom reverberation times and voice levels or between voice

Abstract = {{The study tests the relationship between supervisors' transformational,
   transactional, and laissez-faire leadership and perceived bullying in
   the workplace. Transformational and transactional leaders can create
   conditions that make bullying at work less frequent but laissez-faire
   leadership may cause conflict that can result in bullying. The
   participants were 288 adults (122 women, 164 men; M age = 38.9 yr., SD =
   11.7; M tenure = 7.2 yr.) employed across several organizations. Of the
   participants, 53.2\% were contacted during an evening class in
   organizational behavior, and the others were workers from a
   waterproofing company. Scales measuring perceived leadership of a
   supervisor and perceived bullying at work were administered.
   Supervisor's transformational and transactional leadership were
   negatively related to work-related bullying, person-related bullying,
   and physically intimidating bullying. Transactional leadership was also
   negatively related to Work-related bullying, perceived Person-related
   bullying, and perceived Physically intimidating bullying. Supervisor's
   laissez-faire leadership was positively related to Work-related
   bullying, perceived Person-related bullying, and perceived Physically
   intimidating bullying. The use of Bass's model of transformational
   leadership in relation with the three-factor structure of the Negative
   Acts Questionnaire-Revised is unique in research on leadership and
   bullying. The relationship between laissez-faire leadership and
   leadership support results from previous studies: transactional or
   transformational leadership is likely to provide an environment that
   makes bullying more rare than under a negative or passive leadership.}},

   where the uptake of agriculture follows distinct trajectories in
   different biomes. We analyse the transition in terms of fitness benefits
   that foraging and agriculture bestow on the actors involved. We suggest
   that different substrates offer different fitness benefits with regard
   to the uptake of farming and that these benefits differed between the
   sexes, leading to differing ``optimal{''} strategies for males and

Abstract = {{Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is caused by a hemizygous contiguous gene
   microdeletion of 1.55-1.84 Mb at 7q11.23 region. Approximately, 28 genes
   have been shown to contribute to classical phenotype of SWB with
   presence of dysmorphic facial features, supravalvular aortic stenosis
   (SVAS), intellectual disability, and overfriendliness. With the use of
   Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization and other molecular
   cytogenetic techniques, is possible define with more accuracy partial or
   atypical deletion and refine the genotype-phenotype correlation. Here,
   we report on a rare genomic structural rearrangement in a boy with
   atypical deletion in 7q11.23 and XYY syndrome with characteristic
   clinical signs, but not sufficient for the diagnosis of WBS. Cytogenetic
   analysis of G-banding showed a karyotype 47, XYY. Analysis of DNA with
   the technique of MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification)
   using kits a combination of kits (P064, P036, P070, and P029) identified
   an atypical deletion on 7q11.23. In addition, high resolution SNP
   Oligonucleotide Microarray Analysis (SNP-array) confirmed the
   alterations found by MLPA and revealed others pathogenic CNVs, in the
   chromosomes 7 and X. The present report demonstrates an association not
   yet described in literature, between Williams-Beuren syndrome and 47,
   XYY. The identification of atypical deletion in 7q11.23 concomitant to
   additional pathogenic CNVs in others genomic regions allows a better
   comprehension of clinical consequences of atypical genomic
   rearrangements. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Arrhythmic SNPs and Risk of Cardiac Arrest in HCM
   IntroductionThe accurate prediction of the risk of sudden cardiac death
   (SCD) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) remains elusive. Corrected QT
   interval (QTc) duration is a known risk factor in various cardiac
   conditions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been linked to
   QTc length, and to SCD. Here we investigated the role of 21 candidate
   SNPs in QTc duration and SCD events in patients with HCM.
   Methods and ResultsThis HCM registry-based study included patients with
   an ECG, medical history, first SCD event data, and DNA available. Each
   individual SNP was assessed using logistic regression for associations
   with 2 outcomes: a prolonged QTc ( 440 milliseconds), and first SCD
   event (SCD, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and appropriate implantable
   cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) shock for ventricular
   fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT). In 272 HCM patients, there
   were 31 SCD events (8 SCD, 9 resuscitated cardiac arrest, 14 ICD shocks
   for VF/VT; 11\%). A QTc 500 milliseconds was associated with SCD events

Abstract = {{Background. Although the increasing number of recommended immunizations
   is essential for patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus
   (HIV), the potentially uncompensated costs of expanded immunizations
   will present significant challenges for clinics and health systems
   serving HIV-infected patients.
   Methods. We estimated costs of providing Gardasil, Prevnar, and Zostavax
   to eligible patients at a US Ryan White Part C academically affiliated
   HIV clinic in 2013. Clinic expenditures were calculated using vaccine
   price and administrative fees. Revenue was calculated using insurance
   reimbursement data for vaccination and administration. Three scenarios
   were used: 100\% uptake of vaccines, adjusted uptake based on published
   rates, and adjusted reimbursement according to pre-Affordable Care Act
   (ACA) insurance status.
   Results. 2887 patients (27\% Medicare, 13\% Alabama Medicaid, 26\%
   Commercial, 34\% Uninsured), received care with wide variation in
   immunization reimbursement (\$0 to \$210) by insurance and vaccine. The
   net yield (revenue minus expenditure) was calculated for each vaccine.
   Prevnar was most costly: annual net yield of -\$60 691. Provision of all
   3 vaccines would lead to a net yield of -\$97 122. Adjusting for reduced
   uptake led to annual clinic losses of \$44 119. Using pre-ACA
   reimbursement for immunization of the uninsured led to reduced clinic
   losses (-\$62 326), attributable to reimbursement via Ryan White funds.
   Conclusions. A cost analysis of 3 vaccines shows great variation in
   insurance coverage, with potential losses of almost \$100 000 for one
   HIV clinic if eligible patients received vaccinations in one calendar
   year. Adequate, cost neutral reimbursement should be instituted if
   medical providers and health systems are to achieve Advisory Committee
   on Immunization Practices immunization recommendations for both HIV
   positive and negative adults.}},

Abstract = {{The Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale - Parent Version
   (RCADS-P) is a widely used parent-report measure, initially developed to
   assess anxiety and depression in youth in grades 3-12 from school-based
   and clinic-referred settings. It is important however to be able to
   assess these problems in even younger children due to the need for
   earlier understanding, identification, intervention and prevention
   efforts of anxiety and depression in younger children, and continual
   monitoring of these problems across the youth life span. For the present
   study, we used a sample of 307 children and adolescents ages 3.0 to 17.5
   years old (M = 8.68, SE = 4.10). For the first set of analyses, we
   divided the sample into Younger youth (kindergarten to grade 2; n = 152)
   and Older youth (grade 3 to 12; n = 155) to see whether each group
   independently met benchmarks for acceptable reliability and validity.
   Given the number of children who also develop anxiety and depression
   following early-life adversities and adverse care (such as caregiver
   neglect), we also divided our sample differently into a
   Post-Institutionalized group (i.e., previously institutionalized youth;
   n = 100) and a Comparison group (i.e., youth without histories of
   early-life caregiver neglect; n = 195) to examine whether each of these
   groups also met benchmarks for acceptable reliability and validity.
   Specifically, in each of these grade and experience groups, we examined
   the factor structure (including measurement invariance), internal
   consistency and convergent and discriminant validity of the RCADS-P
   anxiety and depression scales scores. Results demonstrated that younger
   youth RCADS-P reports were associated with acceptable reliability and
   validity estimates. Similar support for the RCADS-P scores was found for
   the Post-Institutionalized youth. The present study therefore extends
   needed support for the use of the RCADS-P to assess and monitor these
   two new and important youth groups.}},

Title = {{Network Coding-Aware Compressive Data Gathering for Energy-Efficient
   Wireless Sensor Networks}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article investigates the joint application of compressive sensing
   (CS) and network coding (NC) to the problem of energy-efficient data
   gathering in wireless sensor networks. We consider the problem of
   optimally constructing forwarding trees to carry compressed data to
   projection nodes. Each compressed dataset refers to a weighted
   aggregation (or sum) of sensed measurements from network sensors
   collected at one projection node. Projection nodes then forward their
   received compressed data to the sink, which subsequently recovers the
   original measurements. This aggregation technique, based on CS, is shown
   to reduce significantly the number of transmissions in the network. We
   observe that the presence of multiple forwarding trees gives rise to
   many-to-many communication patterns in sensor networks that, in turn,
   can be exploited to perform NC on the compressed data being forwarded on
   these trees. Such a technique will further reduce the number of
   transmissions required to gather the measurements, resulting in a better
   network-wide energy efficiency. This article addresses the problem of
   NC-aware construction of forwarding/aggregation trees. We present a
   mathematical model to optimally construct such forwarding trees, which
   encourage NC operations on the compressed data. Owing to its complexity,
   we further develop algorithmic methods (both centralized and
   distributed) for solving the problem and analyze their complexities. We
   show that our algorithmic methods are scalable and accurate, with
   worst-case optimality gap not exceeding 3.96\% in the studied scenarios.
   We also show that, when bothNC and compressive data gathering are
   considered jointly, performance gains (reduction in number of
   transmissions) of up to 30\% may be attained. Finally, we show that the
   proposed methods distribute the workload of data gathering throughout
   the network nodes uniformly, resulting in extended network life times.}},

Abstract = {{In proliferative retinopathies, like proliferative diabetic retinopathy
   and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the hypoxia response is sustained
   by the failure of the retina to revascularise its ischaemic areas.
   Non-resolving retina ischaemia/hypoxia results in upregulation of
   pro-angiogenic factors and pathologic neovascularisation with ectopic,
   fragile neovessels. Promoting revascularisation of the retinal avascular
   area could interfere with this vicious cycle and lead to vessel
   normalisation. Here, we examined the function of endothelial junctional
   adhesion molecule-C (JAM-C) in the context of ROP. Endothelial-specific
   JAM-C-deficient (EC-JAM-C KO) mice and littermate JAM-C-proficient
   (EC-JAM-C WT) mice were subjected to the ROP model. An increase in total
   retinal vascularisation was found at p17 owing to endothelial JAM-C
   deficiency, which was the result of enhanced revascularisation and
   vessel normalisation, thereby leading to significantly reduced avascular
   area in EC-JAM-C KO mice. In contrast, pathologic neovessel formation
   was not affected by endothelial JAM-C deficiency. Consistent with
   improved vessel normalisation, tip cell formation at the interface
   between vascular and avascular area was higher in EC-JAM-C KO mice, as
   compared to their littermate controls. Consistently, JAM-C inactivation
   in endothelial cells resulted in increased spreading on fibronectin and
   enhanced sprouting in vitro in a manner dependent on beta 1-integrin and
   on the activation of the small GTPase RAP1. Together, endothelial
   deletion of JAM-C promoted endothelial cell sprouting, and consequently
   vessel normalisation and revascularisation of the hypoxic retina without
   altering pathologic neovascularisation. Thus, targeting endothelial
   JAM-C may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for promoting
   revascularisation and vessel normalisation in the treatment of
   proliferative retinopathies.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Cohesion is described as the force between particles of the
   same substance that acts to unite them. Contrary to rheology, there are
   currently no ready-made instruments designed to measure cohesion, or
   methods which could be easily adapted to gels. To study and compare the
   possible clinical effects from the cohesive properties of a gel, it is
   necessary to standardize the definition and measurement of cohesion.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate methods
   for measuring cohesion.
   METHODS AND MATERIALS Three different methods were evaluated and
   compared with measures of perceived cohesion; compression force,
   dispersion in water and drop weight. Two different families of fillers
   (Emervel and Restylane) were used for evaluating the different methods.
   RESULTS The compression force did not reflect the measures of perceived
   cohesion. The dispersion method showed variable results over time, had
   some practical issues, and is evaluated by subjective assessment. The
   best correlation to the perceived cohesion was found with the drop
   weight method.
   CONCLUSION The drop weight method which closely resembles the definition
   of cohesion (IUPAC) was considered to be the best method for measuring
   cohesion.}},

Abstract = {{The principles of noise-resistant coding are widely used for
   transmitting the information and synthesis of reliable management
   systems. Quite often, the sum codes are used for the purposes specified.
   Sum codes are systematic codes that allow to detect some error rate in
   data vectors. Sum codes have simple rules of formation and relatively
   low redundancy that determines the priority in its selection, in
   comparison with error correction codes.
   Thus, using of the sum codes in systems of technical diagnostics results
   in a small hardware redundancy for providing the error detection
   characteristics.
   Classic sum codes or Berger codes do not detect 100\% of
   multidirectional errors with even multiplicity containing \{0 -> 1, 1 ->
   0\} distortion groups (100\% of so-called symmetric errors). However,
   Berger codes detect 100\% of monotonous distortions in data vectors that
   is used to transfer the information and to build the discrete devices
   with a 100\% detection of single faults.
   Analysis of the characteristics of Berger codes shows, that they often
   use the check bits inefficiently. For example, all possible check
   vectors are formed for Berger code only in special cases when data
   vector length is m = 2(t) -1 (t is an element of\{1,2, ... \}). In all
   other cases, a number of check vectors does not used at all. There is a
   problem of providing the modified Berger code which has all the
   characteristics of the classic Berger code. The article presents the
   algorithms for formation of modified Berger codes which detect almost
   twice as many symmetrical errors in data vectors, as classic Berger
   codes. The article also covers the conditions under which there is no
   need to increase the number of check bits in the code. It also
   highlights the schematics particularities of synthesis of generators
   (encoders) of new codes. The experiment with making use of a set of test
   cases LGSynth'89 confirmed theoretical results.
   Note that the modified Berger code is promising in solving the problems
   of technical diagnostics.}},

Abstract = {{Reliability is one of the most challenging problems in the context of
   three-dimensional network-on-chip (3D NoC) systems. Reliability analysis
   is prominent for early stages of the manufacturing process in order to
   prevent costly redesigns of a target system. This article classifies the
   potential physical faults of a baseline TSV-based 3D NoC architecture by
   targeting two-dimensional (2D) NoC components and their inter-die
   connections. In this paper, through-silicon via (TSV) issues, thermal
   concerns, and single event effect (SEE) are investigated and
   categorized, in order to propose evaluation metrics for inspecting the
   resiliency of 3D NoC designs. A reliability analysis for major source of
   faults is reported in this article separately based on their mean time
   to failure (MTTF). TSV failure probability induced by inductive and
   capacitive coupling is also discussed. Finally, the paper provides a
   formal reliability analysis on the aggregated faults that affect TSV.
   This formal analysis is critical for estimating the resiliency of
   different components in order to mitigate the redundancy cost of
   fault-tolerant design or to examine the efficiency of any proposed
   fault-tolerant methods for 3D NoC architectures.}},

Abstract = {{Patient education is recommended in the German S3-guideline released in
   2012 by the AWMF as a basic component of the treatment for fibromyalgia
   syndrome. Accordingly, we have reviewed previous patient education
   approaches published in both the national and international literature.
   Moreover, to identify participants' needs from the patients'
   perspective, a qualitative assessment was carried out using focus
   groups. Building on this work, we refined an existing standardized
   education program, which already was based on a curricular structure.
   The statements regarding diagnosis and treatment incorporated in the new
   program were made in close accordance with the S3-guideline mentioned
   above, while its didactic conception and design comply with the quality
   criteria and recommendations as issued by the Center for Patient
   Education, Wuerzburg. The overarching goal of the new education program
   is to enhance patients' self-management of their condition. The
   program's focus is not only on valid disease-specific information
   delivered by interactive and patient-oriented methods, but also on
   lifestyle changes and practical action planning. The evaluation of

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL ON ADDICTIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: To determine if the clinical course of DSM-5
   alcohol use disorders (AUD) in select populations of young adults (18-30
   years) differed based on gender, diagnostic severity (mild, moderate,
   severe), and ethnicity.
   Methods: Native Americans (NA) and Mexican Americans (MA) (n = 1,129)
   were recruited from the community and completed a structured diagnostic
   interview. Participants with DSM-5 AUDs were compared based on gender,
   severity of the disorder (mild, moderate, severe), and ethnicity for
   differences in drinking levels, as well as the clinical course of AUD as
   defined by the occurrence and sequence of 36 alcohol-related life
   events.
   Results: Seventy percent of the NA men, 64\% of the NA women, 56\% of
   the MA men, and 42\% of the MA women met lifetime diagnostic criteria
   for a DSM-5 AUD. NA reported more alcohol-related life events and at an
   earlier age than MA. A high degree of similarity in the clinical course
   was found between men and women and between those with severe or
   moderate disorder, but not with those with mild disorder.
   Conclusions: NA had higher drinking levels and more alcohol problems at
   an earlier age than MA. A similar clinical course was seen based on
   gender and ethnicity in these young adults, but not based on diagnostic
   severity.
   Scientific Significance: The DSM-5 mild AUD category differs from the
   moderate and severe categories on drinking history, clinical course,
   gender, and ethnic distribution. Mild AUD may not be in the same
   clinical continuum as moderate and severe AUD in these populations.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility and utility of intraoperative
   optical coherence tomography (OCT) during pars plana vitrectomy surgery
   for dense vitreous hemorrhage.
   Methods: The Prospective Assessment of Intraoperative and Perioperative
   OCT for Ophthalmic Surgery study examined the utility of intraoperative
   OCT in ophthalmic surgery. Intraoperative scanning was performed with a
   microscope-mounted spectral domain OCT system. This report is a case
   series of those eyes undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for dense central
   vitreous hemorrhage that precluded preoperative OCT assessment.
   Intraoperative OCT images were qualitatively evaluated for retinal
   abnormalities that might impact intraoperative or perioperative
   management. Clinical variables were collected and assessed. Surgeon
   assessment of intraoperative OCT utility was also evaluated.
   Results: Twenty-three eyes were identified and included. The etiology
   for the vitreous hemorrhage was proliferative diabetic retinopathy (19
   eyes, 82.6\%), horseshoe retinal tear (1 eye, 4.3\%), retinal vein
   occlusion with neovascularization (1 eye, 4.3\%), presumed polypoid
   choroidal vasculopathy (1 eye, 4.3\%), and presumed retinal arterial
   macro-aneurysm (1 eye, 4.3\%). Intraoperative OCT revealed epiretinal
   membrane (14 eyes, 60.9\%), macular edema (14 eyes, 60.9\%), posterior
   hyaloid traction (1 eye, 4.3\%), and retinal detachment (1 eye, 4.3\%).
   Surgeon feedback suggested that intraoperative OCT impacted surgical
   decision making in eyes where membrane peeling was performed.
   Conclusion: Intraoperative OCT during pars plana vitrectomy for vitreous
   hemorrhage may provide physicians with clinically relevant information
   that may impact surgical management, perioperative management, and
   patient outcomes.}},

Title = {{Baseline corticosterone levels are higher in migrating than sedentary
   common blackbirds in autumn, but not in spring}},
Journal = {{GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{224}},
Pages = {{121-125}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Corticosterone at baseline levels is thought to be mainly involved in
   the regulation of uptake, storage and release of energy, processes
   central to avian migration. Consequently, corticosterone levels are
   thought to be upregulated during migration, but the temporal pattern of
   its secretion during migration is not well defined. For example,
   although it appears that corticosterone levels decrease from flight to
   stopover, it is unknown if levels at stopover are still elevated and it
   is largely unclear how these levels compare to non-migratory
   life-history stages. Furthermore, what role corticosterone plays in
   crucial migratory processes, such as refueling and departure from
   stopover, is far from understood. We here determined baseline
   corticosterone levels in migrating and resident common blackbirds
   (Turdus merula), sampled simultaneously on Helgoland, a stopover site
   that also supports a sedentary breeding population. In autumn, migrants
   had higher corticosterone levels than residents, but in spring levels
   did not differ between the two groups. Corticosterone levels of migrants
   were very similar in spring and autumn, whereas in residents levels
   tended to be higher in spring than autumn. Higher levels in residents in
   spring than autumn most likely reflect the higher daily workload faced
   by birds during the pre-breeding than the post-breeding period. Our
   study thus indicates that, relative to the levels observed in residents
   in autumn, in spring baseline corticosterone levels were moderately
   elevated in both migrants and residents and that in autumn levels were
   moderately elevated in migrants only. Currently, corticosterone's main
   function at stopover is thought to lie in the regulation of departure.
   Because most migrant blackbirds stay only one or two days on Helgoland,
   our results are in line with this idea and suggest that migrating
   blackbirds up-regulated their corticosterone level in anticipation of an
   oncoming flight bout. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms by which drugs induce pancreatitis are unknown. A
   definite cause of pancreatitis is due to the antiepileptic drug valproic
   acid (VPA). On the basis of three crucial observations-that VPA inhibits
   histone deacetylases (HDACs), HDACs mediate pancreas development, and
   aspects of pancreas development are recapitulated during recovery of the
   pancreas after injury-we hypothesized that VPA does not cause injury on
   its own, but it predisposes patients to pancreatitis by inhibiting HDACs
   and provoking an imbalance in pancreatic recovery. In an experimental
   model of pancreatic injury, we found that VPA delayed recovery of the
   pancreas and reduced acinar cell proliferation. In addition, pancreatic
   expression of class I HDACs (which are the primary VPA targets)
   increased in the midphase of pancreatic recovery. VPA administration
   inhibited pancreatic H DAC activity and led to the persistence of
   acinar-to-ductal metaplastic complexes, with prolonged Sox9 expression
   and sustained beta-catenin nuclear activation, findings that
   characterize a delay in regenerative reprogramming. These effects were
   not observed with valpromide, an analog of VPA that Lacks HDAC
   inhibition. This is the first report, to our knowledge, that VPA shifts
   the balance toward pancreatic injury and pancreatitis through H DAC
   inhibition. The work also identifies a new paradigm for therapies that
   could exploit epigenetic reprogramming to enhance pancreatic recovery
   and disorders of pancreatic injury.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses conversation analysis (CA) to examine client resistance
   in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) sessions for clients with
   depression. Analysis focuses on clients' responses to therapists'
   proposals for behavioural change. Typically, clients displayed active
   resistance to such proposals by drawing on one of three types of
   `inability to comply' account: (1) appeals to restrictive situational
   factors; (2) appeals to fixed physical states; (3) assertions of
   previous effort to do what the therapist was proposing. Each type of
   account involved clients utilising knowledge from personal experience as
   their reason for resisting the proposal. In formulating their accounts,
   clients' turns were designed in ways that displayed their epistemic
   stance in relation to the situation under discussion. By indexing their
   superior epistemic authority in the domain of their experience, clients
   were able to invoke their ultimate right to reject the therapist's
   proposed course of action. The implications for CBT practice are
   discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Particle swarm optimization is an optimization method based on a
   simulated social behavior displayed by artificial particles in a swarm,
   inspired from bird flocks and fish schools. An underlying component that
   influences the exchange of information between particles in a swarm, is
   its topological structure. Therefore, this property has a great
   influence on the comportment of the optimization method. In this study,
   we propose DCluster: a dynamic topology, based on a combination of two
   well-known topologies viz. Four-cluster and Fitness. The proposed
   topology is analyzed, and compared to six other topologies used in the
   standard PSO algorithm using a set of benchmark test functions and
   several well-known constrained and unconstrained engineering design
   problems. Our comparisons demonstrate that DCluster outperforms the
   other tested topologies and leads to satisfactory performance while
   avoiding the problem of premature convergence.}},

Abstract = {{This study reported a new counting of chromosomes number and karyotypes
   of ten introduced accessions of V. articulata. This forage species,
   native of the Mediterranean area, is widespread in south Europe, West
   Asia and Australia. Results showed that all accessions are diploid with
   a somatic chromosome numbers equal to 14. Furthermore, four karyotypic
   formulas were found among the studied accessions: 2sm+1m(s)+4st for
   accessions Va-38; Va-2 and Va-4; 1m+1m(s)+1sm+4st for accessions Va-57
   and Va-91; 1m+1m(s)+1sm+2st+2t for accessions Va-75 and Va-66 and
   2m+1m(s)+4st for accessions Va-85, Va-67 and Va-103. There was a
   predominance of subtelocentric pairs compared to metacentric and
   submetacentric pairs. Karyomorphological parameters based on Rec index
   (ratio between the length of each chromosome and the length of the
   longest one), SYi index (ratio between the average length of the short
   arms and the average length of the long arms) and TF\% (ratio between
   the sum of the lengths of the short arms of individual chromosome and
   the total length of the complement) have been determined. They evidenced
   that the karyotype of accession Va-2 was the most asymmetric one having
   the lowest value of SYi index (27.95). Cluster analysis using thirteen
   karyological parameters has been carried out. The corresponding
   dendrogram based on Euclidian distance showed two main groups of
   accessions. Accession Va-2 is the farthest one and had the most
   karyotype in evolutionary trend.}},

Abstract = {{Clinicopathological features of 25 nodular lymphocyte predominant
   Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) patients in Japan were analysed. To investigate
   the clinicopathological significance of tissue associated macrophages
   (TAM) in NLPHL, CD68 and CD163 expression were investigated. The median
   age at onset was 56 years (range: 6-82 years) with male predominance
   (64\%). All patients presented with lymph node enlargement with
   predilection for cervical LNs. Seven cases (28\%) had mediastinal lesion
   and four (16\%) had extranodal involvement. Most cases (76\%) presented
   with early clinical stages. After median follow up of 44 months, both of
   overall and progression free survival rates were 95\%. The presence of
   >5\% CD68+ TAM in NLPHL was significantly associated with older age at
   diagnosis (median, 71 vs 52.5 years; P=0.048), lower hemoglobin level
   (33.3\% vs 0\%; P=0.037) and lower CR rate after initial treatment
   (42.9\% vs 91.7\%; P=0.038). The presence of >5\% CD163+ TAM was
   significantly correlated with presence of B symptoms (40\% vs 0\%;
   P=0.036). In conclusion, NLPHL is rare among Japanese and appears to
   present at an older age than among Western patients. In our series, the
   presence of >5\% CD68+ TAM in NLPHL was associated with lower CR rate,
   but with no impact on patients' survival.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental and analytical study on the punching strengthening of
   reinforced concrete two-way slabs using external steel plates is
   presented. Five reinforced concrete square slabs of 100 mm thickness
   were tested over simply supported four sides of 1000 mm span under
   central square patch load of 100 mm size up to failure. One control slab
   was tested without strengthening; however, four tested slabs were
   strengthened using four configurations of square steel plates provided
   with steel anchor shear studs. Such configurations considered two
   different plate thickness, two plate side dimensions and different
   arrangement and diameter of shear studs. The strengthened four slabs
   showed improved stiffness and punching shear capacity. The magnitude of
   improvement depended on the plate dimensions and the studs diameter and
   arrangement. An analytical approach was proposed for predicting the
   punching shear strength increase due to using the strengthening steel
   plate. The proposed approach was applied to the tested specimens with
   the use of the punching shear strength equations adopted by several
   codes of practice and proved to be in good agreement with the test
   results. Generally, this research presented a practical strengthening
   concept that can be used to increase the punching shear capacity of
   two-way slabs. (C) 2015 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University.

Title = {{Oncologic and Functional Outcomes of Surgical and Nonsurgical Treatment
   of Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Supraglottic Larynx}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Nonsurgical treatment of advanced supraglottic laryngeal
   cancer is widely used as part of a larynx preservation protocol.
   However, recent studies have suggested that nonsurgical treatment may be
   associated with inferior survival. Furthermore, it is not clear whether
   preservation of the larynx provides superior voice or swallowing
   function in the long term.
   OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that surgical treatment of
   advanced-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the supraglottic larynx is
   associated with superior overall survival (OS), freedom from recurrence
   (FFR), and noninferior voice and swallowing function.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective medical record review of
   patients treated for stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the
   supraglottic larynx between January 1990 and June 2013 at a tertiary
   referral center: 97 patients underwent surgical treatment and 138,
   nonsurgical treatment. Exclusion criteria included prior definitive
   treatment for laryngeal cancer or evidence of distant metastatic disease
   at presentation. The median follow-up for all 235 patients was 63
   months.
   INTERVENTIONS Surgical or nonsurgical therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND
   MEASURES Freedom from recurrence (FFR), OS, larynx preservation, voice
   graded from 1 to 5, and swallowing graded from 1 to 6 using our voice
   and swallowing function scales.
   RESULTS Surgical treatment was associated with superior FFR (5-year FFR:
   75\% vs 55\%; P = .006) but not OS (5-year OS: 52\% vs 52\%; P = .61).
   The larynx was preserved in 83\% of patients in the nonsurgical group vs
   42\% of patients in the surgical group (P < .001). Voice function was
   superior in the nonsurgical group at all time points through 5 years
   after treatment (mean voice score, 3.8 vs 2.6; P < .001). Swallowing
   function was comparable between surgical and nonsurgical groups.
   Multivariable analysis revealed that advanced age (hazard ratio {[}HR],
   1.43 per 10-year increment; 95\% CI, 1.19-1.72) and clinical N stage
   (HR, 1.17 per 1-level increment; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.30) were associated
   with worse OS, while treatment with chemotherapy was associated with
   superior OS (HR, 0.61; 95\% CI, 0.41-0.92).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Compared with surgical treatment, nonsurgical
   treatment as part of a larynx preservation protocol is associated with a
   higher likelihood of recurrence but has similar OS and should continue
   to be viewed as a viable alternative for the treatment of advanced
   supraglottic laryngeal cancer.}},

   Welch's and Yule-Walker's methods in agreement that the second

   spectral estimation methods showed a clear separation in the frequency
   domain between measurements before and after simulated heat-stress

Abstract = {{Objective: There is limited information regarding new ulceration
   following the healing of ischaemic foot ulcers in diabetic patients. Our
   aim is to study new ulcerations in the same foot as the previous
   ulcer(s) in patients with diabetes and severe peripheral artery disease
   (PAD).
   Method: Patients with diabetes and severe PAD who healed from previous
   ulcer(s) (Wagner grade 1-5, at or below the ankle), were recruited for
   the prospective study from the time of healing of their ulcer. Patients
   were followed up regarding new ulceration, and their treatments and
   ulcer status noted either directly or on examination of medical records.
   Results: We analysed the data on 602 patients with diabetes and severe
   PAD with healed foot ulcers, either primarily (n=443, 74\%) or after
   minor amputation (n=159, 26\%). Of these 51\% (n=305) had
   revascularisation before healing from the previous ulcer, 34\% (n=202)
   developed a new ulcer on the same foot within 15 months (range 0-106).
   Amputation was required by 22\% (n=45) of patients, with a new ulcer on
   the same foot. The median survival time of all patients (n=602) was 54
   months. By regression analysis, a low maximal Wagner grade for the
   previous ulcer and reconstructive vascular surgery was related to a
   decreased risk of developing new ulcers in the same foot.
   Conclusion: Patients with diabetes and ischaemic foot ulcers have a
   high-risk for developing new ulcers and amputation in the same foot
   after healing. The extent of tissue involvement in the previous ulcer
   and reconstructive vascular surgery affected the risk for development of
   new ulcers.}},

Abstract = {{Plasma homocysteine (tHcy) is associated with kidney disease. However,
   few, if any, studies have examined homocysteine in relation to arterial
   stiffness, with stratification by the presence or absence of early-stage
   chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to examine
   prospective associations between tHcy and carotid-femoral pulse wave
   velocity (PWV) in persons with and without early-stage CKD in a sample
   of community-living individuals free from end-stage renal disease,
   dialysis, stroke and dementia. We conducted a prospective study with 498
   participants of the Maine-Syracuse Longitudinal Study (mean age 61
   years). Levels of tHcy were positively related to PWV measured 4-5 years
   later for participants with early-stage CKD (estimated glomerular
   filtration rate < 60 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2)). Statistical adjustment
   was made for multiple confounders, including demographic factors,
   PWV-related variables and cardiovascular risk factors (b = 4.27, 95\%
   confidence interval: 0.23-8.31, P = 0.04). These associations were not
   observed in persons free from CKD. Plasma tHcy is an important predictor
   of arterial stiffness, as indexed by PWV, in community-living
   individuals with modest CKD.}},

Abstract = {{IntroductionAccording to neurohormonal theory, prenatal androgens are
   key determinants of sexual orientation. As a reputed marker for prenatal
   androgens, the 2D:4D finger length ratio has been used in more than a
   dozen studies to test the hypothesis that prenatal androgens influence
   sexual orientation. Findings have been very inconsistent.
   AimThe present study sought to retest the hypothesis that 2D:4D and
   sexual orientation are related is a manner consistent with neurohormonal
   theory.
   MethodsA 2D:4D measure (of the right hand) along with four additional
   somatic markers of androgen exposure (height, physical strength,
   muscularity, and athletic ability) with samples of college students in
   Malaysia (N=2,058) and the United States (N=2,511). The five androgen
   measures were factor analyzed, resulting in a two-factor solution:
   Factor 1 consisted of strength, muscularity, and athletic ability (the
   muscular coordination factor), and Factor 2 was comprised of the r2D:4D
   and adult height (the bone growth factor).
   Main Outcome MeasuresSexual orientation was measured by asking each
   respondent the extent to which they were sexually attracted to males and
   the extent to which they were sexually attracted to females, both on
   11-point scales.
   ResultsWhen the countries and sexes were analyzed separately, neither
   the r2D:4D measure nor Factor 2 correlated with sexual orientation to
   significant degrees. Instead, it was the muscular coordination factor
   that correlated the best. Support was found for the hypothesis that
   prenatal androgens influence sexual orientation, but the nature of these
   influences was more complex than neurohormonal theory predicted.
   ConclusionA modified theory is needed and presented to accommodate the
   results from this study. Ellis L, Lykins A, Hoskin AW, and Ratnasingam

Abstract = {{In spite of the high social significance, the professional language
   personality of a future engineer has not yet been an object of a

   language personality of a future engineer will be to turn to an
   interdisciplinary approach: to the correlation of linguistics with
   psycho- and sociolinguistics. The results of this analysis will make it
   possible to describe the professional language personality of the future
   engineer most precisely and completely. The comprehensive description

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{281}},
Pages = {{345-359}},

Abstract = {{A new hybrid material was prepared using chitosan, glycidyl methacrylate
   and magnetite microparticles. The concentration of amine groups on the
   sorbent was increased by grafting diethylenetriamine. These materials
   were tested for the sorption of Hg(II) metal ions. These materials
   showed high affinity and selectivity for Hg(II) uptake from aqueous
   solutions: maximum sorption capacity reached 2.6 mmol g(-1) at pH 4.0.
   The influence of pH was tested on the selective separation of Hg(II)
   from a mixture of Hg(II), Co(II), Cu(II), Fe(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) and
   Mg(II). The effect of counter anions was also studied at different pH
   values. Sorption may occur by chelation of cationic mercury species on
   amino groups or by ion exchange of chloroanionic mercury species on
   protonated amino groups. Uptake kinetics and sorption isotherms were
   modeled using the pseudo-second order rate equation and the Langmuir
   equation, respectively. The distribution coefficient was obtained at
   different temperatures and the thermodynamic parameters have been
   calculated: the sorption is endothermic, spontaneous and contributes to
   increase the entropy of the system. Potassium iodide was used for Hg(II)
   desorption from loaded sorbents: desorption yields 99\%, and the sorbent
   could be efficiently recycled for a minimum of three sorption/desorption
   cycles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We provide a mini-history of the craft beer segment of the U.S. brewing

   other pioneers involved in the promotion and marketing of craft beer who

   lager beer produced by the macrobrewers in the United States, the output
   of the craft segment more closely resembles the product differentiation
   and fragmentation in the wine industry. We develop a database that
   tracks the rise of craft brewing using various statistical measures of
   output, number of producers, concentration within the segment, and
   compares output with that of the macro and import segment of the
   industry. Integrating our database into Geographic Information Systems
   software enables us to map the spread of the craft beer segment from its
   taproot in San Francisco across the United States. Finally, we use
   regression analysis to explore variables influencing the entrants and
   craft beer production at the state level from 1980 to 2012. We use Tobit
   estimation for production and negative binomial estimation for the
   number of brewers. We also analyze whether strategic effects (e.g.,
   locating near competing beer producers) explain the location choices of
   craft beer producers.}},

Abstract = {{Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used in
   clinical medicine. Their utility is, however, often limited by the
   adverse effects they produce in the gastrointestinal tract. Oxidative
   stress has been shown to occur in the small intestine in response to the
   oral administration of indomethacin. In view of this, the effect of
   thyme, an agent with anti-oxidant properties, was evaluated on
   indomethacin-induced small intestinal damage in a rat model. The major
   components of thyme essential oils were determined by gas chromatography
   mass spectrometry. Tissues morphology affected by indomethacin, with and
   without treatment with thyme, was measured. The small intestine
   morphology (villus height, villus width, crypt depth and crypt width of
   duodenum, jejunum and ilea) from indomethacin-treated animals with thyme
   was significantly improved than those from indomethacin. animals.
   Treatment with thyme was found to ameliorate these drug-induced changes.
   Thus, thyme appears to hold promise as an agent that can potentially
   reduce non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induced small intestinal
   damage.}},

Abstract = {{Most vertebrate fossils are rare and difficult to find and although
   paleontologists and paleoanthropologists use geological maps to identify
   potential fossil-bearing deposits, the process of locating fossiliferous
   localities often involves a great deal of luck. One way to reduce the
   role of serendipity is to develop predictive models that increase the
   likelihood of locating fossils by identifying combinations of
   geological, geospatial, and spectral features that are common to
   productive localities. We applied GEographic Object-Based Image Analysis
   (GEOBIA) of high resolution QuickBird and medium resolution images from
   the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) along with GIS data such as
   slope and surface geology layers to identify potentially productive
   Eocene vertebrate fossil localities in the Great Divide Basin, Wyoming.
   The spectral and spatial characteristics of the image objects that
   represent a highly productive locality (WMU-VP-222) were used to extract
   similar image objects in the area covered by the high resolution imagery
   and throughout the basin using the Landsat imagery. During the 2013
   summer field season, twenty-six locations that would not have been
   spotted from the road in a traditional ground survey were visited.
   Fourteen of the eighteen localities that were fossiliferous were
   identified by the predictive model. In 2014, the GEOBIA techniques were
   applied to Landsat 8 imagery of the entire basin, correctly identifying
   six new productive localities in a previously unsurveyed part of the
   basin.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is often seen in
   conjunction with an underlying thyroid disorder. Imaging methods that
   are used to localize the parathyroid adenoma also detect associated
   thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. The aim of this study was to detect
   the rate of thyroid cancer identified while performing parathyroidectomy
   and thyroidectomy in patients with PHPT.
   Material and Methods: Files of all patients who were operated for PHPT
   and who underwent simultaneous thyroidectomy were analyzed. Data
   regarding parathyroid pathology, surgical procedures, indications of
   thyroid surgery, and pathology results were retrospectively recorded.
   The indications for thyroid surgery included presence of suspicious
   thyroid nodules in ultrasonography, increase in size of thyroid nodules
   in follow-up ultrasound, or presence of suspicious thyroid fine needle
   aspiration biopsy (FNAB) findings. Rates of thyroid cancer detection
   were investigated according to definite pathology reports.
   Results: Eighty-three patients who underwent parathyroidectomy with a
   diagnosis of PHPT with concurrent thyroidectomy in Department of General
   Surgery, Istanbul University Istanbul Faculty of Medicine were included
   in the study. Eighteen patients were male (22\%) and 65 were female
   (78\%). The median age was 53 (18-70) years. The primary indication for
   parathyroidectomy was primary hyperparathyroidism in all patients. The
   thyroid procedures applied in addition to parathyroidectomy were
   lobectomy + isthmusectomy in 29 patients (35\%), bilateral subtotal
   thyroidectomy in 20 patients (24\%), bilateral total thyroidectomy in 23
   patients (28\%), and total thyroidectomy on one side and near total
   thyroidectomy to the other side in 11 patients (13\%). The only
   indication for thyroidectomy was the presence of thyroid nodules until
   2000 (20 patients, 24\%). Indications in the remaining 63 patients
   included the presence of multiple nodules that cannot be followed up by
   ultrasonography in 25 patients (30\%), presence of a suspicious nodule
   on ultrasonography in 33 patients (40\%), growth in nodule size in 2
   patients (2\%), and detection of suspicious findings on FNAB in 3
   patients (4\%). Five patients (6\%) were diagnosed with papillary
   thyroid cancer, four of whom were micropapillary cancer.
   Conclusion: Imaging methods performed to localize the pathological
   parathyroid gland for a diagnosis of PHPT are useful in estimating other
   accompanying pathologies. Presence of thyroid nodules should be
   evaluated before all parathyroid procedures, and if the nodule has an
   indication for surgery, thyroid surgery should be considered at the same
   operation with parathyroid surgery.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of submarine groundwater discharges (SGD) on the dynamics
   of coastal ecosystems is receiving increasing scientific attention,
   although our knowledge of this issue still remains insufficient.
   Understanding the ecological response of coastal ecosystems to SGD
   dynamics is important in order to evaluate and predict changes in
   coastal communities. The aim of the present study was to characterize
   the effect of groundwater discharge on subtidal soft-bottom macrofaunal
   assemblages in the south coast of Portugal (Algarve) at different times
   of the year and under different discharge regimes. Sediment macrofauna
   was sampled twice per season in spring and summer 2011 in two locations:
   one under influence of SGD (Olhos de Agua) and one not under that
   influence (Arrifes). The results showed that differences in community
   structure between locations occurred mainly during spring, when the
   magnitude of groundwater discharge was higher. Several individual taxa
   were strongly associated with the SGD, particularly during spring: the
   polychaete families Magelonidae and Oweniidae; the isopod Cyathura
   carinata; and the bivalves Tellimya ferruginosa and Tellina fabula. Some
   of these taxa are already considered indicators of SGD, whereas others
   merit further investigation. The average similarity among samples was
   consistently larger in the location with SGD and the average similarity
   between the two locations was generally higher during spring, indicating
   that SGD promote stability in macrobenthic communities across time and
   space. SGD were also associated with higher values of Chlorophyll a (Chl
   a), fine sediments and total abundance of organisms (particularly
   suspension feeders). This suggests that differences between locations
   are associated with SGD and mediated by nutrient fluxes and sediment
   transport, or their interaction.}},

Abstract = {{The most effective treatment for thyroid cancer (TC) invading into the
   larynx and trachea is a complete surgical resection of the tumor, but
   currently employed techniques are less than ideal. We report a novel
   surgical technique, which we named Windmill resection and Tetris
   reconstruction, for patients with TC invading into the laryngeal lumen.
   We treated eight cases of TC with invasion into the laryngeal lumen by
   Windmill resection and Tetris reconstruction. We analyzed complications,
   clinical data, and pathological findings for all patients. Patients
   included one man and seven women (mean age 69 +/- 10 years).
   Histopathology of TC indicated papillary cancer in five patients, poorly
   differentiated cancer in one patient, anaplastic cancer in one patient,
   and squamous cell carcinoma in one patient. Unilateral recurrent
   laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy was confirmed preoperatively by laryngoscope
   in four patients, and none had bilateral RLN palsy. All patients
   underwent Windmill resection and Tetris reconstruction along with total
   thyroidectomy (three patients), subtotal thyroidectomy (three patients),
   and lobectomy (two patients). Neck dissection was performed in all
   patients. The average resected length of the larynx and trachea was
   29+/-6 mm. Air leakage at the suture line occurred in three patients;
   two required further surgery, while the third was closed by insertion of
   a Penrose drain. Postoperative RLN palsy occurred in five patients.
   Aspiration was observed in two patients and resolved within 4 weeks.
   Pneumonia, atelectasis, and pleural effusion occurred in some patients.
   No other complications, including hemorrhage, wound infection, or airway
   stenosis, occurred. There was no postoperative mortality and no
   recurrence at the anastomotic site. Two patients underwent permanent
   tracheostomy due to permanent bilateral RLN palsy. Two patients, one
   with anaplastic cancer and the other with poorly differentiated cancer,
   recurred 13 and 21 months after surgery, while patients with papillary
   thyroid cancer had no local recurrence. Importantly, laryngeal functions
   such as phonation and swallowing were preserved in all patients. This
   novel surgical technique may be as effective as window resection of the
   larynx for local control of TC and contributes to the quality of life of
   patients by resulting in a less unsightly surgical wound.}},

Abstract = {{1,4-Dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA), a precursor of menaquinone
   (vitamin K2), has an effect on growth stimulation of bifido-bacteria and
   prevention of osteoporosis, making it a promising functional food
   material. Therefore, we tried to clone the menB gene encoding DHNA
   synthase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides CJNU 0147. Based on the genome
   sequence of Leu. mesenteroides ATCC 8293 (GenBank accession no.,
   CP000414), a primer set (Leu\_menBfull\_F and Leu\_menBfull\_R) was
   designed for the PCR amplification of menB gene of CJNU 0147. A DNA
   fragment (1,190 bp), including the menB gene, was amplified, cloned into
   pGEM-T Easy vector, and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of
   MenB (DHNA synthase) protein of CJNU 0147 had a 98\% similarity to the
   corresponding protein of ATCC 8293. The menB gene was subcloned into
   pCW4, a lactic acid bacteria -E. coli shuttle vector, and transferred to
   CJNU 0147. The transcription of menB gene of CJNU 0147 (pCW4::menB) was
   increased, when compared with those of CJNU 0147 (pCW4) and CJNU 0147
   (-). The DHNA was produced from it at a detectable level, indicating
   that the cloned menB gene of CJNU 0147 encoded a DHNA synthase which is
   responsible for the production of DHNA, resulting in an increase of
   bifidogenic growth stimulation activity.}},

Abstract = {{The attachment of electrochemically active microorganisms (EAM) on an
   electrode is determined by both the chemistry and topography of the
   electrode surface. Pre-treatment of the electrode surface by atmospheric
   air plasma introduces hydrophilic functional groups, thereby increasing
   cell attachment and electroactivity in short-term experiments. In this
   study, we use graphite and carbon felt electrodes to grow the model EAM
   Shewanella loihica PV-4 at oxidative potential (0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl). Cell
   attachment and electroactivity are measured through electrodynamic
   methods. Atmospheric air plasma pre-treatment increases cell attachment
   and current output at graphite electrodes by 25\%, while it improves the
   electroactivity of the carbon felt electrodes by 450\%. Air plasma
   pre-treatment decreased the coulombic efficiency on both carbon felt and
   graphite electrodes by 60\% and 80\%, respectively. Microbially produced
   flavins adsorb preferentially at the graphite electrode, and air plasma
   pre-treatment results in lower flavin adsorption at both graphite and
   carbon felt electrodes. Results show that air plasma pre-treatment is a
   feasible option to increase current output in bioelectrochemical
   systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we evaluate various responses to a noteworthy
   objection, namely, the infinite God objection to the kalAm cosmological
   argument. As regards this objection, the proponents of the kalAm
   argument face a dilemma-either an actual infinite cannot exist or God
   cannot be infinite. More precisely, this objection claims that God's
   omniscience entails the existence of an actual infinite with God knowing
   an actually infinite number of future events or abstract objects, such
   as mathematical truths. We argue, however, that the infinite God
   objection is based on two questionable assumptions, namely, (1) that it
   is possible for an omniscient being to know an actually infinite number
   of things and (2) that there exist an actually infinite number of
   abstract objects for God to know.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect plant-mediated interactions between herbivores are important
   drivers of community composition in terrestrial ecosystems. Among the
   most striking examples are the strong indirect interactions between
   spatially separated leaf-and root-feeding insects sharing a host plant.
   Although leaf feeders generally reduce the performance of root
   herbivores, little is known about the underlying systemic changes in
   root physiology and the associated behavioral responses of the root
   feeders. We investigated the consequences of maize (Zea mays) leaf
   infestation by Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars for the root-feeding
   larvae of the beetle Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, a major pest of
   maize. D. virgifera strongly avoided leaf-infested plants by recognizing
   systemic changes in soluble root components. The avoidance response
   occurred within 12 h and was induced by real and mimicked herbivory, but
   not wounding alone. Roots of leaf-infested plants showed altered
   patterns in soluble free and soluble conjugated phenolic acids.
   Biochemical inhibition and genetic manipulation of phenolic acid
   biosynthesis led to a complete disappearance of the avoidance response
   of D. virgifera. Furthermore, bioactivity-guided fractionation revealed
   a direct link between the avoidance response of D. virgifera and changes
   in soluble conjugated phenolic acids in the roots of leaf-attacked
   plants. Our study provides a physiological mechanism for a behavioral
   pattern that explains the negative effect of leaf attack on a
   root-feeding insect. Furthermore, it opens up the possibility to control
   D. virgifera in the field by genetically mimicking leaf
   herbivore-induced changes in root phenylpropanoid patterns.}},

Abstract = {{For bladder cancer, intravesical chemo/immunotherapy is widely used as
   adjuvant therapy after surgical transurethral resection. Bacillus
   Calmette-Guerin (BOG) is a live attenuated Mycobacterium of the same
   family as tuberculosis, that is capable of inducing a local inflammatory
   response upon instillation into the bladder. Intravesical therapy with
   BCG has proved to be more effective in the prophylaxis and treatment of
   superficial bladder tumors than most chemotherapeutic agents used for
   the same indication. However, compared to intravesical chemotherapy, BCG
   immunotherapy provokes more pronounced local and systemic reactions. In
   addition to the commonly induced granulomatous inflammatory changes in
   the bladder, which produce irritative symptoms, this therapy may cause
   systemic side effects varying from mild malaise and fever to, in rare
   instances, life-threatening or fatal sepsis. Nanoparticles with positive
   surface charge and mucoadhesive properties were developed to overcome
   these side effects. Hence, the aim of this study was to optimize and
   evaluate cationic chitosan (CS) nanoparticles encapsulating BCG in terms
   of antitumor efficacy after intravesical administration in bladder
   tumor, induced in rat model. It was found that nanoparticle formulations
   of 269-375 nm in size can be produced with 42\% encapsulation
   efficiency. The zeta potential was positive and was suitable for
   intravesical administration. Antitumor efficacy was determined over the
   parameters of histopathological evaluation, survival rate and mean
   bladder weight in comparison to treatment with commercial BCG solution.
   Concerning survival rates, BOG-loaded chitosan nanoparticles resulted in
   significantly longer survival than BCG commercial product (up to 86 days
   of survival with no systemic side effects). When compared to healthy
   bladder weight averages, all groups (especially BCG commercial solution)
   showed higher bladder weights confirming tumor formation.
   Histopathological findings confirmed antitumor activity in all treatment
   groups and optimum findings were observed in groups treated with CS
   nanoparticles encapsulating BCG. At the same time, significant
   nanoparticle accumulation in bladder tissues was observed especially for
   BCG-loaded CS group. In this study, it was clearly observed that
   cationic CS nanoparticles provide a significantly improved perspective
   in intravesical immunotherapy of bladder tumors.}},

Abstract = {{This study is devoted to the investigation of molybdenum atom formation
   and consumption after UV laser pulse photolysis of molybdenum
   hexacarbonyl vapor diluted by various bath gases. The processes of
   formation and consumption of Mo atoms were observed using atomic
   resonance absorption spectroscopy (ARAS) technique at the Mo-I resonance
   line (lambda = 386.41 nm) providing the time profiles of molybdenum
   atoms concentration in the ground state. The increase of Mo atoms
   concentration was detected immediately after laser pulse and was
   determined mainly by spontaneous radiative quenching of excited Mo atoms
   produced in photolysis of molybdenum hexacarbonyl. It was found that
   collision quenching with bath gas molecules played a minor role. The
   following decrease of Mo atoms concentration after a maximum was
   attributed to the reactions of recombination, cluster formation and
   other secondary reactions. Based on the experimental data obtained, the
   kinetic mechanism of Mo atoms formation and consumption in
   photo-dissociation of Mo(CO)(6) was developed. The rate constants of
   basic reactions responsible for this mechanism were estimated using the
   frequencies of gas-kinetics collisions or were extracted directly from
   experimental data by the fitting of measured and calculated time
   profiles of Mo atoms concentration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the transfer of property rights as an active
   strategic tool that defines space (re) production, development,
   protection, and management processes and presents a creative approach
   and a perspective for urban resilience by an alternative land management
   model proposal. The discussion in this paper largely differs from the
   understanding of the concept both by the planning institution and the
   majority of academic studies. While the planning institution approaches
   the transfer of property rights as a passive ingredient, academic
   studies focus mainly on the outcomes of this transfer in economic terms
   and they fail in defining the necessary strategies, policies, and
   regulatory tools to decrease risk and negative impacts. The alternative
   approach presented in this paper suggests that property rights as a
   creative approach and policy tool for urban resilience should be
   examined on the basis of the relationship between partial interests in
   property; relative to value, land use, the location and the amount and
   type of real property transactions. A coastal region in Turkey where all
   types of historical, cultural, and natural resources are concentrated,
   but rapidly destroyed with the pressure of tourism, energy investments,
   and secondary housing is selected as a case for the analysis of the
   effects of the property market with the planning/urbanization problems
   in the region. The case study takes into account the internet data of
   transfer values by property types in the year 2008. The case study is
   used for presenting an administrative model that is implemented through
   and understanding for spatial planning to achieve urban resilience. This
   understanding is based on the concepts of integrated coastal zone and
   protection area management that are realized by controlling and
   directing transfers in order to limit the impact of the market and
   planning institutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The time at which follicles acquire LHR in bovine granulosa cells is the
   subject of some controversy among researchers. The main objective of the
   present study was to assess the mRNA expression of LHR and LRBP (mRNA
   protein binding), a post-transcriptional suppressor of LHR mRNA
   expression, in granulosa cells from the two largest follicles around the
   expected time of follicle deviation in Nelore heifers. First, the
   interval between ovulation and follicle deviation in 20 Nelore heifers
   was determined (2.3 +/- 0.2 days after ovulation). Ovulation was
   hormonally synchronized, and then, heifers were slaughtered on days 2,
   2.5 and 3 after ovulation (before, during and after, respectively, the
   expected time of follicle deviation), and granulosa cells from the two
   largest follicles were collected. The mRNA abundance of an LHR fragment
   common to all isoforms (total LHR) and LRBP was assessed by real-time
   RT-PCR, and LHR alternative transcripts were assessed by
   semiquantitative RT-PCR followed by electrophoresis. LHR mRNA expression
   was not detected before the expected time of deviation. Total LHR mRNA
   abundance was greater in the largest follicle and increased from day 2.5
   to 3. In contrast, LRBP mRNA was detected starting on day 2 and was more
   expressed in the second largest follicle on days 2.5 and 3. The present
   data suggest that the expression of LHR mRNA in bovine granulosa cells
   is established after follicle deviation and that the lower abundance of
   LRBP mRNA after the expected time of deviation may contribute to greater

Abstract = {{Observations made in a JET experiment aimed at accelerating deuterons to
   the MeV range by third harmonic radio-frequency (RF) heating coupled
   into a deuterium beam are reported. Measurements are based on a set of
   advanced neutron and gamma-ray spectrometers that, for the first time,
   observe the plasma simultaneously along vertical and oblique lines of
   sight. Parameters of the fast ion energy distribution, such as the high
   energy cut-off of the deuteron distribution function and the RF coupling
   constant, are determined from data within a uniform analysis framework
   for neutron and gamma-ray spectroscopy based on a one-dimensional model
   and by a consistency check among the individual measurement techniques.
   A systematic difference is seen between the two lines of sight and is
   interpreted to originate from the sensitivity of the oblique detectors
   to the pitch-angle structure of the distribution around the resonance,
   which is not correctly portrayed within the adopted one dimensional
   model. A framework to calculate neutron and gamma-ray emission from a
   spatially resolved, two-dimensional deuteron distribution specified by
   energy/pitch is thus developed and used for a first comparison with
   predictions from ab initio models of RF heating at multiple harmonics.
   The results presented in this paper are of relevance for the development
   of advanced diagnostic techniques for MeV range ions in high performance
   fusion plasmas, with applications to the experimental validation of RF
   heating codes and, more generally, to studies of the energy distribution
   of ions in the MeV range in high performance deuterium and
   deuterium-tritium plasmas.}},

Abstract = {{Bryozoan fauna was discovered within the glaciogenic sediments of an
   Ordovician (Hirnantian) tunnel valley infill near Alnif, Morocco where
   it had been redeposited from the upper Tiouririne Formation (Ktaoa
   Group, Katian). This fauna contains four species-one esthonioporine, two
   trepostomes and one rhabdomesine cryptostome-of which three are new:
   Revalotrypa ramosa sp. nov., Radiotrypa alnifensis sp. nov. and
   Heminematopora gaetula sp. nov. The fourth species, Monotrypa sp., is
   described using open nomenclature. Branched colonies of R. alnifensis
   sp. nov. are the most abundant element of the bryozoan-rich floatstones
   of the upper Tiouririne Formation in which bryozoans were deposited
   after being transported for a short distance. The genus Radiotrypa was
   previously known exclusively from the Hirnantian of Sweden, and the
   genus Heminematopora was known from the Upper Ordovician of North
   America and Europe. Study of the internal morphology of Heminematopora
   confirmed the presence of heterozooecia in this genus.}},

Abstract = {{Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has yielded major advances in fighting the
   HIV pandemic by restoring protective immunity. However, a significant
   proportion of HIV patients co-infected with the opportunistic fungal
   pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans paradoxically develops a
   life-threatening immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)
   during antiretroviral therapy. Despite several clinical studies, the
   underlying pathomechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we present the
   first mouse model of cryptococcal IRIS that allows for a detailed
   analysis of disease development. Lymphocyte-deficient RAG-1(-/-) mice
   are infected with C. neoformans and 4 weeks later adoptively transferred
   with purified CD4(+) T cells. Reconstitution of CD4(+) T cells is
   sufficient to induce a severe inflammatory disease similar to clinical
   IRIS in C. neoformans-infected RAG-1(-/-) mice of different genetic
   backgrounds and immunological phenotypes (i.e. C57BL/6 and BALB/c).
   Multiorgan inflammation is accompanied by a systemic release of distinct
   proinflammatory cytokines, i.e. IFN-gamma, IL-6, and TNF-gamma. IRIS
   development is characterized by infection-dependent activation of donor
   CD4(+) T cells, which are the source of IFN-gamma. Interestingly,
   IFN-gamma-mediated effects are not required for disease induction. Taken
   together, this novel mouse model of cryptococcal IRIS provides a useful
   tool to verify potential mechanisms of pathogenesis, revealing targets
   for diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Pharmaceuticals are becoming widely distributed in waters and
   wastewaters and pose a serious threat to public health. The present
   study aimed to analyze non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in
   surface waters, drinking water, and wastewater in Tehran, Iran.
   Thirty-six samples were collected from surface waters, tap water, and
   influent and effluent of municipal and hospital wastewater treatment
   plants (WWTP). A solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was used for the
   determination of pharmaceuticals, namely ibuprofen (IBP), naproxen
   (NPX), diclofenac (DIC), and indomethacin (IDM). IBP was found in most
   of the samples and had the highest concentration. The highest
   concentrations of NSAIDs were found in the municipal WWTP influents and
   hospital WWTP effluents. In the municipal WWTP influent samples, the
   concentrations of IBP, NPX, DIC, and IDM were 1.05, 0.43, 0.23, and 0.11
   mu g/L, respectively. DIC was found only in one river sample. All NSAIDs
   were detected in tap water samples. However, their concentration was
   very low and the maximum values for IBP, NPX, DIC, and IDM were 47, 39,
   24, and 37 ng/L, respectively, in tap water samples. Results showed that
   the measured pharmaceuticals were detected in all rivers with low
   concentrations in nanograms per liter range, except DIC which was found
   only in one river. Furthermore, this study showed that the
   aforementioned pharmaceuticals are not completely removed during their
   passage through WWTPs. A potential environmental risk of selected NSAIDs
   for the urban wastewater has been discussed. However, given their low
   measured concentrations, no ecotoxicological effect is suspected to
   occur.}},

Abstract = {{The political and social current throughout the world marked by a
   tendency towards greater citizen participation in the governance of
   institutions has been enacted in European Community Law, among other
   measures, by the inclusion of the figure of the Citizens' Initiative, by
   virtue of the Treaty of Lisbon, as a further right within the framework
   of the Statute of European Citizenship. The legislative texts of the
   European Community predicted a key role for digital media, both in terms
   of providing information and citizen participation. Around three years
   since the option of proposing citizen initiatives began, with around 50
   such proposals having been put into practice, there is now enough
   perspective to evaluate whether or not these predictions were well
   based. After the necessary research, it has been possible to confirm
   that digital media have been essential for achieving the goals for which
   the Citizens' Initiative was designed, both in terms of providing a
   mouthpiece for the initiatives developed and facilitating the gathering
   of support through websites. In fact, practice seems to have
   demonstrated that it would now be impossible, due to a lack of time and
   all types of resources, to achieve the support figures required under
   the regulations corresponding to the Citizens' Initiative, within the
   set time periods, without the help of digital media.}},

Volume = {{467}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was used to
   study the effect of water vapor on the UO2 surface as a function of
   temperature. The experiments were performed in situ inside a high
   pressure chamber attached to the XPS instrument. UO2 samples were put in
   contact with either hydrogen or argon streams, saturated with water at
   room temperature, and the sample surface evolution was analyzed by XPS.
   In the case of the water vapor/argon experiments, one experiment at 350
   degrees C was performed and, in the case of the water vapor/hydrogen
   experiments, the temperatures used inside the reactor were 60, 120, 200
   and 350 degrees C. On one hand, in presence of argon, the results
   obtained showed that the water vapor in the argon stream oxidized 93\%
   of the U(IV) in the sample surface. On the other hand, the degree of UO2
   surface oxidation showed a different dependence on the temperature in
   the experiments performed in the presence of hydrogen: the maximum
   surface oxidation occurred at 120 degrees C, where 65.4\% of U(IV) in
   the sample surface was oxidized, while at higher temperatures, the
   surface oxidation decreased. This observation is attributed to the
   increase of hydrogen reducing effect when temperature increases which
   prevents part of the oxidation of the UO2 surface by the water vapor.

Abstract = {{Objective: To review gait alterations and evaluate the effects of
   OnabotulinumtoxinA on spatiotemporal walking parameters of patients with
   hemiparetic gait.
   Design: Retrospective pre- and post-intervention analysis.
   Setting: Gait analysis laboratory in a tertiary level rehabilitation
   hospital.
   Participants: 42 patients with hemiparesis. 19 males and 23 females, age
   18-78 years were included.
   Intervention: Spatiotemporal parameters collected before and within 4-10
   weeks after OnabotA injection to the ankle muscles. Data was recorded at
   self-selected velocity on a 12 m instrumented walkway. The most common
   muscles injected were medial and lateral gastrocnemius, soleus and
   tibialis posterior. Average total OnabotulinumtoxinA dose was 320 +/-
   107 units.
   Main outcome: Spatiotemporal parameters of walking assessed before (T-0)
   and within 4-10 weeks post injection (T-1). Paired t-test was used to
   compare pre- and post-intervention data. A sequential Holm-Bonferroni
   procedure was used to adjust for multiple comparisons and minimize the
   risk of type I error. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
   Results: Statistically significant increases were seen for walking
   velocity (20\%) (T-0 = 0.40 +/- 0.26 m/s and T-1 = 0.48 +/- 0.29 m/s; p
   = 0.006), and increased cadence (T-0 = 63.48 +/- 23.93 steps/min, and
   T-1 = 70.88 +/- 23.65 steps/min; p = 0.006) following OnabotulinumtoxinA
   injections.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that injection of OnabotulinumtoxinA
   320 units to ankle muscles selected with the aid of dynamic
   electromyography can significantly increase gait velocity and enhance
   functional ambulation in adults with hemiparesis due to upper motor
   neuron syndrome. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sunshield membranes made of germanium-coated black polyimide (GBP) or

   vacuum/inert gas-sealed packaging is required for storing the membranes,
   followed by a staggered fabrication schedule as the shelf-life of the
   GBP is identified as only similar to 6 months. In the present study,
   microstructural, thermo-optical, and electrical properties along with
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies for evaluating oxidation
   states of the as-received and degraded GBP films have been investigated
   thoroughly. The radio frequency (RF) loss behavior of both the films has

Abstract = {{Background. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) remains a concern
   after organ transplantation. In 2005, the University of Kentucky (UK)
   Transplant Center implemented a novel dosing regimen of weekly dapsone
   as an alternative for patients with contraindications or intolerability
   to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), which remains the drug of
   choice. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of weekly
   dapsone with TMP-SMZ in preventing PCP post transplantation.
   Methods. A single-center, cohort, retrospective review of kidney and
   liver transplant patients from January 2005 to December 2012 was
   conducted. Patients who were identified as dapsone cases were matched in
   a 1:1 ratio with TMP-SMZ controls based on type of transplant, age,
   primary diagnosis, and gender. The primary endpoint assessed was the
   diagnosis of PCP at 6 and 12 months post transplant.
   Results. A total of 158 patients were included in the study. No
   documented cases of PCP occurred in either study group at 6 or 12 months
   (P = 1.0). In dapsone patients 35 (44\%) cases of breakthrough infection
   occurred, compared to 24 (30\%) in the TMP-SMZ group (P = 0.07) within
   12 months post transplant. In the dapsone group, 52 (65\%) patients were
   hospitalized within 6 months post transplant compared to 36 (46\%)
   patients in the TMP-SMZ group (P = 0.01). Similar results were seen in
   patients hospitalized within 12 months post transplant; 49\% of patients
   were switched from TMP-SMZ to dapsone owing to renal dysfunction.
   Conclusion. No documented cases of PCP occurred in either study group.
   Future studies are warranted to show the efficacy of weekly dapsone
   dosing compared to other PCP prophylaxis regimens.}},

Title = {{Analysis of groundwater flow in mountainous, headwater catchments with

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{9564-9576}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Headwater catchments have a direct impact on the water resources of
   downstream lowland regions as they supply freshwater in the form of
   surface runoff and discharging groundwater. Often, these mountainous
   catchments contain expansive permafrost that may alter the natural
   topographically controlled groundwater flow system. As permafrost could
   degrade with climate change, it is imperative to understand the effect
   of permafrost on groundwater flow in headwater catchments. This study
   characterizes groundwater flow in mountainous headwater catchments and
   evaluates the effect of permafrost in the context of climate change on
   groundwater movement using a three-dimensional, finite element,
   hydrogeologic model. The model is applied to a representative headwater
   catchment on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. Results from the model
   simulations indicate that groundwater contributes significantly to
   streams in the form of baseflow and the majority of groundwater flow is
   from the shallow aquifer above the permafrost, disrupting the typical
   topographically controlled flow pattern observed in most permafrost-free
   headwater catchments. Under a warming scenario where mean annual surface
   temperature is increased by 2 degrees C, reducing the areal extent of
   permafrost in the catchment, groundwater contribution to streamflow may
   increase three-fold. These findings suggest that, in headwater
   catchments, permafrost has a large influence on groundwater flow and
   stream discharge. Increased annual air temperatures may increase
   groundwater discharge to streams, which has implications for ecosystem
   health and the long-term availability of water resources to downstream
   regions.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{388-401}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper documents the results of scientific studies to quantify the
   impact on shales and claystones of exposure to air, and to different
   liquids. These studies show that the water content of such rocks is
   controlled by the relative humidity of the surrounding air. Most
   shales/claystones will lose water, shrink and desaturate if exposed to
   air, unless the relative humidity is sufficiently high (usually
   80-96\%), causing desiccation damage. While exposure to brine will
   prevent desiccation, it results in water uptake and swelling, and a
   different type of alteration and damage. Confining stress will limit
   this swelling. Well-preserved shales are generally fully saturated under
   zero-stress conditions, but they have a negative pore water pressure.
   Hydrocarbon will not normally enter a fully saturated shale. Based on
   these findings, it is recommended that shale water content should not be
   altered unless it is done so under controlled conditions; to accomplish
   this one must minimize exposure to air, and avoid contact with water or
   brine unless the shale is under stress. Specific guidelines are provided
   for core handling and preservation, sampling, and testing. Gas shales
   are both similar to, and different than, claystone shales, and this
   alters slightly the findings and guidelines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of the CT based quantitative assessment
   of the craniosynostosis before and after the surgery. First, fast and
   efficient brain segmentation approach is proposed. The algorithm is
   robust to discontinuity of skull. As a result it can be applied both in
   pre- and post-operative cases. Additionally, image processing and
   analysis algorithms are proposed for describing the disease based on CT
   scans. The proposed algorithms automate determination of the standard
   linear indices used for assessment of the craniosynostosis (i.e.
   cephalic index CI and head circumference HC) and allow for planar and
   volumetric analysis which so far have not been reported. Results of
   applying the introduced methods to sample craniosynostotic cases before
   and after the surgery are presented and discussed. The results show that
   the proposed brain segmentation algorithm is characterized by high
   accuracy when applied both in the pre- and postoperative
   craniosynostosis, while the introduced planar and volumetric indices for
   the disease description may be helpful to distinguish between the types

   diffraction) with high glass transition temperature (modulated
   differential scanning calorimetry, MDSC), suggesting the potential for
   stabilization of the OT in a glassy amorphous matrix. OT assay and
   impurity profile were conducted by reverse phase HPLC and liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) after storage up to 32 weeks at
   40 degrees C/75\% RH. Analysis demonstrated that OT dry powders
   containing a mixture of citrate and zinc salts retained more than 90\%
   of initial assay after 32 weeks storage and showed significant reduction
   in dimers and trisulfide formation (up to threefold reduction compared
   to control).}},

Abstract = {{Inulin, a plant polysaccharide consisting of mainly d-fructose units, is
   considered an interesting feed for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a top
   12 bio-based chemical. We here report an exploratory experimental study
   on the use of a wide range of homogeneous metal salts as catalysts for
   the conversion of inulin to HMF in water. Best results were obtained
   using CuCl2. Activity-pH relations indicate that the catalyst activity
   of CuCl2 is likely related to Lewis acidity and not to Bronsted acidity.
   The effects of process conditions on HMF yield for CuCl2 were
   systematically investigated and quantified using a central composite
   design (160-180 degrees C, an inulin loading between 0.05 and 0.15 g/mL,
   CuCl2 concentration in range of 0.005-0.015 M, and a reaction time
   between 10 and 120 min). The highest experimental HMF yield in the
   process window was 30.3 wt. \% (39 mol \%, 180 degrees C, 0.05 g/mL
   inulin, 0.005 M CuCl2 and a reaction time of 10 min). The HMF yields
   were modelled using non-linear, multi variable regression and good
   agreement between experimental data and model were obtained.}},

   anticline made in previous studies was based on geological evidences and
   structural geology measurements. In order to have a complete coverage of
   Lavarestan anticline, 4 profiles with appropriate intervals were
   selected on gravity data for further processing and interpretation. 2D
   inverse modeling was performed on these profiles using Encome
   Modelvision and Encome PA software. Geometrical and physical parameters
   of each layer were changed step by step and forward gravity calculations
   were repeated until we reached a desirable fitting between observed and
   calculated gravity anomaly. The results of 2D gravity modeling were
   focused on Lower Paleozoic and Kazerun (cap rock) top horizon, also the
   underground contour map was extracted from seismic data after

   case study of failed and non-failed DC motors}},
Journal = {{TRIBOLOGY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{21-28}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to understand the tribological mechanisms that
   lead to the failure of the commutating system of a DC motor. Brush and
   commutator are the most stressed components of a DC motor because of
   their role in transferring the current from the power unit to the rotor.
   Interrupting one of these parts leads to an unusual current transition
   and mostly to a complete damage of the motor. Two DC motors were
   analyzed after continuously running in a laboratory environment under
   the same conditions. Failure of one of the motors was observed after
   1200 h, while the other one completed the test (1500 h) without any
   interruption.
   The analysis included the characterization of the structure and the
   chemical composition of the surface of the commutator and the brush
   using different complementary surface analytical methods. It was found
   that the failure of the motor is related to a very rough and thick layer
   that was formed both on the commutator and the brush surface. On the
   brush surface this layer mostly consists of oxidized bulk material
   (oxidized graphite) with small changes in the mechanical properties. On
   the commutator however, a combination of oxide material from the bulk
   (Cu2O and CuO) and a significant amount of oxidized carbon coming from
   the brush surface was found to form a layer. Furthermore, spherical wear
   particles were found within the microstructure of this layer. These
   layers were not observed on the surface of the motor that did not fail.

Abstract = {{Prostate cancer is among the most commonly diagnosed male diseases and a
   leading cause of cancer mortality in men. There is emerging evidence
   that autophagy plays an important role in malignant cell survival and
   offers protection from the anti-cancer drugs in prostate cancer cells.
   AMBRA1 and the autophagic protein sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1; p62)
   expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot on
   tissue samples from both benign and malignant prostatic lesions. The
   data reported in this pilot study demonstrated an increased expression
   of AMBRA1 and SQSTM1, which were also associated with an accumulation of
   LC3II in prostate cancer but not in benign lesion. In the present study
   we found that: (i) at variance with benign lesion, prostate cancer cells
   underwent SQSTM1 accumulation, i.e., clearly displayed a defective
   autophagic process but, also, (ii) prostate cancer accumulated AMBRA1
   and (iii) this increase positively correlated with the Gleason score.
   These results underscore a possible implication of autophagy in prostate
   cancer phenotype and of AMBRA1 as possible cancer progression biomarker
   in this malignancy.}},

Title = {{Quantifying Poverty as a Driver of Ebola Transmission}},
Journal = {{PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Poverty has been implicated as a challenge in the control of the current
   Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Although disparities between affected
   countries have been appreciated, disparities within West African
   countries have not been investigated as drivers of Ebola transmission.
   To quantify the role that poverty plays in the transmission of Ebola, we
   analyzed heterogeneity of Ebola incidence and transmission factors among
   over 300 communities, categorized by socioeconomic status (SES), within
   Montserrado County, Liberia.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We evaluated 4,437 Ebola cases reported between February 28, 2014 and
   December 1, 2014 for Montserrado County to determine SES-stratified
   temporal trends and drivers of Ebola transmission. A dataset including
   dates of symptom onset, hospitalization, and death, and specified
   community of residence was used to stratify cases into high, middle and
   low SES. Additionally, information about 9,129 contacts was provided for
   a subset of 1,585 traced individuals. To evaluate transmission within
   and across socioeconomic subpopulations, as well as over the trajectory
   of the outbreak, we analyzed these data with a time-dependent stochastic
   model. Cases in the most impoverished communities reported three more
   contacts on average than cases in high SES communities (p< 0.001). Our
   transmission model shows that infected individuals from middle and low
   SES communities were associated with 1.5 (95\% CI: 1.4-1.6) and 3.5
   (95\% CI: 3.1-3.9) times as many secondary cases as those from high SES
   communities, respectively. Furthermore, most of the spread of Ebola
   across Montserrado County originated from areas of lower SES.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Individuals from areas of poverty were associated with high rates of
   transmission and spread of Ebola to other regions. Thus, Ebola could
   most effectively be prevented or contained if disease interventions were
   targeted to areas of extreme poverty and funding was dedicated to
   development projects that meet basic needs.}},

Abstract = {{The horizontal distribution and temporal variation of bacterial
   indicators (total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC), enterococcus
   (EC) and Escherichia coli (E. coli)) were investigated to identify the
   proper bacterial indicators for a marine bathing beach in China. Two
   different sampling efforts were conducted during dry weather and two
   large rain events at Xinghai Bathing Beach in Dalian, China. Samples
   were collected from three different water depths and analyzed for the
   four indicator bacteria. The results indicated that all four bacterial
   indicators exceeded the single sample standards at different levels.
   Specifically, the water quality exceeded the standard for TC, FC, EC and
   E. coli in 7\%, 28\%, 38\% and 10\% of the samples, respectively.
   Comparison of the rate of the indicators before and after rainfall
   revealed a significant increasing post-rainfall. The concentrations of
   bacteria differed significantly with distance from the shoreline, with
   knee-depth near the shore exceeding the standard most frequently. This
   was primarily due to contamination by excessive sewage discharge and
   rainfall. Based upon the concentration of indicators and exceedance
   rates, as well as the correlation between indicators, both EC and FC
   should be evaluated at the same time as fecal pollution bacterial
   indicators in marine bathing beaches in China.}},

Journal = {{ECONOMIC MODELLING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{524-533}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A model for valuing a European-style commodity option and a futures
   option is discussed with a view to incorporating the impact of changing
   hidden economic conditions on commodity price dynamics. The proposed
   model may be thought of as an extension to the Gibson-Schwartz
   two-factor model, where the model parameters vary when the hidden state
   of an economy switches. A semi-analytical approach to valuing commodity
   options and futures options is adopted, where the closed-form
   expressions for the characteristic functions of the logarithmic
   commodity price and futures price are derived. A fast Fourier transform
   (FFT) approach is then applied to provide a practical and efficient way
   to evaluate the option prices. Real data studies and numerical examples
   are used to illustrate the practical implementation of the model. (C)

   pairs. They can be used as `green' alternatives to conventional
   halogen-containing IL lubricants as they are environmentally friendly
   with good biodegradability and reduced toxicity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Protein adducts covalently modified by catechol estrogens (CEs),
   referred to as estrogenized proteins, are potential biomarkers for
   estrogen homeostasis or exposure to environmental toxicants. However,
   serum proteins endogenously modified by CEs and the modification sites
   remain elusive. In this study, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (LC-MS)-based shotgun proteomics is applied to identify site-specific
   protein estrogenization in human blood via a systematic approach and
   stringent validation. We showed CEs, namely 2- and 4-hydroxyl estrogens
   which are regarded as biomarkers for estrogen homeostasis, form covalent
   bonds with proteins, mainly via side chain Cys, Lys, or His residue.
   Estrogenization of purified human serum albumin (HSA) and immunoglobulin
   G (IgG) at specific sites was achieved by co-incubation and used as the
   standards to confirm the identified estrogenization in serum proteins.
   Based on a database search, estrogenized peptides derived from serum
   proteins in patient blood were identified; endogenous estrogenization of
   HSA and IgG-1 at multiple sites were confirmed as compared to the
   standards. Based on a test using Ellman's reagent, estrogenization
   produced stable products and irreversibly abolished the reactivity of
   Cys34-HSA, which is the most important antioxidant and nitric oxide
   carrier in blood. Given the importance of estrogen metabolism in
   environmental toxicology, further exploration of estrogenized proteins
   is warranted for biomarker discovery and/or new mechanisms in disease
   process.}},

Abstract = {{A link tower is a sequence of links with the structure given by removing
   the last components. Given a link tower, we prove that there is a chain
   complex consisting of (non-abelian) groups given by the symmetric
   commutator subgroup of the normal closures in the link group of the
   meridians excluding the meridian of the last component with the
   differential induced by removing the last component. Moreover, the
   homology groups of these naturally constructed chain complexes are
   isomorphic to the homotopy groups of the manifold M under certain
   hypothesis. These chain complexes have canonical quotient abelian chain
   complexes in Minor's homotopy link groups with their homologies
   detecting certain differences of the homotopy link groups in the towers.}},

Abstract = {{An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) capable of
   detecting walnut proteins in commercial products was developed.
   Polyclonal antibodies against soluble walnut protein were used. Specific
   epitopes of walnut protein were analyzed for cross activity with peanut,
   soybean, sesame, rice, wheat, jujube, and defatted milk protein.
   Epitopes of walnut proteins had no cross activity. The indirect ELISA
   was highly specific for soluble walnut proteins. Recovery values from
   walnut protein solutions ranged from 88.47 to 115\%, and low
   coefficients of variation (< 10\%) indicated good repeatability. Intra
   and inter-assay precisions were < 6 and < 7 \%, respectively. The limit
   of detection was 10 ng/mL of soluble walnut protein. The method was
   applied to detect some commercial food products in China and the results
   showed that indirect ELISA could be promisingly used to quantify
   adulteration of walnut processed foods.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a method to improve the ablation and oxidation resistance by
   designing specified microstructures on the surface of silicon carbide
   (SiC) based ceramic. Three different types of micropatterns were
   designed and simulations were carried out to compare their effects.
   Experiments on SiC ceramic at temperature of 1700 degrees C-1750 degrees
   C were conducted to validate the design. Results showed a favorable
   correlation between the pattern design, simulation, and experiments.
   These specifically designed microstructures can modify the local flow
   fields, change the local oxygen concentration and chemical reaction rate
   due to the structural influence on the fluids dynamics of
   high-temperature gas flow. They can also tune the adhesion property
   between the liquid silica and SiC substrate by ``locking in{''} the
   liquid silica on the surface to prevent further oxygen diffusion.}},

Title = {{Texture hysteresis of pistachio kernels on drying and rehydration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{166}},
Pages = {{335-341}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To prolong shell life, pistachio kernels are first dried and then in
   many cases they are rehydrated prior to or during food formulations.
   Texture of the rehydrated kernels is one of key organoleptic properties
   for consumer acceptability. In this research pistachio kernels were
   dried and then rehydrated to different moisture levels to compare the
   effect of these treatments on their textural properties. This was
   performed to examine texture differences between pistachio kernels of
   same water content but different drying, rehydration or thermal
   histories. Texture profile analysis data showed that hardness, gradient
   and compression energy of all pistachio samples increased with moisture
   reduction and significant differences were observed between the textural
   parameters of dried and rehydrated samples with same moisture level and
   lower values were obtained for rehydrated samples. It was evident from
   the results that thermal history of pistachio plays a key role in
   determining its textural and mechanical properties. Having pistachio
   kernels of same moisture and different drying and rehydration histories
   does not guarantee similar textural properties. These findings are
   clearly showing that texture deteriorations or changes can occur when
   fruits are first dried and then rehydrated to the initial moisture
   level. This can have practical implications in developing and designing
   foods with texture being their main sensory property. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Exposing concrete to high temperature causes progressive breakdown of
   the cement gel structure and consequently severe deterioration and loss
   in the structure's load bearing capacity. This paper presents an
   experimental study on the mechanical and physicochemical properties of
   lightweight self-consolidating concrete (LWSCC) subjected to high
   temperatures. Four LWSCC mixes and one normal-weight self-consolidating
   concrete (NWSCC) were tested. The specimens underwent two different
   tests: a fire test and a thermal characterization test. The first is the
   ISO fire test, which consists of heating the prismatic specimens
   according to the standard fire curve up to 600 degrees C. The second
   test is the thermal characterization test, which consists of heating the
   specimens at a rate of 1 degrees C/min up to 400 degrees C. Ultimate and
   residual compressive strength, loss of mass, density, water porosity,
   spalling characteristics, and other physicochemical properties before
   and after the fire tests were recorded. The LWSCC performed differently
   from the NWSCC with respect to mechanical properties and spalling
   resistance. Scanning electron microscopy and backscatter electron images
   analysis were performed to study the microstructure of both heated and
   unheated specimens. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional carbon/carbon (C/C) composites comprising four

   carbon fibers and densified using a hybrid process. This consists of a
   pre-densification step using a thermal-gradient chemical vapor
   infiltration process followed by a high-pressure pitch impregnation and
   carbonization process. The specimens machined along Z-axis of the
   preform architecture were tested in an arc plasma heater for studying
   its ablation behavior at different temperatures. Regimes from ultra-high
   temperature (4750 K) sublimation to high-temperature (2467 K) oxidation
   zones were created by varying the mass flow rate of secondary air in the
   heater. The ablation rate showed a progressive increase as the
   environment changed from oxygen-lean sublimation to oxygen-rich
   oxidation conditions while the back-face temperature showed a similar
   temperature profile during the plasma exposure period. The thermal
   diffusivity value decreased with the rise in temperature till 1173 K and
   later on became fairly flat till 1523 K and onwards. In the compression
   test, 4750 K exposed specimen showed toughening in the plasma-affected

Abstract = {{Cellulose based films were fabricated by dissolving the
   micro-crystalline cellulose and cotton linter in a LiOH/urea aqueous

   proportional to the thickness of samples. The films also exhibited high
   oil resistance as no fat oil could pass through the RMCC and RCL films
   even after a week. The RMCC and RCL/natural-montmorillonite
   nanocomposites (Na-MMT) films were prepared and characterized. The
   effect of Na-MMT loading on the mechanical, crystallinity and water
   vapor transmission properties of the nanocomposites was further
   investigated. Na-MMT loading improved the mechanical properties and
   decreased the crystallinity of the nanocomposite films. The results

Abstract = {{Individuals from a diverse array of bird species sometimes occur well
   outside of their historic distributions. These vagrants, and their
   patterns of occurrence, may yield valuable insights regarding how birds
   respond to environmental change. Among the Rallidae, which are champion
   dispersers, the Purple Gallinule (Porphyrio martinicus) disperses
   exceptionally long distances. Whereas most Purple Gallinule vagrants
   occur from April to October, a much smaller number of records represent
   a more enigmatic vagrancy pattern that occurs from November to February.
   Using eBird, a global bird-monitoring project, we compiled 77
   occurrences of vagrant Purple Gallinules from 1957-2014 during this
   seasonal window and examined how those occurrences correlated with
   environmental conditions and population trends. Average temperature
   anomalies showed significant correlations with patterns of records, with
   warmer late summer temperatures in particular in Florida and Puerto Rico
   correlating with more vagrants. Drier conditions in eastern Mexico,
   especially during winter, showed similar significant relationships. Our
   results indicate the potential utility of studying vagrants to
   understand relationships between bird populations and environmental
   changes, and more importantly highlight the potential for understanding
   how vagrancy may relate to changes in this species' distribution under

Abstract = {{This study presents the application of electromembrane microextraction
   technique combined with HPLC-UV detection for fast
   extraction-preconcentration and determination of melamine in dairy
   products. It is based on the extraction of charged melamine molecules
   migrated from 6.5 mL feed solution through a liquid membrane immobilized
   in the pores of a hollow fiber into 20 mu L of the acceptor solution.
   The best performance was achieved by using 2-nitrophenyloctylether,
   tris-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (10\%) and di-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate
   (10\%) as the extraction solvent; application of a potential of 90 V as
   the driving force and by adjusting the pH of feed and receiving phases
   at 5.5 and 1, respectively. The working range was 7-8000 ng mL(-1), with
   detection limit of 2.0-5.8 ng mL(-1). The enrichment factor was in the
   range 82-192. Intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations were
   less than 6.6\%. Extraction and relative recoveries for different
   samples were between 25-59\% and 85-95\%, respectively. (C) 2015

Title = {{Behavioural primes in the voting booth: Further evidence of priming
   effects in popular votes and elections}},
Journal = {{ELECTORAL STUDIES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{315-321}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Why do electoral laws prohibit political advertisement right where
   voters cast their ballots? Apparently, it is assumed that the deliberate
   and intentional decision of voters can be swayed at the last minute,
   thereby compromising free and fair elections. While traditional
   approaches to electoral behaviour typically fail to recognise such
   influences, evidence from behavioural psychology suggests that subtle
   primes can indeed automatically trigger individual action. This paper
   therefore argues that voting, too, is subject to unsuspected primes. In
   particular, we analyse whether the innocuous environmental setting of
   the polling place can influence vote choice. Whether priming effects
   extend to political behaviour presents a puzzle that is yet not
   sufficiently investigated. On the one hand, two recent studies do show
   such behavioural priming effects for the USA. On the other hand,
   however, there is a serious debate about behavioural priming in general
   questioning the replicability of earlier studies. Against this
   background, our paper presents the first replication outside the USA of
   previous findings, and furthermore extends behavioural priming to other
   instances. Specifically, we address three questions. First, can
   behavioural priming of vote choice be replicated or are findings
   specific to the context of the USA? Second, does behavioural priming of
   vote choice also occur in elections in multi-party systems? And third,
   how do ambiguous primes affect decisions in votes, in which the prime
   does not correspond directly to favouring one choice over another? Using
   precinct level data from two federal city-states of Germany, Hamburg and
   Berlin, we find that results of popular votes and elections do, in fact,
   differ depending on the polling place being situated in a school. Our
   findings are not only relevant to the theoretical conception of vote
   choice and contribute to psychological accounts of political behaviour,
   but they also have practical implications for the design of electoral
   institutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Suicide conveyed several distinct meanings in the Romantic period -
   unlike today, when it is most often attributed to mental illness. This
   meaning also existed in the long eighteenth century, but it was
   understood more broadly as irrationality and popularized through the
   emphasis on extreme passion and emotionalism as related to suicide in
   the literature of sentiment. William Godwin capitalized on this widely
   recognized and - to some extent - culturally ameliorative significance
   of suicide by casting his dead wife, Mary Wollstonecraft, as a character
   in a novel of sensibility when he reported her two suicide attempts in
   the Memoirs (1798). In doing so, however, Godwin fictionalizes
   Wollstonecraft's suicide attempts as acts of passion, whereas she
   explains clearly in her letters that her suicidal desires were utterly
   rational. Wollstonecraft further explores the concept of rational
   suicide by presenting it as an act of protest in her fictional works,
   Mary (1788) and The Wrongs of Woman (1798). In both novellas about the
   marital enslavement of women, Wollstonecraft draws upon the discourse
   surrounding slave-suicide as a logical response to insupportable tyranny
   and her protagonists' death wishes as willed acts of protest.}},

Title = {{Use of Viremia to Evaluate the Baseline Case Fatality Ratio of Ebola
   Virus Disease and Inform Treatment Studies: A Retrospective Cohort Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The case fatality ratio (CFR) of Ebola virus disease (EVD) can vary over
   time and space for reasons that are not fully understood. This makes it
   difficult to define the baseline CFRs needed to evaluate treatments in
   the absence of randomized controls. Here, we investigate whether viremia
   in EVD patients may be used to evaluate baseline EVD CFRs.
   Methods and Findings
   We analyzed the laboratory and epidemiological records of patients with
   EVD confirmed by reverse transcription PCR hospitalized in the Conakry
   area, Guinea, between 1 March 2014 and 28 February 2015. We used viremia
   and other variables to model the CFR. Data for 699 EVD patients were
   analyzed. In the week following symptom onset, mean viremia remained
   stable, and the CFR increased with viremia, V, from 21\% (95\% CI
   16\%-27\%) for low viremia (V < 10(4.4) copies/ml) to 53\% (95\% CI
   44\%-61\%) for intermediate viremia (10(4.4) <= V < 10(5.2) copies/ml)
   and 81\% (95\% CI 75\%-87\%) for high viremia (V >= 10(5.2) copies/ml).
   Compared to adults (15-44 y old {[}y. o.]), the CFR was larger in young
   children (0-4 y.o.) (odds ratio {[}OR]: 2.44; 95\% CI 1.02-5.86) and
   older adults (>= 45 y.o.) (OR: 2.84; 95\% CI 1.81-4.46) but lower in
   children (5-14 y.o.) (OR: 0.46; 95\% CI 0.24-0.86). An order of
   magnitude increase in mean viremia in cases after July 2014 compared to
   those before coincided with a 14\% increase in the CFR. Our findings
   come from a large hospital-based study in Conakry and may not be
   generalizable to settings with different case profiles, such as with
   individuals who never sought care.
   Conclusions
   Viremia in EVD patients was a strong predictor of death that partly
   explained variations in CFR in the study population. This study provides
   baseline CFRs by viremia group, which allow appropriate adjustment when
   estimating efficacy in treatment studies. In randomized controlled
   trials, stratifying analysis on viremia groups could reduce sample size
   requirements by 25\%. We hypothesize that monitoring the viremia of
   hospitalized patients may inform the ability of surveillance systems to
   detect EVD patients from the different severity strata.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate clinical and radiological features of IgG4-related
   disease (IgG4-RD) patients with intrathoracic involvement. A prospective
   cohort study was performed and IgG4-RD patients were enrolled from
   January 2011 to March 2015 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital, in
   which the clinical and radiological characteristics of IgG4-RD patients
   with intrathoracic involvement were summarized.
   Out of total 248 cases with IgG4-RD, 87 cases had intrathoracic lesions,
   including 58 male cases and 29 female cases, with average age of 54.19
   +/- 13.80 years. Hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy were the most
   common manifestations of IgG4-related intrathoracic disease, accounting
   for 52.9\% (46/87). Other imaging findings of pulmonary disease
   included: solid nodular (25.3\%), round-shaped ground-glass opacities
   (9.2\%), alveolar-interstitial type (20.7\%), bronchovascular type
   (23.0\%), pleural effusion (4.6\%), and pleural nodules or thickening
   (16.1\%). Only 27 patients presented with respiratory symptoms,
   including cough, breathless, chest pain, and asthma. Compared with
   patients without intrathoracic disease, IgG4-related intrathoracic
   disease had higher IgG4 and C-reactive protein level, and higher
   incidence of allergy, fever, and multi-organ involvement. Most of lung
   interstitial disease, mediastinal mass, and bronchial thickening were
   sensitive to corticosteroid and immunosuppressant therapy, while 36.3\%
   (8/22) of solitary nodular lesions were unresponsive to treatment. Eight
   patients were on no treatment, with 5 cases remained stable, 2 patients
   improved spontaneously, and 1 patient was lost follow-up.
   Intrathoracic lesions are not rare in patients with IgG4-RD, involving
   bronchial thickening, nodules, ground glass opacity, pleural
   thickening/effusion, lymphadenopathy, etc. Efficacy of corticosteroid
   and immunosuppressant therapy were noted in most of patients with lung
   interstitial disease, mediastinal mass, and bronchial thickening.}},

   group; 25 patients), according to a parallel group design in one centre.
   Bone-to-implant gaps were filled with an algae-derived bone substitute.
   Four months after socket preservation, delayed implants were placed.
   Implants inserted with an insertion torque of at least 35 Ncm were
   immediately loaded with non-occluding provisional single crowns, then
   replaced, after 4 months, by definitive crowns. Patients were followed
   up to 1 year after loading. Outcome measures were implant failures,
   complications, aesthetics assessed using the pink esthetic score (PES),
   pen-implant marginal bone level changes and patient satisfaction,
   recorded by blinded assessors.
   Results: Nine (36\%) implants were not immediately loaded in the
   immediate group versus 19 (76\%) implants in the delayed placement
   group, because an insertion torque superior to 35 Ncm could not be
   obtained, the difference being statistically significant (difference =
   -0.40, 95\% CI: -0.652 to -0.148, P = 0.010). Two patients dropped out 4
   months after loading in the delayed group versus none in the immediate
   group. Two implants failed in the immediate group (8\%) versus none in
   the delayed group, with the difference showing no statistical
   significance (considering 25 and 23 patients, the difference in
   proportions was 8\% favouring the delayed group, 95\% Cl: -8.4 to 26.0,
   P = 0.490). Three minor complications occurred in the immediate group
   and two in the delayed group, and this was not statistically significant
   (considering 25 and 23 patients, the difference in proportions was 3.3\%
   favouring the delayed group, 95\% Cl: -18.2 to 24.0, P = 1.000). At
   delivery of definitive crowns, 4 months after loading, the mean
   aesthetic score was 12.42 and 12.28 in the immediate and delayed groups,
   respectively. At 1 year after loading, the mean aesthetic score was
   12.78 and 12.22 in the immediate and delayed groups, respectively. There
   were no statistically significant differences at 4 months (P = 0.666)
   and at 1 year (P = 0.090). Marginal bone levels at implant insertion
   (after bone grafting) were 0.01 mm for immediate and 0.06 mm for delayed
   implants, which showed a statistically significant difference (mean
   difference = -0.04; 95\% CI: -0.08 to -0.01; P = 0.009). One year after
   loading, patients of the immediate group lost on average 0.13 mm
   marginal bone and those in the delayed group lost 0.19 mm, however the
   difference was not statistically significant (mean difference = 0.05;
   95\% Cl: -0.002 to 0.110; P = 0.06). All patients were fully satisfied,
   both for function and aesthetics, and would undergo the same procedure
   again at 4 months as well as at 1 year after loading.
   Conclusions: No significant differences were observed between the two
   procedures, although the only two implant failures were for immediate
   post-extractive implants. It seems more difficult to obtain an implant
   insertion torque superior to 35 Ncm in sockets preserved with
   algae-derived bone substitute after a 4-month healing period than at
   immediate post-extractive sites.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports a simple synthesis of a mesoporous ordered silica
   structure (MCM-41) grown up around pre-synthesized maghemite
   nanoparticles. A composite with magnetic response and high specific
   surface area was obtained adding maghemite nanoparticles coated with
   oleic acid in the synthesis gel of MCM-41 and finally calcining in air.
   Different characterizations techniques such as magnetic measurements,
   Mossbauer spectroscopy at 25 and -260 degrees C and transmission
   electron microscopy were used to study the magnetic and structural
   changes of the initial maghemite nanoparticles produced during its
   coverage with the mesoporous silica structure. The presence of the
   mesoporous structure inhibits the expected transformation from maghemite
   to hematite when the system was calcined in air at 510 degrees C. It was
   established that a sintering of the nanoparticles during the calcination
   step occurs, leading to a magnetization saturation value similar to that
   of the bulk compound. In order to evaluate the capability as adsorbent,
   the magnetic composite was subjected to a surface
   amino-functionalization and then tested for Cr(VI) and Cu(II) adsorption
   from water. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights

Abstract = {{Purpose: Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of death among gynaecological
   malignancies. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and
   interleukin-10 (IL-10) are cytokines in the tumour microenvironment and
   may play critical roles in immune suppression. This study highlights
   these roles and immunosuppressive functions in epithelial ovarian cancer
   (EOC).
   Methods: TGF-beta 1 and IL-10 expression was compared in malignant,
   benign, and borderline cancerous tissues and tumour-free tissue by
   immunohistochemistry. Relationships among the levels of these cytokines,
   correlation of expression level with EOC prognosis, and cytokine
   involvement in immunosuppression were investigated.
   Results: Immunohistochemical analysis of TGF-beta 1 and IL-10 in
   epithelial cells showed the presence of epithelial, borderline, and
   benign ovarian tumour growth, and normal ovarian growth. TGF-beta 1 (P =
   0.121), residual tumour after surgery (P = 0.231) and standard
   chemotherapy (P = 0.121) were prognostic factors for EOC. There were no
   significant differences in clinicopathologic factors between specimens
   expressing TGF-beta 1 at low and high levels, indicating that TGF-beta 1
   is an independent factor in EOC diagnosis. Higher concentrations of
   TGF-beta 1 (1754.690 +/- 3416.487 pg/ml) and IL-10 (2731.7101 +/- 6.1613
   pg/ml) were observed in A2780-conditioned than in control medium.
   Conclusion: TGF-beta 1 and IL-10 play pivotal roles in EOC and can lead
   to immune evasion. Targeting these cytokines for tumour treatment,
   specifically at early stages, may prevent tumour progression.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the thermoeconomic multi-objective optimization, simultaneously
   considering exergy efficiency and levelized energy cost (LEC), the
   thermoeconomic comparisons between pure and mixture working fluids of
   organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) have been investigated. Four models are
   proposed based on the different location of evaporating bubble point
   temperature or condensing dew point temperature for mixture working
   fluids. The effects of mass fraction and four key parameters (evaporator
   temperature, condenser temperature, pinch point temperature difference
   and degree of superheat) on exergy efficiency and levelized energy cost
   (LEC) are examined. Pareto-optimal solutions of four models using
   0.7R245fa/0.3R227ea are obtained and compared. Taking mass fraction into
   account, the thermoeconomic comparisons between pure and mixture working
   fluids have been studied. Research demonstrates that the mixtures don't
   always present better thermodynamic performance and economic performance
   than pure working fluids. Model 2 (T-7 = T-E, T-3 = T-C) is the
   favorable operation condition for its highest thermodynamic performance
   and relatively low economic factor. Taking mass fraction as decision
   variable, Pareto-optimal solutions for models 1, 2,3 and 4 in pairs of
   (exergy efficiency (\%), LEC (\$/kW h)) are (56.71, 0.188), (57.67,
   0.192), (57.11, 0.194), and (56.91, 0.192), respectively. Compared with
   pure working fluids, the mixture working fluids present better exergy
   efficiency but worse LEC except model 1. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{High-pressure pipeline transportation is one of the key technologies to
   connect remote gas fields and deliver gas at competitive prices to
   consumer markets. Arctic regions will become more attractive in the near

   climatic contrast between northern and southern parts of mainland
   Portugal is presented, namely the regions of Beira Alta and Alentejo.
   Additionally, it discusses the contribution of different
   climate-responsive strategies developed in vernacular architecture from
   both regions to assure thermal comfort conditions. In Beira Alta, the
   use of glazed balconies as a strategy to capture solar gains is usual,
   while in Alentejo the focus is on passive cooling strategies. To
   understand the effectiveness of these strategies, thermal performances
   and comfort conditions of two case studies were evaluated based on the
   adaptive comfort model. Field tests included measurement of hygrothermal
   parameters and surveys on occupants' thermal sensation. From the
   results, it has been found that the case studies have shown a good
   thermal performance by passive means alone and that the occupants feel
   comfortable, except during winter where there is the need to use simple
   heating systems.}},

Abstract = {{Manipulations in metabolic parameters during pregnancy/lactation can
   impact the development of shortand long-term energy control mechanisms,
   which are mainly modulated by neural and hormonal inputs to the
   hypothalamus. Thus, we tested how mice training and detraining during
   pregnancy and lactation affect hypothalamus gene expression and change
   biometric and metabolic profiles of the offspring. Three-month-old
   female Swiss mice were submitted to an 8-week exercise program (swimming
   5 times/week, 1 h/day). Following this physical exercise protocol, these
   conditioned animals and the control group were submitted to matting.
   After pregnancy verification, the animals were distributed into four
   groups: training during pregnancy and lactation (T); detraining after
   pregnancy confirmation (DP); detraining during lactation (DL); and
   control (CT), without interventions. After weaning, the offspring of the
   four groups were derived into these as follows: TO, DPO, DLO, and CTO,
   respectively. The body weight was lower in conditioned females compared
   to control at weeks 4-8 of the exercise regimen. No statistical
   difference in dam's body weight was observed during pregnancy. Related
   to offspring, at post-natal day 90, the animals were euthanized and DPO
   and DLO showed decrease in Npy and Cart expression in hypothalamus, and
   DLO also had increased Lep gene expression in white adipose tissue.
   Additionally, DPO showed increase in plasma triglycerides levels, total
   liver weight, and decrease in brown adipose tissue compared to CTO.
   Together, these results support that detraining during critical periods
   of development leads to altered gene expression in hypothalamic
   neuropeptidergic systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyse and compare the impact of the choice of the
   release method in a hybrid make-to-order (MTO)-finish-to-order (FTO)
   production system composed of two stages. The study is motivated by a
   practical problem from the aluminium profiles manufacturing industry,
   where for shortening throughput times it is allowed to start production
   of standard and regular items without confirmed orders, holding a stock
   of semi-finished products. The first stage manufactures both, items to
   order and items to a stock of semi-finished products, while the second
   stage is a customization stage based on customer demand requests and
   specifications. The paper addresses the questions of where order release
   control should be exercised, i.e., at only one stage or at both stages,
   and when should it be exercised. Simulation results suggest that
   load-based order release can be successfully applied to this hybrid
   production system when combined with a replenishment control policy for
   semi-finished products. Load-based order release contributes to reduce
   the total throughput time and the percentage of tardy orders of both,
   MTO and FTO, while contributing to a reduction of the semi-finished
   products inventory levels required to achieve a given fill rate. The
   study is a contribution toward the alignment of workload control theory
   to industrial practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The zebrafish is increasingly utilized in biomedical and
   psychopharmacological research aimed at modeling human brain disorders.
   Abnormal social behavior represents the core symptom of several
   neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The zebrafish is a
   highly social species and has been proposed for modeling such disorders.
   Behavioral paradigms that can induce zebrafish social behavior are of
   importance. Here, we utilize a paradigm in which zebrafish are presented
   with computer animated images of conspecifics. We systematically varied
   the size of these images relative to the body size of the experimental
   fish and also investigated the potential effect of presenting different
   number of images in an attempt to optimize the paradigm. We report that
   images similar in size to the experimental fish induced a strong
   shoaling response (reduction of distance to the image presentation
   screen) both when the body size of the experimental fish was varied with
   the image size being held constant and when the image size was varied
   with the body size of the experimental fish being held constant. We also
   report that within the number range studied (from 1 to 8 conspecific
   stimulus fish), presentation of all animated shoals, but the image of a
   single conspecific stimulus fish, led to significant reduction of
   distance to the presentation screen. We conclude that the shoal image
   presentation paradigm induces robust social responses that are
   quantifiable in an automated manner, making the paradigm useful for
   screening of drugs and/or mutations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To report two new cases of IgG4-related retroperitoneal

   METHODS: We analyze two cases diagnosed in our center and performed a
   literature review.
   RESULT IgG4 related disease is a recently described entity that includes
   previously not related pathologies. The clinical manifestations are
   highly variable and its presentation is usually subacute. The treatment
   of choice is glucocorticoids. In our first case the outcome was
   favorable with corticosteroids and azathioprine. However, the second
   case required surgery on 2 occasions with radical nephrectomy. The
   diagnosis of the latter was made nine years after the onset of symptoms
   when the biopsy was reviewed; at that moment immunosuppressive therapy
   was not started.
   CONCLUSIONS: It is very important to know and diagnose this disease
   because of the good response to treatment that prevents complications.}},

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The use of Chlorella vulgaris Beijerinck as a food source for
   zooplankton requires the optimization of algal-culture conditions for
   prolonged growth maintenance. In this study, we developed a method that
   relates algal density to culture turbidity to estimate culture biomass.
   This method was improved by applying digital analysis for algal
   counting, which promotes accuracy, low culture disturbance, easy
   repetition and the rapid acquisition of results. Two 3-L cultures of C.
   vulgaris, maintained for two weeks with continuous lighting (eight
   light-emitting diodes at 50 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), at 660 nm) and
   aerators to prevent algal sedimentation, reached turbidities of 214 and
   280 NTUs, respectively. Sample counting was performed using digital
   images obtained with an inverted microscope. Aliquot sedimentation was
   compared with or without previous homogenization through photographs
   taken in the central, middle, and peripheral sectors of the Utermohl
   settling chambers. For each procedure, we counted between 17 and 404
   individuals image(-1), requiring, on average, one minute image. At low
   turbidity (<40 NTU), the data dispersion was similar between the two
   protocols (error range, 16 to 60 \%); at higher turbidity, the direct
   sedimentation alone gave a larger error (31-50 \%) than with prior
   homogenization (5-13 \%). Regression analysis at low data fit (67 \%)
   suggested that the sedimentation heterogeneity of non-homogenized
   samples corresponded to a pattern of settled algae having increasing
   density from the periphery to the centre of the chamber, but with
   homogenization, a better model fitting (99 \%) resulted, contributing to
   greater consistency with that procedure. We consider that this
   turbidometric protocol could be used successfully with cultures of algae
   that have geometrical shapes recognizable by the image software.}},

Abstract = {{The profusely employed drugs Piroxicam (Piro), Tenoxicam (Teno) and
   Meloxicam (Melo) belonging to the nonsteroidal andinflammatory drug
   (NSAID) family of the Oxicams (Oxis) were studied in the frame of two
   specific conditions: (a) their ROS scavenging ability, in relation to a
   possible biological antioxidant action and (b) their photodegradability
   under environmental conditions, in the context of Oxi-contaminated
   waters.
   Singlet molecular oxygen (O-2((1)Delta(g))) and superoxide radical anion
   (O-2(center dot-)) were photogenerated through Riboflavin (Rf, vitamin
   B2)-photosensitization in aqueous and aqueous-methanolic solutions in
   the presence of Oxi concentrations in the range 50-500 mu M. The
   visible-light absorber vitamin is currently present in all types of
   natural waters and constitutes the most frequent endogenous
   photosensitizer in mammals. Hence, it was employed in order to mimic
   both natural sceneries of interest.
   All three Oxis quench O-2((1)Delta(g)) with rate constants in the order
   of 10(8) M-1 S-1 showing a significant photodegradation efficiency given
   by a dominant reactive fashion for deactivation of the oxidative
   species. Although this is not a desirable property in the context of
   photoprotection upon prolonged photoirradiation, constitutes in fact a
   promissory aspect for the degradation NSAIDs, in waste waters. Indirect
   evidence indicates that Melo is also oxidized through a O-2(center
   dot-)-mediated component.
   The simultaneous presence of Piro plus tryptophan or tyrosine under
   Rf-photosensitizing conditions, which has taken the amino acids as
   photooxidizable model residues in a proteinaceous environment, indicates
   that the NSAID induces a protection of the biomolecules against
   photodynamic degradation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Transracial adoptees represent a specific group of immigrants who
   experience unique immigration processes that bring them face-to-face
   with two cultural backgrounds: that of their heritage culture on one
   hand and that of their national culture on the other hand. However,
   there is a scarcity of studies focused on the way these processes unfold
   within adoptive families. This study was aimed at exploring how
   transracial adoptees cope with the construction of their ethnic
   identity. Administering a self-report questionnaire to 127 transracial
   adoptees and their mothers, for a total of 254 participants, we first
   investigated the association between mothers' cultural socialisation
   (enculturation and preparation for bias strategies) and adoptees' ethnic
   identity (i.e. ethnic identity exploration and ethnic identity
   affirmation dimensions). We then investigated whether ethnic identity
   affects self-esteem by testing the hypothesis that national identity
   moderates the relationship between ethnic identity and self-esteem.
   Results revealed that mothers' enculturation (but not their preparation
   for bias) supported adoptees' ethnic identity exploration, which in turn
   was positively associated with ethnic identity affirmation. Moreover, we
   confirmed the moderation effect: ethnic identity affirmation.}},

Abstract = {{Large body of epidemiological evidence showed strong correlation between
   heart rate and total or cardiovascular (CV) mortality. These data do
   not, however, clarify the role of increased heart rate in CV disease,
   basically because they do not distinguish whether increased heart rate
   is a risk marker or a risk factor. The distinction is relevant for
   therapeutic value, since if it is the cause-or one of the causes-of the
   disease and its progression; its reduction corresponds to a prognostic
   benefit. Ivabradine, a selective heart rate-lowering agent, provides an
   opportunity to assess the effects of lowering heart rate without
   directly altering other aspects of cardiac function. Experimental and
   clinical data with ivabradine illustrate important therapeutic benefits
   resulted from this therapy-improvement in coronary perfusion (myocardial
   perfusion, collateral coronary flow) and cardiac efficiency (improvement
   in LV function, reversing of remodelling). For this reason,
   consideration of the `Ivabradine journey' is particularly relevant, not
   only to establish its therapeutic role in treating different
   manifestations of the CV continuum but also to establish the role of
   heart rate in this continuum. Results of SHIFT trial demonstrated that
   an increased heart rate actively contributes to the outcome as a risk
   factor, and selective heart rate reduction with ivabradine provides a
   prognostic benefit. In patients with angina, heart rate is a major
   determinant of ischaemia and myocardial perfusion time; therefore, heart
   rate reduction is an integral part of antianginal therapy. In setting of
   stable coronary artery disease without LVSD, the results of SIGNIfY
   helped to determine that an elevated heart rate is a risk marker and its
   reduction does not improve the outcome while improving the symptoms of
   angina.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the role of metrology in healthcare facilities, a study was
   performed among Portuguese hospitals to identify and analyze issues
   concerning the concept of metrological traceability. The discussion is
   structured around a dataset obtained from a survey questionnaire
   covering 44 public and private Portuguese hospitals. The principal
   results of our analysis include identifying some key indicators that
   apply to certified/accredited hospitals. Test reports and calibration
   certificates were the main metrological traceability documents required
   by the hospitals. The acquisition of medical measuring instruments with
   conformity reports depended on the type of hospital. Maintenance was
   considered the most relevant issue for private hospitals, whereas for
   the public hospitals, this issue is less important than trust in the
   supplier. For public hospitals, purchase price was the most important
   requirement. For hospitals that acquire calibrated measuring
   instruments, only 50 \% perform in-house calibration. We conclude that
   trust in supplier is associated with a lower overall budget for
   maintenance operations. The protocol established by hospitals to acquire
   measurement instruments does not reflect metrological concerns, and the
   relationship between maintenance and metrological operation is not well
   established. Thus, we conclude that metrological traceability is largely
   absent in the daily considerations of healthcare professionals and
   facilities.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Recent research indicates that atrophic nonunions are
   biologically active and may heal in the optimal biomechanical
   environment.
   Methods: Thirty-three patients with mobile atrophic and oligotrophic
   tibial nonunions were treated with circular external fixation and
   functional rehabilitation. Seven patients required autogenous bone graft
   procedures.
   Results: Bony union was achieved after the initial surgery in 31/33
   (93.9\%) tibias. Two persistent nonunions were successfully treated with
   repeat circular external fixation without bone graft. This resulted in
   final bony union in 33/33 (100\%) patients.
   Conclusion: Mechanobiological stimulation of tibial nonunions can
   produce union even if the biological activity appears to be low. (C)

Abstract = {{The use of DNA databases has proved decisive in many types of criminal
   investigations. In sexual assaults and rapes, DNA databases and evidence
   may play a very important role in the investigations and in the
   identification of the perpetrators. In Brazil, until 2012 and 2013 there
   was no legislation regarding DNA databases of suspected perpetrators or
   convicted individuals. As there was no legislation concerning this
   subject and due to the need for solving crimes related to sexual
   assaults, the Instituto de Pesquisa de DNA Forense da Policia Civil do
   Distrito Federal (Forensic DNA Research Institute of Federal District
   Civil Police) in Brasilia, created in 1998, a DNA database of evidence
   collected in sexual-assaults cases to aid criminal investigations. The
   aim of this study is to demonstrate the successful experience of our
   Institute in aiding criminal investigations to solve sexual assaults
   cases and to identify perpetrators using this kind of DNA database.
   Forensic scientists using a DNA database of evidence from sexual

Abstract = {{Based on radiobiology evidence, hypofractionated radiotherapy has the
   potential of improving treatment outcome in prostate cancer patients. In
   this study, we evaluated the safety, in terms of acutetoxicity, of using
   moderate hypofractionated radiotherapy delivered with Helical
   Tomotherapy (HT) to treat prostate cancer patients.
   Between December 2012 and April 2014, 42 consecutive patients were
   treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy using HT. All patients
   received 70 Gy in 28 fractions to PTV1, which included the prostate. In
   the intermediate risk group, 61.6 Gy were delivered to PTV2, which
   included the seminal vesicles. In high risk patients, the pelvic nodes
   were added (PTV3) and received 50.4 Gy. Acute toxicity was recorded
   prospectively with RTOG and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
   Events 3.0, retrospectively with CTCAE 4.0. Expanded Prostate Cancer
   Index Composite (EPIC) was measured at baseline and 3 months after end
   of treatment, to investigate health related quality of life with regards
   to bladder and gastrointestinal function.
   Acute toxicity was acceptable, independently from the system used to
   score side effects. Moderate genitourinary toxicity was more frequent
   than gastrointestinal toxicity. No correlation between acute side
   effects and patients' characteristics or physical dose parameters was
   registered. EPIC evaluation showed a negligible difference in urinary
   and bowel function post-treatment, that did not reach statistical
   significance.
   Our experience confirms the safety of moderate hypofractionation
   delivered with HT in prostate cancer patients with low, intermediate and
   high risk.}},

Abstract = {{Moral judgments and decisions are accompanied by specific patterns of
   attention, which can be indicative for the underlying cognitive
   processes. In this opinion paper we address methodological, theoretical
   and empirical issues concerning the relation between attention and
   morality. First, we discuss potential advantages of using measures of
   attention based on eye-tracking to investigate processes of judgment and
   choice in general and concerning morality in particular. Second, we
   review empirical studies and identify regularities concerning attention
   patterns in moral judgments. Third, taking into account these findings
   we provide suggestions for the development and testing of more detailed
   and better formalized cognitive process models for moral behavior based
   on interactive activation and parallel constraint satisfaction
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined changes in utilization of medical staff within

   disorder (SUD) at two points in time (2007 and 2010). Utilization was
   calculated as the number of hours paid weekly for psychiatrists,
   physicians, nurses, and other medical staff working as employees or on
   contract. Study data come from a longitudinal national sample of 274
   substance use disorder treatment centers. Average utilization of medical
   staff by these SUD treatment organizations increased by 26\% from 2007
   to 2010. The results showed that growing SUD treatment centers that
   obtained more referrals from health care providers, used case managers
   to coordinate comprehensive approaches to patient care, provided
   medication assisted treatment (MAT), and that were connected more
   closely with hospitals made increased use of medical staff over the
   2007-2010 period. In 2010, these organizations seem to have been moving

Abstract = {{Introduction The aim of our study was to investigate the relation of
   workload on range of motion and isometric strength of team handball
   athletes' shoulders over a competitive season.
   31 Professional male handball athletes underwent clinical shoulder
   examinations. Athletes were examined subsequently during the complete
   playing season (week 0, 6, 22 and 40) to determine bilateral isometric
   shoulder rotational strength and active range of motion (ROM). In
   addition, relative (intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and
   absolute (standard error of measurement) reliability were calculated.
   Intraobserver reliability was excellent (ICC 0.76-0.98) for isometric
   strength and flexibility measurements. Internal rotation (IR) and total
   arc ROM in the throwing shoulder (TS) decreased significantly (p < 0.05)
   in both sequences (week 22 to week 40, week 0 to week 40). External
   rotation (ER) ROM and isometric strength in IR and ER did not change
   significantly. Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) and
   external rotation gain (ERG) of the TS decreased significantly between
   week 22 and week 40, but both did not change overall (week 0 to week
   40). There was significant influence on IR ROM (week 22 to week 40) and
   strength in ER (week 0 to week 40) in the non-throwing shoulder.
   Several characteristics of handball players' shoulders changed
   significantly from the beginning to the end of a season. More
   specifically, the repetitive forces accumulated during the competitive
   season resulted in altered GIRD, ERG and isometric strength of the
   dominant glenohumeral joint.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with drug-seeking behavior can be both labor and resource
   intensive to the emergency department (ED).
   Objective: To determine the effectiveness of ED care plans for
   individuals at high risk for drug-seeking behavior on ED visits.
   Methods: A retrospective, cohort observational study.
   Location: A suburban teaching hospital with an annual census of 80,000
   patients. The number of ED visits was determined 1 year before and 2
   subsequent years following care plan initiation.
   Exclusion criteria: Unclaimed letter, incomplete data, and/or
   non-drug-seeking care plan.
   Statistics: Two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test with significance of P
   < .05.
   Results: Sixty patients were enrolled and 7 were excluded, leaving 53
   patients for analysis. Mean annual visits before care plan initiation
   were 7.6 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 6.3-9.1). One year following
   implementation, mean visits decreased to 2.3 (95\% CI, 1.5-3.1) (P <=
   .0001). Two years following implementation, mean visits continued to
   decline to 1.5 (95\% CI, 0.9-2.1) (P <= .0001). A significant reduction

Abstract = {{Background: Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy may lead to heart failure in
   stressful circumstances, such as after transjugular intrahepatic
   portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement.
   Aim: To examine whether acute volume expansion predicts haemodynamic
   changes after TIPS and elicits signs of impending heart failure.
   Methods: We prospectively evaluated refractory ascites patients (group
   A) and compensated cirrhotics (group B), who underwent echocardiography,
   NT-proBNP measurement, and heart catheterization before and after volume
   load; group A repeated measurements after TIPS.
   Results: 15 patients in group A (80\% male; 54 +/- 12.4 years) and 8 in
   group B (100\% male; 56 +/- 6.2 years) were enrolled. Echocardiography
   disclosed diastolic dysfunction in 30\% and 12.5\%, respectively. In
   group A, volume load and TIPS induced a significant increase in right
   atrial, mean pulmonary, capillary wedge pressure and cardiac index, and
   a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (respectively, 4.7 +/- 2.8
   vs. 9.9 +/- 3.6 mmHg; 13.3 +/- 3.5 vs. 21.9 +/- 5.9 mmHg; 8.3 +/- 3.4
   vs. 15.4 +/- 4.7 mmHg; 3.7 +/- 0.7 vs. 4.6 +/- 1 lt/min/m(2); 961 +/-
   278 vs. 767 +/- 285 dyn s cm(-5); and 10.1 +/- 3.3 vs. 14.2 +/- 3.4
   mmHg; 17.5 +/- 4 vs. 25.2 +/- 4.2 mmHg; 12.3 +/- 4 vs. 19.3 +/- 3.4

   199 dyn s cm(-5), p < 0.001 for all pairs). At 24 h, cardiopulmonary
   pressures returned towards baseline.
   Conclusions: Acute volume expansion predicted haemodynamic changes
   immediately after TIPS. All patients had adequate haemodynamic
   adaptation to TIPS; none developed signs of heart failure. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{The capacity of organizations to share knowledge is seen as a source of
   competitive advantage in many industries. Knowledge sourcing and
   knowledge reuse have been indicated as important enablers of
   organizational efficiency and innovation performance. Although firms may
   own valuable knowledge, the presence of barriers to knowledge sourcing
   and reuse may hinder the exploitation of such knowledge. The present
   study explores the barriers to knowledge sourcing and reuse from
   electronic repository and their implications within the virtual product
   prototyping stage of new products development. The study is based on 24
   interviews with research and development (R\&D) employees of a large
   supplier of R\&D in the automotive sector. Results demonstrate that the
   poor operational quality of a repository hinders knowledge sourcing;
   thereby, people prefer sourcing knowledge from other colleagues rather
   than from the repository. Moreover, the inefficiencies in knowledge
   sourcing from a repository, the poor quality of the codified knowledge
   and its complexity affect the reuse of existing knowledge. This study
   reveals that knowledge sourcing and knowledge reuse can affect the time
   performance in the virtual product prototype development process.}},

   chemical approaches (SEM/EDS/WDS, XRD, micro-Raman spectroscopy, pore
   water analysis, chemical extraction techniques and thermodynamic
   PHREEQC-2 modeling), we documented the mineralogical/geochemical
   characteristics of the dumped arsenopyrite-rich material and
   environmental stability of the newly formed secondary minerals. A
   distinct mineralogical zonation was found (listed based on the distance
   from the decomposed arsenopyrite): scorodite (locally associated with
   native sulfur pseudomorphs) plus amorphous ferric arsenate
   (AFA/pitticite), kankite, As-bearing ferric (hydr)oxides and jarosite.
   Ferric arsenates and ferric (hydr)oxides were found to dissolve and
   again precipitate from downward migrating As-rich solutions cementing
   rock fragments. Acidic pore water (pH 3.8) has elevated concentrations
   of As with an average value of about 2.9 mg L-1. Aqueous As is highly
   correlated with pH (R-2 = 0.97, p < 0.001) indicating that incongruent
   dissolution of ferric arsenates controls dissolved As well as the pH of
   the percolating waste solution. Arsenic released from the dissolution of
   ferric arsenates into the porewater is, however, trapped by latter and
   lower-down precipitating jarosite and especially ferric (hydr)oxides.
   The efficiency of As sequestration by ferric (hydr)oxides in the waste
   dump and underlying soil has been found to be very effective, suggesting
   limited environmental impact of the mine waste dump on the surrounding
   soil ecosystems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An expression for the pressure filed of a gas flowing in a vertical well
   is derived. It is assumed that the ascending flow regime changes from
   laminar to turbulent one at a certain depth due to increasing flow
   velocity at the expense of decreasing density. Results of solving the
   stationary nonlinear problem on the gas pressure distribution along the
   active well bore are presented. The flow is considered to be subsonic.
   The solution is expressed in the form of an implicit pressure dependence
   on the vertical coordinate. A program has been developed and
   calculations have been performed of the dependence of the pressure
   gradient on the gas velocity and the pressure field versus the
   coordinate along the well bore.}},

Abstract = {{Phenology is an important dimension of vertebrate reproductive
   strategies. Characterizing a species' reproductive phenology is a
   fundamental step in directing studies of influences on reproduction
   within and among populations throughout its range. Eastern
   Diamond-Backed Rattlesnakes (Crotalus adamanteus; EDBs) are endemic
   predators of the imperiled longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem of
   the southeastern United States, and the species currently is under
   review for listing under the Endangered Species Act. Conservation and
   management of this imperiled species will greatly benefit from research
   on its basic biology, and particularly from information that will assist
   management for adult survival and population viability. Here, we present
   long-term data on EDB breeding and reproductive phenology from several
   populations in the South Carolina Coastal Plain. We summarized the
   phenology of EDB breeding and reproduction using observations of
   free-ranging, radiotelemetered rattlesnakes in South Carolina from 1997
   to 2011. Breeding activity occurred from 10 July to 14 October, with a
   mean of 28 August. There was one outlying observation of spring breeding
   (18 March). Females moved to birthing sites as early as 26 June and as
   late as 28 August, with a mean of 15 August. Neonates were born around
   31 August, with birth dates between 10 August and 14 September. We also
   noted six unique observations of apparent clutch size: 8, 10, 11, 11,
   12, and 13 neonates. This information will contribute both to our
   current knowledge and conservation efforts of EDBs, and also facilitate
   future long-term comparative investigations throughout their geographic
   range.}},

Abstract = {{Therapeutic Assessment can be helpful to many types of couples,
   including (1) those who are considering marriage and wish to know each
   other more deeply, (2) long-term couples who are in distress and
   considering separating, and (3) couples who have decided to separate but
   wish to better understand why they were unable to stay together. This
   article comprises the first complete case study of Therapeutic
   Assessment (TA) with couples. I describe how those steps common to all
   forms of TA (initial sessions, extended inquiries, assessment
   intervention sessions, and summary/discussion sessions) differ when
   applied to couples. I also discuss the use of the Consensus Rorschach as
   an assessment intervention with long-term distressed couples engaged in
   problematic projective identification. The case example involves a young
   heterosexual couple married for 12 years who were at an impasse in
   couples therapy. The assessment helped the partners explore mutual
   conflicts around the expression of anger and dependency needs, and to
   resolve a power imbalance within the couple. Long-term follow-up showed
   that the Therapeutic Assessment helped the couple have more compassion
   for each other and move beyond the destructive role-lock they had fallen
   into. Also, the referring therapist reported that the TA helped resolve
   the impasse in the couples' therapy. (C) 2015 Societe francaise de

Abstract = {{Objective: Though the liver is frequently affected in myotonic dystrophy
   type1 and 2(DM1, DM2), non-alcoholic and non-hepatitic liver cirrhosis
   have not been reported as a manifestation of DM2.
   Clinical presentation and intervention: In a 52-year-old Caucasian male
   with DM2, the disease manifested as myopathy, mild myotonia, cataract,
   diabetes, erectile dysfunction, gastrointestinal dysmotility,
   dysarthria, mild myocardial thickening and non-alcoholic and
   non-hepatitic liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension and oesophageal
   varicosities since age 48 years. His 69-year-old sister, who carried a
   CCTG expansion of w300 in intron 1 of the CNBP/ZNF9 gene, also
   manifested in the liver with hyperbilirubinaemia, hepatopathy and
   hyperlipidaemia since age 48 years. Liver cirrhosis in the index patient
   was complicated by hyperamonemia, hepatic encephalopathy and flapping
   tremor.
   Conclusion: Rarely, DM2 may also manifest in the liver with elevated
   transaminases, steatosis or non-alcoholic, non-hepatitic liver cirrhosis
   with its common complications. In patients with cryptogenic
   non-alcoholic, non-hepatitic liver cirrhosis or cataract before age 50

Title = {{Life Cycle Assessment of Mixed Municipal Solid Waste: Multi-input versus
   multi-output perspective}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{599-611}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper analyses four strategies for managing the Mixed Municipal
   Solid Waste (MMSW) in terms of their environmental impacts and potential
   advantages by means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. To this
   aim, both a multi-input and a multi-output approach are applied to
   evaluate the effect of these perspectives on selected impact categories.
   The analyzed management options include direct landfilling with energy
   recovery (S-1), Mechanical-Biological Treatment (MBT) followed by
   Waste-to-Energy (WtE) conversion (S-2), a combination of an innovative
   MBT/MARSS (Material Advanced Recovery Sustainable Systems) process and
   landfill disposal (S-3), and finally a combination of the MBT/MARSS
   process with WtE conversion (S-4). The MARSS technology, developed
   within an European LIFE PLUS framework and currently implemented at
   pilot plant scale, is an innovative MBT plant having the main goal to
   yield a Renewable Refined Biomass Fuel (RRBF) to be used for combined
   heat and power production (CHP) under the regulations enforced for
   biomass-based plants instead of Waste-to-Energy systems, for increased
   environmental performance. The four scenarios are characterized by
   different resource investment for plant and infrastructure construction
   and different quantities of matter, heat and electricity recovery and
   recycling. Results, calculated per unit mass of waste treated and per
   unit exergy delivered, under both multi-input and multi-output LCA
   perspectives, point out improved performance for scenarios characterized
   by increased matter and energy recovery. Although none of the
   investigated scenarios is capable to provide the best performance in all
   the analyzed impact categories, the scenario S-4 shows the best LCA
   results in the human toxicity and freshwater eutrophication categories,
   i.e. the ones with highest impacts in all waste management processes.

   increased incidence of gender dysphoria (GD) and paraphilia in autism
   spectrum disorder.
   AimThe aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of (i) paraphilic
   fantasies and behaviors; and (ii) GD symptomatology in KS.
   Methods and Main Outcomes MeasuresA sample of 46 KS individuals and 43
   healthy male controls (HC) were evaluated. Subjects were studied by
   means of several psychometric tests, such as Autism Spectrum Quotient
   (AQ) and Reading the Mind in the Eyes Revised (RME) to measure autistic
   traits, Gender Identity/GD questionnaire (GIDYQ-AA), and Sexual
   Addiction Screening Test (SAST). In addition, body uneasiness
   psychopathological symptoms were assessed using Symptom Checklist 90
   Revised (SCL-90-R). The presence and frequency of any paraphilic fantasy
   and behavior was assessed by means of a clinical interview based on
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition
   criteria. Finally, all individuals included were assessed by Wechsler
   Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised to evaluate intelligence quotient (IQ).
   Data from a subsample of a previous published series of male to female
   GD individuals, with the battery of psychological measures useful to
   provide a psychopathological explanation of GD in KS population
   available, was also considered.
   ResultsWhen compared with HC, KS reported significantly lower total,
   verbal and performance IQ scores and higher SCL-90 obsession-compulsive
   symptoms (all P<0.001). In line with previously reported findings, KS
   showed higher autistic traits according with both RME and AQ tests
   (P<0.001). With respect to sexuality, KS showed a significant higher
   frequency of voyeuristic fantasies during masturbation (52.2\% vs.
   25.6\%) and higher SAST scores (P=0.012). A mediation role of obsessive
   symptoms on the relationship between Klinefelter and SAST was confirmed
   (unstandardized estimate b=2.75, standard error=0.43 P<0.001). Finally,
   KS individuals showed significantly higher gender dysphoric symptoms
   than HC (P=0.004), which were mediated by the presence of autistic
   traits (Sobel's test; P<0.05).
   ConclusionsKS is associated with hypersexuality, paraphilic behaviors,
   and GD, which were mediated by obsessive-compulsive and autistic traits.

Abstract = {{The concept of emerging risk has gained increasing attention in recent
   years. The term has an intuitive appeal and meaning but a consistent and
   agreed definition is missing. We perform an in-depth analysis of this
   concept, in particular its relation to black swan type of events, and
   show that these can be considered meaningful and complementary concepts
   by relating emerging risk to known unknowns and black swans to unknown
   knowns, unknown unknowns and a subset of known knowns. The former is
   consistent with saying that we face emerging risk related to an activity
   when the background knowledge is weak but contains indications/justified
   beliefs that a new type of event (new in the context of that activity)
   could occur in the future and potentially have severe consequences to
   something humans value. The weak background knowledge among other things
   results in difficulty specifying consequences and possibly also in fully
   specifying the event itself; i.e. in difficulty specifying scenarios.
   Here knowledge becomes the key concept for both emerging risk and black
   swan type of events, allowing for taking into consideration time
   dynamics since knowledge develops over time. Some implications of our
   findings in terms of risk assessment and risk management are pointed

   increased with increasing Agaviodeae extract concentration, however, the
   inhibition efficiency decreased with increasing temperature. The
   inhibitor was found to behave as a mixed-type inhibitor. The inhibition
   behavior has been associated with adsorption effects. In fact, the

   this paper, the surfaces of six selected samples were thoroughly
   investigated using various measuring techniques in order to verify the
   outcome of the novel manufacturing processes in terms of distinct levels
   as well as types of surface roughness. The aim of the evaluation was to
   capture surface structures in different wavelength intervals utilizing a
   confocal microscope, a coherence scanning interferometer, and an atomic
   force microscope. Power spectral density functions were also calculated
   from the measurements and used to determine suitability of techniques
   for different roughness scales. The measurements show that the expected
   surface characteristics as well as different RMS roughness values are
   intimately connected to the perceived glossiness.}},

   patients with a diagnosis of acute diverticulitis admitted to the
   Department of General and Emergency Surgery between 1 January 2009 and
   30 June 2014.
   Results: During the 66-month study period, 219 patients with acute
   diverticulitis attended our department; 69\% had simple diverticulitis
   (93\% were treated conservatively and 7\% surgically) and 31\% had
   complicated diverticulitis (76\% were treated surgically and 24\%
   conservatively). Of the patients who were treated surgically, 62.5\%
   underwent primary resection with anastomosis, 31.94\% Hartmann's
   procedure, and 5.56\% laparoscopic lavage and drainage.
   Conclusions: Our cases and a careful review of the literature allowed us
   to develop a decision-making algorithm for patients with acute
   diverticulitis.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. We describe the national dissemination of an evidence-based
   community cardiovascular disease prevention program for midlife and
   older women using the RE-AIM (reach effectiveness adoption
   implementation maintenance) framework and share key lessons learned
   during translation.
   Methods. In a 2010 to 2014 collaboration between the Strong Women
   program and the National Extension Association of Family and Consumer
   Sciences, we assessed reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance
   using survey methods, and we assessed effectiveness using a
   pretest-posttest within-participants design, with weight change as the
   primary outcome.
   Results. Overall reach into the population was 15 per 10 000. Of 85
   trained leaders, 41 (48\%) adopted the program. During the 12-week
   intervention, weight decreased by 0.5 kilograms, fruit and vegetable
   intake increased by 2.1 servings per day, and physical activity
   increased by 1238 metabolic equivalent (MET)minutes per week (all P <
   .001). Average fidelity score was 4.7 (out of possible 5). Eleven of 41
   adopting leaders (27\%) maintained the program.
   Conclusions. The Strong Women-Healthy Hearts program can be implemented
   with high fidelity in a variety of settings while remaining effective.
   These data provide direction for program modification to improve impact
   as dissemination continues.}},

   in 100 \% (6/6), HAV in 66.6 \% (4/6), and RVA in 66.6 \% (4/6). In
   network water, HAdV was detected in 100 \% (6/6) of the samples (these
   83 \% contained infectious HAdV), although HAV and RVA were not detected
   and PCV2 was not evaluated. In groundwater from deep wells, during rainy
   period, HAdV and RVA were detected in 80 \% (4/5) of the samples, and
   HAV and PCV2 were not detected; however, during dry period, HAdV and RVA
   were detected in 60 \% (3/5), HAV in only one sample, and PCV2 in 60 \%
   (4/5). In groundwater, all samples contained infectious HAdV. PCV2
   presence in groundwater is indicative of contamination caused by swine
   manure in Concrdia, Santa Catarina, Brazil. The disinfection of human

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Plasma volume reduction (PVR) may reduce the risk of
   hemolysis associated with transfusion of plateletpheresis blood products
   (PLTs) containing ABO-incompatible plasma. But PVR may delay PLT issue.
   In collaboration with our blood donor center we evaluated an automated
   screen of PLT for high-titer ABO antibody and to apply PVR to high-titer
   PLTs.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: At the donor center, plasma from PLT donors
   was tested using an automated microplate system (PK7300, Beckman). PK
   settings were set for a detection cutoff equivalent to 1 in 256 using a
   manual tube method. The donors associated with high-titer PLTs were
   characterized by sex and age. In the transfusion service, the number of
   PVR procedures was evaluated before and after implementation of the
   high-titer screen.
   RESULTS: During validation, 157 of 1008 PLT units (15\%) were positive
   by the automated method versus 121 (12\%) by manual method. After
   implementation, 2112 of 15,240 PLT units were high-titer, with higher
   frequency in donations from females versus males (18\% vs. 12\%,
   p<0.0001). The PLT PVR rate was reduced by 50\%.
   CONCLUSION: Implementation of an automated method to screen PLTs for
   high-titer ABO antibody at the donor center improves the inventory
   management of PLTs containing ABO-incompatible plasma at the hospital
   transfusion service.}},

Abstract = {{Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the result of mutations in the cystic fibrosis
   transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CF-related diabetes affects
   50\% of adult CF patients. How CFTR deficiency predisposes to diabetes
   is unknown. Herein, we examined the impact of the most frequent cftr
   mutation in humans, deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (Delta
   F508), on glucose homeostasis in mice. We compared Delta F508 mutant
   mice with wild-type (WT) littermates. Twelve-week-old male Delta F508
   mutants had lower body weight, improved oral glucose tolerance, and a
   trend toward higher insulin tolerance. Glucose-induced insulin secretion
   was slightly diminished in Delta F508 mutant islets, due to reduced
   insulin content, but Delta F508 mutant islets were not more sensitive to
   proinflammatory cytokines than WT islets. Hyperglycemic clamps confirmed
   an increase in insulin sensitivity with normal beta-cell function in 12-
   and 18week-old Delta F508 mutants. In contrast, 24-week-old Delta F508
   mutants exhibited insulin resistance and reduced beta-cell function.
   beta-Cell mass was unaffected at 11 weeks of age but was significantly
   lower in Delta F508 mutants versus controls at 24 weeks. This was not
   associated with gross pancreatic pathology. We conclude that the Delta
   F508 CFTR mutation does not lead to an intrinsic beta-cell secretory
   defect but is associated with insulin resistance and a beta-cell mass
   deficit in aging mutants.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Suicide is one of the leading causes of injury-related
   mortality in the United States and prior research has identified alcohol
   and other drug use as a major risk factor. In recent years, prescription
   drug misuse has become a serious public health issue; however, very
   little research examines the relationship between prescription drug
   misuse and suicide or suicidal ideation.
   Methods: Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the
   current research examines the relationship between prescription drug
   misuse and suicidal ideation among adults. Suicidal ideation was
   measured by asking respondents if they seriously thought about killing
   themselves in the past 12 months. Prescription drug misuse was defined
   as use without a prescription or solely for the feeling or experience
   caused by the drug in the past 12 months. Several multivariable logistic
   regression models were estimated.
   Results: Findings show that respondents who report prescription drug
   misuse in the past year, specifically pain relievers, are more likely to
   report that they had seriously though about killing themselves.
   Conclusions: The current research fills an important gap in the
   literature by examining the relationship between prescription drug
   misuse and suicidal ideation. Consistent with the extant literature,
   prescription drug misuse is significantly associated with suicidal
   ideation among adults. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Pig slurry (PS) recycling as fertilizer is commonly practiced as an
   option for minimizing livestock waste. Successive PS applications on the
   soil can lead to crop toxicity and environmental risk. Despite extensive
   investigation of macronutrient behavior, the fate of trace metals
   remains uncertain and only a few long-term field studies have been
   reported to date. This study was designed to assess the impact of
   11-year continuous PS spreading on Cu and Zn accumulation and
   fractionation in a Brazilian clayey Hapludox soil. Three different PS
   application rates -50, 100 and 200 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) - were monitored
   at six soil depths in comparison to a non-amended control soil. The
   modified Geological Survey of Canada sequential extraction protocol was
   applied. A statistically significant increase in Cu and Zn total
   concentration (assessed by the sum of fractions) was noted only within
   the 0-5 cm soil layer for the 50 and 100 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) (PS50 and
   PS100) treatments, and up to 10-15 cm for the 200 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)
   (PS200) treatment. The mass balance, determined for the 22 PS amendments
   over the period, confirmed the overall exogenous Cu and Zn accumulation
   within the surface layers. More than 70\% of the natural heavy metal
   content was originally in the residual fraction. However, this was the
   only fraction not influenced by the PS amendments. After PS input, the
   exogenous Cu was mainly detected in the fraction bound to organic matter
   (66.4\%) within the PS200 0-5 cm soil layer. Exogenous Zn was mainly
   distributed between the adsorbed fraction (36.7\%) and the organic
   matter fraction (32.0\%) within the PS200 0-5 cm layer. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Rynchops niger (Black Skimmer) is a colonial-nesting seabird that nests
   on open, sandy or gravel beaches. In densely populated Pinellas County,
   FL, Black Skimmer colonies often occur on municipal beaches where there
   is relatively little mammalian predation, but intense predation by
   Corvus ossifragus (Fish Crow) and Leucophaeus atricilla (Laughing Gull).
   In 2013, a previously successful Black Skimmer colony experienced high
   egg-loss due to Fish Crow predation. To determine if effigies would
   decrease egg depredation in the middle of the breeding season, we
   monitored the number of crow-foraging passes over the colony and number
   of eggs taken before and after we placed 6 crow effigies among the
   nests. During 36 hours of monitoring, we observed 83 foraging passes and
   28 eggs being taken by Fish Crows. Neither foraging passes nor eggs
   taken decreased after the placement of the effigies, and the Black
   Skimmers abandoned their nests. Future research should focus on other
   methods to limit nest predation after the onset of the breeding season.}},

Title = {{The Use of Simulation to Teach Suicide Risk Assessment to Health

   Demonstration with a Virtual Patient}},

Abstract = {{Objective There is increasing use of educational technologies in medical
   and surgical specialties. Described herein is the development and
   application of an interactive virtual patient (VP) to teach suicide risk
   assessment to health profession trainees. We studied the effect of the
   following: (1) an interaction with a bipolar VP who attempts suicide or
   (2) completion of a video-teaching module on interviewing a bipolar
   patient, on medical students' proficiency in assessing suicide risk in
   standardized patients. We hypothesized that students who interact with a
   bipolar VP will be at least as likely to assess suicide risk, as their
   peers who completed a video module.
   Methods In a randomized, controlled study, we compared the frequency
   with which second-year students at the Medical College of Georgia asked
   suicide risk and bipolar symptoms questions by VP/video group.
   Results We recruited 67 students. The VP group inquired more frequently
   than the video group in 4 of 5 suicide risk areas and 11 of 14 other
   bipolar symptomatology areas. There were minimal to small effect sizes
   in favor of the VP technology. The students preferred the video over the
   VP as an educational tool (p=0.007).
   Conclusions Our study provides proof of concept that both VP and video
   module approaches are feasible for teaching students to assess suicide
   risk, and we present evidence about the role of active learning to
   improve communication skills. Depending on the learning context,
   interviewing a VP or observation of a videotaped interview can enhance
   the students' suicide risk assessment proficiency in an interview with a
   standardized patient. An interactive VP is a plausible modality to
   deliver basic concepts of suicide risk assessment to medical students,
   can facilitate individual preferences by providing easy access and
   portability, and has potential generalizability to other aspects of
   psychiatric training.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we review the mental health consequences of children's
   exposure to community and war violence (ETV) in four African countries:
   South Africa, Sierra Leone, Gambia and Rwanda. A focus on Africa is
   particularly pressing because of children's high levels of community and
   war ETV in countries therein. Regions of Africa present important
   macro-contexts for understanding children's various types of violence
   exposure amidst war and economic disadvantage. Findings of the review
   across 20 quantitative studies from 2004 to 2015 indicate consistent
   associations between exposure to war and community violence and
   children's symptoms of Post-traumatic Stress disorder (PTSD),
   depression, and aggression. School climate and family support mitigate
   these ETV influences upon children: however, more research is needed on
   the buffering effects of such resources. The effects of war violence are
   mediated by perceived discrimination in communities post-conflict. We
   integrate findings across studies to synthesize knowledge on children's
   ETV in Africa around a model of its correlates, mediators, and
   moderators in relation to mental health. Emerging research points to
   avenues for prevention and future inquiry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impacts of acidified seawater (pCO(2)
   similar to 900 mu atm) and elevated water temperature (+3 A degrees C)
   on the early life history stages of Acropora spicifera from the
   subtropical Houtman Abrolhos Islands (28A degrees S) in Western
   Australia. Settlement rates were unaffected by high temperature (27 A
   degrees C, similar to 250 mu atm), high pCO(2) (24 A degrees C, similar
   to 900 mu atm), or a combination of both high temperature and high
   pCO(2) treatments (27 A degrees C, similar to 900 mu atm). There were
   also no significant differences in rates of post-settlement survival
   after 4 weeks of exposure between any of the treatments, with survival
   ranging from 60 to 70 \% regardless of treatment. Similarly,
   calcification, as determined by the skeletal weight of recruits, was
   unaffected by an increase in water temperature under both ambient and
   high pCO(2) conditions. In contrast, high pCO(2) significantly reduced
   early skeletal development, with mean skeletal weight in the high pCO(2)
   and combined treatments reduced by 60 and 48 \%, respectively, compared
   to control weights. Elevated temperature appeared to have a partially
   mitigative effect on calcification under high pCO(2); however, this
   effect was not significant. Our results show that rates of settlement,
   post-settlement survival, and calcification in subtropical corals are
   relatively resilient to increases in temperature. This is in marked
   contrast to the sensitivity to temperature reported for the majority of
   tropical larvae and recruits in the literature. The subtropical corals
   in this study appear able to withstand an increase in temperature of 3 A
   degrees C above ambient, indicating that they may have a wider thermal
   tolerance range and may not be adversely affected by initial increases
   in water temperature from subtropical 24 to 27 A degrees C. However, the
   reduction in skeletal weight with high pCO(2) indicates that early
   skeletal formation will be highly vulnerable to the changes in ocean
   pCO(2) expected to occur over the twenty-first century, with
   implications for their longer-term growth and resilience.}},

Abstract = {{While a number of efficient sequential pattern mining algorithms were
   developed over the years, they can still take a long time and produce a
   huge number of patterns, many of which are redundant. These properties
   are especially frustrating when the goal of pattern mining is to find
   patterns for use as features in classification problems. In this paper,
   we describe BIDE-Discriminative, a modification of BIDE that uses class
   information for direct mining of predictive sequential patterns. We then
   perform an extensive evaluation on nine real-life datasets of the
   different ways in which the basic BIDE-Discriminative can be used in
   real multi-class classification problems, including 1-versus-rest and
   model-based search tree approaches. The results of our experiments show
   that 1-versus-rest provides an efficient solution with good
   classification performance.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the behavioral effects of practice modes in
   simulated slot machine gambling. A sample of 128 participants
   predominantly aged 18-24 years were randomly allocated to 1 of 4
   pre-exposure conditions: control (no practice), standard 90 \% return to
   player, inflated return to player and inflated return with pop-up
   messages. Participants in all conditions engaged in monetary gambling
   using a realistic online simulation of a slot machine. As predicted, the
   results showed that those players exposed to inflated or `profit'
   demonstration modes placed significantly higher bets in the real-play
   mode as compared to the other groups. However, the groups did not differ
   in relation to how long they persisted in the real-play mode. Pop-up
   messages had no significant effect on monetary gambling behavior. The
   results of this study confirm that exposure to inflated practice or
   ``demo{''} modes lead to short-term increases in risk-taking. These
   findings highlight the need for careful regulation and monitoring of
   internet gambling sites, as well as further research on the potential
   risks of simulated gambling activities for vulnerable segments of the

Abstract = {{A new model for translational research and drug repositioning has
   recently been established based on three-way partnerships between public
   funders, the pharmaceutical industry and academic investigators. Through
   two pioneering initiatives - one involving the Medical Research Council
   in the United Kingdom and one involving the National Center for
   Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health in
   the United States - new investigations of highly characterized
   investigational compounds have been funded and are leading to the
   exploration of known mechanisms in new disease areas. This model has
   been extended beyond these first two initiatives. Here, we discuss the
   progress to date and the unique requirements and challenges for this

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Glioblastoma (GB) is the most aggressive type of primary brain tumor.
   Despite the progress in recent years regarding the diagnosis and
   treatment of GB, the recurrence rate remains high, due to the
   infiltrative and dispersive nature of the tumor, which typically results
   in poor patient prognosis. In the present study, 19 formalin-fixed,
   paraffin-embedded GB samples were selected from patients with GB tumors.
   The samples were classified into a short or long recurrence-free
   survival (RFS) group, based on the time of first recurrence of the
   disease in the patients. The 19 samples were molecularly characterized
   for mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene,
   amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene,
   presence of the EGFR variant III, and methylation of the promoter region
   of the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene. Then, the
   expression of 84 genes involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix
   interactions, and that of 84 microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with brain
   cancer, was profiled. In addition, a copy number variation analysis of
   23 genes reported to undergo frequent genomic alterations in human
   glioma was also performed. Differences in the expression levels of a
   number of genes were detected across the short and long RFS groups.
   Among these genes, 5 in particular were selected, and a 5-genes
   combination approach was developed, which was able to differentiate
   between patients with short and long RFS outcome. The high levels of
   sensitivity and precision displayed by this 5-genes combination
   approach, which were confirmed with a cross-validation method, provide a
   strong foundation for further validation of the involvement of the
   aforementioned genes in GB in a larger patient population. In
   conclusion, the present study has demonstrated how the expression
   pattern of miRNAs and mRNAs in patients with GB defines a particular
   molecular hallmark that may increase or reduce the aggressive behavior
   of GB tumors, thus influencing the survival rates of patients with GB,
   their response to therapy and their tendency to suffer a relapse.}},

Abstract = {{The social environment plays a major role in the control of growth in
   many crustaceans, but little is known on the mechanisms involved. Two-
   and three-year-old noble crayfish, Astacus astacus are strictly
   nocturnally active. In the present article, we studied social effects on
   the pattern of nocturnal activity, represented by the time which the
   animals spent outside shelters. For this purpose, the activity of groups
   of uniformly large (dominant') and uniformly small (subordinate')
   individuals were recorded at different densities both separately and in
   mixed set-ups. In crowded laboratory cultures, the presence of larger
   (dominant) conspecifics was found to reduce the time which smaller
   (subordinate) individuals spent outside shelters in search of food and
   feeding by about one-third. It is suggested that this asymmetric
   inhibitory effect is an element of the functional chain which ultimately
   results in an extremely wide variation in individual growth rates of
   communally reared A.astacus. The relevance of the findings to crayfish
   aquaculture is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have identified that, in the mid-1970s to early 1980s, a
   major shift occurred in the structure of the large-scale circulation in
   both hemispheres. This work employs the CSIRO Mk3L general circulation
   model in ensemble simulations with observed sea surface temperatures
   (SSTs) and historical time-evolving carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations
   to investigate the inter-decadal changes found observationally in the
   jet streams, temperature, Hadley circulation, mean sea level pressure
   and precipitation. First, the performance of the model in simulating
   these changes for the mean July climate fields of 1949-1968 and
   1975-1994, in comparison with the corresponding observations (NCEP/NCAR
   Reanalysis I and the Twentieth Century Reanalysis V2), is investigated.
   We find that the model is quite skilful in reproducing the broad
   features of the important inter-decadal changes that occurred in the
   mid-1970s. The model simulations and the NCEP/NCAR and twentieth century
   reanalyses agree in the eastern hemisphere; whereas in the western
   hemisphere the reanalyses show differences, and the simulations combine
   aspects of these two datasets. The role of the direct radiative forcing
   due to CO2 in driving the inter-decadal changes is also examined.
   Results indicate that, in comparison with the indirect effect of CO2
   carried by the changing SSTs, there is little additional impact of the
   direct radiative forcing due to CO2 on the changes in the latter period.
   However, our simulations with fixed CO2 concentration have shown clearly
   that the atmospheric simulations with historical time-evolving CO2
   concentrations are more skilful in reproducing the inter-decadal
   changes. The sensitivity of the ensemble results to employing the same
   or different time evolving sea ice boundary conditions in the ensemble
   members is also studied. The contributions of internal and external
   variability are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the impact of invasion by Chrysanthemoides monilifera
   ssp. monilifera (boneseed) on plant communities, sites that were invaded
   and uninvaded were surveyed across Tasmania, South Australia and
   Victoria, Australia. Above-ground cover abundance was estimated and
   samples of the seed bank from invaded and uninvaded sites in each state
   were collected and germinated in the glasshouse. We compared species
   richness and composition between invaded and uninvaded sites for both
   above-ground and below-ground samples. Across this broad geographic
   area, C. monilifera invaded sites had 25\% fewer species than uninvaded
   sites and twice as many exotic species. Most growth forms showed reduced
   richness in invaded sites. There were no differences in the composition
   of native species communities between invaded and uninvaded sites in
   most regions, except South Australia. The composition of the seed bank
   differed from the above-ground vegetation, but was similar within each
   state. Herbs and grasses were most abundant. The species composition of
   the seed bank was different in invaded sites only in Victoria,
   suggesting that invasion may negatively influence the capacity of the
   seed bank to restore vegetation in some areas. However, the underlying
   mechanisms for the observed patterns were not tested in this study. The
   capacity of all sites to regenerate effectively from the seed bank was
   limited and, in order to ensure the conservation of biodiversity into
   the future, monitoring of species richness at smaller scales,
   particularly those where management of C. monilifera has occurred, will
   be needed to ensure management can facilitate the establishment of
   missing species. This study suggests that C. monilifera impacts a range
   of functional groups and different species across its distribution and
   is therefore non-selective in how it influences changes in communities.}},

Abstract = {{Sex pheromones produced by females of Rhagoletis conversa Br,thes and
   Rhagoletis brncici Frias are deposited on the surface of fruits after
   the eggs are laid. These pheromones repel other females, preventing
   repeated oviposition on the same fruit. They also attract males, thus
   assisting mating. Observations were made on wild populations, and
   cross-species behavioral tests were performed on males. The pheromone
   released by females was significantly more attractive for males of the
   same species. The two species showed remarkable differences in mating
   behavior, in the duration of oviposition, and in the number of circuits
   made around the fruit after eggs were laid. A morphological analysis of
   flies collected from their respective host plants indicated great host
   fidelity and the reproductive isolation of the two species. Possibly,
   the specific male-arresting effect of this pheromone was important for
   the sympatric speciation and evolution of these sibling species.}},

Abstract = {{Recombinant allergens improve the diagnostic precision in Hymenoptera
   venom allergy (HVA), in particular in patients with double sensitization
   to both honey bee (HBV) and yellow jacket venom (YJV). While currently
   available vespid allergens allow the detection of >95\% of YJV-allergic
   patients, the sensitization frequency to the only available HBV marker
   allergen rApi m 1 in HBV-allergic patients is lower. Here, we
   demonstrate that sIgE to additional HBV marker allergens rApi m 3 and
   rApi m 10 allows the detection of genuine HBV sensitization in 46-65\%
   of Api m 1 negative sera. This is of particular relevance in patients
   with double sensitization to HBV and YJV that did not identify the
   culprit insect. Addition of sIgE to rApi m 3 and rApi m 10 provides
   evidence of HBV sensitization in a large proportion of rApi m 1-negative
   patients and thus provides a diagnostic marker and rationale for VIT
   treatment with HBV, which otherwise would have been missing.}},

Abstract = {{Host protection upon vaccination usually results from the complex
   interplay of humoral and cellular components of the immune system.
   Exploring hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-specific T cell responses
   and their correlation with humoral responses under immunosuppression, we
   analyzed 51 renal transplant recipients, differing in HBV
   vaccine-specific antibody titers (non {[}NRs]-, low {[}LRs]-, and high
   responders {[}HRs]) and in 22 healthy controls (HCs) in a
   cross-sectional study. HBsAg-specific T cells were analyzed by flow
   cytometry according to expression of activation markers CD40L and/or
   CD69, and the cytokines IFN gamma, IL-2, TNF alpha, and IL-17. No
   significant differences in responder rate and magnitude of
   HBsAg-specific T cell responses were found between HCs and HRs.
   Interestingly, HBsAg-specific Th-cells were also observed in 50\% of
   humoral NRs. Frequencies of HBsAg-specific CD40L+ Th-cells were
   significantly higher in HRs compared to LRs (p=0.009) and in LRs in
   comparison to NRs (p=0.043). All but NRs showed a predominance of
   multi-potent HBsAg-specific TNF alpha+IL-2+ Th-cells. As expected,
   HBsAg-specific CD8(+) T cells were rarely found. In conclusion, mounting
   of hepatitis B vaccine-specific T cell responses is possible in kidney
   transplant recipients despite immunosuppression. Detection of
   HBV-specific Th-cells in a significant proportion of humoral NRs
   contributes to the current discussion on conferring immune protection by
   cellular memory in such patients.}},

Abstract = {{The United Kingdom Climate Impacts Programme's UKCP09 project makes
   high-resolution projections of the climate out to 2100 by
   post-processing the outputs of a large-scale global climate model. The
   aim of this paper is to describe and analyse the methodology used and
   then urge some caution. Given the acknowledged systematic, shared errors
   of all current climate models, treating model outputs as
   decision-relevant projections can be significantly misleading. In
   extrapolatory situations, such as projections of future climate change,
   there is little reason to expect that post-processing of model outputs
   can correct for the consequences of such errors. This casts doubt on our
   ability, today, to make trustworthy probabilistic projections at high
   resolution out to the end of the century.}},

Abstract = {{The large Storegga slide, which occurred on the Norwegian Atlantic shelf
   similar to 8150 yr ago, triggered a tsunami that has been identified in
   sediment deposits along the coasts of Greenland, Norway, the Faroe
   Islands, the Shetland Islands, Scotland, and the northernmost coasts of
   England, but hitherto not along the southeastern shores of the North
   Sea. It has generally been assumed that the shallow continental shelf of
   the North Sea attenuated and dissipated the energy of the tsunami before
   it reached those coastlines. We used radiocarbon and optically
   stimulated luminescence dating as well as stratigraphic, lithologic,
   chemical, and palynological analyses of sediment cores to identify
   tsunami deposits on the barrier island of Romo located on the
   southwestern North Sea coast of Denmark. We show that tsunami sediments
   were deposited in a freshwater paleolake that is located similar to 16 m
   below present-day mean sea level. The tsunami sediment run-up was
   between 1.5 m and 5.5 m above the contemporaneous sea level. Our results
   demonstrate that the Storegga slide tsunami propagated across the wide
   (>500 km) and relatively shallow (depth <95 m) continental shelf of the
   North Sea and resulted in run-up along adjacent coastlines. In
   contradiction to earlier theoretical studies, the coastline of the
   southeastern North Sea cannot be regarded as being sheltered from
   impacts of North Atlantic tsunami incidents.}},

   Design: Randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: Nursing home for older adults.
   Participants: Adults aged 65 years and older (N=60).
   Interventions: Participants who lived in a nursing home had 6 weeks of
   balance training with either Wii Fit equipment or conventional exercise.
   Main Outcome Measures: Physiological Profile Assessment scores and
   incidence of falls were observed with subsequent intention-to-treat
   statistical analyses.
   Results: Physiological Profile Assessment scores and incidence of falls
   improved significantly in both groups after the intervention (all
   P<.01), but participants in the Wii Fit training group showed a
   significantly greater improvement in both outcome measures (P=.004 and
   P<.001, respectively).
   Conclusions: In institutionalized older adults with a history of falls,
   Wii Fit balance training was more effective than conventional balance
   training in reducing the risk and incidence of falls. (C) 2015 by the

Abstract = {{Delay of the diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV), and its treatment to
   avert cirrhosis, is often present sincethe early stage of HCV
   progression is latent. Current methods to determine the incubation time
   to HCV-related cirrhosis and the duration time from cirrhosis to
   subsequent events (e.g. complications or death) used to be based on the
   time of liver biopsy diagnosis and ignore this delay which led to an
   interval censoring for the first event time and a double censoring for
   the subsequent event time. To investigate the impact of this delay in
   estimating HCV progression rates and relevant estimating bias, we
   present a correlated two-stage progression model for delayed diagnosis
   time and fit the developed model to the previously studied hepatitis C
   cohort data from Edinburgh. Our analysis shows that taking the delayed
   diagnosis into account gives a mildly different estimate of progression
   rate to cirrhosis and significantly lower estimated progression rate to
   HCV-related death in comparison with conventional modelling. We also
   find that when the delay increases, the bias in estimating progression
   increases significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Soil moisture is a critical state affecting a variety of land surface
   and subsurface processes. We report investigation results of the factors
   controlling vertical variation of soil moisture and sand transport rate
   of three types of dunes on the southeastern margin of the Mu Us Sandy
   Land. Samples were taken from holes drilled to a depth of 4 m at
   different topographic sites on the dunes, and were analyzed for soil
   moisture, grain-size distribution and surface sediment discharge. The
   results show that: (1) The average soil moisture varies in different
   types of dunes, with the following sequences ordered from highest to
   lowest: in the shrubs-covered dunes and the trees-covered dunes the
   sequence is from inter-dunes lowland to windward slope to leeward slope.
   The average moisture in the bare-migratory sand dunes is sequenced from
   inter-dunes lowland to leeward slope to windward slope. (2) Vegetation
   form and surface coverage affect the range of soil moisture of different
   types of dunes in the same topographic position. The coefficient of
   variation of soil moisture for shrubs-covered dunes is higher than that
   of other types of dune. (3) The effect of shrubs on dune soil moisture
   is explained in terms of the greater ability of shrubs to trap
   fine-grained atmospheric dust and hold moisture. (4) The estimated sand
   transport rates over sand dunes with sparse shrubs are less than those
   over bare-migratory dunes or sand dunes with sparse trees, indicating
   that shrubs are more effective in inhibiting wind erosion in the sandy
   land area.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in establishing the relationship between the
   count data y and numerous covariates x through a generalized linear
   model (GLM), such as explaining the road crash counts from the geometry
   and environmental factors. This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian
   method to deal with the negative binomial GLM. The Negative Binomial
   distribution is preferred for modeling nonnegative overdispersed data.
   The Bayesian inference is chosen to account for prior expert knowledge
   on regression coefficients in a small sample size setting and the
   hierarchical structure allows to consider the dependence among the
   subsets. A Metropolis-Hastings-within-Gibbs algorithm is used to compute
   the posterior distribution of the parameters of interest through a data
   augmentation process. The Bayesian approach highly over-performs the
   classical maximum likelihood estimation in terms of goodness of fit,
   especially when the sample size decreases and the model complexity
   increases. Their respective performances have been examined in both the
   simulated and real-life case studies.}},

Abstract = {{Memory forensics is an important technique for protecting network
   security and fighting against computer crimes. It has developed greatly
   in the past decade, because memory can provide more reliable information
   that other evidence sources do not contain. However, nowadays, when
   investigating network criminal cases, the Gigabyte (GB) and even
   Terabyte (TB) level memory and many such dumps have made memory analysis
   a difficult task. And investigators usually have to deal with complex
   operating system (OS) data structures, which they have little knowledge
   of. So how to analyze memory evidence automatically so as to find the
   hidden criminal behavior and reconstruct the scenario in an
   understandable way has become an important problem. This paper presents
   an automatic memory analysis methodology based on data correlation.
   Through analyzing key OS data structures and utilizing a clustering
   algorithm, this methodology can discover the relationships among
   processes, files, users, Dynamic-link library (DLLs), and network
   connections. By describing these relationships as correlation graphs,
   our methods can reorganize these independent memory evidences and
   disclose their meanings in a high semantic level. Experiments have
   proved that these correlation graphs can help investigators find hidden
   criminal behavior and reconstruct the criminal scenarios. And as we
   know, now, little work is in this field. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Treatment results of Wilms tumors have been impressively improved over
   the past 50 years resulting in a stage-independent overall survival of
   greater than 90 \%. However, unsatisfying treatment results still remain
   in children with high-risk tumors and tumor relapses.
   This review highlights the current concepts of Wilms tumor surgery as a
   cornerstone of the treatment strategy for this malignancy. A selective
   literature review focusing on the past 5 years served as the basis for
   this article.
   Nephron-sparing surgery is associated with an analogue outcome compared
   to tumor nephrectomy in unilateral Wilms tumors. The surgical panel of
   the International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) group has
   recently introduced a novel nomenclature for organ-preserving resection
   procedures in order to facilitate a prospective comparison of data. The
   minimally invasive approach represents an alternative technique with
   adequate outcome. In bilateral disease, nephron-sparing procedures are
   gold standard. Complete resection of lung and liver metastases has a
   significant impact on patients' survival.
   Surgical guidelines for nephron-sparing surgery and minimally invasive
   tumor nephrectomy need to be established and implemented within newly
   formulated treatment protocols of the different national and
   international treatment trials. Risk stratification of patients needs to
   be more individualized with the aim of reducing late effects while at
   least maintaining the same survival rates. The unsatisfying treatment
   results of tumor relapses-associated with low patient numbers within the
   different trials-emphasize the need for international collaboration.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundWe reviewed the current literature pertaining to extended
   endoscopic endonasal approaches to the craniovertebral junction.
   MethodsA systematic literature review was utilized to identify published
   surgical cases of endoscopic endonasal approaches to the craniovertebral
   junction. Full-text manuscripts were examined for various measures of
   surgical indications, patient characteristics, operative technique, and
   surgical outcomes.
   ResultsWe identified 71 cases involving endoscopic endonasal approaches
   for surgical management of a variety of pathologies located within the
   craniovertebral junction. Patient ages ranged from 3 to 87 years, with
   40 females and 31 males. Five patients required tracheostomy, two were
   reintubated, and all others experienced an average intubation duration
   of 0.54 days following surgery. Fifty-eight patients (81.7\%) underwent
   an additional posterior decompression or fusion either before or after
   the endonasal procedure. A complete resection of the pathologic lesion
   was reported in 57 cases (83.8\%), another five were successful
   biopsies, and four resulted in partial resection. The follow-up time
   ranged from 0.5 to 57 months.
   ConclusionAlthough the transoral approach has been the standard for
   anterior surgical management for the past several decades, our
   systematic review illustrates that the extended endoscopic endonasal
   approach is a safe and effective alternative for most pathologies
   affecting the craniovertebral junction.}},

Abstract = {{With the ascent of modern epidemiology in the Twentieth Century came a
   new standard model of prediction in public health and clinical medicine.
   In this article, we describe the structure of the model. The standard
   model uses epidemiological measures-most commonly, risk measures-to
   predict outcomes (prognosis) and effect sizes (treatment) in a patient
   population that can then be transformed into probabilities for
   individual patients. In the first step, a risk measure in a study
   population is generalized or extrapolated to a target population. In the
   second step, the risk measure is particularized or transformed to yield
   probabilistic information relevant to a patient from the target
   population. Hence, we call the approach the Risk
   Generalization-Particularization (Risk GP) Model. There are serious
   problems at both stages, especially with the extent to which the
   required assumptions will hold and the extent to which we have evidence
   for the assumptions. Given that there are other models of prediction
   that use different assumptions, we should not inflexibly commit
   ourselves to one standard model. Instead, model pluralism should be
   standard in medical prediction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The outcomes of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatitis after liver
   transplantation (LT) without hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) is not
   well documented. This study aims to determine the outcomes of chronic
   hepatitis B (CHB) patients using an HBIG-free regimen. All biopsies
   performed 3 months or more after LT in consecutive CHB patients
   transplanted from 2003 to 2012 were reviewed. None of the patients
   received HBIG. Results of all liver histologies were reviewed to
   determine the cause of graft dysfunction. Of the 435 patients
   transplanted during this period, 263 liver biopsies were performed in
   144 patients. Thirty-six patients were positive for hepatitis B surface
   antigen (HBsAg) with undetectable HBV DNA at the time of biopsy, and
   none had histological evidence of HBV infection. Of the 263 biopsies, 44
   (17\%) had evidence of fibrosis. There was a significantly higher rate
   of fibrosis in those with large duct obstruction compared to those
   without (51\% versus 9\%, respectively; P<0.001). Of the 291 patients
   without a liver biopsy during the same period, 43 were HBsAg+. Seven
   patients had evidence of virological rebound, of whom 6 had evidence of
   rtM204V/I mutation and 1 had recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma with
   low-level rebound and wild-type virus. In conclusion, for patients
   without virological rebound, positive serum HBsAg was not associated
   with histological evidence of HBV-related hepatitis after LT. To prevent
   virological rebound, nucleos(t)ide analogues with higher barriers to
   resistance should be used. (C) 2015 AASLD.}},

Abstract = {{We study the spin-lattice relaxation of the nuclear spins in a liquid or
   a gas entrapped in nanosized ellipsoidal cavities with paramagnetic
   impurities. Two cases are considered where the major axes of cavities
   are in orientational order and isotropically disordered. The evolution
   equation and analytical expression for spin lattice relaxation time are
   obtained which give the dependence of the relaxation time on the
   structural parameters of a nanocavity and the characteristics of a gas
   or a liquid confined in nanocavities. For the case of orientationally
   ordered cavities, the relaxation process is exponential. When the
   nanocavities are isotropically disordered, the time dependence of the
   magnetization is significantly non-exponential. As shown for this case,
   the relaxation process is characterized by two time constants. The
   measurements of the relaxation time, along with the information about
   the cavity size, allow determining the shape and orientation of the
   nanocavity and concentration of the paramagnetic impurities. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Focal temporal lobe seizures often cause impaired cortical function and
   loss of consciousness. Recent work suggests that the mechanism for
   depressed cortical function during focal seizures may depend on
   decreased subcortical cholinergic arousal, which leads to a sleep-like
   state of cortical slow-wave activity. To test this hypothesis, we sought
   to directly activate subcortical cholinergic neurons during focal limbic
   seizures to determine the effects on cortical function. Here we used an
   optogenetic approach to selectively stimulate cholinergic brainstem
   neurons in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus during focal limbic
   seizures induced in a lightly anesthetized rat model. We found an
   increase in cortical gamma activity and a decrease in delta activity in
   response to cholinergic stimulation. These findings support the
   mechanistic role of reduced subcortical cholinergic arousal in causing
   cortical dysfunction during seizures. Through further work, electrical
   or optogenetic stimulation of subcortical arousal networks may
   ultimately lead to new treatments aimed at preventing cortical
   dysfunction during seizures.}},

Abstract = {{Sketch-Based 3D Object Retrieval (SB3DOR) algorithms retrieve 3D models
   similar to hand-drawn sketch queries. It is one of the most effective
   modalities to query 3D models by their shape. However, comparison of a
   sketch, which is a 2D image, with a 3D model is not straightforward.
   Most of the SB3DOR algorithms compare a sketch image with images of 3D
   models rendered from multiple viewpoints. However, retrieval accuracies
   of state-of-the-art SB3DOR algorithms are still not satisfactory, due,
   in part, to stylistic variation, semantic influence, abstraction, and
   drawing error found in sketches. To improve retrieval accuracy of SB3DOR
   systems, we propose a manifold-based similarity metric learning
   algorithm that relates two kinds of features, that are, of sketches and
   3D models. Features in a high dimensional space often lie on a lower
   dimensional subspace, or manifold. Feature similarity may be computed
   more accurately on the manifold than in the original high dimensional
   space. Our Cross-Domain Manifold Ranking (CDMR) algorithm tries to keep
   the two distinct feature manifolds, one for sketch features and the
   other for 3D model features, intact. These two manifolds are interlinked
   by using inter-feature similarity to form a Cross-Domain Manifold (CDM).
   If available, semantic labels may also be used in forming the CDM.
   Relevance diffusion is used to compute similarities between a sketch and
   3D models in a database. Experimental evaluation showed that the CDMR
   algorithm produces higher retrieval accuracy than the algorithms we
   compared against.}},

Abstract = {{Zwitterionic polysaccharides (ZPS) behave like traditional T
   cell-dependent antigens, suggesting the design of new classes of

   synthesis and antigenic evaluation of di-/tri-saccharide fragments of
   Salmonella typhi Vi polysaccharide, as well as of their corresponding
   zwitterionic analogues. Our strategy is based on versatile intermediates
   enabling chain elongation either by iterative single monomer attachment
   or by faster and more flexible approach using disaccharide donors.
   The effect of structural modifications of the synthetic compounds on
   antigenic properties was evaluated by competitive ELISA. All the
   oligosaccharides were recognized by specific anti-Vi polyclonal
   antibodies in a concentration-dependent manner, and the introduction of
   a zwitterionic motif into the synthetic molecules did not prevent the

Abstract = {{The current investigation examines whether the model anti-androgenic
   substance flutamide is capable of disrupting endocrine homeostasis at
   very low doses. The data generated clarify whether a non-monotonic
   dose-response relationship exists to enhance the current debate about
   the regulation of endocrine disruptors. Moreover, it is part of a series
   of investigations assessing the dose-response relationship of single and
   combined administration of anti-androgenic substances. A pre-postnatal
   in vivo study design was chosen, which was compliant with regulatory
   testing protocols. The test design was improved by additional endpoints
   addressing hormone levels, morphology, and histopathological
   examinations. Doses were chosen to represent a clear effect level (2.5
   mg/kg bw/d), a low endocrine effect level (LOAEL, 0.25 mg/kg bw/d), a
   NOAEL for endocrine effects (0.025 mg/kg bw/d), a further dose at 0.0025
   mg/kg bw/d flutamide, as well as an ``ADI{''} (0.00025 mg/kg bw/d or
   100-fold below the NOAEL) for the detection of a possible non-monotonic
   dose-response curve. Anti-androgenic changes were observable at LOAEL
   and the clear effect dose level but not at lower exposures. Nipple
   retention appeared to be the most sensitive measure of anti-androgenic
   effects, followed by age at sexual maturation, anogenital
   distance/anogenital index and male sex organ weights, as well as gross
   and histopathological findings. The results of all five doses indicate
   the absence of evidence for effects at very low dose levels. A
   non-monotonic dose-response relationship was not evident for the
   anti-androgenic drug flutamide.}},

   identification}},
Journal = {{CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{86-97}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the non-linear behavior of an ultracapacitor in
   relation to the operating voltage. The ultracapacitor impedance
   identification is then performed using a fractional continuous LPV model
   according to a local approach composed of two steps. First, the local
   LTI fractional impedance model is identified in the time domain at
   various bias voltages thanks to an output-error technique assuming a
   linear fractional impedance model issued from the physical description
   of the porous nature of the electrodes. Therefore, the excitation
   current is designed so as to induce low level voltage variation,
   compared with the considered operating voltage. Secondly, the model
   parameter dependence with respect to the operating voltage is obtained
   by using a cubic spline interpolation technique. The resulting LPV
   fractional model allows to synthesize a set of LTI models able to build
   low level voltage variation around different initial bias voltage.
   Furthermore, when using charging or discharging current sequence
   generating high level voltage, the LPV model allows to take into account
   the non-linear effects due to the fractional model parameters voltage
   dependence. The fractional LPV model is validated on an experimental
   ultracapacitor test bed and its advantages compared with the fractional
   LTI model is evidenced. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall simulators have been used in research for more than 40 years.
   Unfortunately, there is not much literature on their construction and
   calibration. This paper presents a rainfall simulator experimental rig,

   calibration, i.e. determination of rainfall distribution over the
   surface. The simulator uses six VeeJet 80100 oscillating nozzles equally
   spaced with 100 cm distance along a horizontal pipe. A box for rainfall
   intensity reduction is placed under each nozzle. The maximum rainfall
   intensity that can be achieved is 3,1 mm/min and maximum surface covered
   by the simulator is 1x6 m(2). As a measure of uniformity of rainfall
   distribution over the surface, the Christiansen's uniformity coefficient
   was used. For surface widths ranging from 0,1 to 1 m, the Christiansen's
   coefficient varies from 0,8 to 0,9 for the oscillating nozzles, while
   for the non-oscillating nozzle it has a value of 0,46.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Variceal hemorrhage (VH) is a major complication of chronic
   liver disease. Several factors have been validated for the prediction of
   the outcome of an acute VH. The clinical risk characteristics reported
   in developed countries may be different from developing countries.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the predictors of mortality
   in patients admitted to our hospital with acute upper gastrointestinal
   (UGI) hemorrhage who underwent endoscopy and confirmed to have VH.
   Patients and methods: This was a cross sectional hospital based study
   performed over a seven-year period between January 2006 and January
   2013.
   Results: A total of 224 patients were analyzed. Nineteen patients (8\%)
   died within the first two weeks of their hospital admission. Eighteen
   variables were studied and included in a multivariate analysis using a
   logistic regression model. Five variables were predictors of death.
   Hemodynamic instability at admission (AOR=5.5, 95\% CI=22.3 + 1.4,
   P=0.017), Child class C (AOR=5.9, 95\% CI=24 + 1.5, P=0.013), blood in
   upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract at the index endoscopy (AOR = 12.8,
   95\% CI=126.5 + 1.3, P = 0.03), rebleeding within five days of endoscopy
   (AOR = 25.4, 95\% CI = 109.2 + 5.9, P = 0.000), and in-hospital
   complications (AOR = 23.4, 95\% CI = 122.5 + 4.5, P = 0.000) were
   independent predictors of mortality after the acute VH episode.
   Conclusion: Patients with acute VH and hemodynamic instability at
   admission, Child class C, blood in UGI tract at the index endoscopy,
   rebleeding within five days of endoscopy and in-hospital complications
   are at an increased risk of mortality after the acute VH episode.
   Rebleeding within five days of endoscopy and in-hospital complications
   are the most significant independent predictors of mortality. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Introduction. Among the skeletal causes of limited mouth opening, uni-
   or bilateral coronoid process hypertrophy, or Langenbeck disease, is the
   most frequent. It can be associated with an osteochondroma or a
   coronoid-malar bone conflict and is then called Jacob disease, an
   unilateral pathology. Treatment rests on coronoidectomy in both cases.
   This technique is illustrated via two cases, one Langenbeck and one
   Jacob disease.
   Technical note. A transoral approach was performed. After subperiosteal
   dissection, the coronoid process was cleared. The process was than
   severed at its base by means of a burr, freed from its temporal muscular
   fibers and removed. Mouth opening improved peroperatively. The surgical
   procedure was completed by active long-term physiotherapy beginning
   immediately after surgery.
   Discussion. Transoral coronoidectomy is a simple, quick and safe
   procedure. Extra-oral approaches present a high risk of facial nerve
   injury. In our first case, mouth opening improved from 24 to 36 mm after
   bilateral coronoidectomy and to 40 mm after physiotherapy. In our second
   case, mouth opening improved from 22 to 38 mm after unilateral
   coronoidectomy and to 43 mm after one year physiotherapy. Long-term
   post-operative physiotherapy is mandatory to get and maintain good
   results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil contamination in recreational areas can considerably affect
   children's health, as they are the segment of the population most
   sensitive to anthropogenic contamination. Soil contamination in
   recreational areas is influenced by a number of factors such as type and
   age of the recreational area, nearby traffic intensity, proximity to
   industrial areas, presence of vegetation, level of usage, treated wood
   structures, and the extent of maintenance operations carried out in the
   area. These can most often be observed during a simple site visit. The
   purpose of the present research is to analyze to which extent the
   presence of these factors can trigger an alarm signal, highlighting soil
   contamination in urban recreational areas. In this regard, soil
   contamination was scaled using the integrated pollution index applied on
   nine distinctive contaminants (As, Cu, Cd, Zn, Pb, Hg, Co, Ni, Mg)
   identified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
   Multiple linear regression analysis was performed in order to assess
   predictors of soil contamination. The research was carried out in a
   number of 88 recreational areas, parks, and playgrounds from 19 Romanian
   cities, revealing the fact that proximity to industrial areas and
   intensive traffic had statistically significant effects on soil
   contamination. Furthermore, it was observed that in 78 out of the 88
   analyzed locations, the concentrations of contaminants exceeded the
   guidelines established through national legislation, thus confirming the
   presumption that high concentrations of contaminants exist in the parks
   and playgrounds of Romania.}},

Abstract = {{An unprecedented array of observing systems, coupled with ever
   increasing computing capacity, makes this a golden era for ecologists to
   study and quantify ecosystem services using remote sensing technology.
   Here, we review recent studies that utilize remote sensing to understand
   the supply and demand of ecosystem services, with a specific focus on
   pollination services by bees in forested and agroforestry contexts.
   Pollination by bees is a globally threatened ecosystem service that
   supports the production of food crops and maintains plant biodiversity.
   We explore how studies that use remote sensing to characterize
   landscapes, monitor individual organisms, measure biodiversity proxies
   or species habitat, and describe ecosystem processes may improve
   modeling of pollination services on spatial scales that match
   large-scale management efforts, such as forest conservation policy. We
   then discuss future research opportunities, such as exploring LiDAR and
   radar for 3-D habitat measurements, mapping phenology in space and time,
   and direct measurement of pollination events and outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Mate preference for conspecifics does not necessarily lead to
   assortative mating in cases where mating outcomes also depend on
   preferences based on mate quality and on individual competitiveness. We
   tested how such traits affected mate choice among genetically divergent
   lineages (called molecular operational taxonomic units; MOTU) of the
   amphipod Gammarus fossarum. We presented males with two females,
   including one from its own MOTU. Females also potentially differed in
   body size, and therefore fecundity, and in time before reproduction, two
   traits previously recognized as important in male mate choice. Males
   generally preferred females from their own MOTU when females originated
   from highly divergent MOTUs (17 \% genetic divergence), but not when
   they were more closely related (3.5 \% genetic divergence). Contrary to
   expectations, they did not prefer larger females, but they consistently
   paired with the female closest to reproduction. A second experiment
   involving duos of males of different MOTUs in competition for a female
   also revealed that males consistently won the competition over pairing
   with females of their own MOTU. Overall, these results reveal a strong
   influence of genetic divergence on mate recognition and reproductive
   isolation between sympatric MOTUs. However, male preference for females
   that are close to being available for reproduction also potentially
   results in hybridization among closely related MOTUs. We examine these
   results in the light of field mating patterns observed in a previous
   study of G. fossarum and discuss the importance of considering
   competitiveness and preferences for mate quality signals when studying
   evolutionary consequences of secondary contact between divergent
   lineages.}},

Abstract = {{Human milk (HM) provides all nutrients to support an optimal growth and
   development of the neonate. The composition and structure of HM lipids,
   the most important energy provider, have an impact on the digestion,
   uptake and metabolism of lipids. In HM, the lipids are present in the
   form of dispersed fat globules: large fat droplets enveloped by a
   phospholipid membrane. Currently, infant milk formula (Control IMF)
   contains small fat droplets primarily coated by proteins. Recently, a
   novel IMF concept (Concept IMF) was developed with a different lipid
   architecture, Nuturis (R), comprising large fat droplets with a
   phospholipid coating. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), with
   appropriate fluorescent probes, and transmission electron microscopy
   were used to determine and compare the interfacial composition and
   structure of HM fat globules, Concept IMF fat droplets and Control IMF
   fat droplets. The presence of a trilayer-structured HM fat globule
   membrane, composed of phospholipids, proteins, glycoproteins and
   cholesterol, was confirmed; in addition exosome-like vesicles are
   observed within cytoplasmic crescents. The Control IMF fat droplets had
   a thick protein-only interface. The Concept IMF fat droplets showed a
   very thin interface composed of a mixture of phospholipids, proteins and
   cholesterol. Furthermore, the Concept IMF contained fragments of milk
   fat globule membrane, which has been suggested to have potential
   biological functions in infants. By mimicking more closely the structure
   and composition of HM fat globules, this novel IMF concept with Nuturis
   (R) may have metabolic and digestive properties that are more similar to
   HM compared to Control IMF. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier
